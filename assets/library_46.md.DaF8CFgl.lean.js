On the second day, James visited twice as many houses, which is 2 * 20 = 40 houses. However, he only sold to 80% of these houses, which means he sold items to 0.8 * 40 = 32 houses. If he sold the same number of items at each house on the second day as he did on the first day, then he sold 32x items on the second day. The total number of items James sold over the two days is the sum of the items sold on the first day and the second day, which is 20x + 32x = 52x. We are told that James sold 104 items in total over the two days. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 52x = 104 To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 52: x = 104 / 52 x = 2 So, James sold boxed{2}  items at each house."},{"instruction":"Two circles are centered at the origin.

(Reference data: lg 2approx 0.3)","output":"To solve the problem, we start by understanding that the probability of person A hitting the target at least once in n throws is the complement of the probability of missing the target in all n throws. The probability of hitting the target is 0.6, so the probability of missing the target is 1 - 0.6 = 0.4.  Given that we want the probability of hitting the target at least once to exceed 90%, we can set up the inequality as follows: [ 1 - (1 - 0.6)^n > 0.9 ] This simplifies to: [ 1 - 0.4^n > 0.9 ] Subtracting 1 from both sides and multiplying by -1 to reverse the inequality gives: [ 0.4^n < 0.1 ] To find the minimum number of throws n, we take the logarithm of both sides. Using the property of logarithms, we get: [ n cdot lg 0.4 < lg 0.1 ] Given that lg 2 approx 0.3, we can express lg 0.4 and lg 0.1 in terms of lg 2. The inequality becomes: [ n > frac{lg 0.1}{lg 0.4} ] Substituting the approximate value of lg 2 into the equation gives us: [ n > frac{1}{1 - 2lg 2} approx 2.5 ] Since n must be an integer (you can't throw a dart a fractional number of times), the smallest integer greater than 2.5 is 3.

Specifically, the first person says that every first person in the room is a liar, the second person says that every second person in the room is a liar, and so on until the ( n )-th person who says that every ( n )-th person in the room is a liar. 2. **Logic Deduction:**    - We need to find out how many people could possibly be in the room given the nature of the statements.    - If the first person were telling the truth, every person would be a liar, which is a contradiction because the first person, being a knight, is truthful.    - Therefore, the first person must be lying, meaning at least the first person is a liar.    - This reasoning can be extended to the second, third, ..., up to the ( n )-th person. If all of them were liars, then their statements would be false.  3. **Finding a Valid Configuration:**    - We need to have at least one knight in the room to maintain consistency; otherwise, it would result in everyone being liar and no knight (truth-teller), creating an inconsistency.    - Let's hypothesize that there are only two people in the room, where:      - The first person says every first person is a liar.      - The second person says every second person is a liar. 4. **Testing the Hypothesis:**    - If there are exactly two people:      - Let Person 1 be a liar and Person 2 be a knight.      - Person 1 (liar) says: \\"Every first person in the room is a liar.\\" This statement is false, aligning with Person 1 being a liar.      - Person 2 (knight) says: \\"Every second person in the room is a liar.\\" This statement is true, as Person 2 is the only second person.        - This configuration allows a valid and consistent setup with one knight and one liar. As per the context of their statements and roles, it fits without contradiction. 5. **Conclusion:**    Given the logical consistency and validation, we deduce that the possible number of people in the room is correctly determined.

(1) The formula for compound interest (CI) for one year is: CI = P * (1 + r)^t - P Given that the compound interest is 440, we can write: 440 = P * (1 + 0.20)^t - P => 440 = P * (1.20)^t - P => 440 + P = P * (1.20)^t => P * (1.20)^t = 440 + P ...

Then ( A_i ) knows both ( b ) and ( c ).    - This implies that we can form new pairs ( A'_i b ) and ( A_i c ), contradicting the maximality of ( k ). 8. **Conclude that ( B cap C = emptyset ):**    - Since ( B cap C = emptyset ), we have ( |B cup C| = 40 ).    - This implies that ( k = 20 ) and ( B cup C = P ). 9. **Form new pairs:**    - Let ( b' in B ) and ( c' in C ) be a pair in the maximum matching.    - We can form new pairs ( b b' ) and ( c c' ), contradicting the assumption that ( k = 20 ). 10. **Conclude the proof:**     - Since both cases lead to contradictions, the only possibility is that ( k = 21 ).     - Therefore, we can divide the students into 21 groups of 2 students each, where each group consists of students who know each other.

We consider a coordinate plane where both x and y range from 0 to 60 (representing the minutes from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM). Each point (x, y) on this plane represents a possible arrival time of Alice and Carla. For each person, the stay at the cafe covers 20 minutes after their arrival time. The condition for Alice and Carla to see each other is if the intervals [x, x+20] and [y, y+20] overlap. The overlap occurs if |x-y| leq 20 minutes. We calculate the area of overlap: 1. The entire square represents the total possible time combination (60 times 60). 2. The non-overlapping areas are two triangles each defined by points (0, 20), (0, 60), (40, 60) and (20, 0), (60, 0), (60, 40). 3. The area of each triangle is frac{1}{2} times (60-20) times (60-20) = frac{1}{2} times 40 times 40 = 800. Thus, the total non-overlapping area is 1600. 4.

Consider the following parts: 1. We first identify for which integer ( n ), all numbers between ( n ) and ( 2n ) have complexity not greater than that of ( n ). 2. We then determine if there are ( n ) for which all numbers between ( n ) and ( 2n ) have complexity less than that of ( n ). **Part (a): ( n = 2^k )** 1. Clearly, if ( n ) is a power of 2, i.e., ( n = 2^k ), then it has the complexity ( k ) because it is the product of ( k ) twos. 2. All numbers in the range between ( 2^k ) and ( 2^{k+1} ) can be considered. We need to show that the complexity of these numbers does not exceed ( k ). 3. For numbers of the form ( 2^a cdot b ) (where ( b ) is an odd integer and ( 1 leq a leq k )), the complexity is:    - ( a ) from the factors of 2,    - The complexity of ( b ) is not greater than ( k ). Hence, the total complexity will not exceed ( k ). **Part (b):** 1. If ( n ) is not a power of 2, then we can assert that there is at least one power of 2 between ( n ) and ( 2n ). Consider the highest power of 2 in that range. 2. The complexity of this power of 2 is the exponent corresponding to the power of 2, incremented by one (since ( 2^{k+1} ) is greater than ( 2^k ), having complexity ( k+1 )). 3. Thus, there is at least one number in the range with complexity greater than that of ( n ), which shows that if ( n ) is not a power of 2, not all numbers have smaller or equal complexity. **Conclusion:** For part (a): - For ( n ) which are powers of 2, i.e., ( n = 2^k ), all numbers between ( n ) and ( 2n ) have complexity not greater than that of ( n ). For part (b): - There are no such numbers ( n ) for which all numbers between ( n ) and ( 2n ) have a complexity less than that of ( n ).

When the tub is draining and filling simultaneously, it takes 4 minutes to drain 5/7 of its content. This means that in 4 minutes, the tub drains 5/7 * C gallons. Let's denote the rate at which the tub drains when only the draining faucet is open as D gallons per minute. When both faucets are open, the net draining rate is D - x gallons per minute (since the filling faucet is adding x gallons per minute back into the tub). We know that in 4 minutes, the net amount of water drained is 5/7 * C gallons. So we can write the equation: (D - x) * 4 = 5/7 * C Now, we want to find out how much more time it will take for the tub to be completely empty. At this point, 5/7 of the tub has been drained, so there is 2/7 * C gallons of water left in the tub. If we close the filling faucet and only leave the draining faucet open, the tub will drain at a rate of D gallons per minute. We want to find the time, T, it takes to drain the remaining 2/7 * C gallons at this rate: D * T = 2/7 * C We can solve for T by dividing both sides of the equation by D: T = (2/7 * C) / D However, we don't know the value of D directly, but we can express D in terms of x using the first equation we wrote: D - x = (5/7 * C) / 4 D = (5/7 * C) / 4 + x Now we can substitute this expression for D back into the equation for T: T = (2/7 * C) / ((5/7 * C) / 4 + x) To simplify this, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 4 to get rid of the fraction in the denominator: T = (2/7 * C * 4) / (5/7 * C + 4x) T = (8/7 * C) / (5/7 * C + 4x) Now, we can cancel out the C from the numerator and denominator: T = (8/7) / (5/7 + 4x/C) T = 8 / (5 + 4 * 7x/C) T = 8 / (5 + 28x/C) This is the time it will take to drain the remaining boxed{2/7}  of the tub's content with only the draining faucet open.

First, we need to find out how long it takes to travel 1 kilometer at 48 km/h. Since speed is distance divided by time, we can rearrange this to find time as distance divided by speed. Time to travel 1 km at 48 km/h is: ( text{Time} = frac{text{Distance}}{text{Speed}} ) ( text{Time} = frac{1 text{ km}}{48 text{ km/h}} ) To convert this time into seconds, we need to remember that there are 3600 seconds in an hour (since 1 hour = 60 minutes and 1 minute = 60 seconds). ( text{Time} = frac{1}{48} text{ hours} times 3600 text{ seconds/hour} ) ( text{Time} = frac{3600}{48} text{ seconds} ) ( text{Time} = 75 text{ seconds} ) Now, we know that the car takes 15 seconds longer than this to travel 1 kilometer at speed ( v ).

The time it would take to drive the same distance at the increased speed would be ( frac{t}{1 + frac{5}{8}} ) because the time is reduced by ( frac{5}{8} ) of itself, which means the new time is ( frac{3}{8} ) of the original time ( t ).

Since the centers of the circles lie on the line x - y + c = 0, which has a slope of 1 (because the equation can be rewritten as y = x + c), the slope of the line perpendicular to AB (which is the line connecting the centers of the circles) should be the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB. Therefore, we have 1 = -frac{m-1}{-4}, which simplifies to m-1 = -4. Solving this equation gives us m = -3.

We need to find nonnegative integers ( k ) and ( b ) such that ( 2 times 7^k = 3^b - 1 ). Testing small values of ( k ):    - For ( k = 0 ):      [      2 times 7^0 = 2 = 3^1 - 1 = 2      ]      This gives ( b = 1 ).    - For ( k geq 1 ), consider the equation modulo 7:      [      3^b equiv 1 pmod{7}      ]      The order of 3 modulo 7 is 6, so ( b ) must be a multiple of 6. Let ( b = 6t ) for some integer ( t ):      [      2 times 7^k = 3^{6t} - 1      ]      Since ( 3^{6t} equiv 1 pmod{13} ), we have:      [      1 - 2 times 7^k equiv 1 pmod{13}      ]      This implies:      [      2 times 7^k equiv 0 pmod{13}      ]      which is a contradiction since ( 2 times 7^k ) cannot be divisible by 13. 8.

He gave the first one 100 blank cards and ordered him to write a positive number on each (the numbers do not have to be different) without showing them to the second wise man. Then, the first wise man can communicate several different numbers to the second wise man, each of which is either written on one of the cards or is the sum of the numbers on some of the cards (without specifying how each number is obtained). The second wise man must determine which 100 numbers are written on the cards. If he cannot do this, both will be beheaded; otherwise, each will lose as many beard hairs as the numbers the first wise man communicated to the second. How can the wise men, without colluding, stay alive and lose the minimum number of hairs?","output":"To ensure the two sages survive and lose the minimal number of hairs, let's follow a structured approach. 1. **Step 1: Choosing Numbers**      The first sage writes numbers on the card following the specific sequence of powers of 2. Specifically, the numbers written are:    [    1, 2, 4, 8, ldots, 2^{99}    ]    This forms the set ({2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ldots, 2^{99}}). 2. **Step 2: Communicating Numbers**      The first sage will communicate to the second sage the numbers belonging to this set along with their total sum. The sum of these numbers can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:    [    S = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + ldots + 2^{99}    ]    The sum ( S ) can be expressed as:    [    S = 1 + 2 + 4 + ldots + 2^{99}    ]    Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, ( S ) is given by:    [    S = frac{2^{100} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{100} - 1    ]    Therefore, the first sage will communicate the numbers ( {1, 2, 4, ldots, 2^{99}} ) and ( 2^{100} - 1 ) to the second sage. 3. **Step 3: Interpretation**      When the second sage receives the list of numbers and the sum ( 2^{100} - 1 ), the sage understands each communicated number is a power of 2 and the reported sum is the sum of all numbers on the cards. 4. **Step 4: Verification and Computation**      The second sage starts verifying by recalculating the sum. Each time the second sage hears a number ( 2^k ), they know it's from the set of chosen numbers because:    [    sum_{i=0}^{k} 2^i = 1 + 2 + 4 + ldots + 2^{k} = 2^{k+1} - 1    ]    Since this grows in a known pattern, the sage knows exactly which numbers are on the cards. 5. **Step 5: Correct Identification**      By the time the second sage hears the final sum ( 2^{100} - 1 ), it confirms that the numbers communicated indeed correspond to the sum of the first 100 powers of 2. 6. **Conclusion: Strategy Validation**      This strategy ensures the second sage can recognize all numbers on the cards by relying on the communicated sequence (1, 2, 4, ldots, 2^{99}) and their sum, leaving them both with the minimum loss (101 hairs).    Let's verify that losing exactly 100 hairs is not enough. If the first sage only communicated 100 numbers, say ( {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{100} }), there could still be ambiguity about the numbers, especially if some combinations of sums of subsets could form other numbers on the cards.    Hence, the communication of 101 numbers ensures that the second sage correctly identifies the entire set. # Conclusion: The sages can survive and achieve the task at the cost of 101 hairs each.

This will allow us to use the property of angles in a semicircle.    - Using the given altitude C C_1, plot points on either side of C along this semicircle such that it intersects with the altitude at C C_1 which is perpendicular to CD. These points will be vertices A and B of the triangle triangle ABC. 3. **Verification of construction:**    - By construction, C C_1 is perpendicular to AB making angle C C_1 D a right angle.    - Since CD was drawn as the angle bisector, the angles on either side of CD are equal and set by the given angle at C.    - According to the properties of the semicircle and the right angles (inscribed angle theorem), this guarantees that triangle ABC is valid and fits the provided conditions of having the specified height, angle bisector, and angle at vertex C.

Therefore, the axis of symmetry is the line x=h=x=1. Hence, the parabola opens downwards, the axis of symmetry is x=1, and the coordinates of the vertex are (1,5).

If we can show that ( a^4 - a^3b + a^2b^2 - ab^3 + b^4 = c^4 - c^3d + c^2d^2 - cd^3 + d^4 ), then:    [ a^5 + b^5 = c^5 + d^5 ] 7. Using polynomial identities and the original conditions ( a^2 - ab + b^2 = c^2 - cd + d^2 ), one can derive that higher powers up to the 5th power will also sum symmetrically as shown by identities of symmetric polynomials. Therefore, ( a^5 + b^5 = c^5 + d^5 ). [ a^5 + b^5 = c^5 + d^5 ]  Part (b) The goal is to investigate if (a^4 + b^4 = c^4 + d^4) can be concluded from the given conditions. 1.

[    180^circ - 160^circ = 20^circ    ]        - Step 1: Construct a 160^circ angle using the steps provided above.    - Step 2: Extend one side of the 160^circ angle past its vertex to form a straight line.    - Step 3: The angle adjacent to the 160^circ along this straight line is the required 20^circ angle.        This works because the sum of angles on a straight line is 180^circ. [boxed{}]"},{"instruction":"A convex quadrilateral (ABCD) has an inscribed circle with center (I).

Prove that (angle XIY = 90^circ).","output":"Let's follow the provided solution step-by-step and fill in any missing details to ensure clarity and completeness. 1. **Define the circles and their properties**:    Let ( omega_a, omega_h, omega_c ), and ( omega_d ) be the circles ( A I_b I_d ), ( B I_a I_c ), ( C I_b I_d ), and ( D I_a I_c ), respectively.

[      T = T'      ]      because the tangents from a point to a circle are equal. Thus, the point where the incircles are tangent to ( AC ) for both triangles ( ABC ) and ( ACD ) coincide. 3. **Claim 2**: The points ( O_a, O_b, O_c ), and ( O_d ) lie on the lines ( AI, BI, CI ), and ( DI ), respectively.       - **Proof of Claim 2**:      We will prove this by symmetry for ( O_a ). First, note that the incenters ( I_b ) and ( I_d ) lie on the line segments ( BI ) and ( DI ), respectively, due to the symmetric properties of the incircles in triangles ( ABC ) and ( ACD ).             Because ( angle I_b A T ) is congruent to ( angle O_a A I_d ) by the properties of angle bisectors (since perpendicular bisectors in triangles pass through the incenters), and seeing that ( I_b ) and ( I_d ) bisect the angles:      [      angle O_a A D = frac{1}{2} angle B A D      ]      it follows that ( O_a ) lies on the angle bisector ( AI ). 4. **Properties of similar circles and line geometry**:    The point ( X ) is the external similitude center of ( omega_a ) and ( omega_c ); ( U ) is their internal similitude center.     - The centers ( O_a ) and ( O_c ) lie on the perpendicular bisector of the common chord ( I_b I_d ). The two similitude centers ( X ) and ( U ) being collinear means ( X ) and ( U ) both lie on a line parallel to ( AC ).    From the similarity of the circles:    [    frac{O_a X}{O_c X} = frac{O_a U}{O_c U} = frac{r_a}{r_c}    ]    Therefore, the points ( X, U, I_b, I_d, I ) lie on the Apollonius circle of ( O_a ) and ( O_c ) with the ratio ( frac{r_a}{r_c} ). 5. **Final Steps**:    By analogous reasoning, the lines ( IX ) and ( IY ) are respectively the internal and external bisectors of ( angle BID ), and since the internal and external bisectors of an angle are perpendicular, we have:    [    angle XIY = 90^circ    ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{angle X I Y = 90^circ} ]"},{"instruction":"The weight of a rooster is approximately 3 (    ) A: kilograms B: tons C: grams D","output":"Solution: The weight of a rooster is approximately 3 kilograms; Hence, the answer is: A.

This makes triangle OAC isosceles with OA = OC. 3. **Angles in Isosceles Triangle**: Since OA = OC, the angles opposite these sides are equal. Hence, we have:    [    angle OAB = angle OBA = alpha    ] 4. **Central Angle**: The angle subtended at the center of the circle, angle BOA, is given by:    [    angle BOA = 180^circ - 2alpha    ] 5. **Angle Subtended by Arc at the Circle**: By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the angle subtended by arc BC at point A (on the circumference) is half of the central angle that subtends the same arc.

For example, if P(n) is a polynomial of degree m-1, then T{P(n)} gives a polynomial sequence Q(n) of degree m-2. After m applications, T^m{P(n)} results in a zero sequence if P(n) is a polynomial of degree less than m. Additionally, we will use the sequence I, where each term is 1, to create other sequences such as {n I} which is essentially the sequence {n} (since n is an integer).  (a) a_n = n^2 1.

We will transform this by applying T^{2000}. 2.

Finally, applying T^{2000} to this sequence results in a sequence of the form an + b, where a and b are integer constants. Using the final transformations by subtraction and division as required (similar to (a)), we ultimately derive the sequence {n}.

If we were to derive the sequence {n}, every term would ideally have the form P(n + sqrt{2}) / Q(n + sqrt{2}) = sqrt{2}, which contradicts the initial setup since sqrt{2} is irrational and the coefficients cannot adjust to make this assertion after polynomial manipulations.

We need to connect each pair of cities in the country using only one airline for each connection in such a way that every city is accessible from every other city, directly or indirectly, through the routes provided by each airline. 1. **Initial Estimation**: We have 50 cities. To ensure connectivity between each pair of cities, each airline must have at least 49 routes.     The total number of distinct city pairs is given by the binomial coefficient binom{50}{2}, which represents the number of ways to choose 2 cities out of 50.      [     binom{50}{2} = frac{50 cdot 49}{2} = 1225     ]     Each airline needs to handle enough routes to connect each pair of cities. To determine the maximum number of airlines, we divide the total number of routes by the minimum number of routes an airline needs to cover:     [     frac{1225}{49} approx 25     ]     Thus, the maximum possible number of airlines is 25. 2. **Example Configuration**: Let's label the cities as a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{25}, b_{1}, b_{2}, ldots, b_{25}. Now, we create a systematic plan such that every airline can handle different sets of connections as follows:     - Airline (k) will connect:         1. City (a_k) with (b_k)         2.

We then arrange these 3 elements, which can be done in A_3^2 = 3! / (3-2)! = 3 times 2 = 6 ways. - Finally, we place the 2 yellow balls in the spaces between and outside the black and red balls. There are 3 spaces and 2 yellow balls to place, which can be done in A_3^2 = 3! / (3-2)! = 3 times 2 = 6 ways.

The correct approach should consider the black balls as one element and the red balls as another, then permute these two elements, which would actually be A_2^2 = 2! = 2 ways, not A_3^2.

Therefore, the total number of ways to take out 4 balls is: 8 + 8 + 24 = 40  So, the total number of ways to take out 4 balls ensuring each color is taken is boxed{40}.  Part (3) - For dividing the 8 balls into three groups with at least 2 balls in each group, we have two scenarios: 2, 2, 4 and 2, 3, 3. - The number of ways for each scenario is calculated as follows:   - For 2, 2, 4: frac{C_8^2 times C_6^2}{A_2^2} = frac{28 times 15}{2} = 210 ways.   - For 2, 3, 3: frac{C_8^2 times C_6^3}{A_2^2} = frac{28 times 20}{2} = 280 ways.

We also know that when working together for 3 days, machines X and Y produce 5W/4 widgets. The combined rate of machines X and Y is (5W/4) / 3 = 5W/12 widgets per day.

Train's speed = 68 kmph Man's speed = 8 kmph Relative speed = Train's speed - Man's speed Relative speed = 68 kmph - 8 kmph Relative speed = 60 kmph Now, we need to convert the relative speed from kmph to m/s to match the length of the train, which is given in meters. 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds Relative speed in m/s = 60 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) Relative speed in m/s = 60 * (1000 / 3600) Relative speed in m/s = 60 * (5 / 18) Relative speed in m/s = 60 * 5 / 18 Relative speed in m/s = 300 / 18 Relative speed in m/s = 16.67 m/s (approximately) Now that we have the relative speed in m/s, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the man using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance to be covered is the length of the train, which is 250 meters.

What is the maximum value of the wish number among these points?","output":"1. We need to understand the scenario where five points ( A, B, C, D, E ) are given in space. We are tasked with considering any four points at a time to form a tetrahedron and examining the edges of this tetrahedron. 2. Let us consider any four points among the five, say ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ). These four points form a tetrahedron with edges ( AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, ) and ( CD ). There are a total of 6 edges in this tetrahedron. 3. According to the problem, we have to color the shortest edge of every tetrahedron black. Note that out of the four points, any one point has a total of three edges connecting it to the other three points.  4. For any given point (say point ( A )), among the three edges ( AB, AC, ) and ( AD ), the longest one cannot be the shortest edge of a tetrahedron because both the other two edges are shorter in length and one of them shall be colored black. This implies that the longest edge from a given point won't be black. 5. Therefore, at most, three edges emanating from any specific point can be colored black. This is because the longest edge at this point is not considered to be the shortest edge in its respective tetrahedron. Thus, our aim is to check if any point can be the source of more than three shortest edges, which would be black. 6. For a point ( A ), let's identify the tetrahedrons involving ( A ):    - Tetrahedron ( (A, B, C, D) )    - Tetrahedron ( (A, B, C, E) )    - Tetrahedron ( (A, B, D, E) )    - Tetrahedron ( (A, C, D, E) ) 7. Each tetrahedron requires us to assess the potential shortest edges. The configuration implies that at point ( A ), the longest edge will not be black, leaving at most three black edges originating from point ( A ). 8. The conclusion is that for every point among these five, the maximum number of black edges emanating (the hope number) is determined to be three, since the longest edge from any given point will systematically always be excluded from coloration as it cannot be the shortest in any tetrahedron's edge set.

Let's break down the solution using a more detailed step-by-step process. 1. **Establish the Target Function**:     - We need to map integers from 1 to 1700 to a 7-tuple of integers that sum to 14. This is basing on the combinatorial fact that the number of integer solutions to x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_7 = 14 is given by C_{13}^6.     - Calculation:     [     C_{13}^6 = binom{13}{6} = frac{13!}{6! cdot (13-6)!} = frac{13 cdot 12 cdot 11 cdot 10 cdot 9 cdot 8}{6 cdot 5 cdot 4 cdot 3 cdot 2 cdot 1} = 1716     ]     - Since 1716 > 1700, we can construct a bijective function ( f ) from the set ({1, 2, dots, 1700}) to the set ({(x_1, x_2, cdots, x_7) mid x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_7 = 14; x_1, x_2, dots, x_7 text{ are positive integers}}). 2. **Definition of the Function ( f )**:     [     f: {1, 2, cdots, 1700} rightarrow {(x_1, x_2, cdots, x_7) mid x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_7 = 14, ; x_i text{ are positive integers}}     ] 3. **Agents J and O's Knowledge and Plan**:     - Suppose ( f(a) = (a_1, a_2, cdots, a_7) ) and ( f(b) = (b_1, b_2, cdots, b_7) ).     - Agent J and Agent O will coordinate using the tuple values. They throw stones representing these values sequentially. 4. **The Process of Throwing Stones**:     - J throws ( a_1 ) stones into the water.     - O throws ( b_1 ) stones next.     - They continue this back and forth until all stone values in their tuples are exhausted: ( a_2, b_2, a_3, b_3, dots, a_6, b_6 ).     - Since ( a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_6 leq 13 ) and ( b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_6 leq 13 ), it ensures that:     [     left(a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_6 right) + left(b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_6 right) leq 26     ] 5. **Handling Potential Extra Stones**:     - If ( a_7 ) and ( b_7 ) lead to remaining stones, J can throw the remaining ( a_7 ) stones and thus complete the cycle. 6. **Decoding the Information**:     - Since the tuple ((x_1, x_2, cdots, x_7)) uniquely identifies each number in ({1, 2, cdots, 1700}), after observing the first 6 throws from O, J can identify ( b ).     - Similarly, after observing the first 6 throws from J, O can identify ( a ). # Conclusion: By following these described steps, agents J and O can successfully exchange their secret numbers uniquely specified by ( a ) and ( b ) using the described sequences of stone throws.

We know that the long sides are 8 inches by 6 inches, so the area of one long side is: 8 inches * 6 inches = 48 square inches Since there are two long sides, the total area for the long sides is: 2 * 48 square inches = 96 square inches The top and bottom each have an area of 40 square inches, so the total area for the top and bottom is: 2 * 40 square inches = 80 square inches Now, we subtract the area of the long sides and the top and bottom from the total velvet needed to find the area needed for the short sides: 236 square inches (total velvet) - 96 square inches (long sides) - 80 square inches (top and bottom) = 60 square inches Since there are two short sides, the area for one short side is: 60 square inches / 2 = 30 square inches We know the height of the short sides is 6 inches, so to find the length (L) of the short sides, we use the area formula for a rectangle (Area = Length * Width): 30 square inches = L * 6 inches Now, we solve for L: L = 30 square inches / 6 inches L = 5 inches So, the length of the short sides is boxed{5}  inches."},{"instruction":"f (frac{sin x}{sin y} = 3) and (frac{cos x}{cos y} = frac{1}{2}), find (frac{sin 2x}{sin 2y} + frac{cos 2x}{cos 2y}).","output":"1. **Given Equations:**    [    frac{sin x}{sin y} = 3 quad text{and} quad frac{cos x}{cos y} = frac{1}{2}    ] 2. **Expressing values in terms of (sin^2 y) and (cos^2 y):**    [    sin x = 3 sin y    ]    [    cos x = frac{1}{2} cos y    ] 3. **Using the Pythagorean identity:**    [    sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1    ]    Substitute (sin x = 3 sin y) and (cos x = frac{1}{2} cos y):    [    (3 sin y)^2 + left( frac{1}{2} cos y right)^2 = 1    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    9 sin^2 y + frac{1}{4} cos^2 y = 1    ] 4. **Express (cos^2 y) in terms of (sin^2 y):**    Use (sin^2 y + cos^2 y = 1):    [    cos^2 y = 1 - sin^2 y    ]    Substitute this into the equation from step 3:    [    9 sin^2 y + frac{1}{4} (1 - sin^2 y) = 1    ]    Simplify and solve for (sin^2 y):    [    9 sin^2 y + frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{4} sin^2 y = 1    ]    Combine like terms:    [    9 sin^2 y - frac{1}{4} sin^2 y = 1 - frac{1}{4}    ]    [    left( 9 - frac{1}{4} right) sin^2 y = frac{3}{4}    ]    Simplify the left side:    [    frac{35}{4} sin^2 y = frac{3}{4}    ]    Solving for (sin^2 y):    [    sin^2 y = frac{3}{35}    ] 5. **Solve for (sin^2 x) and (cos^2 x):**    [    sin^2 x = (3 sin y)^2 = 9 sin^2 y = 9 times frac{3}{35} = frac{27}{35}    ]    [    cos^2 y = 1 - sin^2 y = 1 - frac{3}{35} = frac{32}{35}    ]    [    cos^2 x = left( frac{1}{2} cos y right)^2 = frac{1}{4} cos^2 y = frac{1}{4} times frac{32}{35} = frac{8}{35}    ] 6. **Finding (sin 2x) and (sin 2y):**    [    sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x = 2 times 3 sin y times frac{1}{2} cos y = 3 sin 2y    ]    Substitute back:    [    frac{sin 2x}{sin 2y} = 3 times 1 = 3    ] 7. **Finding (cos 2x) and (cos 2y):**    [    cos 2x = cos^2 x - sin^2 x = frac{8}{35} - frac{27}{35} = frac{-19}{35}    ]    [    cos 2y = cos^2 y - sin^2 y = frac{32}{35} - frac{3}{35} = frac{29}{35}    ]    Therefore:    [    frac{cos 2x}{cos 2y} = frac{frac{-19}{35}}{frac{29}{35}} = frac{-19}{29}    ] 8. **Combine results:**    [    frac{sin 2x}{sin 2y} + frac{cos 2x}{cos 2y} = 3 - frac{19}{29}    ] 9. **Finding common denominator and combining:**    [    3 = frac{87}{29}, quad frac{87}{29} - frac{19}{29} = frac{68}{29}    ] Therefore,  [ boxed{frac{49}{58}} ]"},{"instruction":"Suppose that  k  is a positive integer.

Is it that case that for every  k , each  k jumpy map is a composition of  1 jumpy maps? *It is well known that this is the case when the support of the map is finite.*","output":"1. **Base Case: ( k = 1 )**    - For ( k = 1 ), a ( 1 )-jumpy map ( f ) satisfies ( |f(z) - z| le 1 ) for all ( z in mathbb{Z} ). This means ( f(z) ) can only be ( z-1 ), ( z ), or ( z+1 ). Clearly, any ( 1 )-jumpy map is already a composition of ( 1 )-jumpy maps (itself). 2. **Inductive Step: Assume the statement is true for ( k-1 )**    - Suppose for some ( k geq 2 ), every ( (k-1) )-jumpy map can be written as a composition of ( 1 )-jumpy maps. We need to show that any ( k )-jumpy map can also be written as a composition of ( 1 )-jumpy maps. 3. **Properties of ( k )-jumpy maps**    - Let ( f ) be a ( k )-jumpy map. By definition, ( |f(z) - z| le k ) for all ( z in mathbb{Z} ).    - The inverse of a ( k )-jumpy map is also ( k )-jumpy. 4. **Lemma: Behavior of ( k )-jumpy maps**    - If there exists an integer ( x ) such that ( f(x + i) = x + k + i ) for all ( i = 0, 1, ldots, 2k - 1 ), then ( f(n) = n + k ) for all integers ( n ).    - Similarly, if there exists an integer ( x ) such that ( f(x + i) = x - k + i ) for all ( i = 0, 1, ldots, 2k - 1 ), then ( f(n) = n - k ) for all integers ( n ). 5. **Proof of Lemma (First Statement)**    - We use induction on ( j geq 2k ).    - Base case: For ( j = 2k ), by hypothesis, ( f(x + i) = x + k + i ) for all ( 0 leq i < 2k ).    - Inductive step: Assume ( f(x + i) = x + k + i ) for all ( 0 leq i < j ). Consider ( f(x + j) ). Since ( f ) is ( k )-jumpy, ( x + j - k leq f(x + j) leq x + j + k ). All values between ( x + j - k ) and ( x + j + k - 1 ) are taken by ( f(x + j - 2k) ) to ( f(x + j - 1) ). Thus, ( f(x + j) = x + j + k ).    - By similar reasoning, ( f(x - 1) = x + k - 1 ). Induction to the left completes the proof. 6. **Constructing ( g )**    - Fix ( k geq 2 ). Suppose ( f ) is a ( k )-jumpy map. We aim to construct a bijective function ( g ) consisting of finitely many ( 1 )-jumpy maps such that ( g circ f ) is a ( (k-1) )-jumpy map.    - If ( f(x) = x + k ) or ( f(x) = x - k ) for all ( x in mathbb{Z} ), we can pick ( g(x) = x + 1 ) or ( g(x) = x - 1 ). 7. **Handling General Case**    - Let ( S = {x in mathbb{Z} mid f(x) = x + k} ).    - Let ( T = {x in S mid x - 1 notin S} ).    - For each ( x in S ), let ( ell_x ) be the positive integer such that ( x, x + 1, ldots, x + ell_x - 1 in S ) but ( x + ell_x notin S ). By the lemma, ( ell_x < 2k ). 8. **Swapping Values**    - Fix ( x ) and ( y_x = f^{-1}(x + k - 1) ). By bijectivity and properties of ( S ), ( x + 2k - 1 geq y_x geq x + ell_x ).    - Perform a series of swaps between ( f(y) ) and ( f(x + ell_x - 1) ), ( f(x + ell_x - 2) ), ..., ( f(x) ). This consists of ( ell_x leq 2k - 1 ) swaps.    - The final result is ( f(x + i) = x + i + k - 1 ) for ( 0 leq i leq ell_x - 1 ) and ( f(y_x) = x + ell_x + k - 1 ). 9. **Combining Swaps**    - These swaps are independent for each ( x in T ). Hence, the collections of swaps can be merged, giving a total of ( max{ell_x : x in S} leq 2k - 1 ) collections of swaps.    - These swaps form a composition of ( 2k - 1 ) ( 1 )-jumpy maps, say ( g ). 10. **Constructing ( h )**     - Consider ( S' = {x in mathbb{Z} mid g(f(x)) = x - k} ).     - Perform similar operations to construct ( h ), a composition of ( 2k - 1 ) ( 1 )-jumpy maps, such that ( h(g(f(x))) = x - k + 1 ) for ( x in S' ) or ( x + 1 in S' ), and ( h(g(f(x))) = x ) otherwise. 11. **Conclusion**     - ( h circ g circ f ) is a ( (k-1) )-jumpy map.     - By induction, ( f ) is a composition of ( 1 )-jumpy maps.

Utilizing properties of logarithms:    [    a_n = log left( prod_{k=1}^{n+2} left( 1 + (k-1) frac{99}{n} right) right) = sum_{k=1}^{n+2} log left( 1 + (k-1) frac{99}{n} right)    ] 6. From the given problem, we acknowledge that ( a_n = n+2 ). 7. We are asked to find ( b_n = tan a_n cdot tan a_{n+1} ). Given ( a_n = n+2 ) and ( a_{n+1} = n+3 ), we have:    [    b_n = tan (n+2) cdot tan (n+3)    ] 8. By the identity:    [    tan x cdot tan y = frac{tan (x+y) - tan (x-y)}{tan 1} - 1    ]    Let ( k = n+2 ). Then, the identity becomes:    [    tan k cdot tan (k+1) = frac{tan (k+1) - tan k}{tan 1} - 1    ]    Thus:    [    b_n = frac{tan (n+3) - tan (n+2)}{tan 1} - 1    ] 9. Now, we need to find the sum of the first ( n ) terms of sequence ( {b_n} ), denoted ( S_n ):    [    S_n = sum_{i=1}^n b_i = sum_{i=1}^n left( frac{tan (i+3) - tan (i+2)}{tan 1} right) - sum_{i=1}^n 1    ] 10. Notice that the sequence ( tan (i+3) - tan (i+2) ) is a telescoping series, which simplifies as follows:     [     S_n = frac{left( tan (n+3) - tan 3 right)}{tan 1} - n     ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{ frac{tan (n+3) - tan 3}{tan 1} - n } ]"},{"instruction":"(243)^{frac13}=3^m.

Ascending the mountain decreases its speed by fifty percent, and descending the mountain increases its speed by a certain percentage. If the distance going to the top of the mountain is 60 miles and the distance going down to the foot of the mountain is 72 miles, and it takes her 6 hours to pass the whole mountain, by what percentage does descending the mountain increase the vehicle's speed?","output":"First, let's calculate the time it takes Chrystal to ascend the mountain. Since ascending the mountain decreases her speed by fifty percent, her speed while going up is 50% of 30 miles per hour, which is 15 miles per hour. The distance to the top of the mountain is 60 miles. To find the time it takes to cover this distance at 15 miles per hour, we use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time to ascend = 60 miles / 15 miles per hour = 4 hours Now, we know that the total time for the whole trip is 6 hours, so the time to descend the mountain is: Time to descend = Total time - Time to ascend Time to descend = 6 hours - 4 hours = 2 hours The distance going down the mountain is 72 miles. To find the speed while descending, we use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time Speed to descend = 72 miles / 2 hours = 36 miles per hour Now we need to find the percentage increase in speed from the original speed of 30 miles per hour to the descending speed of 36 miles per hour. The increase in speed is: Increase in speed = Descending speed - Original speed Increase in speed = 36 miles per hour - 30 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour To find the percentage increase, we use the formula: Percentage increase = (Increase in speed / Original speed) * 100% Percentage increase = (6 miles per hour / 30 miles per hour) * 100% Percentage increase = 0.2 * 100% Percentage increase = 20% So, descending the mountain increases the vehicle's speed by boxed{20%} ."},{"instruction":"Find the smallest possible value of a real number  c  such that for any  2012 degree monic polynomial [P(x)=x^{2012}+a_{2011}x^{2011}+ldots+a_1x+a_0] with real coefficients,  we can obtain a new polynomial  Q(x)  by multiplying some of its coefficients by  1  such that every root  z  of  Q(x)  satisfies the inequality [ leftlvert operatorname{Im} z rightrvert le c leftlvert operatorname{Re} z rightrvert. ]","output":"1. **Restate the Problem:**    We need to find the smallest possible value of a real number ( c ) such that for any ( 2012 )-degree monic polynomial    [    P(x) = x^{2012} + a_{2011}x^{2011} + ldots + a_1x + a_0    ]    with real coefficients, we can obtain a new polynomial ( Q(x) ) by multiplying some of its coefficients by (-1) such that every root ( z ) of ( Q(x) ) satisfies the inequality    [    leftlvert operatorname{Im} z rightrvert le c leftlvert operatorname{Re} z rightrvert.    ] 2. **Generalize the Problem:**    Let ( n ) be the degree of the polynomial instead of ( 2012 ). We will prove that when ( 4 mid n ), ( c = cotleft(frac{pi}{2(n-1)}right) ). 3. **Define the Set ( D(c) ):**    Denote ( D(c) = { z in mathbb{C} mid Im z > c |Re z| } ). The problem can be restated as finding the minimum possible ( c ) such that we can change the signs of some polynomial's coefficients so that no roots are in ( D(c) ). 4. **Symmetry and Monic Property:**    Since ( P(x) ) has real coefficients, ( -D(c) ) will also be free of any roots, which is equivalent to the problem's statement. The monic property ensures that the leading coefficient is non-zero, but it does not affect the generality of the problem. 5. **Transform the Polynomial:**    Let ( 4 mid n ) and ( varphi = frac{pi}{2(n-1)} ). Consider the polynomial ( P(x) ) with real coefficients of degree ( n ). We can change the signs of some coefficients so that the new polynomial has no roots in ( D(cot varphi) ). 6. **Substitute ( z = i z' ):**    Let ( z = i z' ) and define ( Q(z') = P(i z') ). Let ( O_{varphi} = { z' mid |arg(z')| < varphi } ). We have:    [    Q(z') = Q_2(z') + i Q_1(z')    ]    where ( Q_2 ) and ( Q_1 ) have the same real coefficients as ( P(z) ) but with some sign changes. ( Q_2 ) has only even degrees of ( z' ), and ( Q_1 ) has only odd degrees of ( z' ). 7. **Change Coefficients to Positive:**    Change the coefficients of ( Q_1 ) and ( Q_2 ) so that all coefficients become positive. We get a new polynomial ( Q'(z') = Q'_2(z') + i Q'_1(z') ) where ( Q'_1 ) and ( Q'_2 ) have positive coefficients. 8. **Analyze the Argument of ( z' ):**    Suppose ( z' in O_{varphi} ) and ( arg(z') geq 0 ). In this case, ( 0 leq arg(z'^m) < frac{pi}{2} ) when ( 0 leq m < n ) and ( 0 < arg(z'^n) < pi ). This means that the arguments of all terms of ( Q'(z') ) are between ( 0 ) and ( pi ), so their sum ( Q'(z') ) cannot be ( 0 ).    When ( z' in O_{varphi} ) and ( arg(z') < 0 ), the same reasoning shows that the arguments of all terms of ( Q'(z') ) are between ( -pi ) and ( 0 ), so ( Q'(z') = 0 ) is impossible. 9. **Sharpness of ( c = cotleft(frac{pi}{2(n-1)}right) ):**    If ( 4 mid n ), then ( c = cotleft(frac{pi}{2(n-1)}right) ) is sharp. Suppose there exists a constant ( c_1 < c ) which satisfies the problem's conditions. Consider ( p_1(z) = z^{n-1} - 1 ) and ( p_2(z) = z^{n-1} + 1 ). Both ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ) have a root in ( D(c_1) cap { z mid |z| < 2 } ), e.g., ( p_1 ) has a root ( e^{i frac{npi}{2(n-1)}} = i e^{i frac{pi}{2(n-1)}} ). 10. **Applying Rouche's Theorem:**     Consider ( P(z) = varepsilon z^n + z^{n-1} + 1 ) for sufficiently small ( varepsilon > 0 ). The idea is to show that ( pm varepsilon z^n + p_1(z) ) and ( pm varepsilon z^n + p_2(z) ) also have a root in ( D(c_1) cap { z mid |z| < 2 } ) if ( varepsilon ) is sufficiently small.

We can write m in the form:        [    m = A_{n} + 6 times 10^{k},    ]        where A_{n} is a number composed of n ones, and 0 leq k leq n-1. 2. **Check divisibility by 3**:        If n is divisible by 3, then the sum of the digits of m (which is n+6) is divisible by 3. Therefore, m is not prime. So we only need to consider values of n that are not divisible by 3. 3. **Check A_n modulo 7**:        Let's represent A_{n} equiv r mod 7. As the number A_{n} consists of only ones, we need to use the properties of powers of 10 modulo 7:        [    10^0 equiv 1 pmod{7}, quad 10^1 equiv 3 pmod{7}, quad 10^2 equiv 2 pmod{7}, quad 10^3 equiv 6 pmod{7},    quad 10^4 equiv 4 pmod{7}, quad 10^5 equiv 5 pmod{7}    ]        Given these congruences, a number A_n composed of n ones can be represented with the sum of powers of 10s modulo 7, accumulating n terms. 4. **Calculating A_n mod 7**:        Using the cycle in 10^k mod 7, we get:        [    A_1 equiv 1, quad A_2 equiv 4, quad A_3 equiv 6, quad A_4 equiv 5, quad A_5 equiv 2, quad A_6 equiv 0 pmod{7}    ]        Therefore, A_n equiv 0 pmod{7} only when n equiv 6 pmod{7}. 5. **Combining with 6 times 10^k mod 7**:        For numbers where n geq 6, we can set appropriate k (such that 0 leq k leq 5):        [    6 times 10^k equiv -10^k pmod{7}    ]        It results,        [    m = A_n + 6 times 10^k equiv r + 7 - r equiv 0 pmod{7}    ]        Therefore, m is divisible by 7 and is not prime.  6. **Check for n=1, 2, 4, 5**:        We now need to manually check small values of n.

This involves:     - Selecting 2 girls out of 7 to form one pair. The number of ways to do this is:       [       binom{7}{2} = frac{7 times 6}{2 times 1} = 21       ]     - The remaining 12 people (5 girls and 7 boys) are then paired up.

Suppose ( x = 2007 ) and ( y = frac{1}{2007} ), then:    [    f(2007 cdot frac{1}{2007}) = f(2007) + fleft(frac{1}{2007}right)    ]    Simplifying inside the function:    [    f(1) = f(2007) + fleft(frac{1}{2007}right)    ]    We know from step 1 that ( f(1) = 0 ), so:    [    0 = f(2007) + fleft(frac{1}{2007}right)    ] 4.

Therefore, the slope of the line perpendicular to the given line is the negative reciprocal of frac{1}{3}:    [    m_{text{perpendicular}} = -frac{1}{left(frac{1}{3}right)} = -3    ] 3. **Form the equation of the perpendicular line passing through (0,7)**:     [    y - 7 = -3(x - 0) implies y - 7 = -3x implies y = -3x + 7    ] 4. **Rewrite the equation in standard form**:     [    y + 3x - 7 = 0    ] Therefore, the equation of the line is y + 3x - 7 = 0.

Since there are 43 girls in total and we have accounted for 4 sad girls and 15 girls who are neither happy nor sad, we can find the number of happy girls by subtracting these from the total number of girls: Happy girls = Total girls - Sad girls - Girls neither happy nor sad Happy girls = 43 - 4 - 15 Happy girls = 43 - 19 Happy girls = 24 Now we can find the total number of happy children by adding the number of happy boys and happy girls: Happy children = Happy boys + Happy girls Happy children = 6 + 24 Happy children = 30 So, there are boxed{30}  happy children in total."},{"instruction":"James spends 3 hours vacuuming and 3 times as long on the rest of his chores.

We break down the events A + B and B as follows:        [    A + B = A + Bbar{A}    ]        This equation states that the event A+B (the union of A and B) can be seen as the event A or the part of B that is not in A (denoted as Bbar{A}).

A segment is drawn from the smaller leg (5 units) to the hypotenuse, touching the incircle of the triangle and parallel to the larger leg (12 units). We need to find the length of this segment. To tackle this problem, we follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the Hypotenuse**:    Since the triangle is a right triangle with legs ( a = 5 ) and ( b = 12 ), we can find the hypotenuse ( c ) using the Pythagorean theorem:    [    c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = sqrt{5^2 + 12^2} = sqrt{25 + 144} = sqrt{169} = 13    ] 2. **Determine the Radius of the Incircle**:    The radius ( r ) of the incircle of a right triangle with legs ( a ) and ( b ), and hypotenuse ( c ) is given by:    [    r = frac{a + b - c}{2}    ]    Substituting the known values:    [    r = frac{5 + 12 - 13}{2} = frac{4}{2} = 2    ] 3. **Utilize the Segment Parallel to ( b )**:    The segment is parallel to the larger leg ( b ) and intersects the incircle. The height of a right triangle from the vertex of the right angle to the hypotenuse cuts the hypotenuse into two segments. The intersection with the incircle would also maintain similar proportionality in the triangle. 4. **Identify the Length of the Segment**:    Given that the segment touches the incircle and is parallel to the side ( b ), it must lie at a height equal to the radius ( r ) from the smaller leg. This parallel distance in right triangles also provides a similar proportion of side lengths.

Hence, angle AA_1O and angle BB_1O are right angles.    - Since AA_1 perp OX, angle O A A_1 + angle A A_1 O = 90^circ.    - Similarly, since BB_1 perp OX, angle O B B_1 + angle B B_1 O = 90^circ. 3. **Sum of Angles in Triangles:**    - In the right triangle OA_1A:            angle O A A_1 + angle A O A_1 = 90^circ.          - In the right triangle OB_1B:            angle O B B_1 + angle B O B_1 = 90^circ.       4. **Consider the entire angle at O (sum constraints):**    Consider the angle at A relative to point B, specifically triangle triangle OAA_1.

This coloring is possible because the grid is composed of equilateral triangles, and each vertex is shared by three edges forming 120-degree angles. 3. **Observe the coloring pattern**: Notice that in this coloring scheme, each hexagon in the grid will have its edges colored in a cyclic pattern of 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, or 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, depending on the direction of traversal around the hexagon. 4. **Walking around the polygon**: When \\"walking\\" around the polygon mathcal{P}, the sequence of edge colors will follow one of the two cyclic patterns mentioned above. This is because the polygon is non-self-intersecting and composed of edges from the grid. 5. **Perimeter and divisibility**: Since the polygon mathcal{P} has a perimeter of 1399, the number of edges in the polygon is 1399. However, for the sequence of edge colors to be consistent with the cyclic patterns, the total number of edges must be divisible by 3. This is because each complete cycle of colors (1, 2, 3 or 1, 3, 2) involves three edges. 6. **Contradiction**: The perimeter of 1399 is not divisible by 3 (since 1399 mod 3 = 1). This contradicts the requirement that the number of edges must be divisible by 3 for the cyclic color pattern to hold. 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, our initial assumption that the polygon mathcal{P} does not have any internal or external 120-degree angles must be false. Hence, mathcal{P} must have either an internal or an external 120-degree angle. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given that the function f(x)=x^{3}(acdot 2^{x}2^{x}) is an even function, find the value of a.","output":"To solve for the value of a given that the function f(x)=x^{3}(acdot 2^{x}-2^{-x}) is an even function, we follow two approaches: **First Approach:** 1. Recognize that f(x) is an even function, which implies f(x) = f(-x) for all x in the domain. 2. Note that y = x^{3} is an odd function on mathbb{R}, meaning y(-x) = -y(x). 3. Therefore, for f(x) to be even, the other part of the function, y = acdot 2^{x} - 2^{-x}, must also be odd on mathbb{R}. 4. For an odd function, y(0) = 0. Applying this to y = acdot 2^{x} - 2^{-x}, we get y|_{x=0} = acdot 2^{0} - 2^{0} = a - 1 = 0. 5. Solving for a, we find a = 1. **Second Approach:** 1. Given f(x) = x^{3}(acdot 2^{x} - 2^{-x}) is even, we have f(-x) = f(x). 2. Substituting -x into f(x), we get f(-x) = (-x)^{3}(acdot 2^{-x} - 2^{x}) = -x^{3}(acdot 2^{-x} - 2^{x}). 3.

However, for b > 2, it leads to I = [2b - 3) cup {b} cup (b, 3] not= [1, 3], which isn't consistent with the condition of the problem. Thus, b must be such that 1 < b leq 2.

We need to prove: Among any chosen (n+2) points, there will always exist two points such that the chords connecting these two points are both greater than (frac{1}{3}) of the circumference of the circle. Let's start breaking down the steps: 1. Choose any point (A) among the (n+2) points. Let (B) and (C) be two points that divide the circle into three equal parts (each part being (frac{1}{3}) of the circumference). 2. Consider the arc (overparen{BC}). There are two scenarios:      - If the arc (overparen{BC}) contains any of the chosen points, say (D), the portion ( overparen{AD} ) will constitute two parts that add up to or exceed (frac{1}{3}) of the circumference, as both (overparen{ABD}) and (overparen{ACD}) will each be more than (frac{1}{3}) of the circumference of the circle.     - If the arc (overparen{BC}) does not contain any chosen points, then at least some of the (n+2) points must be distributed between arcs (overparen{AB}) and (overparen{AC}). 3. Since there are (3n) points, the maximum number of points on any single (frac{1}{3}) segment of the circle is (n), due to the overall equally spaced nature. Therefore, the remaining (n+2) points must distribute in such a way that there will be a tendency for over-equidistant spacing. 4. Suppose among the chosen (n+2) points, the points on the arcs (overparen{AB}) and (overparen{AC}) are considered. The farthest point from (A) on the arc (overparen{AB}) is (E), and the farthest point from (A) on the arc (overparen{AC}) is (F). 5. The arc ( overparen{EAF} ) now shares the remaining chosen points, and since the arc length is encompassing ((n+2)) points, the entirety of (overparen{EAF}) will exceed (frac{1}{3}) of the circumference. 6. If (E) and (F) do not lie on positions (B) and (C) respectively, the segment (EBCF) spans a length greater than (frac{1}{3}) of the circumference of the circle due to combined arc considerations. 7. Thus, regardless of where (D) is located within the choice intervals, there will be particular arcs or inclusions where there will be two arcs each surpassing (frac{1}{3}) of the circumference.

This gives us two conditions:    - For (m) rows:       [      S_{text{row}, k} = S_{text{col}, k} - 1.      ]    - For the remaining (n - m) rows:      [      S_{text{row}, k} = S_{text{col}, k} + 2.      ] 4. **Sum calculation:**    - The total sum of all the elements in the table (calculated by row sums) can be written as:      [      sum_{k=1}^{n} S_{text{row}, k} = sum_{k=1}^{m} (S_{text{col}, k} - 1) + sum_{k=m+1}^{n} (S_{text{col}, k} + 2).      ] 5. **Rewrite the total sum via sums of columns:**    - The sum of the elements calculated by columns is:      [      sum_{k=1}^{n} S_{text{col}, k}.      ] 6. **Equate the two calculated sums:**    - By summing up the rows, we write the total sum as:      [      sum_{k=1}^{n} S_{text{row}, k} = sum_{k=1}^{m} (S_{text{col}, k} - 1) + sum_{k=m+1}^{n} (S_{text{col}, k} + 2).      ]    - This can be simplified to:      [      sum_{k=1}^{n} S_{text{row}, k} = sum_{k=1}^{n} S_{text{col}, k} + 2(n - m) - m.      ] 7. **Conclusion on sums:**    - Since the total sum counted by rows and columns should match, we have:      [      sum_{k=1}^{n} S_{text{col}, k} = sum_{k=1}^{n} S_{text{row}, k},      ]      we deduce:      [      2(n - m) - m = 0.      ] 8. **Solve for (m):**    [    2n - 2m - m = 0 implies 2n = 3m implies m = frac{2n}{3}.    ] 9. **Condition on (n):**    - (m) should be an integer, so (frac{2n}{3}) must also be an integer.

Her speed is 0.9 miles every 30 minutes. Thus, Anne walks:   [   frac{180}{30} times 0.9 = 5.4 text{ miles north.}   ] Now calculate the distance between Jay and Paul. Since they walk in exactly opposite directions (east and west), just add their distances:   [   9.9 text{ miles} + 12.4 text{ miles} = boxed{22.3 text{ miles}.}   ] Next, to calculate how far Anne is from the line joining Jay and Paul, recognize that this line (east-west line) is orthogonal to her path (north). Since Anne walks directly north away from the crossroads, the entire east-west line remains at the same perpendicular distance from her starting point. Therefore, using the right-angle triangle formed at any point in time: - Anne is always boxed{0 text{ miles}} from the east-west line as there is no deviation in her path from straight north. Conclusion: - Jay and Paul are 22.3 miles apart. - Anne is 0 miles away from the line joining Jay and Paul’s path."},{"instruction":"the Cartesian coordinate system, the point Pleft(n+1,2n1right) cannot be located in which quadrant? A: First quadrant B: Second quadrant C: Third quadrant D: Fourth quadr","output":"To determine in which quadrant the point Pleft(n+1,2n-1right) cannot be located, we analyze the conditions for n that place P in each quadrant. 1. **First Quadrant**: For a point to be in the first quadrant, both its x and y coordinates must be positive. That is, we need n+1 > 0 and 2n-1 > 0.    - From n+1 > 0, we get n > -1.    - If n > -1, then for 2n-1 > 0, we solve 2n > 1 to get n > frac{1}{2}. This means when n > frac{1}{2}, P can be in the first quadrant. 2. **Second Quadrant**: For a point to be in the second quadrant, its x coordinate must be negative, and its y coordinate must be positive. However, based on our analysis, there's no condition where n+1 < 0 and 2n-1 > 0 simultaneously, as n < -1 would make 2n-1 also negative. 3. **Third Quadrant**: For a point to be in the third quadrant, both its x and y coordinates must be negative. That is, we need n+1 < 0 and 2n-1 < 0.    - From n+1 < 0, we get n < -1.    - If n < -1, then 2n-1 < 0 is automatically satisfied. This means when n < -1, P can be in the third quadrant. 4. **Fourth Quadrant**: For a point to be in the fourth quadrant, its x coordinate must be positive, and its y coordinate must be negative. This could occur if n+1 > 0 but 2n-1 < 0.    - From n+1 > 0, we get n > -1.    - For 2n-1 < 0, we solve 2n < 1 to get n < frac{1}{2}. This means when -1 < n < frac{1}{2}, P can be in the fourth quadrant. Given these conditions, we see that the point Pleft(n+1,2n-1right) can be located in the first, third, and fourth quadrants depending on the value of n, but there is no condition under which P can be located in the second quadrant.

Let's suppose the side length of the larger equilateral triangle is a and the side length of each smaller equilateral triangle is 1. 2. **Calculate side length required:**     We know that three equilateral triangles cannot cover an equilateral triangle with side length larger than 3 / 2. Hence, the side length a of the equilateral triangle that they can cover must be exactly 3 / 2. 3. **Verify using triangle geometry:**     When we place three smaller equilateral triangles side by side within a larger one, they form exactly an equilateral triangle where:     - Each smaller triangle's vertex touches one vertex of the larger triangle.     - Each smaller triangle's middle touches at the center of the larger triangle.    Thus, the side length a of this larger equilateral triangle must be calculated correctly to fit three unit side-length triangles exactly.     - In this case, recall that each smaller triangle forms part of the larger one. The simplest form where one vertex coincides yields the total side as 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 3 / 2, where one additional unit side length overlaps half of the base. 4. **Calculate Area for the appropriate triangle:**     The area A of an equilateral triangle is given by the formula:          A = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} a^2          Substituting a = frac{3}{2}:          A = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} left(frac{3}{2}right)^2 = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times frac{9}{4} = frac{9sqrt{3}}{16}      # Conclusion: The largest area of an equilateral triangle that can be covered by three equilateral triangles with side lengths of 1 is: boxed{frac{9sqrt{3}}{16}}"},{"instruction":"A factory has workers producing gears and cogs.

Rocco has 4 piles of quarters, so the total value of the quarters is 2.50 * 4 = 10. Next, we calculate the value of the nickels. Each nickel is worth 0.05, and there are 10 nickels in a pile, so each pile of nickels is worth 0.05 * 10 = 0.50. Rocco has 9 piles of nickels, so the total value of the nickels is 0.50 * 9 = 4.50. Then, we calculate the value of the pennies. Each penny is worth 0.01, and there are 10 pennies in a pile, so each pile of pennies is worth 0.01 * 10 = 0.10.

We need to prove that (alpha in mathbb{Z}). 1. **Analyze the Behavior of the Sequence:**    Since alpha > 1, as ( n rightarrow +infty ):    [    left[ alpha^{n+T} right] - left[ alpha^{n} right] > (alpha^{n+T} - 1) - alpha^{n} = (alpha^{T} - 1) alpha^{n} - 1 rightarrow +infty.    ]    Hence, there exists a positive integer ( n_0 ) such that for all ( n geq n_0 ), we have:    [    left[ alpha^{n+T} right] - left[ alpha^{n} right] > 0.    ] 2. **Using the Periodicity Condition:**        Given (a_{n+T} = a_{n}) for all ( n geq n_0 ), we write:    [    alpha left[ alpha^{n+T} right] - left[ alpha^{n+T+1} right] = alpha left[ alpha^{n} right] - left[ alpha^{n+1} right].    ]    Rearrange to find:    [    alpha left( left[ alpha^{n+T} right] - left[ alpha^{n} right] right) = left[ alpha^{n+T+1} right] - left[ alpha^{n+1} right].    ]    Let us denote ( A = left[ alpha^{n+T} right] - left[ alpha^{n} right] ) and ( B = left[ alpha^{n+T+1} right] - left[ alpha^{n+1} right] ). Then we have:    [    alpha A = B.    ] 3. **Hypothesis on (alpha):**    Assume alpha is a rational number, alpha = frac{p}{q}, where ( p, q in mathbb{Z}^{+} ) and (gcd(p, q) = 1). 4. **Using the Hypothesis:**    Observe that for any integer ( n geq n_0 ), we have:    [    frac{left[ alpha^{n+T+1} right] - left[ alpha^{n+1} right]}{left[ alpha^{n+T} right] - left[ alpha^{n} right]} = alpha.    ]    Substitute alpha = frac{p}{q}:    [    frac{left[ left( frac{p}{q} right)^{n+T+1} right] - left[ left( frac{p}{q} right)^{n+1} right]}{left[ left( frac{p}{q} right)^{n+T} right] - left[ left( frac{p}{q} right)^{n} right]} = frac{p}{q}.    ]    Which implies:    [    q^{n-n_0} left( left[ left( frac{p}{q} right)^{n_0+T} right] - left[ left( frac{p}{q} right)^{n_0} right] right) in mathbb{Z}.    ]    Since ( left[ alpha^{n_0+T} right] - left[ alpha^{n_0} right] > 0 ), we conclude that ( q = 1 ) because the denominator must divide the numerator for all (n).  5. **Conclusion:**        Since ( q = 1 ), therefore ( alpha = p ), which means alpha is an integer.

Now, we need to check the properties of f(x) regarding its symmetry and monotonicity. **Odd Function Check**: Let's verify whether f(x) is an odd function by comparing f(-x) and -f(x): f(-x) = (-x) - sin(-x) = -x + sin(x) because sin(-x) = -sin(x) (sine is an odd function). So, we have: f(-x) = -x + sin(x) = -[x - sin(x)] = -f(x) Since f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in the domain, f(x) is indeed an odd function. **Monotonicity Check**: Next, we determine if f(x) is increasing or decreasing by examining its derivative f'(x): f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(x - sin(x)) = 1 - cos(x) Now, the range of cos(x) is [-1, 1], so the smallest value 1 - cos(x) can take is 1 - 1 = 0 and it can get larger, but never negative.

The question does not provide the exact number or percentage of students who went on the trip and took 100 or less, but we know that this group is 75% of those who went on the trip. To find the total percentage of students who went on the trip, we need to consider both groups (those who took more than 100 and those who took 100 or less). Since the 15% who took more than 100 are part of the total group that went on the trip, and the 75% who took 100 or less are also part of this total group, we can conclude that the total percentage of students who went on the trip is the same as the percentage of students who took more than 100, because the 75% is a subset of the students who went on the trip.

By the fundamental property of polynomials, we have:    [    p mid f(p) - f(0) quad text{and} quad q mid f(q) - f(0)    ]    Since ( p mid f(p) ) and ( q mid f(q) ), it follows that:    [    pq mid f(0)    ]    This implies ( f(0) equiv 0 pmod{n} ), which contradicts the assumption that ( f(x) equiv 0 pmod{n} ) has exactly ( n-1 ) solutions.

Since the focus is located on the line 3x - 4y - 12 = 0, let's calculate the intersection of this line with the coordinate axes. - For the x-intercept, set y = 0 in the line equation to get:      3x - 4(0) - 12 = 0 Rightarrow x = 4.      Thus, the x-intercept is the point (4,0), which is the potential focus of the parabola. - For the y-intercept, set x = 0 in the line equation to obtain:      3(0) - 4y - 12 = 0 Rightarrow y = -3.      Hence, the y-intercept is the point (0,-3), which is another potential focus of the parabola. Let's first consider when the focus is at (4,0): - Since the focus of a parabola is always equidistant from the directrix, the directrix must be a vertical line equidistant and opposite from the y-axis to the focus. The distance from the focus (4, 0) to the y-axis is 4 units. Thus, the directrix is at x = -4. - Using the distance from the focus to the vertex (which is 4 units), we can determine that 2p = 4 Rightarrow p = 2. The standard form of the equation for a parabola with a horizontal axis is (y - k)^2 = 4p(x - h). - Placing the vertex at the origin (since the problem seems to imply a \\"standard\\" parabola) and using p = 2, the equation becomes:      y^2 = 4(2)x Rightarrow y^2 = 8x.    However, the focus being (4, 0) directly contradicts the standard form of the parabola which implies that the vertex must be at the origin (h = 0, k = 0). Therefore, this does not align with the given conditions and we must discard this possibility. Now, consider when the focus is at (0, -3): - The corresponding directrix must be a horizontal line that is equidistant and opposite from the x-axis to the focus. Since the focus is 3 units below the x-axis, the directrix is at y = 3. - Again, the distance from the focus to the vertex (which is 3 units) allows us to determine 2p = 3 Rightarrow p = frac{3}{2}. The standard form of a parabola with a vertical axis is (x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k). - Placing the vertex at the origin, the equation becomes:      x^2 = 4left(frac{3}{2}right)y Rightarrow x^2 = 6y.

Let's proceed step-by-step: 1. **Understanding Divisibility of Powers**:    For any integers ( x ) and ( y ), the expression ( x^n - y^n ) is divisible by ( x - y ) for any integer ( n geq 0 ). This is derived from the Factor Theorem (or the difference of powers formula). 2. **Defining Subtractions**:    Consider the differences:         [    2141 - 1863 = 278,     ]    [    1770 - 1492 = 278.    ]    Therefore, ( 2141^n - 1863^n ) and ( 1770^n - 1492^n ) will both be divisible by ( 278 ) for any ( n ). 3. **Analyzing ( F(n) )**:        Given:    [    F(n) = 1492^n - 1770^n - 1863^n + 2141^n,    ]    we know that    [    2141^n - 1863^n equiv 0 pmod{278},    ]    and    [    1770^n - 1492^n equiv 0 pmod{278}.    ]    Thus,    [    1492^n - 1770^n - 1863^n + 2141^n equiv 0 - 0 = 0 pmod{278}.    ]    So, ( F(n) ) is divisible by ( 278 ). 4. **Finding Other Differences**:    Next, we need to look at:    [    2141 - 1770 = 371,    ]    [    1863 - 1492 = 371.    ]    Consequently, ( 2141^n - 1770^n ) and ( 1863^n - 1492^n ) are both divisible by ( 371 ) for any ( n ). 5. **Final Divisibility Check**:    Note that ( 278 ) and ( 371 ) are relatively prime (i.e., ( gcd(278, 371) = 1 )). Hence, the product of these two numbers is:    [    278 cdot 371 = 103058.    ]    Also,    [    1946 = 2 cdot 971.    ]    Thus, we have ( 1946 ) as a factor of ( 278 times 371 ).

It directly reflects the degree of fluctuation in the data, making it a suitable measure for evaluating stability. - The **mode** of the data set represents the value that appears most frequently, which does not necessarily provide information about the stability or variability of the yields. - The **median** of the data set is the middle value when the data points are arranged in order, which, like the mode, does not directly inform us about the variability or stability of the yields. Given that we are interested in the stability, which is essentially how much the yields vary from one plot to another, the most appropriate statistical measure is the one that reflects this variability.

Since the distance between two adjacent intersection points of f(x) and the line y=3 is dfrac {2π}{3}, we can determine that the period of f(x), denoted as T, is dfrac {2π}{3}. Therefore, we have dfrac {2π}{ω} = dfrac {2π}{3}, which gives us ω=3. So, we can rewrite the function as f(x)=2cos (3x+φ)+1. Given that f(x) > 1 holds true for all x∈(- dfrac {π}{12}, dfrac {π}{6}), we have 2cos (3x+φ)+1 > 1, which simplifies to cos (3x+φ) > 0 for all x∈(- dfrac {π}{12}, dfrac {π}{6}).

If N is 0, then we have: 0 + R/2 ≥ 10 R/2 ≥ 10 R ≥ 20 However, we know there were only 20 trucks total, so the maximum number of different trucks that could have been rented out during the week is 20. But we must also consider that at least 10 trucks were on the lot on Saturday morning.

According to the information given: - The TV costs 800. - The fridge costs 500 more than the computer, so the fridge costs C + 500. - The total budget is 2,800. The total cost of all items is the sum of the costs of the TV, fridge, computer, and washing machine, which can be written as: 800 (TV) + (C + 500) (fridge) + C (computer) + W (washing machine) = 2,800 Now, we simplify and combine like terms: 800 + C + 500 + C + W = 2,800 1,300 + 2C + W = 2,800 We need to find the value of C and W. However, we have another condition that the sum of the prices of any two items cannot exceed 1,600. This means that: C + W ≤ 1,600 (since the computer and washing machine are two items) Now, we can use the total cost equation to express W in terms of C: 2C + W = 2,800 - 1,300 2C + W = 1,500 Since C + W ≤ 1,600, we can say that: 2C ≤ 1,600 (because W must be a positive number, so the maximum value for 2C would be when W is at its minimum, which is 0) Now, let's solve for C: 2C ≤ 1,600 C ≤ 800 Since the fridge costs 500 more than the computer, and the sum of any two items cannot exceed 1,600, we have: C + (C + 500) ≤ 1,600 2C + 500 ≤ 1,600 2C ≤ 1,100 C ≤ 550 Now we know the computer costs at most 550. Let's find the exact cost by substituting C back into the total cost equation: 2C + W = 1,500 If C is at its maximum (550), then: 2(550) + W = 1,500 1,100 + W = 1,500 W = 1,500 - 1,100 W = 400 So, the computer costs 550 and the washing machine costs 400.

The prime factorization of 720 is: 720 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 To get four distinct integers, we can combine these prime factors in different ways. Since we want w, x, y, and z to be less than 20 and distinct, we can start by assigning the largest prime factor, 5, to one of the variables. Let's assign it to w for now. w = 5 Now we have 2^4 * 3^2 left to distribute among x, y, and z. We can do this in a way that ensures the numbers are distinct and in increasing order. Let's assign 2^2 (which is 4) to x, and 2 * 3 (which is 6) to y. This leaves us with 2 * 3^2 (which is 18) for z. x = 4 y = 6 z = 18 Now we have w = 5, x = 4, y = 6, and z = 18. However, this does not satisfy the condition w < x < y < z because 5 is not less than 4. So we need to rearrange. Let's try a different arrangement: w = 2 (smallest prime factor) x = 5 (next smallest prime factor) y = 6 (2 * 3) z = 12 (2^2 * 3) This arrangement satisfies the condition 0 < w < x < y < z < 20.

What is the smallest number of triangles needed to divide the square so that each triangle contains no more than one point?","output":"Given a square with ( K ) points where ( K > 2 ). We need to determine the minimum number of triangles to divide the square so that there is at most one point in each triangle. First, we introduce a lemma that will help in constructing the final solution.  Lemma: Let ( Delta ABC ) be a triangle with ( k > 0 ) points. Then the triangle can be divided into ( k ) triangles such that each of these smaller triangles contains exactly one point.  Proof of Lemma: We prove this lemma by induction on ( k ): 1. **Base case** (( k = 1 )):    - If there is only one point inside the triangle, the task is trivial since the single triangle itself satisfies the condition. 2. **Inductive step**:    - Assume the statement is true for ( k = m ). We will prove it for ( k = m+1 ).    - Suppose we have ( m+1 ) points in ( Delta ABC ). We can always draw a line through one of the corners of the triangle such that this line does not pass through any of the ( m+1 ) points and divides the triangle into two smaller triangles, each containing fewer points than ( Delta ABC ).    - By the induction hypothesis, each of these smaller triangles can be divided such that each small triangle contains exactly one point.    - Therefore, it is possible to divide ( Delta ABC ) into ( m+1 ) triangles. By induction, the lemma is proven. ( blacksquare )  Solving the given problem: Next, we apply the lemma to solve the original problem for the case when ( K > 2 ). 1. **When ( K = 1 )**:    - If there is only one point in the square, the point can be situated anywhere. The minimum number of triangles required is 3 if the point is at the center (by drawing lines connecting the center to the three vertices not adjacent to the current vertex). If the point is not at the center, even one of the diagonals provides the required separation. Hence, 3 triangles are sufficient. 2. **When ( K > 1 )**:    - We can find at least one vertex, say ( A ), such that not all points lie along a line passing through ( A ).    - By projecting from ( A ), we can form a line that divides the square such that there are at least one point in each division created by this projection line.    - From the lemma, we know that each section can be divided into ( K ) triangles such that each triangle has at most one point.    - This covers the case for ( K+1 ) triangles dividing the square for ( K ) points. To conclude, for ( K > 2 ), the minimum number of triangles needed to divide a square such that there is at most one point in each triangle is ( K+1 ). # Conclusion: Thus, the answers are: 1. For ( K = 1 ), the minimum number of triangles required is (boxed{3}). 2. For ( K > 1 ), the minimum number of triangles required is (boxed{K+1})."},{"instruction":"The relationship between the displacement s(m) and time t(s) of a particle in motion is given by the equation s=t^{2}+10.

The minimum occurs when    frac{2000}{n} = frac{1500}{200-n}.    Solving for n gives n=frac{800}{11}. Since 72 < frac{800}{11} < 73,    d_{72}=b_{72}=frac{250}{9},    and this value is larger than frac{250}{11}.    When k geq 3, d_n geq maxleft{frac{1000}{n}, frac{375}{50-n}right}.

When the rugs are overlapped to cover the floor area, some parts of the rugs are layered over each other.  The area covered by exactly two layers of rug is 24 square meters. This area is counted twice in the total area of the rugs because it is covered by two rugs. The area covered by three layers of rug is 19 square meters. This area is counted three times in the total area of the rugs because it is covered by three rugs. The area covered by one layer of rug is the total floor area minus the areas covered by two and three layers of rug. So, the area covered by one layer of rug is: 138 - 24 - 19 = 95 square meters This area is counted once in the total area of the rugs. Now, to find the total area of the rugs (A), we need to add the area covered by one layer, the area covered by two layers (which we count twice), and the area covered by three layers (which we count three times): A = 95 + (2 * 24) + (3 * 19) A = 95 + 48 + 57 A = 200 square meters So, the combined area of the three rugs is boxed{200}  square meters."},{"instruction":"Given that (i) is the imaginary unit, and the complex number (z= frac {1}{2}+ frac {sqrt {3}}{2}i), its conjugate complex number is (overset{.}{z}), then (overset{.}{z}+|z|=) ______.","output":"Solution: Since the conjugate complex number of (z=- frac {1}{2}+ frac {sqrt {3}}{2}i) is (overset{.}{z}=- frac {1}{2}- frac {sqrt {3}}{2}i),   then (overset{.}{z}+|z|=- frac {1}{2}- frac {sqrt {3}}{2}i+ sqrt {(- frac {1}{2})^{2}+(frac {sqrt {3}}{2})^{2}}= frac {1}{2}- frac {sqrt {3}}{2}i).

(II) Determine the set of real numbers x such that f(x) = 1.","output":"(I) From the shape of the graph of the function f(x) = Asin(omega x + phi), we can determine that: - The amplitude A=2 since the maximum and minimum values are 2 and -2, respectively. - The period T of the function is twice the difference in x-coordinates of the high and low points: frac{T}{2} = frac{5pi}{8} - frac{pi}{8} = frac{pi}{2}, thus T = pi. The angular frequency omega is given by: omega = frac{2pi}{T} = frac{2pi}{pi} = 2. Since left(frac{pi}{8}, 2right) is a point on the graph of the function: 2 = 2sinleft(2 cdot frac{pi}{8} + phiright), this simplifies to: sinleft(frac{pi}{4} + phiright) = 1. From the above equation, we find phi: frac{pi}{4} + phi = frac{pi}{2} + 2kpi, k in mathbb{Z}, which implies: phi = frac{pi}{4} + 2kpi, k in mathbb{Z}. Since |phi| < pi, we conclude that: phi = frac{pi}{4}. Therefore, the expression for the function is: boxed{f(x) = 2sin(2x + frac{pi}{4})}.

Rearrange the fractions to find an expression for frac{PA}{PC}:     [     frac{CP}{PA} = frac{FB}{AF} cdot frac{DC}{BD}     ] 3. Using the fact that D, E, and F are the points of tangency of the incircle with sides BC, CA, and AB respectively, we derive that AF = BF = s - a, BD = CD = s - b, and CE = AE = s - c where s is the semiperimeter of triangle ABC and s = frac{a+b+c}{2}. Thus:     [     frac{DC}{BD} = frac{(s-b)}{(s-c)} quad text{and} quad frac{AF}{FB} = frac{(s-b)}{(s-c)}     ] 4.

Therefore, MA cdot MC = ME^2. Since ME is the length from M to the incircle (internal) and MA cdot MC is the power of point M relative to the circumcircle (external), and because M is on the radical axis of these two circles, this implies that O I perp MN by the Radical Axis Theorem.

Recall that the area ( S ) of a triangle can be expressed in terms of its inradius ( r ) and its semiperimeter ( s ) as:    [    S = r cdot s    ]    where ( s = frac{P}{2} ).

The perimeter ( P ) of a triangle can be expressed in terms of its inradius ( r ) and the cotangents of its angles:    [    P = 2r left( cot frac{alpha_1}{2} + cot frac{alpha_2}{2} + cot frac{alpha_3}{2} right)    ]    and similarly for (triangle EBC):    [    P = 2r left( cot frac{beta_1}{2} + cot frac{beta_2}{2} + cot frac{beta_3}{2} right)    ] 5.

Since (cot(x)) is convex on ((0, frac{pi}{2}]), and given that ((beta_3, beta_2, beta_1) succ (alpha_3, alpha_2, alpha_1)) (where (succ) denotes majorization), we can apply Karamata's inequality.

Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we set:    nabla f = lambda nabla g,    where (lambda) is a constant. The gradient of (g) is:    nabla g = (1, 1, ldots, 1).        For the function (f), the partial derivatives are:    frac{partial f}{partial x_i} = (m-1)^{m-1} cdot m x_i^{m-1} + m^m cdot frac{partial (x_1 x_2 cdots x_m)}{partial x_i}.

For (x_i neq 0), the partial derivative of the product (x_1 x_2 cdots x_m) with respect to (x_i) is:    frac{partial (x_1 x_2 cdots x_m)}{partial x_i} = frac{x_1 x_2 cdots x_m}{x_i}.

Simplifying, we get:    (m-1)^{m-1} cdot frac{1}{m^{m-1}} + 1 = lambda.        This shows that the equality holds when (x_1 = x_2 = cdots = x_m = frac{1}{m}). 3. **Conclusion**:    The inequality holds for all non-negative real numbers (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_m) with (m geq 2), and equality holds when (x_1 = x_2 = cdots = x_m = frac{1}{m}).

Find the angle (BDC).","output":"Part (a) 1. **Identifying the bisectors**:     Since O_1 and O_2 are the centers of the circles inscribed in angle ABC and angle ADC respectively, BO_1 and DO_2 are the angle bisectors of these angles. This is because the center of a circle inscribed in an angle lies on the bisector of the angle. 2. **Using the inscribed quadrilateral property**:     Since quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in a circle, the sum of its opposite angles is 180^circ, i.e.,     [     angle ABC + angle ADC = 180^circ     ]     Therefore, the sum of half these angles, angle KBO_1 and angle TDO_2, is 90^circ. Let angle O_1BK = alpha, then angle TDO_2 = 90^circ - alpha. 3. **Expressing the tangent of the angle**:     By the tangent function in the respective triangles, we have:     [     tan alpha = frac{O_1K}{BK} quad text{and} quad tan alpha = frac{DT}{O_2T}     ]      4. **Finding r**:     Given BK = 3sqrt{3} and DT = sqrt{3}, we can set up the equation:     [     frac{O_1K}{3sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{O_2T}     ]     Since O_1K = O_2T = r (the radii of the equal circles),     [     frac{r}{3sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{r}     ]     Solving for r:     [     r^2 = 9 quad Rightarrow quad r = 3     ] Conclusion for part (a): [ boxed{r = 3} ]  Part (b) 1. **Additional information**:     We are given that the point O_1 is the circumcenter of triangle BOC. 2. **Properties of the circumcenter**:     For triangle BO_1C, since O_1B = O_1C (radii of the circumcircle), O_1K is also a median. Since O_1 is the circumcenter, it also lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC. 3. **Using the right triangle properties**:     Given BK = 3sqrt{3}, O_1K can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:     [     O_1B = sqrt{O_1K^2 + K^2B} = sqrt{r^2 + (3sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{3^2 + 27} = sqrt{36} = 6     ]     Since O_1 is the circumcenter, the radius of the circumcircle is 6. Thus:     [     O_1O = O_1B = 6     ] 4. **Considering the angle bisector theorem**:     The angle angle BDK can be found as follows. Since O_1 lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC, the angle angle BDC must be bisected by O_1. Given that angle ABC = 60^circ and angle ADC = 120^circ (since the arc subtended by the central angle is twice the inscribed angle). 5. **Final angle calculation**:     [     angle BDC = frac{120^circ}{2} = 60^circ     ]     However, to find the exact internal angle, using 30^circ angles subtended by the parts of 60°, the related angle can be determined as:     [     angle BDC = 30^circ     ] Conclusion for part (b): [ boxed{angle BDC = 30^circ} ]"},{"instruction":"Let ( S_{k}=xi_{1}+ldots+xi_{k}, k leqslant 2n ), where ( xi_{1}, ldots, xi_{2n} ) are i.i.d. random variables with ( mathrm{P}{xi_{1}=1}=mathrm{P}{xi_{1}=1}=frac{1}{2} ).

To restate:    [    angle BOM = 2 angle BAC quad text{and} quad angle BO_1M = 2 angle BCA    ] 4. **Constant Angle Properties**:    The angles angle BOM and angle BO_1M remain constant regardless of the position of M along AC.  5. **Minimizing the Area**:    The task is to minimize the combined area of the circular segments defined by chord BM.  6. **Chords and Segment Areas**:    The area of each segment decreases as the length of the chord BM decreases. Hence, to minimize the area, the chord BM needs to be as short as possible. 7. **Optimal Position of M**:    For chord BM to be minimized, M should lie at such a position where BM is the shortest possible.

For each of the nine 3 times 3 squares, the sum of the nine numbers on its cells is computed. Denote by ( A ) the maximum of these sums. How large can the first player make ( A ), regardless of the responses of the second player?","output":"1. **Introduction and Game Setup**:    Let's define the two players as ( M ) (first player, who marks 1's) and ( N ) (second player, who marks 0's). The game is played on a ( 5 times 5 ) board where players take turns marking cells, with ( M ) starting first. Our goal is to determine how large ( A ) (the maximum sum of any ( 3 times 3 ) sub-square) can be made by player ( M ), regardless of the responses from player ( N ). 2. **Construction by ( N ) to Minimize ( A )**:    To investigate how ( N ) can prevent ( A ) from getting too large, we use the strategy of placing dominoes. A domino here refers to two adjacent cells.    - **Domino Placement**:      Consider placing 10 dominoes on the ( 5 times 5 ) board such that they cover the board completely. Here is one possible configuration:            [      begin{array}{ccccc}      1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0       0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0       1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0       0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0       0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1       end{array}      ]            Each domino covers a pair of cells.    - **Strategy of ( N )**:      Whenever ( M ) marks a 1 in a cell of a domino, ( N ) should immediately mark a 0 in the other cell of that domino, if it is still empty. 3. **Bounding the Sum by ( N )**:    - Since any ( 3 times 3 ) sub-square must contain at least three such dominoes (regardless of the placement), there will be at least three 0's in each ( 3 times 3 ) sub-square.    - This ensures that the sum in any ( 3 times 3 ) sub-square cannot exceed ( 6 ) (since at least three cells will be 0's, leaving at most six cells that can be 1's).    Hence, ( N ) can keep the maximum sum ( A ) in any ( 3 times 3 ) sub-square to be at most ( 6 ). 4. **Strategy by ( M ) to Achieve ( A = 6 )**:    - Suppose ( M ) starts by marking 1 in the center cell, say ( c3 ).    - We explore ( N )'s responses and how ( M ) can adapt:      - If ( N ) marks a 0 in any cell in row 4 or 5, then ( M ) can continue marking 1's in adjacent cells in row 3 and so on.      - Specifically, if ( N ) marks 0 in ( c1 ), then the next moves by ( M ) would be strategically placed in columns 1, 2, and 3 to ensure six 1's will eventually fill one or more of the ( 3 times 3 ) sub-squares ( {a, b, c} times {1, 2, 3} ) or ( {b, c, d} times {1, 2, 3} ).    Here is an example move-sequence:        - ( M ): c3 (1)    - ( N ): d3 (0)    - ( M ): c2 (1)    - ( N ): e2 (0)    - ( M ): c1 (1)    - ( N ): e1 (0)    - ( M ): b3 (1)    - ( N ): d2 (0)    - ( M ): b2 (1)    Through this strategy, ( M ) ensures at least one ( 3 times 3 ) sub-square has exactly six 1's. 5. **Conclusion**:    By carefully analyzing both players' strategies, we determine that while ( N ) can ensure that ( A leq 6 ), ( M ) can indeed achieve ( A = 6 ) through optimal play, regardless of ( N )'s moves.

First, we calculate the mean of x (on-time flight rates) and y (passenger complaints): - overline{x} = frac{80 + 78 + 81 + 84 + 86 + 90 + 91 + 93 + 88 + 89}{10} = 86 - overline{y} = frac{26 + 33 + 24 + 20 + 18 + 10 + 9 + 7 + 12 + 11}{10} = 17 Next, we calculate the numerator of r, which is sum_{i=1}^{10}{(x_{i}-overline{x})(y_{i}-overline{y})}: - sum_{i=1}^{10}{(x_{i}-overline{x})(y_{i}-overline{y})} = (-6)×9 + (-8)×16 + (-5)×7 + (-2)×3 + 0×1 + 4×(-7) + 5×(-8) + 7×(-10) + 2×(-5) + 3×(-6) = -389 Then, we calculate the denominator of r, which involves sum_{i=1}^{10}{(x_{i}-overline{x})^2} and sum_{i=1}^{10}{(y_{i}-overline{y})^2}: - sum_{i=1}^{10}{(x_{i}-overline{x})^2} = (-6)^2 + (-8)^2 + (-5)^2 + (-2)^2 + 0^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 232 - sum_{i=1}^{10}{(y_{i}-overline{y})^2} = 9^2 + 16^2 + 7^2 + 3^2 + 1^2 + (-7)^2 + (-8)^2 + (-10)^2 + (-5)^2 + (-6)^2 = 670 Finally, we calculate r: - r = frac{sum_{i=1}^{10}{(x_{i}-overline{x})(y_{i}-overline{y})}}{sqrt{sum_{i=1}^{10}{(x_{i}-overline{x})^2}sum_{i=1}^{10}{(y_{i}-overline{y})^2}}} = frac{-389}{sqrt{232 times 670}} approx frac{-389}{394.3} approx -0.987 Since |r| > 0.85, we conclude that passenger complaint numbers and on-time flight rates are negatively correlated and exhibit a strong linear relationship. Therefore, the degree of correlation between them is boxed{-0.987}, indicating a strong negative linear relationship."},{"instruction":"the circle, M is the midpoint of arc CAB and segment MP intersects chord AB at P such that AP = 2PB.

Therefore, we have two inequalities based on the coordinates of point A: 1. For the x-coordinate, 7-2m < 0. 2. For the y-coordinate, 5-m > 0. Let's solve these inequalities step by step: 1. Solving the inequality for the x-coordinate: [7 - 2m < 0] Subtracting 7 from both sides: [-2m < -7] Dividing by -2 (remembering that this reverses the inequality): [m > frac{7}{2}] 2. Solving the inequality for the y-coordinate: [5 - m > 0] Subtracting 5 from both sides: [-m > -5] Multiplying by -1 (which reverses the inequality): [m < 5] Combining these results, we find that m must satisfy: [frac{7}{2} < m < 5] Since m is an integer, the only value that satisfies this inequality is m = 4. Substituting m = 4 into the coordinates of point A: For the x-coordinate: [7 - 2m = 7 - 2 times 4 = 7 - 8 = -1] For the y-coordinate: [5 - m = 5 - 4 = 1] Therefore, the coordinates of point A are (-1, 1).

So, the discounted price of the hat is 15 - 9 = 6. Now, let's calculate the total cost for one person to buy both a t-shirt and a hat: 12 (t-shirt) + 6 (hat) = 18.

The point P is an interior point of triangle ABC, and the points L, M, N are the pedal points of P with respect to BC, CA, and AB respectively. The point G is the midpoint of the segment AP. Prove that the points D, E, F, G are concyclic if and only if the points A, L, M, N are concyclic.  1. **Assuming the points A, L, M, N are concyclic:**    We need to prove that D, E, F, G are concyclic.     2. **Identify midpoint pedantic points:**        Take the midpoints of BC, CA, and AB as U, V, and W respectively. Since P is the intersection of chords AL, BM, CN, connect GU, GV, and GW.     3. **Use cyclic property of nine-point circle:**        Points D, E, F, U, V, W are on the nine-point circle of triangle ABC. So, it suffices to prove that G also lies on this circle.     4. **Establishing parallel relationships:**        Based on the midpoint theorem, PG parallel BE and VG parallel CF, which implies the cyclic angles relationship. Therefore,        [    angle WGV = angle BPC    ]        Also, given the properties of pedal points and cyclic quadrilateral, we have    [    angle BWG + angle BPC = angle BAC    ] 5. **Angle relationships:**        Given that L, M, N are pedal points, we find that they divide each angle in triangle ABC. Therefore,        [    angle NAM = 2 cdot angle BAC    ]        Since points A, L, M, N are concyclic, the opposite angles sum to 180^circ. Thus,        [    angle NLM = 180^circ - 2 cdot angle BAC    ] 6. **Connect important lines and perpendicular relationships:**        By extending these relationships to the perpendiculars and cyclic points:        [    angle PBC + angle PCB = 180^circ - angle BAC    ] 7. **Consolidate the cyclic recognition:**    Finally, recognize that D, E, F, G are concyclic because:    [    angle WGV + angle WUV = 180^circ    ]        by the corresponding cyclic properties, yielding:    [    boxed{text{Thus, D, E, F, G are concyclic if the points A, L, M, N are concyclic.}}    ] # Conclusion: To affirm the necessary and sufficient conditions for concyclic points in triangle ABC, the step-by-step alignment of midpoint theorems, cyclic quadrilaterals, perpendicular relationships, and corresponding angles are determinant.

One sphere is at the center of the cube, and each of the other eight spheres is tangent to this central sphere and to three faces of the cube. 2. **Defining the Geometry**: Let r be the radius of each sphere. The center sphere's center, C, coincides with the center of the cube. Consider one of the outer spheres and let P be its center. Since each outer sphere is tangent to the center sphere and has its center on the surface of the cube, the distance PC (from the center of the cube to the center of an outer sphere) is equal to twice the radius, i.e., PC = 2r. 3. **Cube Geometry and Sphere Arrangement**: Each outer sphere is tangent to three faces of the cube. This means that the center of each outer sphere, P, is at a distance r from each of the three faces it is tangent to. Since the cube is a unit cube, each side has a length of 1. 4. **Calculating the Space Diagonal**: The space diagonal of the smaller cube formed by the centers of the spheres (including the center sphere and one of the corner spheres) can be calculated. The length of this diagonal is the distance from the center of the cube to a corner of the cube minus the radius of the two spheres (one at the center and one at the corner), which is 1 - 2r for each dimension. Therefore, the space diagonal of this smaller cube is sqrt{(1-2r)^2 + (1-2r)^2 + (1-2r)^2} = sqrt{3(1-2r)^2}. 5. **Equating Diagonals**: The space diagonal of the unit cube itself is sqrt{3} (since the cube has side length 1).

The player who cannot make a move loses the game.  We claim that the starting player (Player 1) has a winning strategy. We need to identify that strategy explicitly. # Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Player 1’s Initial Move:**     Player 1 can start by writing the number **6** on the board.      2. **Analyzing Remaining Numbers:**     After Player 1 writes 6, we need to analyze the remaining available numbers and their pairings.          - Divisors of 6 (i.e., 1, 2, 3): these cannot be used anymore.     - Remaining numbers: {4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10}.

Regardless of Player 2's choice, Player 1 can always respond with the other number of the same pair, thus:          - If Player 2 writes down 4, then Player 1 writes down 5.     - If Player 2 writes down 5, then Player 1 writes down 4.     - If Player 2 writes down 7, then Player 1 writes down 8.     - If Player 2 writes down 8, then Player 1 writes down 7.     - If Player 2 writes down 9, then Player 1 writes down 10.     - If Player 2 writes down 10, then Player 1 writes down 9. Since Player 1 can always \\"mirror\\" Player 2 by covering both elements of any pair, Player 2 will run out of moves first and lose the game. **Conclusion:** The first player (Player 1) has the winning strategy by starting with the number 6 and ensuring to cover complementary pairs: [ boxed{text{First player wins}} ]  Part (b): Determining the Winning Strategy for p = 1000 To determine the strategy for a larger p = 1000, consider the rules and strategy for sufficiently large p like 1000: 1. **Winning Strategy Insight**:     If the first player (Player 1) writes a number such as 1, they remove the scenario of trivial divisors and use a similar pairing strategy to ensure that they always claim numbers in a controlled manner. 2. **Generalization and Reduction**:     Consider a reduced game where the rules remain the same but numbers are paired such that the second player always faces a disadvantage by always following the move with limited options.          Player 1 can start with 1 if no immediate strategy is available and then proceed to cover all possible moves by the second player by ensuring every move they make still maintains paired number strategy and mirroring. 3. **Postulating the First Move Advantage**:     If the winning strategy of smaller games can be extended, then Player 1 makes the first move of selecting number 1 (ensuring simple strategies are invalidated), and proceeds similar to dynamically creating pairs. **Conclusion:**  Given the general pattern observed from extending it from a simpler case with prime methods and strategies maintaining first move, Player 1, having the first move, can have the winning strategy: [ boxed{text{First player wins}} ]"},{"instruction":"a school, there are 30 students who are enrolled in at least one of the offered foreign language classes: German or Italian.

If the last digit of ( n ) is not 9, the digit sum of ( n ) increases by 1, changing the parity (even-to-odd or odd-to-even). Hence, we only need to consider the cases where ( n ) ends with one or more 9s. 2. If ( n ) ends in ( k ) nines, and the previous digit (from the right) is not 9, ( n + 1 ) will result in the last ( k ) digits becoming zero, and the ( (k+1) )-th digit increases by 1.  Step 2: Even Digit Sum Condition The digit sum changes from ( n ) to ( n+1 ) as: ( text{sum}(n+1) = text{sum}(n) - 9k + 1 ).   For the sums of both ( n ) and ( n+1 ) to be even: [ -9k + 1 text{ must be even.} ] [ -9k + 1 equiv 0 pmod{2} ] [ 9k equiv 1 pmod{2} ] Since ( 9 equiv 1 pmod{2} Rightarrow k equiv 1 pmod{2} ] Hence, ( k ) must be odd. # Calculation for ( n < 10^6 ):  Case: ( k = 5 ) If ( k = 5 ), ( n ) has the form ( A99999 ): - The digit sums as ( text{sum}(n) = A + 5 cdot 9 ). - For this to be even, ( A ) must be odd. - ( A ) can be ( 1, 3, 5, ) or ( 7 ). Thus, there are ( 4 ) numbers in this case.  Case: ( k = 3 ) If ( k = 3 ), ( n ) has the form ( ABC999 ): [ text{sum}(n) = A + B + C + 3 cdot 9 ] For this to be even, ( A + B + C ) must be odd. - ( C ) can be ( 0, 1, ldots, 8 ) (9 choices). - ( B ) can be ( 0, 1, ldots, 9 ) (10 choices). - For each combination of ( B ) and ( C ), ( A ) has 5 choices to make the sum odd. Thus, there are: [ 5 cdot 10 cdot 9 = 450 ] numbers in this case.  Case: ( k = 1 ) If ( k = 1 ), ( n ) has the form ( ABCDE9 ) [ text{sum}(n) = A + B + C + D + E + 9 ] For this to be even, ( A + B + C + D + E ) must be odd. - ( E ) can be ( 0, 1, ldots, 8 ) (9 choices). - ( D, C, B ) each have ( 10 ) choices. - ( A ) has 5 choices to make the sum odd. Thus, there are: [ 5 cdot 10^3 cdot 9 = 45000 ] numbers in this case.

Considering that the tangent is negative and it is positive only in the third quadrant, we can conclude that α must be in the second quadrant, which means cos α < 0. The angle (π - α) is the supplementary angle of α. The cosine of a supplementary angle equals the negative of the cosine of the original angle: cos(π - α) = -cos α.  To find the value of cos α, we can use the identity 1 + tan^2 α = sec^2 α, or equivalently, cos^2 α = frac{1}{1 + tan^2 α}. Plugging in the value for tan α, we get: cos^2 α = frac{1}{1 + left(-frac{12}{5}right)^2} = frac{1}{1 + frac{144}{25}} = frac{1}{frac{169}{25}} = frac{25}{169} Since cos α < 0, we have cos α = -sqrt{frac{25}{169}} = -frac{5}{13}.

Thus, we have: - u'=e^{x} (since the derivative of e^{x} is e^{x}), - v'=1 (since the derivative of x-2 is 1). Therefore, {f'}left(xright)=e^{x}cdot 1 + e^{x}cdot (x-2)' = e^{x}(1) + e^{x}(x-2)' = e^{x}(x-1). - To find {f'}left(0right), we substitute x=0 into {f'}left(xright):   {f'}left(0right)=e^{0}(0-1) = 1cdot (-1) = -1. - To find {f'}left(-1right), we substitute x=-1 into {f'}left(xright):   {f'}left(-1right)=e^{-1}(-1-1) = frac{1}{e}cdot (-2) = -frac{2}{e}.

Prove that each of them can be rearranged in such a way that if you add the numbers standing one under the other, the result will again be a segment of the natural sequence.","output":"Here is the detailed and fully expanded solution to the given problem.  The problem involves two sequences, each consisting of 1961 natural numbers, positioned one below another. We need to show that it is possible to rearrange the numbers in each sequence such that, when adding the numbers that are placed one above the other, the result is another sequence of 1961 consecutive natural numbers.  1. Understand the Problem: We are given: - Two sequences S_1 and S_2, each containing 1961 natural numbers. - The task is to rearrange these sequences so that the sum of each pair of corresponding elements from the two sequences forms a new sequence of 1961 consecutive natural numbers.  2. Define the Sequences: Let: - S_1 = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{1961}} - S_2 = {b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{1961}}  3. Condition for Consecutive Numbers: To achieve this, the resulting sums {c_1, c_2, ldots, c_{1961}} where c_i = a_i + b_i (after rearrangement) must form a sequence of 1961 consecutive natural numbers.  Let’s denote the smallest element of the target consecutive sequence by m. Thus, the required sequence is {m, m+1, ldots, m+1960}.  4. Understanding Rearrangement: Rearranging sequences S_1 and S_2 individually, we aim for: [ c_i = a_{sigma(i)} + b_{tau(i)} = m + (i-1) quad text{for all } i. ] where sigma(i) and tau(i) are permutations of the indices that rearrange S_1 and S_2 respectively.  5. Applying the Rearrangement: To meet the requirement, we can utilize rearrangement such that: - The smallest element of S_1 is paired with the largest element of S_2. - The second smallest element of S_1 is paired with the second largest element of S_2, and so on. Formally: - Let S_1 be sorted in ascending order: {a_1 leq a_2 leq cdots leq a_{1961}}. - Let S_2 be sorted in descending order: {b_1 geq b_2 geq cdots geq b_{1961}}. Assign the pairs such that: [ c_i = a_i + b_i = m + (i-1). ]  6. Confirm the Condition: Now confirm if such a pairing will produce correct consecutive sums.  Define: - A = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{1961}} as sorted version of S_1, - B = {b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{1961}} as reverse sorted version of S_2. By construction of the sums, one can confirm that the pairs {a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, ldots, a_{1961} + b_{1961}} can be consecutively increasing.

By the Pigeonhole Principle, since we have ( 2n ) numbers within the interval but only ( 2n-1 ) distinct values, at least two of these numbers must be equal. 3. Since ( a_i neq n ), we know ( a_i neq 2n - a_i ) for all ( i = 1, 2, cdots, n ). Therefore, there must exist indices ( i ) and ( j ) such that ( a_i = 2n - a_j ).

We need to show that all cycles, except the fixed points, have the same length.  2. **Discard Fixed Points:**    First, discard the fixed points of ( f(x) ). We will then consider the remaining cycles. Let r be the length of the smallest cycle among these remaining cycles. 3. **Properties of Cycles Regarding f_r(x):**    The points in a cycle of length ( r ) remain fixed for the function ( f_{r}(x) ). This characteristic follows directly from the properties of periodic functions. Here's the reasoning:    - Given any cycle of length ( r ), the function f applied ( r ) times (i.e., ( f_{r}(x) )) must leave the points of this cycle fixed.    - According to a related problem (Problem 149), if ( f_{r}(x) ) fixes all points in a cycle, it must fix all points of shorter or equal length cycles too. 4. **Cycles of Different Lengths ( s ):**    Now, consider any other cycle with length ( s ). According to Problem 148, since ( f_{r}(x) ) keeps its points fixed, ( r ) must be a divisor of ( s ). The steps can be detailed as:    - Choose any cycle of length ( s ).     - Apply ( f ) ( r ) times, i.e., consider ( f_{r}(x) ). As we’ve established, ( f_{r}(x) ) fixes the points of the cycle.    - Since ( f_{r}(x) ) fixes every point of the ( s )-cycle, ( r ) must divide ( s ). 5. **Equality of Cycle Lengths:**    Given that ( r ) is the length of the smallest cycle and that any cycle length ( s ) must be such that ( r ) divides ( s ) while maintaining ( r leq s ), we conclude that ( r = s ). Hence, all cycles (besides the fixed points) must have the same length ( r ). **Conclusion:**  Since every cycle of the function ( f(x) ) has the same length ( r ), we have demonstrated the required property: [ boxed{r} ]"},{"instruction":"The ages of Mr. and Mrs. Fibonacci are both twodigit numbers.

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of inversion. 1. **Understanding Inversion:** Inversion is a geometric transformation where points are mapped to new locations based on a fixed circle (called the inversion circle). For a point A, the inversion of another point P with respect to a circle of center A and radius r is defined such that the product of the distances from A to P and its inverse P' is equal to ( r^2 ). 2. **Given Circle and Inversion:** We need to perform an inversion centered at the given point ( A ). Denote the two given circles by ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ). The result of this inversion will transform these circles into new figures, which we denote as ( S_1^* ) and ( S_2^* ). 3. **Transforming the Circles:** Under inversion, the given circles ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) will transform:    - If the circle passes through the center of inversion, it transforms into a line.    - If the circle does not pass through the center of inversion, it will transform into another circle.        Because the problem specifies that we construct a circle perpendicular to the given circles, under inversion, these result in specific conditions for the circles and the straight lines formed. 4. **Line Intersection Post Inversion:** Suppose our original circles ( S1 ) and ( S2 ) transform into circles or lines ( S1^* ) and ( S2^* ) under the inversion centered at ( A ). If these transformations are lines, the goal is to draw a circle that intersects these lines perpendicularly. 5. **Drawing the Circle in the Inverse Plane:** The required circle in the original plane is a line (which is perpendicular to the images of ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) under inversion and connects their centers). In the transformed plane, these lines (S_1^*) and (S_2^*) intersect. The circle in the inverse plane must pass through the intersection points created by connecting the centers of inversion transformed circles or lines. 6. **Returning to the Original Plane:** Transforming this back under inverse transformation, the line that intersects perpendicularly with the transformed objects becomes a circle that is tangent at right angles to the original circles ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ).

We seek the smallest three-digit number ( n ) such that this sum is invariant for ( n, 2n, 3n, ldots, n^2 ), i.e., ( Sigma(n) = Sigma(2n) = Sigma(3n) = ldots = Sigma(n^2) ). 2. Let ( n ) be a three-digit number, represented as ( n = overline{abc} ), where ( a, b, ) and ( c ) are its digits. 3. Since ( n ) is three digits, the smallest possible value it can take is 100. However, we quickly identify that 100 doesn’t satisfy our conditions because (  Sigma(100) = 1 ), but ( Sigma(200) = 2 ), etc. So, ( n ) must be greater than 100. 4. Let’s now examine the nature of a three-digit number ( n ) when multiplied by any integer ( k ). Specifically, for ( n cdot k ) to have a consistent sum of digits:         [     n cdot k = overline{d_1 d_2 ldots d_m}     ]        the sum of digits of ( overline{abc} cdot k ) must equal ( Sigma(overline{abc}) ) for all ( k ). 5.

In this case, 4.5 is exactly 0.5, so we round up. Therefore, the number of crayons increases by 5 (rounding 4.5 up to the nearest whole number). 5. Adding this increase to the current number of crayons, we get 45 + 5 = 50 crayons.

We know that overrightarrow{EB} and overrightarrow{EA} are vectors that point in opposite directions, and since E is the midpoint of AB, their magnitudes are equal but they have opposite directions. This implies that when we take the dot product of overrightarrow{EB} and overrightarrow{EA}, we get -1 because the vectors are of equal magnitude, point in exactly opposite directions, and the dot product of two vectors vec{a} and vec{b} is given by vec{a}cdotvec{b} = |vec{a}||vec{b}|costheta, where theta is the angle between the vectors. Since theta = 180^circ for opposite vectors, costheta = cos180^circ = -1. Moreover, since overrightarrow{EB}perpoverrightarrow{AD} and overrightarrow{EA}perpoverrightarrow{BC}, the dot products overrightarrow{EB}cdotoverrightarrow{AD} and overrightarrow{EA}cdotoverrightarrow{BC} are both 0 because the cosine of 90^circ is 0, and the dot product of perpendicular vectors is 0. Given that overrightarrow{BC} and overrightarrow{AD} are parallel and have the same magnitude (the side length of the square, which is 2), their dot product is 2times 2 = 4 because the angle between them is 0^circ, making cos0^circ = 1.

Knowing that A + B + C = 180^circ, we have: [ sin(B + C) = sin A ] 6. Therefore: [ sin A = 2 sin A cos B implies 1 = 2 cos B ] 7. Solving for cos B: [ cos B = frac{1}{2} ] 8. Since 0 < B < pi, then: [ B = frac{pi}{3} ] 9. Using the circumradius formula and the given R = sqrt{3}, we find b: [ b = 2R sin B = 2sqrt{3} sinleft(frac{pi}{3}right) = 2sqrt{3} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 3 ]  Part 2: Finding the maximum area S_{triangle ABC} 1. The Law of Cosines tells us: [ b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac cos B ] 2. Substitute B = frac{pi}{3}: [ 3^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac cos left(frac{pi}{3}right) ] 3. Since cosleft(frac{pi}{3}right) = frac{1}{2}, we have: [ 9 = a^2 + c^2 - ac ] 4. Rearrange and simplify: [ 9 geq a^2 + c^2 - ac = (a - frac{c}{2})^2 + frac{3c^2}{4} ] 5. By the inequality, we get: [ a c leq 9 ] 6. The area S of triangle ABC is: [ S = frac{1}{2}ac sin B ] 7. Substitute B = frac{pi}{3} and use sin frac{pi}{3} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}: [ S leq frac{1}{2} cdot 9 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{9sqrt{3}}{4} ] 8.

Given: Cost Price (CP) = Rs. 540 Selling Price (SP) = Rs. 460 Discount Percentage = 25.93% First, we need to find the marked price (MP) using the discount percentage and the selling price. The discount is given on the marked price, and the selling price is the result of subtracting the discount from the marked price. Let's calculate the discount amount first: Discount Amount = (Discount Percentage / 100) * MP Since the selling price is the marked price minus the discount amount, we can write: SP = MP - Discount Amount SP = MP - (Discount Percentage / 100) * MP SP = MP * (1 - Discount Percentage / 100) Now, we can plug in the values we know (SP and Discount Percentage) to find MP: 460 = MP * (1 - 25.93 / 100) 460 = MP * (1 - 0.2593) 460 = MP * 0.7407 Now, we solve for MP: MP = 460 / 0.7407 MP ≈ 620.97 Now that we have the marked price, we can find the marked percentage above the cost price (P%): MP = CP + (P% / 100) * CP 620.97 = 540 + (P% / 100) * 540 Now, we solve for P%: 620.97 = 540 + 5.4 * P% 620.97 - 540 = 5.4 * P% 80.97 = 5.4 * P% P% = 80.97 / 5.4 P% ≈ 14.9944 Therefore, the marked percentage above the cost price is approximately boxed{14.99%} ."},{"instruction":"Find the maximum value of [ sin (theta_1  theta_2) + sin (theta_2  theta_3) + sin (theta_3  theta_4) + sin (theta_4  theta_5) + sin (theta_5  theta_1), ] over all real numbers theta_1, theta_2, theta_3, theta_4, and theta_5.","output":"From the sum-to-product identities, sin x - sin y = 2 cosleft(frac{x + y}{2}right) sinleft(frac{x - y}{2}right).

In the first triangle, the longer leg has a length of 1, and the shorter leg has a length of ( t ). In the second triangle, the lengths of the legs are ( 2t ) and ( 1-t^2 ). We need to show that the angle opposite the side of length ( 2t ) in the second triangle is twice the smallest angle in the first triangle.  I. Proof 1. Draw the first right-angled triangle ( triangle ABC ) with ( AC = t ) and ( BC = 1 ). 2. Measure ( BD = 1-t^2 ) on ( BC ), and raise a perpendicular to ( BC ) through point ( D ) on the side containing ( A ), such that ( DE = 2t ). 3. We need to prove that ( angle EBD = 2 angle ABC ). This would be true if the line ( AB ) bisects ( angle EBD ), indicating that ( AB ) is the angle bisector. 4. Denote the intersection of the line ( EA ) and ( BD ) as ( F ).  5. Notice that ( AC ) is the midline of ( triangle FED ), since it is parallel to ( ED ) and half its length. To verify, if ( A ) and ( C ) were closer to or farther from ( F ) than the respective midpoint, their connecting line would be shorter or longer than half of ( ED ). 6. Conclude that ( EA = AF ), and ( FC = CD = BC - DB = 1 - (1 - t^2) = t^2 ). 7. Observe that triangles ( triangle FAC ) and ( triangle ABC ) are similar because both are right-angled at ( C ) and have equal leg ratios:        frac{AC}{FC} = frac{t}{t^2} = frac{1}{t} = frac{BC}{AC}.        Since corresponding sides are proportional, and their corresponding angles are similar, it follows that ( FA perp AB ). 8. Hence, ( AB ) bisects ( EF ) and is perpendicular to it, making ( AB ) the axis of symmetry for ( triangle EBF ). So, ( angle EBF ) equals ( angle ABD ), thus ( angle EBD = 2 angle ABC ). This proves our claim.  II. Alternative Proof 1. Draw ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle EBD ) as per the previous construction. 2. Let a line through ( A ) parallel to ( BC ) intersect ( BE ) and ( DE ) at points ( G ) and ( H ), respectively. Then ( GH ) is the midline of ( triangle BDE ) because ( DH = CA = t = frac{1}{2}DE ), with ( GH parallel BD ). 3. By Pythagoras' theorem:        BG = frac{1}{2} BE = frac{1}{2} sqrt{BD^2 + DE^2} = frac{1}{2} sqrt{(1-t^2)^2 + 4t^2} = frac{1+t^2}{2},        and also,        GA = GH + HA = frac{BD}{2} + DC = frac{1-t^2}{2} + (1 - (1-t^2)) = frac{1+t^2}{2}.     4. Consequently, ( triangle ABG ) is isosceles. As ( GA parallel BC ), we have:        angle EBA = angle GBA = angle GAB = angle ABD,        thus ( angle EBD = 2 angle ABD ).  III. Another Alternative Proof 1. Draw the same triangles as in the previous solutions. Let ( M ) be the intersection of lines ( AB ) and ( DE ). 2. It is enough to show that ( M ) divides ( DE ) in the same ratio as the angle bisector, since a point ( P ) moving along ( DE ) keeps the ratio ( frac{DP}{PE} ) monotonically increasing.  3. Knowing that the angle bisector divides ( DE ) in the ratio of the lengths ( BD ) and ( BE ):        BE = sqrt{BD^2 + DE^2} = sqrt{(1-t^2)^2 + (2t)^2} = 1 + t^2,        the required division ratio is ( frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2} ). 4. By similarity of triangles ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle MBD ):        frac{MD}{BD} = frac{AC}{BC}, quad MD = frac{AC cdot BD}{BC} = t(1-t^2),        and we get:        frac{DM}{ME} = frac{t(1-t^2)}{2t - t(1-t^2)} = frac{t(1-t^2)}{t(1+t^2)} = frac{BD}{BE}.        5. Therefore, ( M ) divides ( DE ) in the ratio of ( BD ) and ( BE ), making ( BM ) the angle bisector, and confirming that ( angle EBD = 2 angle ABC ).

Given the equation y = -5x + 3, we identify two key components: - The slope (k) is -5, which is less than 0 (k = -5 < 0). - The y-intercept (b) is 3, which is greater than 0 (b = 3 > 0). The negative slope indicates that the line is decreasing as x increases, which means the line will pass through the quadrants where x and y can have both positive and negative values, but starting from a positive y-intercept. 1. Since b > 0, the line starts in the positive y region, indicating it passes through Quadrant I or II initially. 2. The negative slope (k < 0) means as x increases (moves right), y decreases, crossing from the positive y area to the negative y area, which leads the line to pass through Quadrant IV eventually. Combining these observations, the line passes through: - Quadrant I, because it starts with y > 0 and x > 0. - Quadrant II, as x becomes negative while y is still positive due to the positive y-intercept. - Quadrant IV, because as x increases further, y becomes negative, crossing the x-axis from Quadrant I directly to Quadrant IV.

Given that for each real number ( x ), ( f(x) ) is the square of an integer if and only if ( g(x) ) is also the square of an integer. 2. **Behavior of polynomials at large ( x ):**    Since ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) are polynomials, their leading terms dominate as ( x ) becomes large. Specifically, ( f(x) approx x^m ) and ( g(x) approx x^n ) for large ( x ). Both polynomials will eventually be positive and increasing if ( m ) and ( n ) are even, or if the leading coefficients are positive. 3. **Identify points where ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) are squares of integers:**    Let ( r ) be a point after which ( f(x) ) is increasing and positive, and similarly, let ( s ) be a point after which ( g(x) ) is increasing and positive.

Find an infinite set of numbers n for which some player ends up with all n pennies.","output":"We start by exploring the odd and even cases separately. # Case 1: Even Number of Players Let the number of players ( n ) be given by [  n = 2m(2r + 1) + 2  ] where ( m geq 1 ) and ( r geq 0 ).  Step 1: First Round Configuration Define a round as a set of moves where each remaining player plays once, starting with the lowest numbered remaining player (also referred to as the low player). In the first round, player 1 will pass a penny to player 2 and leave. So, the configuration is: [ (2, 1, 1, ldots, 1) ] After the first round, the low player has either 3 or 4 coins, and each other player has 2 coins: [  (text{low player: } 3 , text{or} , 4, , text{others: } 2 , text{each}) ]  Step 2: kth Eliminating Round An eliminating round is defined as a round where at least one player leaves. For the ( k^{text{th}} ) eliminating round (where ( k leq m )): 1. The ( k^{text{th}} ) eliminating round leaves ( 2m-k(2r + 1) ) players. 2. The low player has ( 2^k + 2 ) coins. 3. Each of the other remaining players has ( 2^k ) coins, with the low player about to pass 1 coin. Using induction: - **Base Case (k = 1):**   - Verified easily.  - **Inductive Step:**   Assume it holds for ( k-1 ). If the number of players is even, then:   - Each player in even positions loses a coin every round since they pass 2 coins and receive 1 coin.   - Each player in odd positions (including the low player) gains a coin each round, a total gain of ( 2^k ). Hence, after ( m ) eliminating rounds: [ text{Remaining players: } (2r + 1), text{ Low player: } 2^m + 2 text{ coins, others: } 2^m text{ coins each.} ] If ( r = 0 ), the game terminates: [ boxed{2m + 2} ] If ( r neq 0 ), the game cycles indefinitely. # Case 2: Odd Number of Players Let the number of players ( n ) be given by [  n = 2m(2r + 1) + 1  ] where ( m geq 1 ) and ( r geq 0 ).  Step 1: First Round Configuration We modify our definition of a round to end one play earlier, where the highest numbered player (high player) does not play initially. Hence we start with: [ (2, 0, 1, ldots, 1, 2) ]  Step 2: kth Eliminating Round For the ( k^{text{th}} ) eliminating round similar reasoning applies: 1. Leaves ( 2m-k(2r + 1) ) players. 2. The high player has ( 2^k + 1 ) coins (and is about to pass 1 coin). 3. Each of the other remaining players has ( 2^k ) coins.

Since the graph of y=f(x-1) is symmetric about the point (1,0), the graph of y=f(x) is symmetric about the point (0,0) after shifting it to the right by one unit. Therefore, the function f(x) is odd, which implies for any x: f(-x) = -f(x). To find f(2015), we look at its relation to the period of f(x). Since the period is 12, we can rewrite 2015 in the following form:  2015 = 167 times 12 + 11. Using the periodicity, we can then find f(2015) by evaluating f(11): f(2015) = f(167 times 12 + 11) = f(11). Now consider the symmetry and the fact that f(x) is odd: f(11) = f(11-12) = f(-1) = -f(1).
