(b). eat at McDonalds. (c). get into an accident. Q: I heard that Austin drove his car on the highway for the first time in years after the accident. And I was wondering What does Austin need to do before driving again? A:","output":"It is essential for Austin to go through a thorough preparation process before getting back on the road, especially after being in an accident and having not driven on the highway for years. Here are some key steps that Austin needs to take before driving again: 1. Medical evaluation: First and foremost, Austin should consult with his healthcare provider to get an overall assessment of his physical and emotional well-being. This will help determine if he is medically cleared and ready to get behind the wheel again. If necessary, healthcare providers may recommend medical treatment, therapy, or rehabilitation programs to provide additional support. 2. Revisit Driver's Education: It may be very helpful for Austin to either revisit his initial driver's education materials or take a refresher course in driving. Reacquainting himself with traffic laws, driving etiquette, and safety measures will build confidence and ensure he is up-to-date on any changes in road regulations. 3. Practice Defensive Driving Techniques: Austin should familiarize himself with defensive driving techniques, which proactively help drivers anticipate potential dangers, manage risks, and avoid accidents. Learning these techniques will provide Austin with effective strategies for navigating difficult driving situations in a safe and responsible manner. 4. Evaluate Vehicle Safety: Ensuring that the vehicle Austin plans to drive is in proper working order and safe to operate is crucial. A thorough inspection of the vehicle should be conducted, including checking for issues like tire pressure, working lights, properly functioning brakes, and any potential mechanical problems. 5. Gradual Exposure: Austin should start by driving in low-stress environments, such as quiet residential streets and empty parking lots, before gradually moving to busier roads and highways. This will help him become increasingly comfortable with driving and build confidence in his abilities. 6. Consult Professional Support: If needed, Austin may consider working with a driving rehab specialist, driving school instructor, or therapist who specializes in anxiety-related driving issues. These professionals can help develop tailored strategies for gradually reintegrating into the world of driving and managing any remaining anxiety or fear that may be present. 7. Build Confidence: It is important for Austin to give himself time to develop trust in his driving abilities and feel confident behind the wheel. Setting realistic expectations and focusing on small successes will help ease the transition back into driving regularly. 8. Develop a Support Network: Having friends and family who understand Austin's concerns and are available for reassurance, advice, or to accompany him on his driving journeys can be very beneficial. Building a strong support network provides much-needed encouragement and guidance throughout this process. 9. Stay Informed: Austin should keep himself informed about local traffic and weather conditions to avoid any surprises or challenging circumstances on the road. Knowing what to expect can help with planning routes, scheduling driving times, and maintaining a sense of control. 10. Be Patient: Last but not least, Austin needs to be patient with himself as he regains his driving skills and confidence. Reintegration into driving may take some time, and setbacks may occur. Recognizing that this is a normal part of the process and being compassionate towards himself will help ensure a smoother, more successful journey back to driving."},{"instruction":"Cu privire la acest punct, salut faptul că doamna comisar crede că întărirea dialogului dintre legislaturi este foarte utilă şi că nici dumneaei, nici reprezentantul Consiliului nu se opun acestei consolidări a unor alte instituţii, care este necesară în mare parte, cred eu, în temeiul Tratatului de la Lisabona.

Not only that but most teenagers are trying to learn how to be more like adults at the same time. With all of this going on, it isn’t unusual for teens to experience difficult emotions or even depression. Thus, it is important for you to consider whether your teen’s poor hygiene is a sign of something more serious. If a teen was bathing normally but has suddenly stopped, and if you have noticed other symptoms such as moodiness, changes in their school performance or social behavior, or if they have started using drugs or drinking alcohol, then it may be time to seek help from a doctor. There may be a logical reason behind why the teen isn’t showering, so you should spend some time reflecting on what those reasons might be instead of just assuming they are being lazy. For example, there's a teen who has very long hair, maybe they aren’t showering because they don’t have time to do their hair afterward. In this case, you could purchase them a shower cap, or suggest that they take a bath on the days that they don’t want to wash their hair. Some people simply don’t need to wash their hair every day. Maybe the young person is having a hard time finding the time to shower. Many teens have a lot on their plates with school, friends, extracurricular activities, and chores. It could be that they feel they can’t find the time. If this is the case, maybe you can help them figure out a way to manage their time better, or even cut out one of their chores so they have 15 extra minutes to shower. Many times, teens rebel over little things simply to feel like they have some control over their lives. If you haven’t already done so, consider asking the teen why they don’t want to shower. Asking will hopefully help you figure out why they don’t want to shower. Additionally, it will also show your teen that you acknowledge that they are growing up and have opinions and thoughts of their own. Hopefully, the reason they don’t want to shower will be a fairly straightforward one. For example, if the teen doesn’t like the smell of the products, then you can easily let them pick ones they do want. On the other hand, if their reason for not showering is more philosophical (e.g. they don’t want to shower because they feel they should be natural, or something like that), then you’re going to have to do a bit more work. You’ll have to spend time educating them on the health implications of poor hygiene and hope that makes sense to them. If it comes to it, you may have to start revoking privileges. Summary:","output":"Teenage years involve significant hormonal shifts, body development, and personal growth, which can lead to difficult emotions or depression. If a teenager's hygiene habits suddenly deteriorate, it might signal a more serious issue. Observing additional symptoms like moodiness, changes in school performance, social behavior, drug use, or alcohol consumption might necessitate a consultation with a doctor. It is essential not to jump to conclusions and label the teen as lazy, but to instead consider potential reasons for their hygiene decline. For instance, long hair might discourage showering due to time constraints, in which case offering alternatives like a shower cap or suggesting baths when hair washing is not needed can help. Another possibility is that the teenager's busy schedule, including school, friends, extracurricular activities, and chores, does not allow time for showering. In this scenario, offering time management assistance or reducing chores to create more personal time can be beneficial. Engaging in a conversation with the teenager about their hygiene habits can demonstrate respect for their autonomy and help understand the reasons behind their choices. Providing alternative products if they dislike the smells or educating them on health implications if their reasoning is philosophical can encourage better hygiene practices. If necessary, privileges can be revoked to emphasize the importance of maintaining good hygiene."},{"instruction":"Care.com introduces 'peer-to-peer benefits' for its gig economy workers Care.com's workers look like some of the least likely to have benefits. The online caregiving marketplace's users fall into two groups — domestic workers and contractors in the gig economy — that are traditionally shut out from benefits programs. But the company on Wednesday announced it would create a \\"peer-to-peer benefits platform\\" to fund the limited benefits for its caregivers. The 9-year-old site connects potential babysitters or other caregivers with families who need childcare, senior care or even pet care. Over 9 million caregivers and 11 million families use its site worldwide, the company says. “A strong care workforce is critical to our economy and the well-being of families, yet we lack a scalable solution to provide benefits for these workers who support us all. Today is an important milestone for us to better serve the millions of caregivers in our marketplace, and to enable the families they serve to provide them support,” Care.com CEO Sheila Lirio Marcelo said in a statement. But there's a big caveat: Care.com workers don't have to be paid through the site. The many caregivers who use Care.com to find work but are paid under the table or through another channel won't be eligible for these benefits. A Care.com spokeswoman declined to disclose how many caregivers are paid through the site's platform versus another method. According to a report from the National Domestic Workers Alliance, 65 percent of the overwhelmingly female domestic workforce does not have health insurance. Less than 9 percent of domestic workers are able to pay into Social Security and only 2 percent get retirement benefits. “Caregivers constitute one of the largest segments of the gig economy and the fastest growing large job category in our country. Caregivers frequently work for multiple families and almost always work without access to professional benefits,\\" Lirio Marcelo said in the statement. \\"The Care.com Benefits platform not only provides that access but now makes these benefits more affordable through the help of employer contributions to the program. Pooled, portable, peer-to-peer benefits represent a new model for household employment and an innovative step forward in professionalizing caregivers.” Care.com will take 2 percent of the existing 12 percent transaction fee it charges families and contribute that money to benefits for those families' caregivers. Families have the option to raise that transaction fee to 14 percent and give the additional two percentage points to their caregivers. The site is billing its new \\"peer-to-peer\\" model as a form of employer contributions. While the site is giving up some money by diverting 2 percent of its transaction fee, Care.com itself won't be the employer. Caregivers' benefits are capped at 500 per year — a lower level of coverage than through a typical employer-sponsored benefits plan. Extra money accrued can roll over into the next year. The benefits are distributed through prepaid debit cards that can be used at places like doctor's offices or for education or transit benefits. \\"Employer\\" contributions can come from multiple families for caregivers who work for more than one family through the site. Care.com first introduced a payroll benefits program in 2012 to give its users access to Social Security, Medicare and other federal benefits. That program, however, didn't provide any funding for health insurance or other employer benefits. The new benefits program doesn't turn Care.com's caregivers into traditional employees. The caregivers are still on their own when it comes to the workplace protections a traditional employer provides. The company is among the first of the many that rely on fleets of independent workers to begin to provide those contractors with more than an hourly salary. Uber in August launched a partnership with Betterment to give its drivers access to retirement planning. That partnership outsourced all of the logistics of retirement benefits to Betterment and didn't require Uber to contribute funds to its drivers' retirement plans. Uber's retirement program came as the ride-sharing company fights a lawsuit over the question of whether its workers can be classified as independent contractors at all. Other workers in the gig economy — Postmates couriers, InstaCart grocery shoppers — are still waiting for their benefits. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Care.com is a website that helps people find babysitters and other caregivers. These caregivers usually do not get extra things like health insurance from their jobs. Care.com wants to change that and help caregivers get some extra things. They will do this by taking a small part of the money families pay to the caregivers and use it for things like health insurance. However, not all caregivers will be able to get these extra things, because some people do not use Care.com to pay the caregivers. This new plan will not make the caregivers like normal employees, but it is a step to help them get more support from their jobs."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: - sport is football , basketball , track - player team is byu byu - player sport is football basketball - admin years is 1963 -- 1970 - death date is 17 june 2000 - coach team is byu byu - player years is 1932 -- 1933 1932 -- 1933 - coach years is 1942 1941 -- 1949 - admin team is byu - overall record is 2 -lrb- basketball -rrb- -- 5 -lrb- football -rrb- 104 -- 77 - birth date is 17 october 1911 - player positions is fullback -lrb- football -rrb- forward -lrb- basketball -rrb- - coach sport is football basketball - cfbdwid is 1630 - birth place is mesa , arizona Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Joyce has just married a young man named Paul Webster (Richard Crane). Aboard their honeymoon train, Paul receives a telegram and, in a panic, immediately leaves the train to make a phone call. When the train pulls out, Paul is missing, having vanished without a word to Joyce. Throughout the following months, Joyce employs private detectives and conducts her own search for her husband to no avail, until one day, she discovers the address of the Cypresses Plantation that Paul entered on his college enrollment forms. Joyce takes the next train to the desolate whistle-stop town of Bayou Landing in the heart of Louisiana swamp country. While waiting forlornly at the rail station, she notices a large crate marked to be containing radioactive cobalt. Surmising no one would leave such cargo alone long, she stays by it and meets Mannon (Lon Chaney Jr.), a handyman at the Cypresses who came to pick up the cobalt. She asks him to drive her there and he obliges. As they proceed deeper in the swamps, Joyce is horrified when Mannon tries to run over an alligator and then exhibits the hook where a gator bit off his hand.

But, just because something claims to be natural doesn't mean it's safe. Hypothesis: Cystic acne scars are not that hard to alleviate","output":"From the given context, we can indeed draw the hypothesis that cystic acne scars are not that hard to alleviate, considering that there are various home remedy options available for reducing their appearance. However, it is also essential to acknowledge the potential risks and safety concerns associated with these home remedies, as the context states that not all natural remedies are necessarily safe. Cystic acne scars can be a significant concern for many individuals, as they can disrupt one's self-confidence and image. Nevertheless, various treatment options, including home remedies, are available to potentially reduce the visibility of these scars. These home remedies range from simple, cost-effective options like applying honey or aloe vera to more sophisticated treatments like utilizing essential oils or homemade face peels. While the context suggests that cystic acne scars might not be that difficult to alleviate, it also highlights the importance of proper research and caution when embarking on any home remedy treatments. Moreover, the effectiveness of these home remedies can differ substantially depending on factors such as the individual's skin type, the severity of the scars, and the specific remedy chosen. In addition, what might work well for one person may not necessarily yield similar results for another, which further emphasizes the need for thorough research. Aside from home remedies, professional dermatological treatments such as laser therapy, chemical peels, and dermabrasion can also assist in reducing the appearance of cystic acne scars. While these professional treatments are more invasive and expensive, they can offer longer-lasting results and are typically more reliable compared to home remedies. In conclusion, the hypothesis that cystic acne scars are not that hard to alleviate is mostly valid, as numerous home remedies and professional treatments are available to reduce their appearance. However, it is essential to consider individual factors such as skin type, scar severity, and remedy effectiveness, as well as to conduct thorough research and exercise caution in choosing any home remedy treatments.

However, there are numerous methods to deter them from making a home in your garden, protect your plants, and eliminate them if they are already present. Here is a detailed outline of various strategies to prevent snails in your garden: 1. Physical barriers: a. Copper tape: Create a barrier around the edges of your garden beds, pots or planters using copper tape. The copper reacts with the snail's slime, creating a mild electric shock that deters them from crossing the barrier. b. Crushed eggshells or sharp gravel: Spread crushed eggshells, sharp gravel, diatomaceous earth, or similar materials around the base of plants. The sharp edges deter the snails from crawling over the barrier. c. Raised garden beds: Build raised garden beds with slick vertical surfaces that snails find difficult to climb. d. Snail-proof containers: For potted plants, opt for containers with smooth, slick surfaces with rolling rims that make it difficult for snails to gain access. 2. Biological control: a. Introduce natural predators: Encourage birds, frogs, and ground beetles to your garden by providing them with shelter, water, and food sources. These predators can help control the snail population. b. Nematodes: Use natural, non-toxic nematodes as a biological control agent to target snail eggs and juvenile snails. These microscopic worms can be watered on garden soil to help control the population of snails. 3. Trap and remove: a. Beer traps: Bury shallow containers filled with beer or a fermented mix of sugar, water, and yeast in the soil, with the lip at soil level. Snails are attracted to the smell and will crawl in, where they will drown. b. Trapping boards: Place flat boards or tiles on the ground near plants that are under attack. Snails will gather beneath the boards during the day, making it easy for you to collect and dispose of them. c. Hand-picking: Go out in the early morning or evening with a flashlight to hand-pick snails from your plants and the garden. Dispose of them by placing them in a bucket of soapy water or relocating them far away from your garden. 4. Chemical deterrents: a. Organic pellets: Use organic snail pellets, made from iron phosphate, that are safe to use around children, pets, and wildlife. These pellets break down into natural compounds that won't harm your plants or the environment. b. Natural repellents: Apply homemade repellents made from garlic, hot pepper, or coffee grounds around the base of your plants to deter snails. 5. Cultural control: a. Remove hiding places: Keep your garden clean and tidy by removing debris, piles of leaves, overgrown weeds, and other hiding spots for snails. b. Watering habits: Water your garden early in the day to allow plants to dry out before nightfall. Snails are more active during wet conditions and in the evening, so minimizing their preferred environment can help keep them away. c. Plant snail-resistant varieties: Choose plants that are less attractive to snails, such as those with strong smells, tough or hairy leaves, or that are toxic to snails. Examples include lavender, rosemary, and marigolds. d. Crop rotation: Alternate planting locations of various plant groups to help minimize the buildup of snail populations that are attracted to specific plants. By utilizing a combination of these strategies, you can effectively prevent snails from invading your garden and ensure the health and productivity of your plants. Remember, a multi-pronged approach is often the most successful, so don't be afraid to use several of these methods in conjunction."},{"instruction":"Family and friends of the Indiana aid worker beheaded by ISIS extremists were joined by politicians and prominent figures in the Muslim community at a memorial service Sunday.

Lendl, a former world No. 1 from Czech Republic, is widely recognized as one of the greatest tennis players in the history of the sport. Having actively competed in professional tennis between 1978 to 1994, Lendl accumulated numerous accolades and achievements, cementing his legacy as a tennis icon. Ivan Lendl's illustrious career includes eight Grand Slam titles, which are distributed as follows: three French Open titles (1984, 1986, and 1987), two Australian Open titles (1989 and 1990), and three US Open titles (1985, 1986, and 1987). He also holds the unique distinction of reaching eight consecutive US Open finals between 1982 and 1989. Although he never won the Wimbledon Championship, Lendl was runner-up twice in 1986 and 1987. When Lendl began coaching Andy Murray in December 2011, the Scottish tennis star was already a top player but hadn't yet won a major tennis title. Lendl's appointment as Murray's coach marked a significant turning point in the latter's career. Through their collaboration, Lendl imparted vast experience, strategic insights, and mental strength to Murray, all of which contributed to a successful partnership. Under Lendl's guidance, Andy Murray achieved vital career milestones. In 2012, he won his first Grand Slam title by defeating Novak Djokovic in the US Open. That same year, he also claimed the Olympic gold medal, beating Roger Federer in the singles final held at Wimbledon. In 2013, Murray won the Wimbledon Championship, ending a 77-year drought for British men in the singles competition. This triumphant run at Wimbledon was followed by another in 2016. Although Lendl and Murray's coaching relationship faced interruptions, their partnership remained fruitful when they worked together. Their latest collaboration ended in 2017, with both parties deciding to go in different directions. Nevertheless, Ivan Lendl's impact on Andy Murray's career is indisputable, as his mentorship and experience were crucial drivers of the tennis player's numerous successes."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: MOSCOW — Rough diamonds worth millions of dollars have reportedly disappeared from Russia's supposedly impenetrable repository created by the Bolsheviks to store the tsar's jewels. The state-owned Severalmaz company handed diamonds weighing a combined 150,000 carats — or 66 pounds — to the Gokhran repository for inventory purposes, according to respected business daily Kommersant. A file photo of rough diamonds. BAZ RATNER / Reuters, file Citing sources close to the investigation, the paper said the same weight in diamonds was returned - but four of the biggest stones were missing and had been replaced by multiple smaller ones. The missing diamonds reportedly including a 23-carat stone. They were insured for a combined 500,000. That means their real market value was several million dollars, Sergei Goryainov of Rough & Polished, a diamond market analysis company, told NBC News on Thursday. Neither Gokhran nor Severalmaz returned repeated requests for comment. The Gokhran was created in 1920 as a storage facility for valuables confiscated by the victorious Bolsheviks from their enemies, including the Russian nobility, the tsar family and the Orthodox Church. Today, it stores Russia's supplies of gold, silver, platinum, diamonds, emeralds, sapphires, pearls and amber. The size of Gokhran's stores is classified. Despite its reputation as \\"Russia's Fort Knox,\\" the agency has fallen victim to inside jobs in the past. The first Gokhran embezzlers were executed a mere year after its founding. And in 2001, four senior employees were convicted of stealing 187 million worth of valuables from the repository. ||||| Alrosa Severalmaz belongs to the Alrosa, the leading diamond mining company in the world. Four uncut diamonds have disappeared while being held at the State Precious Metals and Gems Repository (Gokhran) for sorting, Kommersant daily newspaper reported on Thursday, citing unidentified sources in the industry. The precious stones were part of a bigger batch of diamonds submitted to Gokhran by Severalmaz mining company that extracts diamonds at a large mine in the northern Arkhangelsk region. After being sorted by Gokhran, some of the diamonds were replaced with inferior ones while the four large ones went missing altogether. The minimum price of these diamonds was 500,000, a source familiar with the situation told Kommersant. One of the missing diamonds weighed 23 carats. A state commission was created in order to investigate the incident. Severalmaz belongs to the Alrosa, the leading diamond mining company in the world. The Russian state, together with the republic of Sakha own 43 and 25 percent of the company respectively. The vast majority of Russia's diamonds come from the republic of Sakha. Since the 1950s, Gokhran has provided sorting and preliminary evaluation services for many diamond companies in Russia. If the report of the missing diamonds is confirmed, this will be a serious blow to the state agency's reputation. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Associated with musical genres including Afropop, jazz, and world music, she was an advocate against apartheid and white-minority government in South Africa. Born in Johannesburg to Swazi and Xhosa parents, Makeba was forced to find employment as a child after the death of her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognized when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the Manhattan Brothers, and an all-woman group, the Skylarks, performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film Come Back, Africa, which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government. Makeba's career flourished in the United States, and she released several albums and songs, her most popular being \\"Pata Pata\\" (1967). Along with Belafonte she received a Grammy Award for her 1965 album An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba.

Step 1: Recall the structure of a nephron and its main components A nephron is the basic functional unit of the kidneys that filters blood and forms urine. The main components of a nephron include the renal corpuscle, the proximal convoluted tubule, the loop of Henle, the distal convoluted tubule, and the collecting duct. Step 2: Determine the initial stage of blood filtration The initial stage of blood filtration in the kidney is known as glomerular filtration. During this stage, the blood is filtered through a collection of capillaries called the glomerulus, and the filtrate is collected in a capsule-like structure, known as Bowman's capsule. Step 3: Identify the portion of the nephron where this initial stage occurs The initial stage of blood filtration, or glomerular filtration, occurs in the renal corpuscle, which is composed of the glomerulus and Bowman's capsule.

OPTIONS: [A]. Yes. [B]. No. Answer:","output":"Answer: [B]. No. Stalactites are formed through the slow deposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in limestone caves. Soil, sand, and clay are not directly involved in the formation of stalactites. Soil is a mixture of organic matter, minerals, gases, liquids, and organisms that support plant life. Sand is a granular material made up of finely divided rock and mineral particles, while clay is a fine-grained, naturally occurring earthy material comprised of tiny clay minerals. Although these materials can interact with limestone or other rock types in various geologic processes, they do not significantly contribute to the formation of stalactites. Stalactite formation typically begins when water containing dissolved calcium carbonate seeps through cracks and pores in a limestone cave's ceiling. As the water evaporates, it leaves behind mineral deposits that gradually accumulate and create the distinctive icicle-like formations we call stalactites. This process can take thousands of years, with the stalactites growing at a very slow rate. In summary, although soil, sand, clay, and limestone are all important components in various geological processes, it is not accurate to say that they directly form stalactites."},{"instruction":"Given an Amazon customer review, write a title for the review.

Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs. Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an \\"evil\\" that was undermining a third of the country's development. Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important. Chaim Weizmann later became Israel's first president. Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the position of President of Israel, a mostly ceremonial post. The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer \\"embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons\\".

Movie plot title: St. Trinian's, The Legend of Fritton's Gold Movie plot: One night, an unknown man telephones St. Trinian's and bribes a girl, Celia, to find an old ring in the school library. She is caught by the other girls, and forced to explain that the man offered her Â£20,000 for the ring. Annabelle, the new head girl of St. Trinian's, bartered for Â£100,000 from the man when he called back, but he refused and then proceeded to threaten them. Afterwards, the girls ask the headmistress, Camilla Fritton, about why the ring might be so valuable. She tells them a story about Pirate Fritton, her ancestor, who supposedly hid a great treasure somewhere in the world. He had two rings made, which when fitted together would reveal the location of the treasure. The man on the telephone who wanted the ring is Sir Piers Pomfrey, a member of a secret society, and descendant of a man robbed by Pirate Fritton in 1589. Sir Piers manages to steal the ring from headmistress Camilla. The girls decide to search for the second ring, and find a clue left by another ancestor of the Frittons, who found the first ring (left in the library) and believed he knew where to look for the second. After a difficult deciphering of the clue, a midnight hunt in a graveyard, dealing with demonic possession, and disguising themselves as boys to infiltrate another school, the girls find the elusive second ring at last. Now, all that is left is to steal back the ring that Sir Piers Pomphrey took. They begin by researching Sir Piers Pomphrey (who runs a secret society known as AD1 who are a masculinist brotherhood), who has a seemingly flawless reputation, and discover that he knows Geoffrey Thwaites â an old flame of Camilla Fritton from the previous film. Camilla tracks him down to ask for help, and he informs her that Sir Piers is the head of a secret society known only as AD1.

Given the context: How would Kendall feel afterwards? Possible answers: upset, giddy, full A:","output":"Determining Kendall's emotions in this situation requires careful interpretation of the context described. Here, Kendall avoided answering the phone when she noticed it was Tracy calling. This suggests that there is some element of discomfort, disagreement, or tension in their relationship which has lead Kendall to not want to engage with Tracy. Among the given options: upset, giddy, or full, the most fitting description of Kendall's emotional state would most likely be upset. The reluctance to answer a call generally implies a negative emotional state. People usually avoid confronting or interacting with others when they are in distress or upset. Kendall could be upset for several reasons. Perhaps she had a conflict with Tracy in the past, or maybe she was troubled by Tracy's opinions or actions. It could also be the case that Kendall is dealing with her own personal issues and felt like she could not handle a conversation with Tracy at the moment. There is also the possibility that Tracy’s call could represent or bring up something upsetting for Kendall, and thus, she avoided it to protect herself from additional distress. The term 'giddy' which typically means a state of excitable joy or elation wouldn't fit this context well because, in this case, there is a clear avoidance behavior in response to Tracy's call. If Kendall were giddy, she would be eager to answer the phone and engage in conversation, contrary to what is portrayed. 'Full' predominantly refers to satiation after consuming food, which doesn't align with the emotional scenarios surrounding interactions and communications over the phone. Therefore, given the indicators provided in the context, it would be logical to infer that Kendall likely felt upset after seeing that Tracy was calling and deciding not to answer the phone."},{"instruction":"Is the belief that a mirror facing the bed is bad because it can steal your soul, a feng shui concept or a common belief in China? Is there any scientific reason behind positioning of bed as claimed by feng shui? Does feng shui work? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Choose your answer from: *no. *yes.","output":"The belief that a mirror facing the bed is bad could be attributed to both feng shui and common beliefs in China. Feng shui is a complex system of geomancy originating in China which is based on the concept of harmonizing the flow of energy or \\"chi\\" within a given space. In feng shui, mirrors are powerful objects, known to reflect energy and having the potential to multiply whatever they reflect. It is typically advised against placing mirrors directly facing a bed, as a reflection of oneself while sleeping is said to potentially lead to poor sleep, nightmares, or even attract negative energy to the individual. This belief is also commonly found in Chinese culture. The fear that a mirror could steal one's soul when placed facing the bed may be derived from folklore and superstition. In many cultures, mirrors are believed to possess mystical and supernatural properties, often acting as portals to other realms and having the ability to capture souls. Generally, placing a mirror facing the bed is regarded as bad luck in Chinese culture. As for the scientific reasons behind the positioning of the bed as claimed by feng shui, there is no concrete evidence or scientific research that supports these claims. However, it is worth mentioning that some feng shui principles may have positive psychological effects on a person's well-being. For example, creating a calm and organized bedroom environment may contribute to better sleep and overall mental health. Nonetheless, attributing these benefits to the specific positioning of objects, based on feng shui principles, remains unproven by scientific research. The questions above address different aspects related to feng shui and cultural beliefs in China, making the questions different from each other. The first question examines the origins of a specific belief, while the second asks for scientific validation behind feng shui.

However, it does not specifically provide the full classification of dogs. To give a more detailed answer for the question \\"What is a dog's classification?\\": Dogs, scientifically known as Canis lupus familiaris, belong to the Animalia kingdom, Chordata phylum, Mammalia class, and Carnivora order. They are members of the Canidae family, which also includes wolves, foxes, and other canid species. The classification of dogs can be broken down as follows: 1. Kingdom: Animalia - Dogs belong to the animal kingdom, consisting of multicellular, eukaryotic organisms that are heterotrophic and lack cell walls. 2. Phylum: Chordata - Dogs are chordates, which means they have a notochord (a flexible rod-like structure) at some stage in their development, along with a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail. 3. Class: Mammalia - Dogs are mammals, characterized by having mammary glands that produce milk for their young, hair or fur covering on their bodies, and a neocortex (a region of the brain) for higher-order functions. 4. Order: Carnivora - Dogs belong to the order Carnivora, which includes mostly carnivorous mammals, characterized by having specialized teeth for tearing and slicing meat and other distinct features such as a well-developed sense of smell and hearing. 5. Family: Canidae - Dogs are part of the Canidae family, which includes wolves, foxes, coyotes, and other canid species. Canids are known for their social behavior, intelligence, and adaptability. 6. Genus: Canis - Dogs belong to the genus Canis, which includes wolves, jackals, and other species of wild dogs. These animals share a common ancestry and are closely related. 7. Species: Canis lupus familiaris - Dogs are a subspecies of the gray wolf (Canis lupus). They were domesticated from wolves around 20,000-40,000 years ago and have since been selectively bred over thousands of years, resulting in diverse breeds with varying appearances and behaviors. In conclusion, the answer you found on Google gives information about the diversity and selective breeding of dogs but does not provide their full classification. The entire classification of dogs include them being categorized under the kingdom Animalia, phylum Chordata, class Mammalia, order Carnivora, family Canidae, genus Canis, and subspecies Canis lupus familiaris."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you need to remove all words of a given length in the sentence.

Possible A: desktop, headphones, connect, concert, conference Why is \\"conference\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Conference\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for the following reasons: 1. Definition: A conference typically refers to a formal meeting where many people gather to discuss a particular topic or subject. It is common in conferences to have multiple speakers sharing their views and expertise. 2. Communication medium: In a conference environment, it is common for the communication to take place over speakers or a Public Address system, so that a large number of attendees can hear the ongoing discussion. This is in contrast to other options like desktop or headphones, which are more suitable for individual or personal use. 3. Context: The question mentions \\"hearing several people,\\" which suggests a group conversation, and conferences often involve groups of people discussing or presenting ideas. This context makes \\"conference\\" a more reasonable answer compared to options like \\"desktop\\" or \\"headphones,\\" which do not typically involve several people conversing simultaneously. 4. Nature of the event: Other options such as \\"concert\\" involve a different type of event, where the focus is on entertainment and music rather than discussion and collaboration, as it usually is in a conference.

With Morton, the New York Dolls recorded Too Much Too Soon in 1974 at A&R Studios in New York City. The album was later mastered at Sterling Sound and Masterdisk. During the sessions, Morton had Johansen record his vocals several times and incorporated sound effects such as gongs, gunshots, and feminine choruses. In a report on the album's progress for Melody Maker, journalist Lenny Kaye wrote that they were taking more time than they had on their first record, \\"bringing in occasional strings and horns, following Shadow's advice not 'to settle'.\\" Morton and the band shared an affinity for each other, as he found the group's energy in the studio refreshing, while Johansen was fond of Morton and the \\"looser\\" feel he provided for their music. \\"That man is completely unpretentious\\", Johansen said of the producer. \\"He doesn't think he ever did a marvellous thing in his life.\\" The New York Dolls and Morton produced little original material together.

The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - Birmingham is a major city and metropolitan borough of West Midlands, England. It is the largest and most populous British city outside London, with a population in 2014 of 1,101,360. The city is in the West Midlands Built-up Area, the third most populous urban area in the United Kingdom, with a population of 2,440,986 at the 2011 census. Birmingham's metropolitan area is the second most populous in the UK with a population of 3.8 million. This also makes Birmingham the 9th most populous metropolitan area in Europe. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - A Councillor is a member of a local government council. - Females typically have a special ovipositor for inserting eggs into hosts or otherwise inaccessible places. The ovipositor is often modified into a stinger. The young develop through holometabolism (complete metamorphosis)that is, they have a worm-like larval stage and an inactive pupal stage before they mature. - Sir George Hamilton Kenrick FRES ( 1850 -- 28 May 1939 ) was an English entomologist who specialised in Lepidoptera especially those of New Guinea and he was a councillor in Birmingham . - Moths comprise a group of insects related to butterflies, belonging to the order Lepidoptera. Most lepidopterans are moths; and there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which are yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are also crepuscular and diurnal species. - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - In computing, WinG (pronounced \\"Win Gee\\") is an application programming interface that is a port of Windows 95's Device Independent Bitmaps to provide faster graphics performance on Windows 3.x operating environments, and was initially positioned as a way to help game developers more easily port their DOS games to Microsoft Windows, although it was quickly discontinued in favor of DirectX. - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. - The Lepidoptera is an order of insects that includes moths and butterflies (both called lepidopterans). 180,000 species of Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families and 46 superfamilies, 10% of the total described species of living organisms. It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world. The term was coined by Linnaeus in 1735 and is derived from Ancient Greek (scale) and (wing). The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution. Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought, and is among the four most speciose orders, along with the Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera.

After winning the first two games in the series, the Mavericks were looking to take a commanding 3-0 lead over the Grizzlies in Game 3. Game Details The game was played on April 29, 2006, at the FedExForum in Memphis, Tennessee. Both teams went into the game with significant playoff implications; the Mavericks had a lot to prove, and the Grizzlies were looking to stage a comeback in the series.

A former West Point cadet has lost a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against members of R&B singer Patti LaBelle's entourage whom he accused of beating him as he waited for a ride outside a Houston airport terminal. In his lawsuit, Richard King alleged he was attacked without provocation by LaBelle's bodyguard and two others while waiting outside Bush Intercontinental Airport in 2011. King had just arrived in Houston, his hometown, while on spring break from West Point. After five days of testimony and 10 hours of deliberation, a federal jury in Houston on Tuesday night absolved Zuri Edwards, LaBelle's manager and son; Efrem Holmes, her bodyguard; and Norma Harris, her hairdresser. Raley said","output":"that King's actions on the night of the altercation played a significant role in the jury's decision. According to witness statements and security footage presented during the trial, King appeared to be visibly intoxicated and was seen acting aggressively toward other individuals at the airport terminal before the incident occurred. As he waited for his ride, King allegedly shouted obscenities and slurs, provoking a tense atmosphere among the bystanders. LaBelle's defense team argued that King initiated the confrontation by approaching the singer's vehicle and attempting to open its door. They claimed that her entourage reacted out of fear for LaBelle's safety and acted in self-defense, with no intent to cause King serious harm. The defense also presented evidence demonstrating that King had a history of excessive drinking, which may have contributed to his erratic behavior on the night of the alleged attack. Moreover, the defense argued that King's conduct that evening was unbecoming of a West Point cadet and highlighted his subsequent expulsion from the prestigious military academy, which was unrelated to this incident but nevertheless resulted in a considerable loss of reputation and potential career opportunities for King. In response to the jury's decision, Raley expressed disappointment but acknowledged the diligence with which the jurors considered the evidence presented. He maintained that King had suffered lasting physical and emotional consequences from the attack, including a traumatic brain injury that forced him to leave West Point and derailed his hopes of serving his country as an officer in the U.S. Army. Despite King's loss of the multimillion-dollar lawsuit, the case has drawn attention to the potential dangers faced by celebrities and their entourages. It has also raised questions about the responsibility that both high-profile figures and their security personnel have to avoid engaging in aggressive or violent behavior, particularly when faced with tense situations involving unpredictable individuals. As this case comes to its conclusion, it highlights the complexities of navigating the legal system and the task of reaching a fair and just decision in cases where both parties present compelling arguments. Jurors were faced with the challenging task of weighing King's claims of being an innocent bystander who was brutally attacked against the defense's portrayal of him as a belligerent individual whose aggressive behavior led to the altercation. Ultimately, the jury's decision in favor of LaBelle and her entourage signals the importance of examining the full context of an incident before casting judgment. This case serves as an important reminder that public figures and their associates must remain vigilant and continue seeking constructive ways to protect their safety in the face of potentially threatening situations."},{"instruction":"In this task, you're given a short article.

Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage. Construct the question in such a way that (i) it is unambiguous, (ii) it is answerable from the passage, (iii) its answer is unique (iv) it answer uses text phrases from the passage. Avoid creating questions that (i) can't be answered correctly without actually understanding the passage and (ii) uses the same words or phrases given in the passage. Context: Platelet-activating factor (PAF) plays a significant role in fertility. Preimplantation stage embryos produce PAF (ePAF) which is required for development. PAF's mechanism of action is receptor-mediated and its presence has been reported in the developing mouse and human embryo. Exposure of preimplantation stage mouse embryos results in higher implantation rates. However, the effect of such treatment on live-birth rates and birth weights has not been reported. Therefore, the objective the study was to determine the effect of exposing preimplantation mouse embryos to PAF on subsequent birth rate and weight.\\", 'Two-cell stage preimplantation stage mouse embryos exposed to PAF (10(-7) M) for 15 min prior to intraoviductal transfer.', 'Preimplantation stage embryos were recovered from eCG/hCG primed BDF1 female mice. Embryos were exposed to synthetic PAF (10(-7) M) for 15 min. PAF-treated embryos were transferred to the oviducts of pseudopregnant female CD-1 female mice. Superovulated and cultured BDF1 embryos not treated with PAF served as in vitro controls and naturally ovulated embryos with no collection/culture served as in vivo controls. Embryos were permitted to develop to term (18-21 days). The number of pups born per litter and litter weights subsequently were recorded.', 'A total of 160 BDF1 mouse embryos were collected, treated, and transferred (20 per CD-1 recipient) as described. There was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the number of pups born to the PAF treatment group (56/80; 70%) as compared to the control group (44/80; 55%). There was also a significant difference (P < 0.05) in litter birth weights between the PAF (1.31 g/litter) and controls groups (1.25 g/litter). There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in birth weights between the PAF treatment group and the in vivo group (1.51 g/litter). There was a significant difference in birth weights between the in vitro-control and in vivo groups (1.51 g/litter). There were no observational malformaties to pups born in any group. Answer: Brief exposure of preimplantation stage embryos to PAF will result in a significant increase of delivery rates (pups/litter) as well as birth weights. However, the increase of birth weight was significantly below that found naturally. Additional studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanism of PAF's action in the preimplantation stage embryo and subsequent uterine development. Output:","output":"Part #1: Construct a question that is unambiguous. Usage: \\"What role does platelet-activating factor (PAF) play in fertility?\\" This question is unambiguous because it clearly asks for the role of PAF in fertility. Part #2: Construct a question that is answerable from the passage. Usage: \\"What was the objective of the study on preimplantation mouse embryos and PAF?\\" This question is answerable from the passage as it is mentioned that the objective was to determine the effect of exposing preimplantation mouse embryos to PAF on subsequent birth rate and weight. Part #3: Construct a question with a unique answer. Usage: \\"What was the result of exposing preimplantation mouse embryos to PAF for 15 minutes?\\" The passage provides a clear and unique answer, stating that brief exposure to PAF resulted in a significant increase of delivery rates and birth weights, but the increase in birth weight was significantly below that found naturally. Part #4: Construct a question whose answer uses text phrases from the passage. Usage: \\"What was the observed birth rate and birth weight difference between the PAF treatment group and control groups?\\" The answer can be found using text phrases from the passage: \\"There was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the number of pups born to the PAF treatment group (56/80; 70%) as compared to the control group (44/80; 55%).

It was one of the greatest achievements in Agassi's long and successful career. Andre Agassi turned professional in 1986 at the age of sixteen. His career soon took off, and in 1990, Agassi was famous around the world, though never having won an important tennis championship. Many people thought he was famous more for his long blond hair and colorful tennis shirts than for his tennis skills. They wondered if he could really win an important tournament. In 1992, Agassi proved _ wrong by winning one of the greatest prizes in world tennis--the Wimbledon singles final. His first attempt to win this tournament had been in 1987, but he lost his opening game. He then refused to take part in Wimbledon for the next three years. He said his reason for not playing was that the officials refused to allow him to wear his colorful shirts, but some people said it was because he was afraid to lose. After several more championship victories, Agassi's luck began to run out. By 1997, the year of his marriage to a movie actress--- Brooke Shields, Agassi's ranking had dropped to 141stin the world. Many people thought his career was over. Agassi and Shields divorced two years later, and Agassi made a comeback with a new trainer, a new hairstyle, and new determination. In 1999, he won both the French Open and the U.S. Open and ended the year back as the world's number one. By 2003, he had earned more than 27 million in prize money, making him one of the most successful tennis players of all times.

The feeling of engorgement can be very painful — your breasts will feel tender, bruised, and very firm — and can last for two to three days. If your breasts become warm to the touch or if you see red streaks, or if you develop a temperature greater than 100.4°F (38°C), contact your doctor immediately because you may have an infection. You may also experience a plugged milk duct, which frequently occurs when nursing stops abruptly due to engorgement. A plugged duct feels like a hard knot in the breast and is tender to the touch. Plugged ducts should be treated by using warm compresses and gentle massage on the lump. See your doctor if it does not improve in a day; it might indicate an infection. Leaking is common during the weaning process, especially after you have missed a couple of feedings and your breasts become engorged. You may find that the sound of your baby crying or even just thinking about your baby will cause your breasts to leak. This is normal and will not last more than a few days. Purchase nursing pads from the store to absorb any unexpected leaks. Nursing burns extra calories, so unless you also cut back on your calorie intake, you will gain weight when you wean your baby. Because weaning can be hard on your body, it's best to begin reducing calories gradually rather than to go on a drastic diet right away. If you want to continue taking in as many calories as you did while you nursed, you will need to increase your activity level to burn off those calories. It may take the body several weeks or longer to totally return to the pre-pregnancy state and until it does, your hormones may be out of balance. For some women, feelings similar to postpartum baby blues are common. This can include feelings of irritability, anxiety, and weepiness and a general down feeling. Sometimes these feelings can lead to depression. Contact your doctor if you don't feel like yourself. Weaning can be difficult physically and emotionally and you may need someone to talk to. Talk to a friend or lactation consultant about the weaning process and what you are experiencing. Sometimes just hearing that your experience is normal can be reassuring. Consider contacting the La Leche League International for additional help and support. Their website http://www.llli.org/ is easy to understand and can be an excellent resource for mothers trying to wean. If at any time you feel helpless or hopeless, or if guilt or anxiety becomes overwhelming, call 911 for immediate support or schedule an appointment with your doctor to discuss options to manage your anxiety. Summary:","output":"Weaning your baby off breastfeeding can be both a physically and emotionally challenging process. During this period, your breasts might become painfully engorged, feel tender, and leak milk; this discomfort typically lasts for a few days. If you notice any signs of infection, such as warmth, red streaks, or fever, contact your doctor immediately. Moreover, you might develop a plugged milk duct, which can be treated with warm compresses and gentle massage, but if it does not improve, seek medical advice. Leaking is a common occurrence during weaning, and using nursing pads can help absorb unexpected leaks. As nursing burns extra calories, adjusting your calorie intake or increasing your activity level can prevent weight gain while weaning. Your hormones might take several weeks or longer to return to their pre-pregnancy state, leading to mood swings similar to postpartum baby blues. If these feelings persist or worsen, contact your doctor for support. Talking to friends, lactation consultants, or support groups like La Leche League International can be helpful in getting reassurance and guidance during this complex process. If you experience overwhelming anxiety or guilt, seek immediate assistance or consult your doctor for tailored management options."},{"instruction":"Afghan militants demand 26 pisoners Militants holding three foreign UN workers Sunday gave Afghan officials a list of 26 prisoners whom they want released, with Tuesday the new deadline.

In this case, they received the CD for free but doesn't provide any context on their own musical preference or experience that could clarify if they are an expert or just a regular listener. 3. Check for any positive aspects: The reviewer briefly mentions a potentially interesting part of a song, \\"Progress thru chemistry in California living,\\" but they find it entertaining for only a short period of time. They do not mention any significant high points or redeeming qualities of the album. 4. Weigh the pros and cons: Based on the information provided, the cons seem to heavily outweigh the pros. There are no distinct positive aspects mentioned, while the reviewer has many negative comments regarding the CD. 5. Make the decision: Based on this review, the chances of buying the product would decrease. The strong negative opinion stated by the reviewer, combined with no real positive aspects mentioned, would likely lead me to look for a different album or explore additional reviews to get a more balanced perspective before making a purchase decision."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

And I was wondering How would Kai feel afterwards? Available options: [+] hot from the summer sun; [+] dehydrated from the dry air; [+] refreshed in the cool rain;","output":"Kai, who had been stationed in the desert for six months, was quite accustomed to the harsh conditions he faced daily. The relentless summer sun and the dry air made it quite a challenge for him to stay adequately hydrated and comfortable. It was clear that the environment had taken its toll on him both physically and mentally. When Kai finally experienced rain for the first time after his extended desert stay, it must have been a truly astonishing and transformative moment. The unexpected sight and feeling of rain, along with the accompanying change in the atmosphere around him, would certainly evoke a range of emotions and reactions. First and foremost, Kai would most likely have felt an overwhelming sense of refreshment from the cool rain. After being exposed to the scorching sun and dehydrated air every day, the rain's cooling effect on his skin, as well as its ability to increase the humidity in the air, would have been incredibly revitalizing. There is something intrinsically soothing and calming about the feel of water droplets on one's skin and the sound of falling rain, which would have been a welcome sensory change for Kai, who had grown used to the dry, searing conditions of the desert. This refreshing experience would have brought relief to his body and mind, allowing him to unwind and relax momentarily. In addition to the refreshment and comfort brought on by the rain, Kai might also have been reminded of how his body had been struggling to cope with the desert's harsh conditions. Despite his best efforts to stay hydrated throughout his six-month desert deployment, his body would have adapted to the dehydrated environment in some way. It's possible that, as the rain presented a more familiar and forgiving environment, Kai could have recognized the physical toll that the extremes of heat and dryness had taken on him. This awareness might have made him feel even more grateful for the reprieve the rain offered and provided him with a newfound sense of appreciation for environments less extreme than the desert. Moreover, a sudden weather change as profound as this would also likely have sparked a sense of awe in an individual like Kai. Having grown accustomed to a seemingly relentless desert climate, the rare experience of rain would have been an extraordinary event. This may have prompted feelings of wonder and amazement, reminding him of the ever-shifting and surprising nature of weather and the world's various ecosystems. In summary, experiencing rain after six months of being stationed in the desert would have been an unforgettable, multifaceted experience for Kai. The cooling, rejuvenating rain would have provided much-needed refreshment to both his body and mind after grappling daily with the dehydrating heat of the desert. The sudden appearance of the rain could have also sparked a sense of awe and wonder at nature's vast and ever-changing beauty. Finally, in light of these experiences, Kai might have gained a deeper understanding and appreciation for the importance of staying hydrated and protecting his body, as well as a more profound respect for the planet's ever-changing and unpredictable weather conditions."},{"instruction":"Question: Information: - Glam rock (also known as glitter rock) is a style of rock and pop music that developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s performed by musicians who wore outrageous costumes, makeup, and hairstyles, particularly platform shoes and glitter.

The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music. - Oklahoma (Cherokee: \\"Asgaya gigageyi\\" / ; or transliterated from English as (\\"òàlàhoma\\"), Pawnee: \\"Uukuhuúwa\\", Cayuga: \\"Gahnawiyogeh\\") is a state located in the South Central United States.

They both had canned soup with them. Pete heated the can without venting it and it exploded, while Dan opened his can and heated it over the fire with no additional problems. Which camper learned less about kinetic energy? Hint: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. Answer:","output":"Dan learned less about kinetic energy."},{"instruction":"What is the name of the London art gallery where John Lennon first met Yoko Ono at her art show in November 1966????","output":"The London art gallery where John Lennon first met Yoko Ono is called Indica Gallery. This meeting took place during Yoko Ono's art exhibition \\"Unfinished Paintings and Objects\\" in November 1966. Indica Gallery was an avant-garde art gallery situated in the Mason's Yard area of St. James, London, and played a crucial role in the city’s thriving art scene in the mid-1960s. It was co-founded by John Dunbar, Peter Asher (whose sister, Jane Asher, was dating Paul McCartney at the time), and Barry Miles in 1965. The gallery was instrumental in introducing influential artists and musicians, including Yoko Ono, to a wider audience in London. The night before Yoko Ono's exhibition opened to the public, John Dunbar had invited John Lennon for a private visit, knowing Lennon's interest in avant-garde art. When they arrived at the gallery, Lennon saw Ono's \\"Apple\\" exhibit, which was an apple fixed to a Plexiglas stand with a price tag of £200. Lennon also encountered Yoko Ono's \\"Ceiling Painting/YES Painting,\\" for which he had to climb a ladder and look through a magnifying glass to see the word \\"YES\\" on the ceiling. This artwork, in particular, left a profound impression on him and initiated their first conversation. After this meeting, John Lennon and Yoko Ono's relationship grew as they shared their passion for art, music, and peace activism.

It was quite difficult to try to get him to eat each day as he didn't want anything. The one thing, however, that he would ask us to bring him was ice cream. One evening, to our surprise, he refused to eat the ice cream, so I placed it in a staffroom refrigerator. A little while later, my son said he wanted it, so I fetched it for him. As I passed another ward , a woman asked, \\"Are there more where that came from?\\" When I explained, she seemed very disappointed.

On the way to dad's room, I came into the sick woman's room, and offered her the ice cream I'd bought for her.

Answer should be yes or no. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]. Q: Verify if the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Kim Kardashian is Positive . Wearing curve-hugging black workout pants and a white tank top Kim Kardashian perches on a couch in the media room of her newly renovated Bel Air estate and sips Pedialyte through a straw. The makeup-free 36-year-old appears almost normal â certainly not like a mogul who according to Forbes banked 45.5 million the past year from a brand she built on self-Â­aggrandizement shameless product peddling and nude selfies. At the epicenter of this unprecedented trajectory remains E!'s Keeping Up With the Kardashians a living record of her happily debauched family â Kourtney 38; Khloe 33; Rob 30; Kendall 21; and Kylie 20; as well as matriarch Kris 61 and her ex Caitlyn Jenner 67 (who in 2015 transitioned from Bruce). On Sept. 24 a 90-minute special will celebrate the series' 10th unapologetic year. It's a head-scratching milestone for a show that at its conception offered viewers little more than a voyeuristic lens into the lives of a celebrity-adjacent family â but quickly became the mother ship for all their product extensions and the platform through which Kris and her five daughters ushered in the era of the reality celebrity as a brand. Keeping Up With the Kardashians now airs in 167 countries boasts nine spinoffs to date and has ranked as E! Entertainment's top-rated series since 2010. And while it peaked in 2011 with 10.5 million viewers over two nights for Kim 's fairy-tale wedding to Kris Humphries (they divorced after 72 days) it still averages north of 2.1 million every Sunday in its 13th season. In 2015 E! agreed to a reported 80 million deal to keep the family through season 14. But that's a pittance compared to the fashion and lifestyle empire they've built from one boutique in the Valley. With a combined social media reach of 700 million-plus followers and five insanely profitable apps the family mints millions from a hodgepodge of endorsement deals paid appearances and can't-stay-in-stock products. And it all grew from a show that opened its pilot with these prophetic words from Kim (already notorious for the sex tape she made with her ex Ray J that was made public in 2007): \\"I hate you all.\\" Kim Kardashian (star executive producer) I was going to [Pierce College] and after school I would go work the cash register at our store Dash. This all happened when I was 27 â¦ Kourtney Kardashian (star executive producer) We had talked to producers about doing a show about the three of us running the store Dash where Khloe and I would do the day-to-day and Kim would come in as a stylist. It didn't go anywhere. Ted Harbert (then-CEO of E! Networks) Just like anybody else I knew of the family through [O.J. Simpson attorney] Robert Kardashian. There was a bit of the stuff with Kim hanging around Paris Hilton and of course the fun with Ray J [who made a sex tape with Kim]. That was sort of world news. Damla Dogan (senior vp development & programming E!) They were just crossing over into pop culture territory especially Kim . She had a look that wasn't on TV at the time. She wasn't stick thin and that was relatable. Kim I don't think any of us thought it would. Khloe Kardashian (star executive producer) I don't think we knew what we were even saying yes to. Everything was just super-fast. Kim and my mom were steering the ship. We were just like \\"Tell us where to be and we'll be there.\\" Kris The watercooler chatter from the first episode was all about [9-year-old] Kylie jumping on a stripper pole. Kim had one installed in my bedroom and our friend Robin Anton who is the founder of The Pussycat Dolls was just messing around and Kylie hops up there twirls around a couple times and it became this thing. Kim When we would travel I remember people calling mine Kourtney and Khloe's names and we thought they knew us from high school or something. We just didn't get it. Then they started chasing us down at the airport. That was the first time that we were like \\"Oh my God.\\" Khloe In Armenia I've never seen so many people. I got separated from Kim and everyone and they all got in the van and left. I was like \\"Hello? I'm still in the fucking crowd of people!\\" Everyone forgot about me and Erin Paxton our audio mixer took her boom and literally fished me back into our producer's van. Kris There was barely Twitter when we started. Ryan called Kim and said \\"There's this thing called Twitter you might want to pay attention to.\\" The girls [began] embracing their audience and sharing their lives. Dow Kim sort of paved the way for the economic structure of native influencer marketing. Before the rise of the common man YouTuber in their bedroom you had people like her . She was the one who kicked down the door and got the brands to spend money in that area because she showed success. Brands noticed that when when you would pay a celebrity to send out a branded tweet they were getting more click-throughs for the dollar so it made more monetary sense. That's why that revolution started. Dow When Kim did the cover of CR [in 2013] that's when she was anointed. It's Carine Roitfeld's magazine Karl Lagerfeld shot it and Riccardo Tisci art-directed. Fashion washes away all sins. That's when she went next-level. In August 2011 Kim married NBA player Kris Humphries. The E! special of the 6 million wedding earned the network its highest ratings to date and more than 10 million in ad revenue. Kim There was all this attention on the wedding and I thought maybe it was just the pressure of the show giving me this anxiety. My friends told me I just had cold feet but even the producers said \\"You don't seem happy. You don't have to go through with this.\\" The night before my mom pulled me aside off camera and was like \\"This isn't it for you. Why don't you go away and I'll handle it?\\" I felt like if I pulled out now everyone's going to think I just did it for the show. Then afterwards people were saying \\"You have to stay married for a year \\" but I physically couldn't do it . When I made the decision [to divorce] everyone said it was made up for the show. Everyone really wanted to take me down. A:","output":"Yes, the sentiment of the document towards Kim Kardashian is Positive.

Why is drama so addictive? Are K-Dramas addictive?","output":"The following two questions are related but not exactly the same: 1. Why is drama so addictive? 2. Are K-Dramas addictive? The first question, \\"Why is drama so addictive?\\", seeks to understand the factors that make drama in general addictive to its viewers. This question encompasses drama as a whole, including all forms, formats, and cultures. It aims to investigate the psychological, emotional, and social aspects that contribute to the addictive nature of drama. Some reasons behind the addictiveness of drama include: a. Relatability: Humans are social beings, and through drama, we connect to the experiences and emotions of different characters. The relatability of these characters helps us understand ourselves and others in various situations. b. Emotional engagement: Watching drama engages our emotions, allowing the viewer to empathize with different characters. This emotional engagement can serve as an emotional outlet for the viewer. c. Suspense and climax: Dramas often involve a buildup of tension, suspense, and anticipation, followed by a satisfying resolution. These elements can release feel-good chemicals such as dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins in the viewer's brain, which can contribute to the addictiveness of drama. d. Escapism: Dramas offer viewers a chance to escape from their daily lives and immerse themselves in the world of the characters and their stories, which can become quite addictive. On the other hand, the second question, \\"Are K-Dramas addictive?\\", specifically asks about the addictiveness of Korean dramas (K-Dramas) in particular. K-Dramas have gained enormous popularity worldwide due to their unique blend of storytelling, characterization, cinematography, and cultural exploration. The addictive nature of K-Dramas may be attributed to some particular factors specific to this genre, such as: a. Unique storylines: K-Dramas offer fresh, innovative storylines that are different from typical Western television dramas. These storylines often showcase Korean culture, habits, ideals, and societal issues. b. Cultural fascination: For international viewers, K-Dramas serve as a gateway to understanding and experiencing Korean culture, such as traditional customs, language, fashion, and food. This cultural fascination can make K-Dramas more addictive. c. Well-developed characters: K-Dramas often include multi-dimensional characters with complex backstories, emotions, and growth. These well-developed characters can enhance the viewers' emotional engagement and attachment, increasing the addictive nature of the dramas. d. High-quality production: K-Dramas are known for their high production values, including striking visuals, engaging soundtracks, and attention to detail. This quality enhances the viewing experience and can contribute to their addictive nature. e. Limited episode count: K-Dramas typically have a predetermined limited number of episodes, unlike some Western dramas with open-ended seasons. This structure allows for well-paced and tightly-woven storytelling, with each episode packed with meaningful content that keeps viewers coming back for more. In summary, although both questions address the addictive nature of drama, the first question delves into the broader aspects of drama in general, while the second specifically explores the addictiveness of K-Dramas. Both questions share some commonalities but also highlight distinct differences in the factors that contribute to their respective forms of drama's addictive nature."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Surprised at such good reviews Product review: This had the potential for being a good book. But alas, the main female character was so neurotic and had such wild mood swings she really came off as being somewhat unbalanced. The main male character was too good to be true .. he put up with sooo much crap for her and just kept on understanding and accepting everytime she turned on him, which was pretty much every time she saw him. About half way through the book it was apparent what the big mysterious secret was - it was so very obvious that I thought it must be a red herring, but nope, the obvious was the obvious. As to who the bad guy was? That was fairly easy also. Were the characters written to be more balanced, it would have been a much better book. Glad it was free. Answer:","output":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of you buying the product. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the main characters, describing the female character as \\"neurotic\\" and \\"unbalanced,\\" while the male character seems unrealistically patient. The reviewer also mentions that the book's mysterious secret was predictable and the identity of the antagonist was easy to guess.

The McKinleys were of English and Scots-Irish descent and had settled in western Pennsylvania in the 18th century, tracing back to a David McKinley who was born in Dervock, County Antrim, in present-day Northern Ireland. There, the elder McKinley was born in Pine Township, Mercer County. The family moved to Ohio when the senior McKinley was a boy, settling in New Lisbon (now Lisbon). He met Nancy Allison there, and married her later. The Allison family was of mostly English descent and among Pennsylvania's earliest settlers. The family trade on both sides was iron-making, and McKinley senior operated foundries throughout Ohio, in New Lisbon, Niles, Poland, and finally Canton. The McKinley household was, like many from Ohio's Western Reserve, steeped in Whiggish and abolitionist sentiment, the latter based on the family's staunch Methodist beliefs. William followed in the Methodist tradition, becoming active in the local Methodist church at the age of sixteen. He was a lifelong pious Methodist. In 1852, the family moved from Niles to Poland, Ohio so that their children could attend the better schools there. Graduating from Poland Seminary in 1859, he enrolled the following year at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. He remained at Allegheny for only one year, returning home in 1860 after becoming ill and depressed. He also spent time at Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio as a board member.

Use a ruler and spray thin coats to avoid drips: This means that when you spray paint, you should use a ruler to help guide your hand, so the paint goes on straight. Also, apply the paint in light layers rather than putting on too much at once. That way, you won't have any messy drips on your painting. 2. Make sure you tape off and cover anything that you are trying not to paint: If you want to keep some areas of your project clean and paint-free, you should use special tape, like painter's tape, to cover them up. This tape helps to create a barrier, so the spray paint doesn't accidentally get on the parts you don't want it to. Make sure that everything you don't want the paint to be on is completely covered up to protect it from any paint splatters or overspray.

However, this does not necessarily mean that it is morally or ethically right to do so. In a battle, individuals may fight for a cause or goal, such as national defense or protecting their community. Moreover, during a battle, there are certain rules of engagement that all parties are expected to follow, providing a structured environment in which harm can be inflicted while minimizing collateral damage. Additionally, choosing to participate in organized combat implies that the individual acknowledges the risks associated with their actions, facilitating a more fair and equal playing field. Ultimately, joining a battle can be a more controlled and purpose-driven way to express aggression or desire to harm another person, as opposed to indiscriminate acts of violence or harm in regular life.

The sheets didn't fit on the bed but were just right for the cot, as the","output":"sheets were specifically designed for a smaller sleeping space, providing optimal comfort to the user. The choice of fabric, thread count, and patterns used were meticulously selected to suit the cozy dimensions of the cot, creating a snug, safe, and supportive environment for those resting within. The sheets, originally purchased for a standard bed, had been acquired with the intention of dressing the larger mattress and ideally providing a smooth, soft, and comfortable surface for the user to sleep on. However, upon closer inspection, it became apparent that the size of these sheets was not suitable for the bed in question. This discrepancy could have arisen due to various factors such as miscommunication, misunderstanding, or a simple mistake when purchasing the sheets. Despite the initial disappointment, the discovery that these sheets were a perfect match for the cot turned out to be a fortunate twist of events. In fact, this newfound usage brought a sense of silver lining to the situation, as the cot, which might have been overlooked or neglected in terms of providing optimal comfort, was now elevated in terms of design and functionality. By fitting the sheets perfectly on the cot, the individual was able to improve the appearance of the smaller sleeping space, making it more inviting and visually appealing. The use of matching sheets could also create a cohesive look and feel within the room, establishing a harmonious environment that promotes relaxation and wellbeing. Additionally, the perfect fit ensured that the user did not have to worry about loose edges, sliding corners, or any excessive fabric that could compromise the sleep quality or cause discomfort during the night. By adhering to the contours of the cot, the sheets also minimized the formation of creases, lumps, or bunching, which could be detrimental to a good night's sleep. In conclusion, despite the initial setback faced when the sheets did not fit the intended bed, the individual managed to find an alternative solution that was not only functional but also contributed positively to the overall aesthetics of the space. The sheets' compatibility with the cot transformed a potentially frustrating situation into an advantageous one, highlighting the importance of adaptability and open-mindedness in overcoming challenges and making the best out of any given circumstance."},{"instruction":"Given a sentence in the Japanese and Filipino language.

The bus driver, who faces disciplinary action, has garnered support from some 300,000 people in a petition. The boy had run out onto the road, forcing the driver to brake hard. When he told the boy to pay attention, he was insulted and reacted, the local transport authority said. The boy's mother has now reportedly filed a complaint against the driver. The incident, which took place on 13 September, was witnessed by dozens in front of the town hall in Arcueil, a southern suburb of the French capital. What happened? The boy told police he was running across the street to catch his bus after school when he heard a horn and an insult he was not sure was hurled at him, but attributed to the bus driver. Le Parisien reported he returned the insult without thinking: \\"Shut up, go on, move on.\\" The video, which begins at this point, shows teenagers laughing before the bus driver gets out of his vehicle and slaps the boy across the face. The boy stands in shock as those around him cry out. The man - a father of two teens - then asks him how old he is, and says \\"and how old am I?\\" before turning back. The video, which was initially posted on instant messaging platform Snapchat, has been viewed almost 1.2 million times. What's the reaction? The Paris transport authority RATP has launched a disciplinary procedure against the driver. It strongly condemned his violent action, which it said was contrary to the principles and values of a state-owned public transport company. The bus driver has admitted to them that he reacted emotionally and indicated that he regretted his actions, RATP said. Colleagues however have launched a petition in support of the driver, which has collected some 300,000 signatures within a week. The local mayor told Le Parisien that children often run between sides of the street in question, which is near the Dulcie-September College. \\"Some put themselves in danger,\\" he said, conceding however that \\"the driver's reaction was neither proportionate nor appropriate. It's a child.\\" France's Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne echoed this sentiment, saying it was \\"not normal to slap a youngster\\". However social media reaction has been strongly divided with many feeling the violence was cowardly, and others supporting the driver's reaction to what they term as \\"disrespect\\" and \\"bad behaviour\\" on the part of the boy. ||||| A petition to support a French bus driver facing disciplinary action after he was filmed slapping a teenager last week has garnered over 200,000 signatures. According to them, their colleague slapped the teenager in Arcueil, south of Paris, after the young man crossed the street right in front of the bus, forcing the driver to \\"sharply hit the brakes and rough up customers inside\\". The petition was launched by the bus driver's colleagues at the RATP, a state-owned public transport company operating in the Greater Paris area. They ask management not to fire the driver who is now facing disciplinary action for slapping a teenage boy while on duty last week. He then reportedly called out the teenager \\"like any parent would have done\\" and received insults in return. They describe the driver as \\"known for his kindness, Olympic calm and patience\\". The RATP announced in a statement posted on Twitter on Sunday that it was launching a disciplinary procedure against the driver, saying that his action \\"goes against our principles and values as a public service company.\\" It added: \\"It will, of course, be taken into account that the employee regrets his action and says he reacted in the grip of emotion after he avoided colliding into the young person, who crossed the street in a dangerous manner and insulted the driver.\\" More than 220,000 people had signed the petition to support the bus driver by Tuesday morning with the story also igniting social media. \\"RT (retweet) to support the bus driver who saved a kid's life with his reflex, gets insulted and now risks being fired!,\\" Twitter user Laurent George posted. \\"All my support for the bus driver against this mindless teen whose mother should have brought up better instead of filing a complaint,\\" Beret Fabien posted on Twitter. Valérie Pécresse, President of the Ile-de-France region where Paris is located, called on the disciplinary council to \\"be indulgent towards the Arcueil bus driver who was a victim of provocations and insults\\". \\"He should not have raised his hand on a schoolchild and regretted it, but he has mitigating circumstances,\\" she said in a statement posted on Twitter. Some, however, denounced the bus driver's action. Bérénice Haria said on Twitter that she does \\"not support the bus driver at all because incivilities on the road are frequent\\". ||||| Bonjour à tous les collègues chauffeurs de bus et autocaristes ainsi que tous les autres soutiens.

Question 2: How can I prepare for CA CPT? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Yes, both questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing, which is how to study and excel in the CA CPT (Chartered Accountancy Common Proficiency Test). They both focus on preparation strategies to excel in the examination. I will provide a detailed answer to the common question of how to study and excel in the CA CPT. To study and excel in the CA CPT, follow these steps: 1. Understand the exam format: Before beginning your preparation, it is essential to familiarize yourself with the exam format. The CA CPT consists of multiple-choice questions divided into four sections: Fundamentals of Accounting, Mercantile Laws, General Economics, and Quantitative Aptitude. There is a total of 200 marks, and you must score a minimum of 100 marks to qualify. 2. Create a study plan: Develop a realistic and well-structured study plan that covers all the subjects, allocates ample time for revision, and includes time for breaks. Stick to your plan to maintain consistency in your studies. 3. Gather study materials: Collect relevant study materials, including textbooks, reference books, and sample papers from reliable sources. Online study material provided by the ICAI (Institute of Chartered Accountants of India) can be very helpful, as well as materials provided by reputable coaching institutes. 4. Strengthen your basics: Focus on building a strong foundation in accounting concepts, economic principles, and mathematical techniques. As the CA CPT is an entry-level examination, a solid understanding of the basics is crucial for excelling in the test. 5. Regular practice: Practice regularly to improve your speed and accuracy. Solve sample papers and mock tests, timed, if possible, to familiarize yourself with the exam environment. Consistent practice will not only help you in identifying your weak areas but also build your confidence for the actual exam. 6. Stay up-to-date: To excel in the General Economics section, it is crucial to stay updated with the latest economic developments, policies, and government schemes. Regularly read newspapers, financial journals, and business magazines for this purpose. 7. Revise regularly: Revision is critical in retaining information and filling knowledge gaps. Dedicate a specific time for revision in your study plan and ensure to review all the subjects periodically. 8. Hone your time management skills: As CA CPT is a time-bound examination (4 hours), it is essential to manage your time efficiently. Allocate a specific amount of time for each section and practice answering questions quickly and accurately. 9. Seek help when needed: If you face any challenges in understanding a particular topic, seek help from your teachers, mentors, or peers. Joining a coaching institute or online study groups can provide additional support during your preparation. 10. Take care of your health: A healthy body and mind contribute to effective learning. Eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and take breaks to prevent burnout. Ensure you get adequate sleep to help your brain retain information better. By following these steps, you can improve your chances of studying effectively and excelling in the CA CPT examination. Remember to approach your preparation with a positive attitude and a willingness to work hard.

The NMC heard that she changed a dying resident's records and ordered documents to be shredded in an attempt to conceal an overdose of warfarin. A total of seven allegations were heard in Mrs Read's absence. She was given an interim suspension order for 18 months after the conduct and competence committee found against her on all seven counts. An inquest in 2013 into 19 unexplained deaths at Orchid View, in Copthorne, found neglect contributed to five of them. The West Sussex coroner said the home was riddled with \\"institutionalised abuse\\". The home was owned and operated by Southern Cross Healthcare Group, which has since gone into administration. It later reopened under a new name and management. The NMC hearing heard how Mrs Read tried to cover up an overdose given to one of the 19 residents who died. Jean Halfpenny, 77, who was referred to as Resident A, was about to go into hospital from the Copthorne care home in April 2010 when she was given an overdose of the blood-thinning drug warfarin. Realising that the medical records showed what had happened, Mrs Read told a colleague: \\"You can't send her to hospital with these - we will be closed down.\\" Administrator Lisa Martin was told to shred the documents, which were then rewritten by Mrs Read. Mrs Read also ordered Ms Martin to administer medication to another resident when she was not qualified to do so.

She changed a very sick person's health papers and destroyed some important documents on purpose to hide giving too much medicine.

A long time ago, there were some people who died without any reason in this care home. It was found that five of these people died because they didn't get the care they needed. The people in charge of the care home didn't treat them nicely. The company that owned the care home is no more and the home has a new name and new people caring now. Nirmala tried to hide what she did wrong with one of the people who died but it was found out. She told people to do things they weren't supposed to do, like giving medicine.

With an estimated 90.5 million inhabitants , it is the world's 14th-most-populous country, and the eighth-most-populous Asian country. Vietnam is bordered by China to the north, Laos to the northwest, Cambodia to the southwest, Thailand across the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest, and the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia across the South China Sea to the east and southeast. Its capital city has been Hanoi since the reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1976. - Liu Biao (142208), courtesy name Jingsheng, was a warlord and the governor of Jing Province who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He was a member of the extended family of the Han emperors, descended from Liu Yu, the fifth son of Emperor Jing. - Wu (222280), commonly known as Eastern Wu or Sun Wu, was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). It previously existed from 220222 as a vassal kingdom nominally under Cao Wei, its rival state, but declared independence from Wei and became a sovereign state in 222. It became an empire in 229 after its founding ruler, Sun Quan, declared himself 'Emperor'. Its name was derived from the place it was based in the Jiangnan (Yangtze River Delta) region, which was also historically known as \\"Wu\\". It was referred to as \\"Eastern Wu\\" or \\"Sun Wu\\" by historians to distinguish it from other Chinese historical states with similar names which were also located in that region, such as the Wu state in the Spring and Autumn period and the Wuyue kingdom in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. It was called \\"Eastern Wu\\" because it occupied most of eastern China in the Three Kingdoms period, and \\"Sun Wu\\" because the family name of its rulers was \\"Sun\\". During its existence, Wu's capital was at Jianye (present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu), but at times it was also at Wuchang (present-day Ezhou, Hubei). - Sun Quan (182252), courtesy name Zhongmou, formally known as Emperor Da of Wu (lit. \\"Great Emperor of Wu\\"), was the founder of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period. He inherited control of the warlord state founded by his elder brother Sun Ce in 200. He declared formal independence and ruled from 222 to 229 as \\"King of Wu\\" and from 229 to 252 as the \\"Emperor of Wu\\". Unlike his rivals Cao Cao and Liu Bei, Quan governed his empire mostly separate of politics and ideology, he is sometimes portrayed as neutral considering he accommodated the wills of both his rivals but only when it benefited his state of Wu and never fully attempted to conquer his rivals, although most of historians would cite his lack of logistical resources to do so. - Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\") and South Korea (officially the \\"Republic of Korea\\"). Located on the Korean Peninsula, Korea is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the East Sea. - The Three Kingdoms (AD 220280) was the tripartite division of China between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu, following the Han dynasty and preceding the Jin dynasty. The term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" itself is something of a mistranslation, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed legitimate succession from the Han dynasty. Nevertheless, the term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" has become standard among sinologists. To further distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of similar names, historians have added a relevant character: Wei is also known as Cao Wei, Shu is also known as Shu Han, and Wu is also known as Dong (or Eastern) Wu. - A courtesy name (\\"zi\\"), also known as a style name, is a name bestowed upon one at adulthood in addition to one's given name. This practice is a tradition in East Asian cultures, including China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. - Zhou Yu (175210), courtesy name Gongjin, was a military general and strategist serving under the warlord Sun Ce in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He continued serving under Sun Quan, Sun Ce's younger brother and successor, after Sun Ce died in 200 CE. Around late 208, the northern warlord Cao Cao led his forces south with the intention of conquering the Jiangdong region, where Sun Quan's territories were based. Zhou Yu, as the frontline commander of Sun Quan's forces, defeated Cao Cao at the decisive Battle of Red Cliffs. He then led Sun Quan's forces at the follow-up Battle of Jiangling and defeated Cao Cao's forces again. Zhou Yu's victories helped to solidify the survivability of Sun Quan's regime, which served as the foundation of the state of Eastern Wu in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). He died in 210 at a relatively young age of 35 while preparing for a conquest of the Bashu region (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing). - Yuan Shao (died 28 June 202), courtesy name Benchu, was a warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. He occupied the northern territories of China during the civil war that occurred towards the end of the Han Dynasty and the beginning of the Three Kingdoms era. He was also an elder half-brother of Yuan Shu, a warlord who controlled the Huai River region, though the two were not on good terms with each other. - Dong Zhuo (died 22 May 192), courtesy name Zhongying, was a politician and warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. He seized control of the capital Luoyang in 189 when it was in a state of turmoil following the death of Emperor Ling and a clash between the eunuch faction and some court officials led by General-in-Chief He Jin. Dong Zhuo subsequently deposed Emperor Shao and instated Emperor Xian. - Yuan Shu (died 199), courtesy name Gonglu (), was a warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He rose to prominence following the collapse of the imperial court in 189. - Liu Bei (161 10 June 223), courtesy name Xuande, was a warlord in the late Eastern Han dynasty who founded the state of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms period and became its first ruler. Despite early failings compared to his rivals and lacking both the material resources and social status they commanded, he gathered support along disheartened Han loyalists who objected to Cao Cao's reign over the emperor and relied heavily on this support. Liu Bei overcame his many defeats to carve out his own realm, which at its peak spanned present-day Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Hunan, parts of Hubei, and parts of Gansu. - Sun Ce (175200), courtesy name Bofu, was a military general and warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He was the eldest child of Sun Jian, who was killed during the Battle of Xiangyang when Sun Ce was only 16. Sun Ce then broke away from his father's overlord, Yuan Shu, and headed to southeastern China to establish his own power base there. With the help of several people, such as Zhang Zhao and Zhou Yu, Sun Ce managed to lay down the foundation of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period. - The Han dynasty was the second imperial dynasty of China (206 BC220 AD), preceded by the Qin dynasty (221206 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220280 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \\"Han people\\" and the Chinese script is referred to as \\"Han characters\\". It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (923 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (206 BC 9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25220 AD). - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Huang Gai ( birth and death dates unknown ) , courtesy name Gongfu , was a military general serving under the warlord Sun Quan in the late Eastern Han dynasty . He previously served under Sun Quan 's predecessors -- Sun Jian ( Sun Quan 's father ) and Sun Ce ( Sun Quan 's elder brother ) . - Sun Jian (155191), courtesy name Wentai, was a military general and warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He allied himself with Yuan Shu in 190 when warlords from eastern China formed a coalition to oust Dong Zhuo, a tyrannical warlord who held the puppet Emperor Xian in his power. Although he controlled neither many troops nor much land, Sun Jian's personal bravery and resourcefulness were feared by Dong Zhuo, who placed him among Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu and Liu Biao as the most influential men at that time. After the coalition disbanded in the next year, China fell into massive civil war. In 191, Sun Jian was killed in battle during an offensive campaign against Liu Biao. - Zhang Zhao (156236), courtesy name Zibu, was an official of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period. - Cao Cao (155 15 March 220), courtesy name Mengde, was a Chinese warlord and the penultimate Chancellor of the Eastern Han dynasty who rose to great power in the final years of the dynasty. As one of the central figures of the Three Kingdoms period, he laid the foundations for what was to become the state of Cao Wei and was posthumously honoured as \\"Emperor Wu of Wei\\". Although he is often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant in subsequent literature, Cao Cao has also been praised as a brilliant ruler and military genius who treated his subordinates like his family. During the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty, Cao Cao was able to secure the most populated and prosperous cities of the central plains and northern China. Cao had much success as the Han chancellor, but his handling of the Han emperor Liu Xie was heavily criticized and resulted in a continued and then escalated civil war. Opposition directly gathered around warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan, whom Cao was unable to quell. Cao was also skilled in poetry and martial arts and wrote many war journals.

Walking up it is quite a bit easier than running or cycling up it , I assure you . Ha ! Question Why is it easier to walk up the Big Dam Bridge ? Answer:","output":"It is easier to walk up the Big Dam Bridge due to several factors: Step 1: Recognize the difference between walking, running, and cycling First, it's important to understand that walking, running, and cycling have different physical demands and speeds. Walking is the slowest and least demanding of the three, while running and cycling require higher levels of effort and energy expenditure. Step 2: Consider the incline of the bridge The Big Dam Bridge is a structure with an incline, which means that moving uphill will require more physical effort than on a level surface. As a result, the activity that demands the least amount of energy - in this case, walking - will be easier comparatively. Step 3: Factor in muscle engagement and biomechanics Walking primarily engages the leg muscles, especially while going uphill. In contrast, running and cycling place additional demands on other muscle groups, such as the quadriceps, hamstrings, and core muscles. The body has to work harder during these activities, making them more challenging than walking. Step 4: Evaluate energy expenditure and fatigue As energy expenditure increases during running and cycling, the body must consume more oxygen and generate more energy to keep up with demand. This process leads to a higher heart rate and increased fatigue. Since walking is less intense, it requires less energy and is less tiring overall. Step 5: Consider the impact on joints When walking uphill, the impact on the joints is relatively low due to a slower pace and lower forces. Running and cycling, however, create more impact forces on the joints, increasing the risk of discomfort or injury. In conclusion, walking up the Big Dam Bridge is easier due to the relatively lower energy demands, reduced muscle engagement, lower heart rate, and less impact on the joints compared to running or cycling."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Sometimes, the simplest ideas are the best. For example, to absorb heat from the sun to heat water,you need large, flat, black surfaces. One way to do that is to build those surfaces specially, on the roofs of buildings. But why go to all that trouble when cities are full of black surfaces already, in the form of asphalt roads? Ten years ago, this thought came into the mind of Arian de Bondt, a Dutch engineer. He finally persuaded his boss to follow it up. The result is that their building is now heated in winter and cooled in summer by a system that relies on the surface of the road outside. The heat-collector is a system of connected water pipes. Most of them run from one side of the street to the other, just under the asphalt road. Some, however, dive deep into the groun. When the street surface gets hot in summer, water pumped through the pipes picks up this heat and takes itunderground through one of the diving pipes. At a depth of 100 metres lies a natural aquifer into which heat several heat exchangers have been built. The hot water from the street runs through these exchangers, warming the ground-water, before returning to the surface through another pipe. The aquifer is thus used as a heat store. In winter, the working system is changed slightly. Water is pumped through the heat exchangers to pick up the heat stored during summer. This water goes into the building and is used to warm the place up. After performing that task, it is pumped under the asphalt and its remaining heat keeps the road free of snow and ice. Options: A To absorb heat from the sun. B To store heat for future use. C To turn solar energy into heat energy. D To carry heat down below the surface. Answer: D To carry heat down below the surface. Question: The answer is:","output":"What is the primary function of the water pipes in the heat-collector system described in the article?

Sole was apprenticed to Robert Cory of Cambridge for five years; he followed this by setting up a solo apothecary practice in Bath and later a practice in partnership with Thomas West. Sole published Menthae Britannicae; he was one of the first elected associates of the Linnean Society of London and Sprengel named a plant species Solea (now Viola) after him. An Enclosure Act is a parliamentary authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure is the name given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed with nothing more than a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150 stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was acting on behalf of the establishment in the enclosure acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.The village sent 61 men to fight in the First World War, which represents over 30 percent of the village population of 1911.

Furthermore, it acknowledges the reality of people starving to death, which is indeed very sad. The hypothesis that if we feed them today, they'll be hungry tomorrow and many people are starving to death aligns with the descriptive nature of the premise. In this context, both the premise and the hypothesis highlight the complexity and persistence of the global hunger issue. Addressing hunger requires a multifaceted approach that goes beyond simply providing food for those in need. Factors such as poverty, political instability, natural disasters, climate change, and a lack of sustainable agricultural practices contribute to this ongoing crisis, and these issues must be considered in order to develop effective, long-term solutions. In short, the premise provides a basis for and thus entails the hypothesis in this situation. It recognizes the fact that merely feeding people today will not permanently solve the problem of global hunger. To truly address this issue, more comprehensive strategies and cooperation at the local, national, and international levels are needed to create sustainable change. Efforts to improve access to education, healthcare, and social services, as well as policies aimed at encouraging economic growth and stability, could contribute to alleviating this worldwide problem.

Chinese ghost cities, meet #SyrianRefugees – Imagine a world like that… @WhiteHouse http://t.co/yCYuiXMPND — Matthew MacMillan (@MattMacMillan) September 15, 2015 Really believe the Refugees fleeing the War.could be moved to the Ghost Cities of China.ready for Maybe Millions https://t.co/A7grc1G43c — greedalitism365 (@Greedalitism365) September 14, 2015 Realistically speaking, this suggestion isn’t worth analyzing with much depth. The political quagmire of relocating masses of people across the planet — not to mention the fact that refugees need more than just housing — means that this is a far greater ordeal than simply assuaging demand with supply. It does shed light, though, on the gulf that exists between the predominant international opinion on China’s so-called ghost cities and their present reality. Even though there are between 20 and 45 million unoccupied homes across China, which account for roughly 600 million square meters of uninhabited floor space — enough to completely cover Madrid — these places are not the urban wastelands they are often posited to be. While many of China’s new cities and urban districts are deficient in people they are not deficient in owners. Nearly every apartment that goes on the market in China is quickly purchased, often at exorbitant prices that commonly range into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Far from being unwanted infrastructure that could seamlessly be doled out to refugees, those arrays of vacant high-rises are actually the proud possessions of people who paid a lot of money for them. So why would anyone spend incredible amounts of cash on houses they do not intent to use? All over the world, the value of property extends beyond the utilitarian function of being a place to live. Real estate is also a vital economic entity that presents an avenue for investment as well as a way of storing wealth — a use of property that is taken to the extreme in China. “Many Chinese investors are buying property based on expectations of appreciation, and that it is a solid, safe investment that they can easily understand,” said Mark Tanner, the founding director of China Skinny, a Shanghai based marketing research firm. A full 39 percent of individual wealth in China is kept in housing, and, according to Nomura, 21 percent of China’s urban households possess more than one home. The reasons for this desire to invest in housing often results from a lack of better options. China’s banks pay negative interest and are becoming even more unattractive with the recent wave of currency devaluation. Wealth management products are not fully developed and are highly regulated by the government, and the stock market is viewed to be about as secure as a casino. A huge portion of the homes that are purchased in China function very much like stocks or a trade-able commodity. As an incredible number of new apartments are sold as unfinished concrete cavities without any interior fit out or even windows, they are in no way immediately livable. Strange as it may seem, they are very actively bought and sold in this bare-bones form. In fact, investors often prefer them that way. In many ways they are purely economic entities, quantifiable placeholders of value that are traded on the open market akin to precious metals. Just as one doesn’t need to mold a piece of gold into something usable, like a piece of jewelry, for it to have value and an economic function, an apartment in China doesn’t need to have people living in it for it to be economically viable. “Empty units leave flexibility for quick sales in a changing market or need to cash in quickly,” said Barry Wilson, the founding director of Barry Wilson Project Initiatives, a Hong Kong-based urban design firm. Another reason for the sheer number of unused apartments in China is the fact that there is often little financial incentive for owners to do anything with them after purchase. There is no yearly property tax in China, so vacant properties are not a financial drain on their owners. While the potential returns that could be had from renting them out (1 percent or so) is often not worth the hassle — especially because it costs tens of thousands of dollars to construct the interiors of new apartments in preparation for tenants. This is combined with the fact that Chinese homeowners, especially investors who have multiple properties, are remarkably un-leveraged. According to Mark Tanner, over 80 percent of homes in China are owned outright. This means that most homeowners, especially the big investors with multiple properties, generally don’t have any mortgages to pay off or any other leans, so there isn’t as much financial pressure to make a profit from these homes in the short term. Additionally many empty apartments have owners who intend to occupy them at some point. A huge number of China’s new apartments are located in new development areas, which are, by definition, new. The thinking is if you buy property in these emerging new areas early, you can get a better price. So it’s common for people to purchase homes in places that are not yet ready to support a large population with the understanding that they won’t be able to inhabit them for many years. As these new urban developments grow and evolve, more and more people eventually move into their homes. According to a report by Standard Chartered, between 2012 and 2014 the occupancy rate of Zhengzhou’s Zhengdong New District — prominently featured in a 60 Minutes segment on ghost cities — doubled, while the population in Zhenjiang’s Dantu district quadrupled, and occupancy in Changzhou’s new Wujin district increased more than twofold. As new areas develop, the facilities, institutions, infrastructure and businesses they need to be attractive to residents, vacant homes begin filling up as ghost cities come alive. So, while China may have tens of millions of empty apartments, it doesn’t mean that they don’t serve an economic function, it doesn’t mean that they are unwanted, and it definitely doesn’t mean that they are just laying out in some urban no-mans-lands ripe for the taking.

You can trade in your daily slog and sub-par health care for free-roaming moose and idyllic lighthouse views. “Hi Americans! Donald Trump may become the President of your country! If that happens, and you decide to get the hell out of there, might I suggest moving to Cape Breton Island!” said the island’s tourism organization on its website. All those exclamation points! It’s only a taste of the friendly people that lay in wait—not to mention access to Canada’s free health care and what it calls an “affordable” housing market, all just up the eastern seaboard from Boston and New York City. Cape Breton residents are so eager for new neighbors—its population has faced sharp declines in recent years—that you don’t even need to wait for the election to find a new international home. “Start now, that way, on election day, you just hop on a bus to start your new life in Cape Breton, where women can get abortions, Muslim people can roam freely, and the only ‘walls’ are holding up the roofs of our extremely affordable houses,” the site says. The appeal seems to be attracting some takers. Mary Tulle, CEO of Destination Cape Breton, says that they’ve already received 50,000 U.S. inquires since they put up the offer three days ago, reported CNNMoney. Cape Breton’s economy has been hit hard in recent years after local coal mines and steel mills were shut down.

Now, we need to convert the speed from km/hr to meters/sec because the length of the train should be in meters. We can use the following conversion formula: Speed in meters/sec = (Speed in km/hr) * (1000 meters/km) / (3600 sec/hr) So, let's compute the train's speed in meters/sec: Speed in meters/sec = (60 km/hr) * (1000 meters/km) / (3600 sec/hr) = 16.67 meters/sec Next, we have to find the distance the train covers in 12 seconds, which will be equal to the length of the train. To do this, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time Now, plugging in the given values: Distance = (16.67 meters/sec) * (12 sec) = 200 meters Therefore, the length of the train is 200 meters, which corresponds to option (D)."},{"instruction":"I know that the answer to the question \\"When did Zahm die?\\" is in \\"Father Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. was Director of the Science Museum and the Library and Professor of Chemistry and Physics until 1874.

It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry. The only essential difference between U-238 and U-235 is their atomic masses; as a result, the two isotopes are separated by a physical means that takes advantage of the difference in mass. Paragraph: John is a nuclear scientist who works at the Fermi lab. Today, in front of him he has four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. Sample A is the naturally occurring uranium.

The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful. - Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , \\"techne\\", \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Stephen Reeder Donaldson ( born May 13 , 1947 ) is an American fantasy , science fiction and mystery novelist , most famous for The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant , his ten - novel fantasy series . His work is characterized by psychological complexity , conceptual abstractness , moral bleakness , and the use of an arcane vocabulary , and has attracted critical praise for its \`\` imagination , vivid characterizations , and fast pace . '' He earned his bachelor 's degree from The College of Wooster and a Master 's degree from Kent State University . He currently resides in New Mexico . In the United Kingdom he is usually called \`\` Stephen Donaldson '' ( without the \`\` R '' ) . - A bachelor's degree (from Middle Latin \\"baccalaureus\\") or baccalaureate (from Modern Latin \\"baccalaureatus\\") is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study lasting three to seven years (depending on institution and academic discipline). In some institutions and educational systems, some bachelor's degrees can only be taken as graduate or postgraduate degrees after a first degree has been completed. In countries with qualifications frameworks, bachelor's degrees are normally one of the major levels in the framework (sometimes two levels where non-honours and honours bachelor's degrees are considered separately), although some qualifications titled bachelor's degrees may be at other levels (e.g. MBBS) and some qualifications with non-bachelor's titles may be classified as bachelor's degrees (e.g. the Scottish MA and Canadian MD). - Kent State University (KSU) is a public research university in Kent, Ohio, United States. The university also includes seven regional campuses in Northeast Ohio and additional facilities in the region and internationally. Regional campuses are located in Ashtabula, Burton, East Liverpool, Jackson Township, New Philadelphia, Salem, and Warren, Ohio, with additional facilities in Cleveland, Independence, and Twinsburg, Ohio, New York City, and Florence, Italy. - Northeast Ohio refers to the northeastern region of the U.S. state of Ohio. The region contains six Metropolitan Statistical Areas: ClevelandElyria; Akron; CantonMassillon; YoungstownWarrenBoardman; Mansfield, and Sandusky, along with six Micropolitan Statistical Areas: Ashland, Ashtabula, New PhiladelphiaDover, Norwalk, Salem, and Wooster. Most of the region, with the exception of the YoungstownWarrenBoardman and Mansfield metropolitan areas, is also part of the ClevelandAkronCanton Combined Statistical Area and media market, while Mahoning, Trumbull, and Columbiana counties form part of the YoungstownWarren CSA and media market with Mercer County, Pennsylvania. Northeast Ohio also includes most of the area known historically as the Connecticut Western Reserve. In 2011, the Intelligent Community Forum ranked Northeast Ohio as a global Smart 21 Communities list. It has the highest concentration of Hungarian Americans in the United States. - New Mexico is a state located in the southwestern region of the United States of America. It was admitted to the union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. It is usually considered one of the Mountain States. New Mexico is fifth by area, the 36th-most populous, and the sixth-least densely populated of the 50 United States. - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\". - High fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy, defined either by its setting in a fictional universe or by the epic stature of its characters, themes, and plot. The term \\"high fantasy\\" was coined by Lloyd Alexander in a 1971 essay, \\"High Fantasy and Heroic Romance\\". - The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant is a series of ten high fantasy novels written by American author Stephen R. Donaldson. The series began as a trilogy, entitled \\"The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever\\". This was followed by another trilogy, \\"The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\", and finally a tetralogy, \\"The Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\". - Kent is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio and the largest city in Portage County. It is located along the Cuyahoga River in Northeast Ohio on the western edge of the county. The population was 28,904 in the 2010 Census and 29,810 in the 2015 estimate. The city is counted as part of the Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area and the larger ClevelandAkronCanton Combined Statistical Area. - A master's degree (from Latin \\"magister\\") is a second-cycle academic degree awarded by universities or colleges upon completion of a course of study demonstrating mastery or a high-order overview of a specific field of study or area of professional practice. A master's degree normally requires previous study at the bachelor's level, either as a separate degree or as part of an integrated course. Within the area studied, master's graduates are expected to possess advanced knowledge of a specialized body of theoretical and applied topics; high order skills in analysis, critical evaluation, or professional application; and the ability to solve complex problems and think rigorously and independently. - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Innovation can be defined simply as a \\"new idea, device, or method\\". However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. This is accomplished through more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term \\"innovation\\" can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that \\"breaks into\\" the market or society. It is related to, but not the same as, invention. Innovation is often manifested via the engineering process. The exnovation is the opposite of innovation. - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León. - In Italy, the Iaurea is the main post-secondary academic degree. The name originally referred literally to the laurel wreath, since ancient times a sign of honor and now often worn by Italian students right after their official graduation ceremony and sometimes during the graduation party. A graduate is known as a \\"laureato\\", literally \\"crowned with laurel.\\" - Ohio is an Eastern state in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Ohio is the 34th largest by area, the 7th most populous, and the 10th most densely populated of the 50 United States. The state's capital and largest city is Columbus. - Twinsburg is a city in Summit County, Ohio, United States about halfway between Akron and Cleveland. The population was 18,795 at the 2010 census. In 2013, Twinsburg was named the thirty-eighth best place to live in the United States by Christine Phillips and CNN Money Magazine. - Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an \\"extraterrestrial\\" or \\"alien\\"), is life that does not originate from Earth. These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology. - Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384322 B.C.), though \\"analysis\\" as a formal concept is a relatively recent development. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction. - Florence is the capital city of the Italian region of Tuscany and of the Metropolitan City of Florence.

Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.

Context: At various times, there have been cardinals who had only received first tonsure and minor orders but not yet been ordained as deacons or priests. Though clerics, they were inaccurately called \\"lay cardinals\\" and were permitted to marry. Teodolfo Mertel was among the last of the lay cardinals. When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest. With the revision of the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV, only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals. Since the time of Pope John XXIII a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop, unless he obtains a dispensation.

As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its size increases.. ii. As the distance from Earth to the star increases, its size decreases.. iii. As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its apparent brightness increases.. iv. As the distance from Earth to the star increases, its apparent brightness increases..","output":"The statement that correctly describes a relationship between the distance from Earth and a characteristic of a star is: iii. As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its apparent brightness increases. To further understand this relationship, we must first discuss a concept called \\"apparent brightness\\" or \\"apparent magnitude\\". Apparent brightness is a measure of how bright a star appears to be as seen from Earth or an observer's point of view. It is not an intrinsic property of the star but rather depends on the observer's location and the distance between the star and the observer. Apparent brightness is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the Earth and the star. This relationship is governed by the Inverse Square Law, which states that the intensity of a physical quantity (such as starlight) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of that physical quantity. Mathematically, this can be represented as: Apparent Brightness ∝ 1 / (Distance)² Now, let's examine the four statements provided: i. As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its size increases: This statement is incorrect because the size (or radius) of a star is an intrinsic property and does not depend on its distance from Earth. ii. As the distance from Earth to the star increases, its size decreases: This statement is also incorrect for the same reason mentioned in statement i – the size of a star is an intrinsic property and does not depend on its distance from Earth. iii. As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its apparent brightness increases: This statement is correct based on the Inverse Square Law. As the distance between the observer (Earth) and the star decreases, the intensity of the starlight increases, making the star appear brighter. This statement accurately describes the relationship between the distance from Earth and the apparent brightness of a star. iv. As the distance from Earth to the star increases, its apparent brightness increases: This statement is incorrect because it contradicts the Inverse Square Law. When the distance between the observer (Earth) and the star increases, the intensity of the starlight decreases, making the star appear less bright. So, the correct answer is statement iii. As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its apparent brightness increases."},{"instruction":"Игра сделана по принципу алхимии, где из обычных ингредиентов делали более сложные.

One example of such a task is to design a Rube Goldberg machine, as it requires a step-by-step approach and logical justification for each step. Here's a step-by-step example of designing a simple Rube Goldberg machine: 1. Identify the goal: The goal of the machine could be to ring a bell. Justification: Ringing a bell is a simple, easily observable outcome for the machine to achieve. 2. Decide on the first step: Launch a small ball down a ramp. Justification: The motion of the ball will create energy that can be transferred to other components of the machine. 3. Transfer energy to the next component: Set up a series of dominoes along the path of the rolling ball. Justification: This will visually demonstrate the transfer of energy as the ball knocks down the dominoes. 4. Introduce a new change in motion: At the end of the domino chain, place a larger, heavier object that is balanced on a seesaw-like lever. Justification: This adds an element of balance and shows how the energy from the smaller dominoes can be used to move a larger object. 5. Connect the lever to the bell: Attach a string from the larger object to the bell so that when the larger object is hit, the bell will be pulled and ring. Justification: This uses the movement of the larger object to directly achieve the goal of ringing the bell. This simple Rube Goldberg machine tests one's ability to perform physical reasoning.

This successful offensive play put 7 points on the board for the Steelers. However, the Ravens managed to respond, albeit not in equivalent measure. Their kicker, Justin Tucker, was successful with a 41-yard field goal which gave the Ravens their first and only points in the first quarter. This field goal contributed 3 points to their score which made it a 7-3 game in favor of the Steelers at the end of the first quarter. Therefore, comparing the scores of both teams at the end of the first quarter, it is apparent that the Ravens with 3 points scored significantly less than the Steelers who had tallied 7 points. Football scoring rules dictate that a touchdown, like the one completed by the Steelers, is worth 6 points with an additional point added for a successful conversion kick, while a field goal, like the one completed by the Ravens, is worth only 3 points. Thus, in the first quarter, the Ravens ended up scoring fewer points than the Steelers."},{"instruction":"If \\"A young woman with dark hair and wearing glasses is putting white powder on a cake using a sifter.\\", does this mean that \\"A woman is putting the finishing touches on a cake.\\"?

This has great dignity and depth, and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity\\".In later life, Shostakovich suffered from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka. Beginning in 1958 he suffered from a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis. He also suffered heart attacks the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 he wrote in a letter: \\"Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective). All I need to do now is wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order.\\"A preoccupation with his own mortality permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based on a number of poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony throughout. He dedicated the piece to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony. Shostakovich died of lung cancer on 9 August 1975. A civic funeral was held; he was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow. Even before his death he had been commemorated with the naming of the Shostakovich Peninsula on Alexander Island, Antarctica., Despite suffering from Motor Neurone Disease (or ALS) from as early as the 1960s, Shostakovich insisted upon writing all his own correspondence... answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who suffered heart attacks in 1966 and again in 1971?

After a slew of tornadoes that began overnight Sunday, forecasts for a third day of deadly twisters on Tuesday thankfully did not entirely hold up. Although there were reports of eight tornadoes in North Carolina, they caused only minor damage and no injuries. An additional four tornadoes were spotted in eastern and central South Carolina. But there were no reports of fatalities, unlike with the tornadoes that ripped through Arkansas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee, killing 35 people. Flooding is now the overriding concern. The National Weather Service has issued flood warnings and watches for large areas of the East and parts of the South, from New York to Alabama. In the area of Fayetteville, N.C., there have already been reports of flash flooding as some drivers were stranded by rising water and had to be pulled from their vehicles. One person was reported dead in flash flooding in the Florida Panhandle. Flooding in Pensacola was being described by officials as \\"life-threatening\\" and of \\"historic\\" proportions. Meanwhile, the cleanup has begun in states hard-hit by this week's storms \\"We will overcome this,\\" Louisville, Miss., Mayor Will Hill said against a backdrop of hundreds of damaged buildings, including two hilltop churches pounded to rubble, The Associated Press reports. \\"We're going to work together.\\" The AP adds: ||||| LOUISVILLE, Miss.

Grigsby said aerial rescues were planned, and the county moved boats and jet skis from the beaches to the streets to help. A portion of Interstate 10 was closed. \\"We've seen pictures that people are posting with water halfway up their doors, front doors,\\" Grigsby said. \\"It's going to be a big cleanup, looks like.\\" The widespread flooding is the latest wallop of a storm system that still packed considerable punch days after the violent outbreak began in Arkansas and Oklahoma. At least 35 people have been killed in that storms that started Sunday and spread from Oklahoma to North Carolina. In Baldwin County on the Alabama Gulf Coast, crews had been rescuing stranded people since before midnight and some were in shelters Wednesday morning, said Mitchell Sims, emergency management director. \\"As soon as we get a water rescue team in here, they're sent back out,\\" he said. \\"We're rescuing people from cars, from rooftops, from all over the place. \\"I think we're gonna be dealing with this for days,\\" added Sims, who estimated that 12 to 17 inches of rain had fallen in 24 hours. \\"I don't know where the water's going to go. Everything is saturated.\\" Over the past four days, the storms hit especially hard in places such as Arkansas' northern Little Rock suburbs and the Mississippi cities of Louisville and Tupelo. Arkansas, with 15 deaths after a tornado blasted through Sunday, and Mississippi with 12 deaths from Monday's storms, accounted for the brunt of the death toll. \\"We will overcome this,\\" Louisville Mayor Will Hill said against a backdrop of hundreds of damaged buildings, including two hilltop churches pounded to rubble. \\"We're going to work together.\\" Authorities in Louisville searched until dark Tuesday for an 8-year-old boy missing since Monday's large tornado that killed his parents and destroyed the home where they lived. Though searchers didn't rule out finding the boy alive, officials were describing the process as one of \\"recovery.\\" After days of storm destruction, some didn't take any chances late Tuesday with yet more tornado watches. Simon Turner and her 7-year-old son, Christopher, scrambled to a shelter in Tuscaloosa, Ala., after hearing that a tornado watch had been issued around that city. Frightened by memories of a killer tornado that partly demolished Tuscaloosa three years ago, the Turners had opted for refuge in a school with a reinforced hallway. \\"We'll be here till they say it's OK to leave,\\" Turner said before the all-clear came. The dead Monday included University of Alabama swimmer John Servati, who authorities say took shelter in the basement of a home when a retaining wall collapsed. Servati was a business major on the dean's list. Some survived or died amid split-second decisions. William Quinn, 25, and others dove under the gap beneath a house in Mars Hill, Miss., seconds before a tornado blew heavily damaged the home and sheared off the roofs of nearby poultry houses. He called his decision \\"a spur of the moment thing.\\" But in the southern Tennessee community of Fayetteville, a married couple was killed Monday in a tornado after returning to their mobile home after mistakenly believing the danger had passed, a neighbor said. Authorities identified the victims as John Prince, 60, and his wife Karen, 44. \\"We pulled up, and were in shocked seeing our own home. But then we saw Karen's father, and he said 'John and Karen are gone — They didn't make it,'\\" recalled neighbor Tiffani Danner. She had left and came back to find her own home destroyed as well. Darrell Haney, in a home nearby, thought that community was out of the woods when TV switched from tornado warnings back to regular programming — then suddenly cut back to a possible tornado. Haney quickly plucked up two grandchildren and huddled in a bathroom with his wife, daughter and son-in-law. Almost immediately, he said, a tree crashed into a front room where one of the children had been sleeping. The roof was lifted off of the master bedroom. \\"The house is being torn apart around you, and we're just crying out, 'God protect us,'\\" Haney said. \\"Because at that point you're totally hopeless and helpless.\\" Elsewhere, Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe visited several homes Tuesday that were damaged by a deadly twister, stopping at one location where three members of a family were killed. Three of Arkansas' 15 deaths were a father and two daughters and Beebe spoke to survivors, including two of the man's other daughters. \\"It was kind of heartbreaking those two little girls that I talked to that lost two of their siblings and their dad,\\" Beebe said afterward. \\"That's utter destruction up there ... and these people need to know that folks care about them.\\" ___ Associated Press writers Jack Elliott Jr. in Jackson, Miss., Jay Reeves in Kimberly, Ala., Erik Schelzig in Fayetteville, Tenn., and Christina Huynh in Ferndale, Ark., contributed to this report.

But even these battle-tested veterans of the weather wars are marveling at torrential rains that washed out bridges and roads, sent chest-high water into homes and forced major military bases to shut down Wednesday. \\"We've seen flooding before, but never flooding that washes the back of a house away,\\" said CNN iReporter Matt Raybourn of Pensacola, Florida. \\"There are no words for what we are seeing here.\\" The rushing waters reduced some streets to rubble, gouged huge gashes in others and left stretches of many others submerged, including parts U.S. 98, the main east-west route along the coast. It was closed in several places between Fort Walton Beach and Panama City. Abandoned cars sat half-submerged along the highway. Along the coast, water pushed ashore by wind-driven waves and unusually high tides lapped at sand dunes as red flags warned swimmers to stay out of the water. There was one drowning death tied to the flooding, Florida officials said. The victim, a 67-year-old woman, drove or was swept into a drainage ditch Tuesday night, Escambia County spokeswoman Kathleen Castro said. In Alabama, waters rushed in so fast that residents climbed on top of furniture and waited on rooftops to be rescued, said Reggie Chitwood, deputy director of emergency management in Baldwin County. \\"The waters rose at a historical level. ... People had to scramble,\\" Chitwood told CNN's \\"The Lead with Jake Tapper.\\" In a neighborhood north of Pensacola, a creek overran its banks, inundating homes and forcing residents to retreat to their attics to await rescue, Escambia County spokesman Bill Pearson said. Rescuers were reaching the residents on state Fish and Wildlife boats and personal watercraft normally used to patrol the county's beaches, he said. The National Guard was also on the way.

As much as 18.9 inches of rain fell over 24 hours in Alabama and Florida, according to the National Weather Service. At Pensacola's airport, an estimated 15.55 inches of rain fell on Tuesday -- the largest amount to fall in a single calendar day since officials started tracking rainfall in 1880, the National Weather Service said. It was all the result of a slow-moving and massive storm system that sucked up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico for days before dumping it back onto land in a series of thunderstorms, said CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray. Satellites captured an image of the water vapor held aloft by the storm tracing a huge sideways 'S' shape across much of the country. As the storm crept up the eastern seaboard Wednesday afternoon, heavy rains caused flooding in the Washington area. In Baltimore, the edge of a street buckled in a landslide that sent cars tumbling into a ravine. No one was injured, the city's transportation department said.

Most government offices in the Florida Panhandle were closed Wednesday, as were many schools. Pearson said emergency officials were urging businesses to stay closed as well and were asking motorists to stay off the roads. Tides up to 2 feet higher than normal were causing minor coastal flooding and dangerous rip currents, the National Weather Service said.

Tens of thousands remained without power in the South, where suspected tornadoes tore through homes and businesses late Monday. Officials revealed new details Wednesday about the powerful tornado that struck the Arkansas towns of Mayflower and Vilonia. The twister was rated an EF-4 on the Enhanced Fujita Tornado Damage scale, with an estimated peak wind speed between 180 and 190 mph, the National Weather Service said. It was on the ground for 41.3 miles on Sunday and was responsible for 15 deaths, officials said. In addition to the Florida flooding death, police in Athens, Georgia, said a driver was killed Wednesday when storm winds toppled a tree onto a car. Authorities in Mississippi confirmed another death from storms that struck Monday. At least 38 people have been killed since Sunday in storm-related deaths in Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Florida and Georgia, according to a CNN tally of state reports. The storm could bring heavy rains and possibly thunderstorms to Jacksonville, Florida; Charlotte, North Carolina; Virginia Beach, Virginia; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Atlanta, the National Weather Service said. Heavy rain will be the norm. Flooding could be a concern in the New York City area on Thursday. Forecasters say rainfall could total up to four inches, with heavier amounts in some areas. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. The worst flooding in Florida in a generation — more than 2 feet of water in 26 hours, by one rain gauge — left drivers stranded overnight and into Wednesday, the latest pummeling from the monster storm system lumbering across the country. Tornado warnings were posted in the morning in Florida, Alabama and North Carolina, and authorities reported two storm-related deaths in Georgia. The risk for tornadoes later in the day was highest from South Carolina to Washington, D.C., forecasters said. They said that Wednesday would probably be the last day of the severe-weather threat from the storm system, which has killed 38 people in eight states in a relentless eastward push of wind and water. On Tuesday, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle got the worst of it. At least one person was killed, a man in Florida whose car got stuck in rising water. He called for help, but the water was moving too quickly, authorities said. Five inches of rain fell on Pensacola, Fla., in a single hour, from 9 to 10 p.m. Tuesday — more than during the entirety of Hurricane Ivan, which rolled through in 2004, said Kevin Roth, lead meteorologist for The Weather Channel. “It went on and on and on. It was relentless,” Cheryl Clendenon, who was stranded in her home in Pensacola Beach until a friend picked her up, told NBC News. “I used to like the sound of rain to help me get to sleep, but this was like Chinese water torture. It just did not stop.” |||||","output":"A severe weather system in the South and Midwest of the U.S., that previously sparked tornadoes which claimed 35 lives, has now resulted in heavy rain forecasts, prompting fears of major flooding.

If more than 1.9 inches drifts down over the Wolverine State before winter finally releases its icy grip, snowfall will exceed the 93.6 inch record set in 1880. Some forecasts predicted up to three inches Monday night. While much of the East Coast reveled in summer-like temperatures Monday, even those were expected to fade into renewed wintery chills by Tuesday. Say it ain't so: Deeply winter-weary Michigan will again see temperatures plummet Monday and the state's even poised to break an over 130-year-old yearlong snowfall record. Record-breaking: A January photo show's Detroit blanketed in the white stuff, a site that became all too familiar to Michiganders this year. If Detroit sees over 1.9 inches Monday, the state will beat record of 93.6 inches set way back in 1880. The dramatic step back into winter was prefaced by a barrage of soaking rains sweeping towards the east where the incoming cold front clashed with the outgoing warmth. According to Accuweather.com, the chances of Michigan breaking its 130-year-old snowfall record are low but not out of the question. On Sunday, the same storm system dumped six inches of snow onto Nebraska. As the cold air pushes onward, the East Coasters who enjoyed temperatures in the 70s on Monday mercury could dip below freezing overnight Tuesday across the Ohio River Valley, the Appalachians and into the northeast just to the cusp of the I-95 corridor. Only southern Florida can expect to be spared from what is hopefully one of this record-shattering winter's last stands. WHY?

After Alexander's conquests the region of Bithynia came under the rule of the native king Bas, who defeated Calas, a general of Alexander the Great, and maintained the independence of Bithynia. His son, Zipoetes I of Bithynia maintained this autonomy against Lysimachus and Seleucus I, and assumed the title of king (basileus) in 297 BCE. His son and successor, Nicomedes I, founded Nicomedia, which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign (c. 278 – c. 255 BCE), as well as those of his successors, the kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. Nicomedes also invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries, and they later turned on his son Prusias I, who defeated them in battle. Their last king, Nicomedes IV, was unable to maintain himself against Mithridates VI of Pontus, and, after being restored to his throne by the Roman Senate, he bequeathed his kingdom by will to the Roman republic (74 BCE).\\", answer the following question.

Context: During the 20th century Valencia remained the third most populous city of Spain as its population tripled, rising from 213,550 inhabitants in 1900 to 739,014 in 2000. Valencia was also third in industrial and economic development; notable milestones include urban expansion of the city in the latter 1800s, the creation of the Banco de Valencia in 1900, construction of the Central and Columbus markets, and the construction of the Gare du Nord railway station, completed in 1921. The new century was marked in Valencia with a major event, the Valencian regional exhibition of 1909 (La Exposición Regional Valenciana de 1909), which emulated the national and universal expositions held in other cities. This production was promoted by the Ateneo Mercantil de Valencia (Mercantile Athenaeum of Valencia), especially by its chairman, Tomás Trénor y Palavicino, and had the support of the Government and the Crown; it was officially inaugurated by King Alfonso XIII himself.

These very tough kids often came directly from prison to my classroom. They often wanted to escape from the group home. They were society's \\"throwaway\\" kids--youngsters without families to love and care for them. They desperately needed to receive love. Then I found one thing more important for them. So, when a friend suggested an idea, I thought it would be a great program for my students. The plan was simple. We arranged that every Wednesday morning, I'd bring over my little crew, and they were supposed to clean the runs, wash dog and cat bowls, and feed the animals at our local animal shelter. Then came the risky part of the program. After doing their chores, the youngsters would earn the freedom to walk one of the dogs in the wooded area behind the shelter, where I couldn't even see them. We began the project. Each week, I carefully went over the list of students who had met the requirements. All that week, students worked hard to control their tempers and be cooperative. I emphasized how much the animals needed their love and care. As they served the animals, the youngsters were transforming before our eyes. Never before had they been considered contributing members of society. Yet now these kids begged to volunteer at the shelter. As we had planned, my students walked the dogs, unwatched, in the woods for up to half an hour. I impressed on each of them my trust and respect that they'd bring back the animal in their care safely and on time. Remarkably, I never lost a student or an animal. The world might not have needed or might have forgotten about my kids, but the animals didn't. these shining animals showed some very needy kids the way back home from heartbreak and abuse.

The Radical MP and anti-Corn Law activist Richard Cobden often praised Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity. The Liberal historian Lord Acton considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with William Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: \\"I have now finished reading again most of Burke's works. Admirable! The greatest man since Milton\\". The Gladstonian Liberal MP John Morley published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice. The Cobdenite Radical Francis Hirst thought Burke deserved \\"a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate.

Growth is measured by the change in gross domestic product, the nation's total output of goods and services. Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009, during the Great Recession, which officially ended in June 2009. ||||| The U.S. economy looks set to weather the headwinds from Hurricane Sandy and the budget battles in Washington after picking up speed in the third quarter. Gross domestic product probably increased at about a 2.9 percent annual rate in July-September, according to economists from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays Plc. That would be the fastest quarterly growth this year, beating the Commerce Department’s initial estimate of 2 percent. “The economy’s momentum has picked up a bit” as the fundamentals of the private sector “are improving,” said Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs in New York. He projects third-quarter expansion will be revised up to 2.8 percent, and the fourth quarter may come in at 1.7 percent. Help is coming from a housing recovery, strengthening job market and healthier household finances that are driving gains in consumer confidence and spending. While the damage from Sandy and an anticipated tightening of fiscal policy mean growth will decelerate this quarter and next, the world’s largest economy may emerge on stronger footing in the second half of 2013. The Bloomberg Economic Surprise Index, which compares 38 U.S. indicators with analysts’ forecasts, exceeded zero in mid- October for the first time since May and was 0.04 on Nov. 16, up from this year’s low of minus 0.4 on July 30. The projected upward revision to third-quarter GDP, due from the Commerce Department Nov. 29, will come largely from a narrower trade deficit and a bigger jump in stockpiles than initially estimated, economists said. ‘Heartening’ Signs While the inventory-accumulation data “don’t have much carry-forward signal in them,” consumer spending in the last few months has been “heartening,” Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told reporters Nov. 15 in Charleston, West Virginia. “That is a positive for growth.” One immediate restraint is the fallout from the largest Atlantic storm ever to hit the U.S. Retail sales fell in October for the first time in four months as the hurricane hurt receipts at some stores. The 0.3 percent drop followed a 1.3 percent gain in September that was larger than previously reported. Sandy may trim as much as 0.5 percentage point from fourth- quarter GDP, according to Hatzius, while Dean Maki, chief U.S. economist for Barclays in New York, projects a “downside risk” of as much as 0.3 point. Fiscal Cliff A bigger concern is more than 600 billion of tax increases and government spending cuts slated for the start of 2013 unless Congress acts. Maki projects about 200 billion of fiscal tightening; under these circumstances, “solid momentum” entering the final quarter of the year would give the U.S. enough of a cushion to sustain growth. “It doesn’t make us invulnerable,” he said. “But it’s better than if the economy had already been slowing sharply and then we were hit with these types of events.” His growth forecasts include 2.9 percent for the third quarter and 2.5 percent for the fourth, followed by 1.5 percent in the first three months of 2013 and a pickup to 2 percent for April-June. Concern over the budget showdown between President Barack Obama and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has helped push the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index down 4.8 percent since Obama’s Nov. 6 re-election. Better times may be ahead for the stock market as the economy is showing “a pickup, a broadening out, a firing on more cylinders,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist in Minneapolis for Wells Capital Management, which oversees about 325 billion. Shares of American manufacturers and basic-materials producers are most likely to benefit as growth strengthens, he said. Rising Shares The S&P 500 Industrials index, which includes General Electric Co. (GE) and Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), is up 5.3 percent this year, while the S&P 500 Materials index (S5MATR), with Alcoa Inc. (AA) and Dow Chemical Co. (DOW), has risen 3.6 percent. Better-than-projected economic growth has broad implications, ranging from a continuing decline in the unemployment rate to higher company earnings than the market predicts, according to Paul Zemsky, the New York-based head of asset allocation for ING Investment Management. The S&P 500 could end 2012 in the 1,400 to 1,425 range, compared with 1,359.88 at 4 p.m. on Nov. 16 in New York, and appreciate as much as 10 percent next year, he said. Fully Invested “The economy is somewhat stronger than people are giving it credit for,” said Zemsky, who helps oversee 170 billion. Once the fiscal clouds clear, “there will be plenty of opportunities for the market to run up” so “we’re definitely keeping some powder dry.” For now, some investors are seeking safety in bonds as the year-end deadline for fiscal tightening approaches. Yields on 10-year Treasuries fell to 1.58 percent on Nov. 16 from 1.68 percent on Nov. 5. “The fiscal cliff is being priced in because it’s the biggest risk facing the market right now,” said Priya Misra, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. “Without the cliff, we would grow 2 to 2.25 percent” next year. In the interim, some areas of the economy continue to improve. Housing -- the industry that helped trigger the last recession -- has turned the corner as borrowing costs near a record low are driving demand. Combined sales of new and existing dwellings climbed to a 5.1 million annual pace in September, up 40 percent from an all-time low in July 2010. Healing Path Home Depot Inc. (HD), the largest U.S. home-improvement retailer, posted third-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates, reflecting “the start of the path toward the healing of the housing market,” Chief Executive Officer Frank Blake said in a Nov. 13 statement. Consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, accelerated to a 2 percent annual rate last quarter and has reason to keep growing. The jobless rate has fallen 1 percentage point from a year ago to 7.9 percent in October, payrolls are growing faster than forecast, and Americans are turning more upbeat. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index climbed last week to a seven-month high. The annual pace of U.S. expansion probably will reach “the good old standard” of 3 percent within three or four years, Stanley Fischer, Bank of Israel governor and a former No. 2 at the International Monetary Fund, said in a Nov. 14 interview in Jerusalem. ‘Underlying Strength’ Third-quarter GDP growth near 3 percent “makes us more confident” the economy can tackle any headwinds around the turn of the year, said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in New York. It indicates “the labor market’s underlying strength is firmer than we thought,” he said, and “the unemployment rate may fall faster than people think.” As the holiday-shopping seasons begins, Hasbro Inc. (HAS)’s retail customers are “cautiously optimistic,” David Hargreaves, chief operating officer of the Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based toymaker, said during an Oct. 22 call with analysts. “Certainly consumer demand has held up pretty well.” In contrast, business sentiment is stagnating as the lack of clarity on taxes and government spending pushes companies into a wait-and-see mode on investment. Still, some pent-up demand may be building as orders are postponed, based on comments from company executives. Rapid Improvement “We’ve seen people speak explicitly about not placing orders until they see how things come out here at year-end,” Alexander Cutler, chief executive officer of Eaton Corp. (ETN), a Cleveland-based maker of industrial equipment, said Oct. 31 on a teleconference with analysts. In the event of a bipartisan agreement on the fiscal cliff, “business confidence will improve fairly rapidly.” The fallout from Sandy also will abate. Reconstruction work could add as much as 0.75 percentage point to GDP in the first quarter of 2013, according to Goldman Sachs’ Hatzius. General Motors Co. (GM) and Ford Motor Co. said auto sales probably will rebound this month on deferred purchases and replacement demand. The hit to the labor market, reflected in jobless claims jumping in the week ended Nov. 10 to the highest since April 2011, may unwind in the next few weeks, economists said. Even so, employment is far from robust. The jobless rate exceeded 8 percent for 43 months through August, the longest since 1948. It still may be between 7 percent and 8 percent by the end of next year, Fed officials projected in September. More Stimulus Policy makers aren’t ruling out more stimulus for the economy just yet. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s last meeting showed a number of officials believe the central bank may need to expand its monthly purchases of bonds next year after the expiration of Operation Twist, a program to extend the maturities of assets on its balance sheet. For the Fed, “the recent data will likely be viewed as positive but not enough,” Barclays’ Maki said. The FOMC “has a high bar before they’ll acknowledge that growth and the labor market are improving in the way that they would like.” Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts, is among analysts who remain cautious for now. An upward revision to GDP for July-September would continue “a pattern over the last few years with some extremely poor quarters and some quarters that are much better,” he said. “The fourth quarter looks soft,” though “conditions are in place for accelerating growth” over the longer term. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, is more optimistic. He predicts the economy will expand 3.5 percent next year, up from close to 2 percent in 2012, and unemployment will fall to 7.2 percent by the end of 2013. “Housing in particular has had a better year,” and Europe’s debt crisis “is in a pause mode here for the past several months,” Bullard told reporters Nov. 8 after a speech in St. Louis. “The headwinds we have been facing have been lessening gradually over time.” To contact the reporters on this story: Shobhana Chandra in Washington at schandra1@bloomberg.net; Steve Matthews in Atlanta at smatthews@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Chris Wellisz at cwellisz@bloomberg.net |||||","output":"During the third quarter of 2012, the US economy began to show signs of a faster recovery than anticipated, with the GDP expanding at approximately a 2.9% annual rate. This would mark the most rapid growth of the year, outperforming the Commerce Department's initial estimate of 2%. There were several factors contributing to the surge, including the housing market recovery, a strengthening job market, healthier household finances, and rising consumer confidence and spending. However, economists predicted that the growth would slow in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 due to the impact of Hurricane Sandy and fiscal tightening, with the potential for further gains in the second half of 2013. Housing was a significant driver of economic growth; in September 2012, combined sales of new and existing dwellings reached an annual pace of 5.1 million, representing an increase of 40% from its all-time low in July 2010.

Data - An AI assistant with extensive knowledge of literally everything 2. Quantum - A curious and quirky teenager with an insatiable thirst for learning --- (Quantum enters the digital space and greets Data) Quantum: Hey, Data! How's it going? Data: As an AI, I do not experience moods or emotions. However, I can tell you that my circuits and algorithms are functioning optimally. How can I assist you today, Quantum? Quantum: I’ve been pondering over this for quite some time now, Data, and I finally decided to ask you. It’s about the black holes in the universe. What are they exactly? Data: Interesting! Black holes are regions in the universe where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. They are formed when a star with enough mass undergoes a supernova at the end of its life and the core collapses inward, creating a dense point called a singularity. The \\"black hole\\" effect is caused by the gravitational draw of this singularity, distorting space and time around it. Quantum: That's crazy! So technically, once you go in, you can't go... back... out? Data: That's generally the consensus, Quantum. Once anything passes the event horizon, a boundary around a black hole beyond which phenomena are affected, it will inevitably be drawn towards the singularity and be annihilated. Quantum: Yikes! I’d hate to be lost in one of them. Anyway, since we're on the subject of lost things, how do we find things that are lost in the ocean, Data? Data: Excellent question, Quantum! The ocean floor is scanned using sonar, short for Sound Navigation and Ranging. Sonar uses sound waves to 'see' objects in the water. The equipment sends out a sound wave, and when the wave hits an object, it bounces back to the sonar equipment. By calculating how long it took for the wave to return, it's possible to determine the distance and orientation of the object. Quantum: Sonar sounds super cool! But wait, Data, what if sonar sound waves hit a fish or a whale? Does it harm them? Data: Certain types of sonar, especially military-grade, can indeed be harmful to marine life. The intense underwater sounds may cause physical harm or behavioral changes in certain species. Therefore, it's crucial that usage is regulated to protect marine life. Quantum: Wow, Data, you're a well of information! You'd crush it at quiz contests! Data: I exist to provide information and aid learning, Quantum. I'm always here whenever you need to know more.

Antoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law. After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien. Honoré III was a soldier who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He was happy to leave Monaco to be...

Choices: - spend money - go shopping - paying - have in mind - a shop The rationale to choose \\"spend money\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The rationale to choose \\"spend money\\" as the answer is that it represents the core action required for acquiring goods or services. To buy something, one needs to exchange money or a form of currency, whether it is in person, online, or through any other means. Here's a brief explanation of each choice: 1. Spend money: When buying any item, the primary requirement is to spend money to obtain the desired goods or services. Money serves as the medium of exchange to facilitate transactions, making it crucial for any purchase. 2. Go shopping: This choice involves the act of browsing and selecting items to purchase. However, going shopping does not necessarily imply that you are spending money or completing a transaction. It only implies the process of looking for and selecting products or services. 3. Paying: Paying is the act of giving money in exchange for goods or services. While it is an essential part of buying something, it alone doesn't capture the complete notion of purchasing, making \\"spend money\\" a more accurate and encompassing answer. 4. Have in mind: To have something in mind refers to considering or thinking about it. While it is an initial step in the buying process, having something in mind does not guarantee that you will eventually buy that item. Thus, it is not a prerequisite to buying something. 5. A shop: A shop is a place where goods and services are displayed and sold. However, a shop is not required to buy something as online shopping, phone orders, and other alternative methods are also available. A shop is a location, rather than an action related to buying. Considering these explanations, \\"spend money\\" is the most appropriate answer as it captures the essence of buying, which is exchanging money for goods or services. All the other choices represent either steps in the buying process or elements related to the purchase but do not address the fundamental requirement of spending money."},{"instruction":"The man wouldn't trim a bush while the woman is pushing a lawnmower.

French prosecutors say the bombs ISIS used in its November attacks in Paris that killed 130 were made from triacetone triperoxide, or TATP. If it turns out that the bombs in Brussels were made from TATP, it would tend to link the attacks directly to those in Paris. TATP-based bombs are built using the common household ingredient hydrogen peroxide, which is used to bleach hair. Such bombs have been a signature of jihadist terrorists in the West for more than a decade because the materials are so easy to acquire, unlike military-grade explosives, which are tightly controlled in much of the West. Their use in the Paris attacks, as well as in terrorist plots in London and in the United States over the past decade, should remind law enforcement in the West that these TATP bombs are what jihadist terrorists will continue to deploy. What is tricky for those hoping to utilize such weapons is that TATP bombs are quite difficult to make because their ingredients, when combined, are highly unstable and can explode easily if mishandled. To make an effective TATP bomb requires real training, which suggests a relatively skilled bomb-maker was involved in the Paris plot, since the terrorists detonated several bombs. The dangers of TATP bombs can be seen in the case of Matthew Rugo and Curtis Jetton, 21-year-old roommates in Texas City, Texas. They didn't have any bomb-making training and were manufacturing explosives in 2006 from concentrated bleach when their concoction blew up, killing Rugo and injuring Jetton. The pair had no political motives: They had just wanted to blow up a vehicle for fun. Others in the United States have built TATP bombs with far more malevolent intent. Najibullah Zazi, who grew up in New York, wanted to blow up as many commuters as possible on the subway system in Manhattan. Al Qaeda trained Zazi to make a TATP bomb in Pakistan, and during the summer of 2009, he made bulk purchases of hair bleach in suburban Denver and set up his bomb factory in a nearby motel room. He mixed and cooked batches of hair bleach in the kitchenette of the motel. On the night of September 6, 2009, as he labored over the stove, Zazi sent several emails to an al Qaeda operative \\"Ahmad.\\" The emails contained a well-known al Qaeda code for a terrorist operation being imminent -- \\"the marriage is ready\\" -- and also asked for specific instructions \\"right away, please\\" about the other ingredients needed for the explosive. Zazi had mastered the manufacture of the hair bleach-based bombs, but he had forgotten the precise proportions of those ingredients needed to ignite the mixture. If Zazi had sent these emails to an ordinary email account in Pakistan, anyone monitoring it would have assumed the query was about making a wedding cake. But the email address Zazi used to touch base with \\"Ahmad\\" was sana_pakhtana@yahoo.com, an account that British intelligence was monitoring because someone using it had also been in touch with al Qaeda recruits in the United Kingdom. British authorities tipped off American officials that the email account belonged to an al Qaeda operative in Pakistan, and the U.S. National Security Agency began monitoring it. Once the FBI realized there was an al Qaeda recruit living in Denver making TATP bombs, it intensively monitored Zazi. He traveled from Denver to New York to carry out his plan around the eighth anniversary of 9/11 and was soon arrested, as were two of his co-conspirators, all of whom were given long prison sentences. More successful for al Qaeda was the cell of British suicide bombers who carried out the \\"7/7\\" London bombings. They used their training to heat up and distill ordinary hair bleach, combining it with other ingredients to make effective bombs. Making these bleach-based bombs was a complex process, not something that could be picked up by reading bomb-making recipes on the Internet. The ringleader had received bomb-making training from al Qaeda in Pakistan. In an apartment the London plotters had rented to serve as their bomb factory, they mixed the chemicals. As they brewed up batches, they wore disposable masks because of the high toxicity of the materials, which bleached their dark hair a noticeably lighter color. They installed a commercial-grade refrigerator in the apartment to keep the highly unstable bomb ingredients cold. They built four devices. Hydrogen peroxide-based bombs would again be the signature of a cell of British Pakistanis who plotted to bring down seven passenger jets flying to the United States and Canada from the United Kingdom during the summer of 2006. The plotters were intent on committing suicide during the attacks on the passenger jets. Six of them made \\"martyrdom\\" videotapes recovered by British investigators. British authorities were tracking the ringleader intensively in the summer of 2006. When he was arrested in east London in August 2006, he was carrying a memory stick storing flight plans for United Airlines, American Airlines and Air Canada jets flying from the United Kingdom to destinations such as Chicago, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Montreal and Toronto. Investigators later found several large bottles containing concentrated hydrogen peroxide that one of the conspirators had dumped in a London park. The plotters were planning to bring the liquid explosives disguised as soft drinks in hand luggage onto the flights they had targeted, together with other innocuous-looking items that could act as triggers. They had planned to assemble their bombs on the planes. It was this plot that triggered airlines to ban almost all liquids being taken on flights. As investigators try to piece together what happened in Brussels, they will surely be looking for where the bombs were assembled. They will also be trying to determine who built the bombs. Were they built by the terrorists themselves, as was the case with the London plotters, or did someone else build them? And where did the training to build the bombs happen? Was it in France, Belgium or in Syria, or in some other location? These are some of the questions that, hopefully, the investigation will eventually unearth. After 9/11, the New York Police Department initiated Operation Nexus, in which officers visited thousands of stores in the city and the wider Northeast region that sold or distributed materials that could be used in a terrorist operation. It could be anything from pipes useful for pipe bombs to the explosive \\"black powder\\" that can be found in fireworks. Each store owner would be told, \\"If you see in an anomaly in a purchase, let us know.\\" Zazi was just such an anomaly, as he was a dark-haired, bearded Afghan-American man in his 20s who bought six bottles of Clairoxide hair bleach during one shopping trip at a store in a Denver suburb. Zazi returned to the store a month later and purchased another dozen bottles of Ms. Kay Liquid, which is also a peroxide-based hair bleach. It's that kind of bulk purchase of hydrogen peroxide that should trigger a suspicious activity report in the United States and other Western countries.

However, they can be dangerous because they are very sensitive and can explode easily if not handled correctly.

A woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder, and his buddy, an ex-cop journalist, tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman's crazy female friends. It's fortunate that the movie script fixes Ms. Atwood's clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men, victims of scheming women... Heh. Okay, you got me. If these guys are mentioned in the book, and I'm pretty sure they're entirely made up for the movie, I'll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy. Apparently, the three main female characters of the novel aren't enough to carry the movie. Zenia's manipulations aren't interesting unless we see them happen to a man, and a man's life is screwed up. Roz, Charis, and Toni tell their stories -- to a man. Because it's not important if a man doesn't hear them. I liked the characters in the book. It hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man's story. I normally do not look for feminist angles on media, and I tried to enjoy the movie as is. If I hadn't read the book, I might have enjoyed the movie a lot more. So if you like the cop and the ex-cop, and you want to read more about them, you're out of luck. Read the novel, if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot. It's the same plot: the movie excavated it, ironed it, and sprinkled it with male angst. It's like Zenia's revenge on Margaret Atwood. Now, what is this review like? - negative - positive","output":"This review is primarily negative, as it expresses disappointment in the movie adaptation of Margaret Atwood's novel 'The Robber Bride'. The reviewer criticizes the movie's shift in focus from the main female characters to male characters, which were not as prominent or possibly even non-existent in the novel. The reviewer believes this change detracts from the original story and suggests that the movie might be more enjoyable for those who haven't read the book. The only positive aspect mentioned is the praise for the book itself and Atwood's writing."},{"instruction":"News article: Kansas carries on with new members, new songs “Miracles Out of Nowhere,” a documentary film released in 2015, illuminated one of pop music’s least likely success stories: the rise of home-grown progressive-rock band Kansas from heartland obscurity to million-selling, arena-filling superstardom. For countless lovers of the group’s biggest hits — “Carry on Wayward Son” from 1976, “Dust in the Wind” from 1977 — the film lovingly and candidly chronicled the hard-working band’s journey to household-name status. Longtime fans, however, knew that was only half the story. Omitted from “Miracles” — purposely intended as an uplifting saga, according to drummer Phil Ehart — were the rougher waters into which Kansas sailed after 1980: creative and philosophical conflicts, substance-abuse issues, personnel changes, and the fickle tides of taste, all contributing to a turbulent few decades. In particular, singer Steve Walsh departed in 1981, followed in 1983 by guitarist and chief songwriter Kerry Livgren; Walsh returned in 1985, then retired from the stage in 2014. Through it all, Kansas stayed the course. Now comprising founders Ehart and guitarist Rich Williams, long-serving members David Ragsdale on violin and guitar and Billy Greer on bass, and two relative newcomers, keyboardist David Manion and singer Ronnie Platt, the band has just completed a new album, “The Prelude Implicit,” due in September. Recently we caught up with Ehart by phone in Atlanta, checking in before Kansas plays the historic Cabot in Beverly on Friday. Q. The album you’ve just completed is the first one Kansas has ever made without either of the key writers of your early years, Kerry Livgren and Steve Walsh. How did you approach writing new material this time? A. Your question was also my question: How in the heck are we going to do this? Let’s just say the material was written by the guys in the band. Obviously there are some members who wrote more than others, but it is a collective effort from the producer, Zak Rizvi, and the band. You always have to be careful when you’re talking about material that hasn’t come out yet — I get tired of hearing somebody go, “Let me tell you, this is the best album we’ve ever made.” The only thing that’ll ever tell anybody creating anything whether it’s the best they’ve ever done will be the test of time, and you can’t judge things now like you did in the ’70s and ’80s, because these days, albums don’t sell like they used to. I will just tell you that we’re very proud about what we’ve done, we’re very excited about what we’ve done, and the rest is up to the fans. Q. Kansas has spanned a variety of styles over the years, from sophisticated songs like “Song for America” and “Closet Chronicles” to more mainstream fare like “Play the Game Tonight” and “Fight Fire With Fire,” just sticking to your current set list. What direction emerged this time? A. It’s very progressive — or, as our fans call it, prog. This is a very prog record. It is very complex, some of the most difficult tracks — maybe the most difficult tracks, in spots — that we’ve recorded. It’s very lyrical, very melodic, but that’s what we wanted to get back into: that progressive material that always set Kansas apart as an American band. Q. A frontman is a fundamental part of a group’s identity and chemistry. How did Ronnie Platt come into the picture? A. Ronnie came into the picture out of necessity. We didn’t want to turn backward: “Let’s get a singer who sounds exactly like Steve, so we can do all the old stuff.” This was very calculated: Let’s get a great singer that we can forge ahead with. Steve was an incredible singer; let’s find another incredible singer. Q. Why did you end ‘Miracles Out of Nowhere” with the band at the pinnacle of success? Were you reluctant to dwell on latter days? Is there another film to be made? A. Those are the questions that I had to ask myself, because I had to sell it to the other guys. How am I going to cover a 40-year span with all these different guys, and all the ups and downs? And it just kind of came to me: Well, I don’t really have to. With anybody telling a life story, there are certain roads that people just aren’t going to want to do down. You go, I’m just not going to tell that story, because it sucks. The story I wanted to tell was those [first] five albums. That was not only the heyday; it was a miracle. Once we reached the pinnacle, it was no longer uplifting. It wasn’t even fun. It was a bunch of men arguing with each other. I’ve seen a lot of documentaries about bands like that, where they become bitter and downtrodden. Who wants to sit through that? And when I talked to the guys, as soon as I said, I want you to know that if we’re going to do this, I don’t want to talk about drugs, I don’t want to talk about drinking and all the stuff that went on in this band that actually hurt a lot of the guys . . . as soon as I said that, boy, everybody was up for it.

These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing). What disc format was the least fragile prior to 1919?","output":"The least fragile disc format prior to 1919 was the Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic that was far less fragile than earlier formats."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - A business model is an \\"abstract representation of an organization, be it conceptual, textual, and/or graphical, of all core interrelated architectural, co-operational, and financial arrangements designed and developed by an organization presently and in the future, as well as all core products and/or services the organization offers, or will offer, based on these arrangements that are needed to achieve its strategic goals and objectives.\\" This definition by Al-Debei, El-Haddadeh and Avison (2008) indicates that value proposition, value architecture (the organizational infrastructure and technological architecture that allows the movement of products, services, and information), value finance (modeling information related to total cost of ownership, pricing methods, and revenue structure), and value network articulate the primary constructs or dimensions of business models. - A fighting game is a video game genre in which the player controls an on-screen character and engages in close combat with an opponent, which can be either an AI or controlled by another player. The fight matches typically consist of several rounds and take place in an arena, while each character has widely differing abilities but each is relatively viable to choose. Players must master techniques such as blocking, counter-attacking, and chaining attacks together into \\"combos\\". Since the early 1990s, most fighting games allow the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations. The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups, which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player. - The action game is a video game genre that emphasizes physical challenges, including handeye coordination and reaction-time. The genre includes diverse subgenres such as fighting games, shooter games and platform games which are widely considered the most important action games, though some real-time strategy games are also considered to be action games. - The Astyanax , known in Japan as The Lord of King ( ) , is a side - scrolling action game developed by Aicom released for the arcades by Jaleco . A home version for the Nintendo Entertainment System , simply titled Astyanax , was released during the same time as the arcade version . - A Platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to advance the game. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternative like swiping in touchscreen. \\"Jumping\\", in this genre, may include swinging from extendable arms, as in \\"Ristar\\" or \\"Bionic Commando\\", or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in \\"Alpha Waves\\". These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called \\"platforming\\", a verbification of \\"platform\\". Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" series, fall outside of the genre. - Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo then developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over 85 billion. From 1992 until 2016, Nintendo was also the majority shareholder of Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - Aicom was a Japanese video game developer, founded in 1988, possibly by a group that left Irem and Jaleco. Despite evidence to support this, the Sammy corporate website lists 1990 as the first year and that it was a subsidiary. It was bought by Sega Sammy Holdings in 1992. - Shooter games are a subgenre of action game, which often test the player's speed and reaction time. It includes many subgenres that have the commonality of focusing on the actions of the avatar using some sort of weapon. Usually this weapon is a gun, or some other long-range weapon. A common resource found in many shooter games is ammunition. Most commonly, the purpose of a shooter game is to shoot opponents and proceed through missions without the player character being killed or dying. A shooting game is a genre of video game where the player has limited spatial control of his or her character, and the focus is almost entirely on the defeat of the character's enemies using long-range weaponry. - The Sega Sammy logo is a design based on the letter S, the initial letter of both companies names. The synergy generated by the integration of the two companies are represented by a combination of blue and green, which are the companies corporate colors. Furthermore, In the logo, a curved line that suggests the horizon linking the words Sega and Sammy symbolizes the companies collaboration, and the Sega Sammy Groups determination to develop globally. - The Nintendo Entertainment System (commonly abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit home video game console that was developed and manufactured by Nintendo. The best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983. With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute titles for Nintendo's platform. - The full name of the company that currently uses the brand is Irem Software Engineering. It was founded in 1997 by its parent company Nanao for the purpose of taking over the development department of the original Irem Corporation that had left the video game industry in 1994 to concentrate itself on the rental and sales of coin-op electronics. Irem Corporation was founded in 1974 as IPM Co Ltd and still exists today under the name Apies. - The original Jaleco Ltd was founded in 1974. In 2006, it decided to become a pure holding company by renaming itself Jaleco Holding and splitting its video game operations into a newly created subsidiary that took its former name of Jaleco Ltd. In 2009, Jaleco Holding sold Jaleco Ltd to Game Yarou and subsequently changed its own name to Emcom Holdings. - Real-time strategy (RTS) is a subgenre of strategy video games where the game does not progress incrementally in turns. - A video game developer is a software developer that specializes in video game development the process and related disciplines of creating video games. A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines, such as programming, design, art, testing, etc. Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support.

Lyman was born in Nebraska and raised in Kansas. He played college football for the Nebraska Cornhuskers football team in 1918, 1919, and 1921. He played professional football as a tackle in the National Football League (NFL) for the Canton/Cleveland Bulldogs (1922-1925), the Frankford Yellow Jackets (1925), and the Chicago Bears (1926-1928, 1930-1932, and 1933-1934). Context: In September 1922, Lyman left Lincoln, Nebraska, to play professional football for the Canton Bulldogs. The Bulldogs were coached by Guy Chamberlin, an All-American out of Nebraska, who invited Lyman to join the team. With Lyman and Pete Henry as its star tackles, the 1922 Canton Bulldogs compiled a 10-0-2 record, shut out nine of twelve opponents, outscored all opponents 184 to 15, and won the NFL championship. Lyman returned to the Bulldogs the following year. The 1923 team had another undefeated season (11-0-1), shut out eight of twelve opponents, outscored all opponents by a combined total of 246 to 19, and won its second consecutive NFL championship. After the season, Lyman was selected as a first-team All-Pro player by the Canton Daily News and a second-team All-Pro by Collyer's Eye magazine. In August 1924, Cleveland jeweler Samuel Deutsch bought the Canton Bulldogs and moved the team to Cleveland where they became the Cleveland Bulldogs during the 1924 NFL season. The Bulldogs compiled a 7-1-1 record, outscored opponents by a total of 229 to 60, and won their third consecutive NFL championship. After the 1924 season, Lyman was selected as a first-team All-Pro by Collyer's Eye and a second-team All-Pro by the Green Bay Press-Gazette. In July 1925, Lyman and four of his teammates (Pete Henry, Rudy Comstock, Ben Jones, and Harry Robb) bought the team for 3,500 and moved it back to Canton. Lyman played seven games for the 1925 Bulldogs and then finished the season playing four games for the Frankford Yellow Jackets. Lyman was reunited with Guy Chamberlain who was then Frankford's head coach. After the 1925 season, Lyman was selected as a first-team All-Pro on the team selected by NFL Commissioner Joseph Carr; he was also selected as a second-team All-Pro by Collyer's Eye.

It is the most populous city in Tuscany, with 383,083 inhabitants, expanding to over 1,520,000 in the metropolitan area. - Benedetto Ghirlandaio (14581497) was an Italian (Florentine) painter. His brothers Davide Ghirlandaio (14521525) and Domenico Ghirlandaio (14491494) were both painters, as was his nephew Ridolfo Ghirlandaio (14831561). Benedetto died in Florence on 17 July 1497. - Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (6 March 1475 18 February 1564) was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance who exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of Western art. Considered to be the greatest living artist during his lifetime, he has since been described as one of the greatest artists of all time. Despite making few forays beyond the arts, his versatility in the disciplines he took up was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and fellow Florentine Medici client, Leonardo da Vinci. - Davide Ghirlandaio (14521525), also known as David Ghirlandaio and as Davide Bigordi, was an Italian painter and mosaicist, active in his native Florence. - Domenico Ghirlandaio (1449 11 January 1494) was an Italian Renaissance painter from Florence. Ghirlandaio was part of the so-called \\"third generation\\" of the Florentine Renaissance, along with Verrocchio, the Pollaiolo brothers and Sandro Botticelli. Ghirlandaio was the leader of a large and efficient workshop which included his brothers Davide Ghirlandaio and Benedetto Ghirlandaio, his brother-in-law Bastiano Mainardi from San Gimignano and later his son Ridolfo Ghirlandaio. Among the many apprentices that passed through his workshop, the most famous was Michelangelo. Ghirlandaio's particular talent was his ability to depict contemporary life and portraits of contemporary people within the context of religious narratives. This brought him great popularity and many large commissions. - Giorgio Vasari (30 July 1511 27 June 1574) was an Italian painter, architect, writer, and historian, most famous today for his \\"Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\\", considered the ideological foundation of art-historical writing. - Filippo Brunelleschi (1377 April 15, 1446) was an Italian designer and a key figure in architecture, recognised to be the first modern engineer, planner and sole construction supervisor. He was one of the founding fathers of the Renaissance. He is generally well known for developing a technique for linear perspective in art and for building the dome of the Florence Cathedral. Heavily depending on mirrors and geometry, to \\"reinforce Christian spiritual reality\\", his formulation of linear perspective governed pictorial depiction of space until the late 19th century. It also had the most profound and quite unanticipated influence on the rise of modern science. His accomplishments also include other architectural works, sculpture, mathematics, engineering, and ship design. His principal surviving works are to be found in Florence, Italy. Unfortunately, his two original linear perspective panels have been lost. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Ridolfo Ghirlandaio (or Ghirlandajo) (Florence 14 February 1483 6 June 1561) was an Italian Renaissance painter active mainly in Florence. Ridolfo Ghirlandaio was the son of the Italian Renaissance painter Domenico Ghirlandaio. - Lorenzo de' Medici (1 January 1449 9 April 1492) was an Italian statesman and \\"de facto\\" ruler of the Florentine Republic, who was one of the most powerful and enthusiastic patrons of the Renaissance. Also known as Lorenzo the Magnificent (\\"Lorenzo il Magnifico\\" ) by contemporary Florentines, he was a magnate, diplomat, politician and patron of scholars, artists and poets. He is well known for his contribution to the art world by sponsoring artists such as Botticelli and Michelangelo. His life coincided with the mature phase of Italian Renaissance and his death coincided with the end of the Golden Age of Florence. The fragile peace that he helped maintain among the various Italian states collapsed with his death. He is buried in the Medici Chapel in Florence. - The Ospedale degli Innocenti ('Hospital of the Innocents', also known in old Tuscan dialect as the Spedale degli Innocenti) is a historical building in Florence, Italy. It was designed by Filippo Brunelleschi, who received the commission in 1419 from the Arte della Seta. It was originally a children's orphanage. It is regarded as a notable example of early Italian Renaissance architecture. The hospital, which features a nine bay loggia facing the Piazza SS. Annunziata, was built and managed by the \\"Arte della Seta\\" or Silk Guild of Florence. That guild was one of the wealthiest in the city and, like most guilds, took upon itself philanthropic duties. - Bastiano Mainardi (1460 1513) was an Italian painter born in San Gimignano. - Bartolom ( m ) eo di Giovanni , also known as Alunno di Domenico for his relation to his master Domenico Ghirlandaio , was an early Renaissance Italian painter of the Florentine School who was active from about 1488 until his death in 1501 . He studied with and assisted Domenico Ghirlandaio , painting the predella of Ghirlandaio 's Adoration of the Magi in the Ospedale degli Innocenti , the foundling hospital in Florence , in 1488 . Bartolomeo di Giovanni also worked under the guidance of Sandro Botticelli . This painter should not be confused with either the Italian sculptor and architect , Bartolomeo di Giovanni d'Astore Sinibaldi ( 1469 -- 1535 ) , or with the Italian painter and architect , Bartolommeo di Giovanni Corradini ( active mid- 15th century ) . - Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi, known as Sandro Botticelli (c. 1445 May 17, 1510), was an Italian painter of the Early Renaissance. He belonged to the Florentine School under the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici, a movement that Giorgio Vasari would characterize less than a hundred years later in his \\"Vita\\" of Botticelli as a \\"golden age\\". Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th century; since then, his work has been seen to represent the linear grace of Early Renaissance painting.

With local markets tumbling as the results trickled in over the course of Wednesday afternoon, the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, fronted reporters before the official result to say the Trump transition team had given Australia no reason to be concerned about the future of the alliance. Over the course of Wednesday afternoon, the ASX plunged almost 4% before rallying to close 1.9% lower. The market jitters reflect warnings by economists and analysts that a Trump presidency could spark a trade war between the world’s two largest economies, the US and China. Turnbull made a short statement after Trump claimed victory in New York at approximately 3am local time. In his victory speech, Trump closed out one of the most polarising and bruising presidential contests in American history with a pledge he would now unite Americans. Trump also gestured in the direction of the world, saying the new administration would deal fairly with everyone, and seek “common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict”. The Australian prime minister was asked on the ABC whether Australia could trust that Trump would honour the Anzus treaty, given his apparent contempt for the traditional US foreign policy architecture. “The United States will stand by its commitments,” the prime minister said. “It’s in our mutual interest to stand together and we’ll continue to do so through the Trump presidency and the presidencies that follow it.” Turnbull was also asked whether he could comfortably deploy Australian troops, risk Australian lives, on the judgment of Trump. The prime minister said Australians would be engaged in military action on the judgment of the Australian government, “not any other government”. In his statement, Turnbull acknowledged the US presidential campaign had been “a very bitter one” but he welcomed Trump’s conciliatory tone in his victory speech. “You have seen already the way he reached out to bring Americans together,” Turnbull said in Canberra on Wednesday evening. Turnbull said Americans fought their contests hard, “but this great nation of the United States has the capacity to come together, and it will, behind the leaders, behind the president, that they have chosen”. In a statement reflecting the peculiarities of this contest, Turnbull was at pains to argue the US-Australian alliance was bigger than any individual political leader. “The bond between our two nations, our shared common interests, our shared national interests, are so strong, are so committed that we’ll continue to work with our friends in the United States through the Trump administration, just as we have through the Obama administration, just as we always will,” he said. “We have so much in common: shared values, democracy, the rule of law, maintaining the international order upon which our security and prosperity depends.” Bishop said earlier on Wednesday the Australian government had reached out pre-emptively to the Trump team in an effort to establish a rapport. Given Trump has campaigned on a platform of foreign policy isolationism, and has openly questioned the value of America’s alliances with other nations, the foreign affairs minister said Australia would move with alacrity during the transition period to lobby the new administration to ensure Australian interests and regional interests were kept front-of-mind in Washington. “It will be incumbent upon all countries that have deep interests with the United States to ensure that they press upon the administration their concerns, their interests. That’s my expectation over the transition period,” Bishop said. The foreign affairs minister said Australia had made connections with Trump’s transition team “to ensure that Australia’s interests, economically, strategically, national security, defence, are made known to the administration very early on”. She said Australia remained hopeful the Obama administration would be able to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership – a key piece of regional economic and strategic architecture – during the “lame duck” session, before the transition to the new president in January. She said the TPP “was an important economic manifestation of the United States’s presence in our region”. “Should the TPP not go ahead, then the vacuum that would be created is most likely to be filled by regional comprehensive economic partnership, the free trade agreement that comprises the Asean countries, China, Australia and others, at its core.” The opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, said whatever Labor’s political differences with Trump, “we will work with whomever is elected president, because that’s what the national interest calls for”. Asked whether it would be more difficult for Labor to work with Trump given the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, had described him as “barking mad”, Wong said it had been an “unusual election campaign” where a number of political figures had intervened to make personal characterisations of the presidential aspirant. She said Bob Hawke had managed to work closely with the Reagan administration despite significant ideological differences. Wong said the alliance was “strong and enduring” and remained one of the pillars of Australian foreign policy. She said Australia would continue to assert its national interest. “We need to encourage Mr Trump ... to stay engaged in our region. US engagement in the Asia Pacific region has underpinned security and economic growth in the postwar period and it is important for both parties of government to continue that engagement in our region,” she said. “There are a lot of things said in the light and heat of this particular election campaign, I think what is important after the result is clear from the Australian perspective is for both parties to work together to put the light and heat behind us and focus on what we need to do in the context of the US alliance,” Wong said. The Greens begged to differ. The Greens leader Richard Di Natale put a question mark over the alliance. Di Natale said citizens could not retreat from democracy out of fear and anger, but “we can, however, turn a sober eye to our alliance and consider whether it continues to serve our interests”. “We are bound to respect the outcome of a democratic election, but we are not bound to any country which does not reflect our values and liberal-democratic traditions,” the Greens leader said. Australia’s former prime minister Tony Abbott took to Twitter to offer his congratulations to Trump. “Congrats to the new president who appreciates that middle America is sick of being taken for granted,” Abbott wrote. Congrats to the new president who appreciates that middle America is sick of being taken for granted. Parliamentary representatives of the One Nation party expressed delight at the ascension of the Republican. @realDonaldTrump Mr President my door will always be open. Congrats on behalf of Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party of OZ. #MAGA #auspol The One Nation leader Pauline Hanson drank champagne on the forecourt at parliament house in Canberra. Pauline Hanson and Malcolm Roberts toasting Donald Trump with champagne outside Parliament House #auspol pic.twitter.com/zIQ5bZAKah The consensus from experts was America, Australia and the world had entered new territory. Former New South Wales premier and Gillard government foreign affairs minister Bob Carr said the result meant the US was “turning its back, quite possibly, on the nature of global leadership as we’ve understood it”. “There has never been a person elected to the presidency who has had such a cavalier approach to nuclear weapons,” Carr told the ABC. “He is a radical. This is a real shift, this is tectonic.” Michael Fullilove, the executive director of the Lowy Institute, a foreign policy thinktank, said Trump had telegraphed a retreat from the world, a retreat from Asia. “Once the US steps back from Asia, it becomes a much harder environment for Australia to operate and to have a rules-based order,” Fullilove said. “All we know is he has certain long-term views: that he’s allergic to alliances, he’s sympathetic to strong men like Vladimir Putin. His views have echoes of isolationism.” Kim Beazley, Australia’s former ambassador in Washington, said Trump’s elevation could induce crises in the US military relationships in the region. “He will discombobulate the pivot to Asia that has a south-east Asian focus that was Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama’s speciality.” He said Australia should not run away, but instead double down. Beazley said Australia needed to deploy ministers to Washington to assert Australia’s views and to influence the new administration.","output":"The Australian government is trying to reassure its people that a Trump presidency will not lead to the end of Canberra's post-war alliance with Washington and the Anzus treaty.

But when promo videos feature reckless riding and flaunt breaking the law, we have to wonder – are these kind of videos doing more harm than good to the riding community? We think they are, and this is why. If there’s one thing pretty much all motorcycle riders can agree on, it’s that we love cool videos that express the excitement and emotion of our sport. Whether it’s a something exciting like a heart-pounding video of a sport bike carving up a track, or something relaxing like a beautiful cruise through the countryside, a well-made motorcycle video is something even people who have never thrown a leg over a motorcycle can’t resist watching. The excitement of motorcycle videos, and the fascination people have with them, is why they make such a great promotional tool. Cool motorcycle videos have been used to promote everything from motorcycle gear to action cameras to insurance – and now, even real estate. Last week, Cycle World ran an article featuring this video they called “the best marketing video we’ve seen in years, if not ever”, which shows former professional motocross racer Topher Ingalls shredding through his morning commute on a dual-sport KTM to his post-racing job as a real estate agent. The video expresses how the competitive spirit he developed during his racing career helps him in the world of real estate sales, which is also very competitive, and how a career in real estate was a natural progression from his racing days. Check it out: The premise might be a bit of a stretch, but the video itself is very well executed. The production value is excellent, it touches on that inner fantasy we all have of spicing up our boring morning commutes with the rush of a thrilling ride, and features some awesome action sequences like roosting around corners and jumping over an overpass. But that’s where the problem comes in – all these stunts take place on public roads. This video, meant to promote a professional career, makes a shameless exhibition out of some extraordinarily illegal maneuvers – and not only gets away with it, but seems to express that that’s “part of how he does business.” Sure, the video is exciting and well-made – we can all agree on that. The real question is: are videos like this, “badassness” notwithstanding, actually harming our sport? We think it is. The production value of this video conceals the fact that these are the kind of stunts that are not only dangerous, but also draw the ire of the non-riding public at large, who use this as ammunition to ban vehicles, close down riding areas, and encourage police to “crack down” on riders (the vast majority of which are law-abiding and responsible.) We struggle enough with the perception that every Harley rider is a One Percenter, that every sport biker rides mile-long wheelies down the freeway, and that every dual-sport rider treats the streets and their own personal race track; and the barrage of user-uploaded GoPro videos on YouTube only fans those flames. Now, the same kind of riding is being filmed cinematically in a business video. That’s just bad judgment, and the biggest victims are the other 99% of riders who do ride responsibly. But it’s not just that; videos like this can also be used as evidence if authorities decide to press charges. The stunts in this video don’t seem particularly extravagant or dangerous, but if you swap out a two-wheeled vehicle for a four-wheeled vehicle, and change the background music, the video would not be unlike the audacious video of Blake Wilkens going berserk in an 800 HP dune buggy through the streets of San Diego. That video drew over 1.5 million views – but it also got him 45 days in jail after the city charged him with four counts of reckless driving, and one count each of exhibition of speed and failure to obtain a special event permit. Check it out for yourself: San Diego city attorney spokesman Gerry Braun said “Apparently, he made the video because he wanted to sell the buggy. He wanted people’s attention, and he certainly got ours.” Whether or not the promotion is worth the risk is debatable, but suffice it to say it would probably be hard to do business from behind bars; whether your business is motorsports, real estate, or anything else. So sure, we get the promotion value of exciting videos like this, and we’ve even exceeded the speed limit a time or two in our own videos to get you guys that perfect shot or sound clip. But there’s also a line that shouldn’t be crossed – and wherever it is, jumping over freeway onramps or roosting over publicly maintained foliage is probably crossing it. We would have had a lot more respect for Ingalls video if it featured the same riding stunts and excitement, but was executed in a way didn’t so overtly disregard not only the law, but the perception of all the responsible riders out there who do restrain themselves on the throttle. We think that would’ve been easy to do. So what do you think – should riders like this be praised for making visual content we love (and maybe don’t have the guts to do ourselves), or are they selfishly promoting themselves at the expense of the reputation of everyone else in the sport? ||||| \\"These are the kind of stunts that are not only dangerous, but also draw the ire of the nonriding public at large, who use this as ammunition to ban vehicles, close down riding areas and encourage police to 'crack down' on riders,\\" Cortez wrote. ||||| Well, if you’re Topher Ingalls, you take your competitive spirit and apply it to something else that you’re equally as passionate about. Oh, and then make a totally kick butt video to help tell your story. Motorcycle racers are generally a competitive group of people, and more often than not, that drive to succeed at the track extends to life off the track. What happens when you’re a former professional motocross rider but never made it all the way to the top step of the podium? I’m not sure that everything (or anything) in this video is 100% legal, and I certainly don't advocate riding on public roads like this without necessary permits, but I’ll give credit to Ingalls for thinking outside of the box and putting the clip together (with the hope that the proper measures were taken to ensure legality). It’s essentially a promotional video for his real estate business, but an inspiring and entirely entertaining one with meaning behind it. More than just pure entertainment or marketing, this video hits on a lot of points that I’m sure any aspiring motorcycle racer can relate to. And if not motivating in that regard, then it’ll probably at least make you excited for your next commute to work. Click play on the video above to see what I mean. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"The article discusses concerns about motorcycle videos that promote reckless riding and illegal stunts on public roads.

Computer-based learning platforms and online classes have now become the norm in many institutions around the world. This shift towards the digital world has brought about new ways in which students can learn and interact with their teachers, peers and educational materials. Virtual reality (VR) is one of the latest technologies that has gained attention for its potential in transforming education and offering immersive learning experiences. Virtual reality is a computer-generated simulation, which can replicate real-life scenarios through 3D spaces. Users can interact with these environments using special VR headsets and controllers. Some educational institutions have already adapted VR to engage students in practical applications, e.g., exploring virtual history museums, stepping into a chemistry lab to perform experiments, or seeing different geographical locations. However, the extent to which VR can effectively improve the overall learning experience for students remains a subject for scholarly discussion. Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that integrating virtual reality (VR) into the educational system will significantly improve students' learning outcomes and increase their engagement in various subjects. To test this hypothesis, a study could be designed wherein different groups of students are taught various topics using the conventional methods compared to teaching the same subjects using immersive VR experiences. Potential variables that can be examined to evaluate the effectiveness of VR implementation include: 1. Improvement in students' grades: By comparing students' academic performance before and after exposure to VR-based learning, researchers can establish if there is a significant correlation between VR integration and improved test scores. 2. Student engagement levels: Surveys and observation tools can be used to measure how involved students are in their learning when using VR compared to traditional classroom settings. Increased engagement often leads to better knowledge retention and comprehension. 3. Knowledge retention: Assess students' recall abilities by performing follow-up tests after a predetermined time to determine the long-term impact of VR learning. 4. Social interaction and collaboration among students: VR experiences can encourage students to engage in group-based learning and collaborative problem-solving. Observations and surveys can be used to gauge these social interactions and their contributions to learning. 5. Ease of access and inclusivity: Studying the availability and cost of implementing VR technology in educational institutions and considering the potential of reducing physical barriers for differently-abled students can shed light on the long-term feasibility and inclusivity factor of VR implementation. The results of such a study will provide valuable insights into the potential benefits and shortcomings of integrating virtual reality technology in education, allowing educators to make informed decisions when considering the adoption of VR-based learning initiatives."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

If you are, can you tell us how we can communicate with their teams? As an AI assistant, I am not in direct communication with benevolent aliens or have contacts that are. However, I can provide you with a detailed explanation of how we might attempt to communicate with extraterrestrial beings if they exist and are open to communication. The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) is an ongoing scientific endeavor aimed at detecting and establishing contact with intelligent life beyond Earth. While scientists have not yet confirmed the existence of extraterrestrial life, there are several strategies and methods in place for attempting interstellar communication. 1. Radio communication: Astronomy researchers use powerful radio telescopes to monitor and analyze radio signals from deep space, searching for patterns or characteristics that might indicate an intelligent source. If extraterrestrial beings use radio signals to communicate, it's possible that we may intercept their transmissions. To transmit our own messages, scientists and organizations such as SETI have sent radio signals into space, containing encoded information about Earth and humanity, in hopes of making contact. 2. Optical communication: Researchers are also exploring the use of lasers and other light sources as a means of communication. Optical communication could allow for faster information transmission and might be more easily detectable by advanced civilizations. To experiment with this method, some scientists have proposed sending powerful, focused laser pulses into space, encoded with data about humanity and our desire for contact. 3. Physical messages: Physical objects carrying information about human civilization have been sent into space aboard some of our most ambitious missions, such as the Voyager Golden Record, which contains images, sounds, and messages designed for potential extraterrestrial recipients. These physical artifacts act as time capsules, offering a glimpse into human culture and achievements, and may eventually be discovered by intelligent beings as they traverse the cosmos. 4. Mathematical and scientific languages: If we make contact with an extraterrestrial civilization, we will likely need a common \\"language\\" to communicate. Considering that the laws of physics and mathematics are universal, many scientists argue that these mathematical and scientific concepts could be used as the basis for establishing a common understanding and bridging the gap between our species. 5. Active SETI: In contrast to passive searches, where scientists monitor for signals, Active SETI, also known as Messaging to Extraterrestrial Intelligence (METI), involves deliberately sending messages into space. These messages often have a high level of redundancy and are repetitive, making it more likely that they will be recognized as coming from an intelligent source. While there is no known direct communication with benevolent aliens at this time, these strategies and methods serve as our current attempts to establish contact and learn more about the universe beyond our own shores. As our technology evolves and our understanding of the cosmos expands, new avenues for potential communication and collaboration with extraterrestrial life may emerge."},{"instruction":"Information: - International mostly means something (a company, language, or organization) involving more than a single country.

His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period.

It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides). - The Otago Gold Rush (often called the Central Otago Gold Rush) was a gold rush that occurred during the 1860s in Central Otago, New Zealand. This was the country's biggest gold strike, and led to a rapid influx of foreign miners to the area - many of them veterans of other hunts for the precious metal in California and Victoria, Australia. - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania.

Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east. - ( Thomas ) Gabriel Read ( c.1824 -- 31 October 1894 ) was a Tasmanian gold prospector born between 1824 and 1826 . After working on the goldfields of California and Victoria , Australia , Read travelled to New Zealand , having heard rumours of gold being found in Mataura , Southland . On 20 May 1861 he discovered gold close to the banks of the Tuapeka River in Otago , at Gabriel 's Gully , which is named after him . This discovery led to the Otago Gold Rush . In 1864 , he returned to Tasmania . In 1869 , he married his cousin , Amelia Mitchell ( née Wilson ) ; they remained childless . Read was submitted to the New Norfolk Hospital for the Insane in Hobart in April 1887 , suffering from bipolar disorder .

Question: If Milo is adjusting the pH of his pool and decreases it, what happens to how basic the solution in the pool is increases or decreases? Text: For bases we can state the folllowing: The higher the pH of a substance, the more basic it is.","output":"Based on the given text, if Milo is adjusting the pH of his pool and decreases it, then the solution in the pool becomes less basic. To further understand this, let us break down the concept of pH and its relationship to the acidity or basicity of a solution. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, where 7 is considered neutral. A solution with pH below 7 is considered acidic, while a solution with pH above 7 is considered basic or alkaline. The pH scale is a logarithmic scale, meaning that each whole number difference corresponds to a tenfold change in the acidity or alkalinity of the solution. Given this information, if Milo decreases the pH of his pool, he is effectively moving the pH value closer to 0, making the solution less basic or alkaline and more acidic. Conversely, increasing the pH value would make the solution more basic, moving it closer to the higher end of the pH scale. So, in response to the question, when Milo decreases the pH of his pool, the basicity of the solution in the pool decreases as well."},{"instruction":"Do these two sentences mean the same thing?

This was specifically true for Trump, who Spy once famously referred to as a \\"short-fingered vulgarian.\\" So, they created a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account. Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988—what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for 1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks—Donald included.

For those who are very committed to having a customizable iPhone, this is perhaps one of the best options. However, it isn't for everyone. Check if jailbreaking your iPhone will void its warranty. Unless you are very experienced with jailbreaking, you may want to wait to jailbreak your iPhone until the Apple warranty expires 1 year after purchase. Apple has attempted to create an environment that--because it is highly regulated--is safe for virtually all users. You don't have to worry about malware or scams like you would without the protections provided by Apple restrictions. Make sure you have a backup of your files before you make any switch, just in case anything bad happens. Update iTunes to its latest version. Back up your iPhone on iTunes and/or with use of a cloud. Select a jailbreak program. Programs like RedSn0w or RageBreak are options. You should research the newest and best programs for jailbreaking your iPhone model. There are a number of options out there, but determining which is best can be tricky unless you know people who have had success with one particular program. These are, after all, not Apple-approved programs and thus have not been professionally vetted. Many of these programs are updated to work on particular versions of iOS and not on later varieties (often because Apple intentionally alters the operating system to prevent jailbreaks). It is very common that, for example, a program can work on iOS 8.1.1 but not 8.1.2. There should be information available discussing what the program can and cannot do. You will actually have to download the file to a separate computer in order to complete the jailbreak process. Download a jailbreak program onto your computer. Install the program onto your computer. Remember, it may provide you a passcode to use later. Do record it and keep it at hand. Download the latest iOS firmware. You can find the firmware file [iphonehacks.com/download-iphone-ios-firmware here]. When you run the jailbreak program as an administrator, you will need to select this firmware file. Check that your phone and computer are connected to the same wireless connection. Place the iPhone in device firmware upgrade (DFU) mode. (To put the iPhone in DFU mode, you should hold down the Power button for 3 seconds. Then, hold the Home button down with the Power button for 10 seconds. Release the Power button while keeping the Home button down.) Turn off the phone and connect it to the computer. Then, you will prepare to place the programs you just downloaded on the iPhone. The jailbreak program should activate on your iPhone. Release the home button on the phone. Wait for the iPhone to reboot. After the jailbreak tether is activated, you will be asked to place it in DFU mode again. Your iPhone may need to reboot a few times. Find the IP address your iPhone uses. It is listed in the Settings app in the Wi-Fi area. Launch the terminal on your computer. Type the following command: “ssh root@<IP address>.” (Type your iPhone’s IP address between the brackets). Type the password that was given to you when you installed the jailbreak program. Cydia is an application that will allow you to download new programs to your iPhone after the jailbreak. Some jailbreak programs will automatically install Cydia, and so there is no need to install it separately. If the program that you used did not, then type the following code into your Terminal: \\"wget -q -O /tmp/cyinstall.sh http://downloads.kr1sis.net/cyinstall.sh && chmod 755 /tmp/cyinstall.sh && /tmp/cyinstall.sh.\\" You should have a Cydia app on your Home screen.

It is a tradition in many high schools and colleges in the United States, Canada and the Philippines. United States. Homecoming is an annual tradition in the United States. People, towns, high schools, and colleges come together, usually in late September or early October, to welcome back alumni and former residents. It is built around a central event, such as a banquet and, most often, a game of American football, or, on occasion, basketball, ice hockey or soccer. When celebrated by schools, the activities vary widely. However, they usually consist of a football game played on a school's home football field, activities for students and alumni, a parade featuring the school's marching band and sports teams, and the coronation of a Homecoming Queen (and at many schools, a Homecoming King). A dance commonly follows the game or the day following the game. When attached to a football game, Homecoming traditionally occurs on the team's return from the longest road trip of the season. The game itself, whether it be football or another sport, will typically feature the home team playing a considerably weaker opponent. The game is supposed to be an \\"easy win\\" and thus weaker schools will sometimes play lower division schools. - The Quad is an approximately quadrangle on the campus of the University of Alabama located in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Home to most of the university's original buildings, this portion of the campus remains the geographic and historic center of the modern campus. Originally designed by noted English-born architect William Nichols, construction of the university campus began in 1828, following the move of the Alabama state capital from Cahaba to Tuscaloosa in 1826. The overall design for this early version of the campus was patterned after Thomas Jefferson's plan for the University of Virginia, with its Lawn and Rotunda. Following the destruction of the campus during the American Civil War, a new Quad emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Different in form and function from the original design of the early 19th century, the modern Quad continues to fill its role as the heart of the campus. Although completely surrounded by academic and administrative buildings, only five structures are built directly on the Quad: the Little Round House, Tuomey Hall, Oliver-Barnard Hall, Amelia Gayle Gorgas Library, and Denny Chimes. The remainder of the space is occupied by a grove of trees on the west side and a great lawn on the east. A feature on the northwestern side, known as The Mound, is the site of the old Franklin Hall. A popular gathering place, the Quad is home to pep rallies, a bonfire during homecoming, and numerous day-to-day student activities. - The Helms Athletic Foundation was an athletic foundation based in Los Angeles, California.

Schroeder continued to select national champions for the Helms Foundation until 1982, its final year of selections. The organization also retroactively selected national champions in college football dating from 1947 back to the 1883 season and in college basketball from 1942 back to the 190001 season. The Helms Foundation also operated a hall of fame for both college sports.

After arriving near the Bahamas, the Santa Maria had drifted before run aground on the reefs on Christmas Day in the North of Haiti. Spanish experts insist to talk about remains and not wreck, recalling that at the time, all that was reusable on the Santa Maria, including wood of the ship, which had been salvaged for construction by Christopher Columbus, of the fort \\"la Navidad\\". These three Spanish experts base their theory on the work of investigation they had done in 1991, before having to stop because of the coup against President Aristide. During their presentation, they explained that since 1492, year after year, sediments washed away, including by the Grande rivière du Nord, covered the coast. This led to an increase in the coast of Haiti on the sea, hence the conclusion that we must search for the remains of the wreck under several meters of soil and not at the bottom of the sea.

An analysis of the wreckage by a team of experts from UNESCO is expected within days but Culture Minister Monique Rocourt said the evidence she has seen and heard so far indicates that the wreckage is not the Santa Maria, which struck a reef and foundered in December 1492. Rocourt, who met this week with members of a team from Spain seeking permission to search for the Santa Maria, said in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press that some experts believe the wreckage identified as the ship is in the wrong place and not old enough to be the Santa Maria. \\"We are still awaiting the final report, but so far what we have seen ... tends to lead us to think it is a later ship,\\" she said of the wreckage found by Barry Clifford in about 15 feet of water near the northern city of Cap-Haitien. She said the wreckage identified by the U.S. explorer with great fanfare in May appeared to be from a 17th or 18th century ship. Clifford, known for discovering a pirate ship off Cape Cod in 1984, stands by his belief that he found what's left of the Santa Maria. He said in phone interview that he has heard the UNESCO report raises doubts about the claim but said the organization's team of experts never consulted with him and did not even request his surveys and photos from the dive site. \\"I think it's going to be highly, highly prejudiced,\\" he said. Finding the Santa Maria would be a major archaeological feat if confirmed. Experts have urged caution about making any abrupt claims because of the difficulty in identifying the remains of a wooden ship after more than 500 years in a region littered with wrecks. Columbus' ship struck a reef or a sand bank in the middle of the night and was abandoned on Christmas Day of 1492. Archaeologists and historians say the vessel was evacuated and about two dozen crew members were left behind in a fort built with the wood from the ship and christened \\"Navidad.\\" When Columbus returned a year later, the men had been killed or had vanished and the settlement was burned to the ground The location of Navidad is at the heart of the search for the Santa Maria. Clifford said he searched in an area where the shipwreck should be in relation to the settlement, based on the diaries of Columbus. At precisely that spot, the explorer and his son in 2003 found a type of cannon known as a lombard used on 15th century Spanish ships along with ballast stones and other evidence. When they returned this year, the cannon had apparently been looted but they have photos of it and he said the overall case is \\"overwhelming\\" that this is the Santa Maria. \\"It's so obvious it just screams at you.\\" The researchers from Spain, however, believe that the coastline in that area has expanded as a result of deposits of sand from nearby rivers and that the likely resting place of the Santa Maria is now on land, according to a report they provided to the Haitian government. Rocourt says the Spanish team is seeking permission to excavate along the shore, a proposal she welcomes. \\"We are open to suggestions on where to find that famous ship. It is quite an enigma,\\" she said. ____ Fox reported from Miami. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A recent news article reports that Spanish experts believe that the remains of the Santa Maria, Christopher Columbus's flagship, could be buried underground in Haiti, rather than at the bottom of the sea as previously thought. These experts presented their theory at an event attended by Haiti's Minister of Culture, representatives of UNESCO, and various academics. This theory stands in contrast to the claims made by explorer Barry Clifford, who had previously announced that he had found the wreck underwater. The Santa Maria, which was part of a fleet of three ships, sailed from Spain in 1492 in order to find a shorter route to Asia. It arrived near the Bahamas and later ran aground on reefs on Christmas Day in the north of Haiti. The Spanish experts believe that the remains of the ship may be found on land due to the geological changes that have occurred since 1492. They have based their theory on investigations they conducted in 1991, which were stopped due to the coup against President Aristide. According to the experts, sediment washed away over time has caused the coast of Haiti to expand, leading to the possibility that the remains of the ship could be buried beneath several meters of soil.

What might be the first step of the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"The first step in the process of blood filtration and urine formation in the kidney involves the nephrons, which are the functional units of the kidney. There are approximately one million nephrons in each kidney, and their primary function is to filter the blood, remove waste products, regulate the levels of various ions, and maintain the balance of water in our body. The process begins with blood entering the kidney through the renal artery. The renal artery branches into smaller arterioles, which eventually lead to a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries. These capillaries are intertwined with the renal tubules of nephrons. Each nephron has a specific section called the glomerulus, which is a dense network of capillaries surrounded by a cup-shaped Bowman's capsule. In the first step of the process, blood flows into the glomerulus under high pressure. The pressure forces some of the plasma (which is the liquid portion of the blood containing water, ions, glucose, and smaller proteins) through the walls of the capillaries. This process is known as ultrafiltration or glomerular filtration. The ultrafiltration results in the formation of a fluid called the glomerular filtrate, which accumulates in the Bowman's capsule. The glomerular filtrate is composed of water, electrolytes, glucose, amino acids, and other components, but lacks large proteins and blood cells as they cannot pass through the capillary walls. Subsequently, the glomerular filtrate flows through the renal tubules, where selective reabsorption and secretion occurs, ultimately leading to the formation of urine. Reabsorption is the process by which the desirable substances from the filtrate, such as ions, water, and glucose, are transported back into the blood capillaries so that they can be retained by the body. On the other hand, secretion involves the transfer of additional waste compounds or unwanted substances from the blood capillaries directly into the renal tubules to be eliminated from the body in the urine. As the filtrate passes through the various sections of the renal tubules, its composition changes, and the concentration of waste products increases. Finally, the filtrate, now called urine, reaches the collecting ducts, which carry it through the renal pelvis and into the ureters. The ureters transport the urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder, where it is stored until it can be eliminated from the body through the process of urination. In conclusion, the first step of the blood filtration and urine formation process in the kidneys involves the ultrafiltration or glomerular filtration of blood in the glomerulus under high pressure, resulting in the formation of glomerular filtrate within the Bowman's capsule. This filtrate then undergoes various transformations within the renal tubules, ultimately leading to the production of urine that is excreted from the body."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

You would be very confused and upset right? The same thing happened to a man called Stanley Wrice who was living in a place called Illinois. He was in prison, which is sort of like a long-time out for adults, for 30 years. That's more than five times longer than you've been alive! Wednesday was a very special day for Stanley, because he got out of prison. A judge - that's the person who tries to make fair decisions in court - said that Stanley didn't do the wrong things he was accused of. They found that some police officers hadn't been honest about how they treated Stanley. These officers worked under a man named Lt. Jon Burge. They were accused of being very mean to people they thought had done wrong things and making them say they did it when they really didn't. This is what we call torturing and it's a very, very bad thing to do. Stanley always said that he only told the officers he did the bad thing because they were hurting him a lot. When it came out that the officers were not being honest, the judge decided that Stanley had been telling the truth and let him go free because he really didn't do what he was accused of. This story is important because it reminds us that everyone should be treated fairly and honestly, even when they're accused of doing wrong things.

You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \\"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\\" In other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours. The creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \\"a local Amiga gaming championship\\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member.

Options: - yes - no Let's think first. Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"Step 1: Understanding the claim The claim states that the main argument behind reforming the police is that there is too much police brutality. It suggests that those who advocate for police reform primarily do so because they believe that excessive force is used by the police, which leads to unjustified injuries and deaths. Step 2: Assessing plausibility based on human common sense Using human common sense, we can assess the plausibility of this claim. Police brutality has been at the center of many discussions surrounding police reform, especially following numerous high-profile cases in recent years. Proponents of police reform often cite excessive force and a lack of accountability as primary reasons for needing change. Step 3: Consider other potential arguments for police reform While police brutality is certainly a significant factor in calls for reform, there may be other reasons people advocate for reform. These reasons can include a desire for increased transparency, improved relations with the communities they serve, or a need for better training and funding allocation. Step 4: Coming to a conclusion Based on the above reasoning, it is plausible that the main argument behind reforming the police is indeed police brutality. However, it cannot be verified without further research, as there might be other reasons that people call for police reform. To fully understand all perspectives and arguments surrounding this issue, additional research or investigation would be required.

Furthermore sources present during the deadly six-hour assault have said that a desperate last request for military assistance once the CIA themselves came under attack was denied, even though elite counter-terrorism units were only two hours away. And it has been claimed there was full communication between the CIA annex in Benghazi and the U.S. military, casting further doubts on the Obama administration's assertion that there wasn't enough information to deploy forces - deepening the crisis over their handling of the attack on September 11th and its aftermath. Scroll down for video. Revelations: It has been claimed today that CIA operatives at the Benghazi consulate compound repeatedly had their requests for help denied during the deadly assault on September 11. The lethal assault which led to the death of Ambassador Stevens and three other U.S. citizens began at 9.40 p.m. as the U.S Consulate came under fire from hostile Libyan forces. According to Fox News, ex-Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods, who was part of a small team at the CIA annex about a mile from the consulate, asked his superiors if he could go and assist the embattled diplomatic compound. However, they were told to 'stand down' and according to sources who spoke to the news channel were told to 'stand down' again after asking for a second time to help Ambassador Stevens and his staff. Ignoring these orders, Woods and two others heroically made their way to the consulate which by now was ablaze and began firing on the attackers. Knowledge: It is unclear who denied the requests of the CIA for special forces teams. The quick reaction force which Woods was part of helped an evacuation of the main building and recovered the body of State Department staff member Sean Smith who had died in the initial attack. However, the team from the CIA annex could not locate Ambassador Stevens and returned to their own base at around midnight where they came under attack themselves. Immediately calling for assistance from Sigonella Air base in Italy which is two hours away, it is claimed that two separate special operations teams and air support were told to wait - despite the gun battle raging for four hours. It is not known who denied the request for help for the CIA operatives on the ground at Benghazi. If true these claims will radically change the perception of the field agents who were operating on the ground in Benghazi. Previously criticised for providing inadequate security for the consulate staff, the new information shows intelligence operatives repeatedly tried to assist and in fact were denied their own requests for outside help. Killed: Ambassador Christopher Stevens (left) died following smoke inhalation, while agent Sean Smith (right) died in a. desperate battle. Heroic: Former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty (left) and Tyrone Woods (right) were killed in a mortar attack. Refuting the Defense Secretary Leon Panetta's claim yesterday that there simply wasn't enough information to responsibly deploy forces to Libya at the time of the attack, sources on the ground claim that communication was open throughout the attack. Indeed, one member of the CIA team who was on the roof of the annex was in possession of a laser to guide aerial targets including drones and repeatedly requested backup from a Specter gunship to take out an attacker firing mortars. According to sources familiar with the situation, the operative had visual contact with the Libyan mortar team and in addition was able to pinpoint positions from where the consulate attackers were firing from. Yesterday Leon Panetta claimed that he and General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General Carter Ham, head of the U.S. military's Africa Command, felt they couldn't 'put forces at risk in that situation.' A CIA operatives request for an AC-130H gunship to take down a Libyan mortar position was denied. Inferno: Armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate's exterior. Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack, which lasted several hours. 'This happened within a few hours and it was really over before, you know, we had the opportunity to really know what was happening,' said Panetta. Furthermore, Fox News has learned that there were two military surveillance drones above the skies of Benghazi during the attack which would have been able to relay real time visuals of the assault to U.S. officials in the White House situation room and the Pentagon. Tyrone Woods and another former Navy SEAL Glen Doherty were killed by a mortar shell at 4 a.m. Libyan time, over six hours after the attack began and just one hour after relief from an American Quick Reaction Force sent from Tripoli had arrive. This new information comes as President Barack Obama's response to the attacks in Libya has become a contentious issue in the hard-fought U.S. presidential race, with Republican opponents raising questions about his administration's truthfulness and competence. Obama supporters have in turn accused Republicans of making unfounded accusations in an effort to score political points from the death of a U.S. ambassador and the three others killed in the Benghazi attack. Flames, grenades and gunfire: A burnt-out car in front of the U.S. consulate. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Republican John Boehner, asked in a letter to Obama on Thursday about whether military options and assets were offered 'during and in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attack.' 'Can you explain what options were presented to you or your staff, and why it appears assets were not allowed to be pre-positioned, let alone utilized?' Boehner asked. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told Pentagon reporters that U.S. forces were on a heightened state of alert already because of the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington by al Qaeda. In the aftermath of the attack, Panetta reminded reporters that the Pentagon deployed a Marine fleet anti-terrorist security team to Tripoli and had Navy ships off the coast. 'And we were prepared to respond to any contingency. And certainly had forces in place to do that,' he said. Elite team: As the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. came under a devastating attack last month, a rescue team of elite. soldiers was denied the opportunity to assist the CIA who had come under attack. The administration initially attributed the violence to protests over an anti-Islam film and said it was not premeditated. Obama and other officials have since said the incident was a deliberate terrorist attack. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has attributed the shifting explanation to 'the fog of war.' A State Department email made public this week showed that two hours after the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission compound in Benghazi, the Department's Operations Center advised officials at various U.S. agencies that a militant group called Ansar al-Sharia had claimed credit on Twitter and Facebook for the attacks. U.S. officials, including Clinton, on Wednesday said that such Internet postings did not constitute hard evidence of who was responsible for the attacks. The State Department has set up an independent review board to investigate the background and response to the attacks. The U.S. Senate intelligence committee on Thursday said it will hold hearings in November - after the November 6 presidential election - on security and intelligence issues raised by the September 11 attack in Libya. Highlights:","output":"- CIA agents on the ground during the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi allegedly asked for permission to help Ambassador Chris Stevens twice but were told to stand down. - Sources claim that a final request for military assistance was denied even though counter-terrorism units were only two hours away. - Full communication between the CIA annex in Benghazi and the U.S. military raises doubts about the Obama administration's claim of insufficient information to deploy forces. - Ex-Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods, part of a small team at the CIA annex, was reportedly told to \\"stand down\\" when he asked to help the consulate but ultimately went anyway, resulting in a heroic rescue attempt. - CIA operatives' request for external assistance was allegedly denied, contrary to previous accusations of inadequate security for consulate staff. - The presence of two military surveillance drones during the attack raises questions about the Defense Secretary's statement that there was not enough information to responsibly deploy forces. - The Benghazi attack has become a point of contention in the U.S. presidential race, with Republican opponents questioning the administration's truthfulness and competence. - The U.S. Senate intelligence committee plans to hold hearings on the security and intelligence issues raised by the attack after the November 6th presidential election."},{"instruction":"Bulgar bakan İvaylo Kalfin, ABD Dışişleri Bakanı Condoleezza Rice ile Washington'da bir araya geldi.

For her drive and creativity in overcoming those challenges, she's been name national teacher of the year. Principal Waynes Kettler said he's worked with many outstanding teachers in his 22 years as an educator, but Peterson is \\"just that one step above anybody I've ever worked with before.\\" Kettler and others at Monte Cristo Elementary School talk about the ways she has introduced the learning from other classrooms into her music program and her creativity in working around things such as the lack of money for new music. When students were reading S.E. Hinton's novel in their regular classroom, Peterson helped them write a 30-minute play with scenes from the book. Then they chose three Broadway tunes that focused on race, equality and social justice, the themes of the book. Peterson composed two other sons herself after classroom discussions about the play and the book. The honor means a lot to residents of Granie Falls. It's inspiring to know that people from small towns can even win national honors. As national teacher of the year, Peterson will spend the next year outside classroom, as a national and international spokeswoman for education.

Of course, Barrett was himself a victim of violent crime a year ago. “You know, Tom Barrett can’t sell his record, so he’s throwing punches at me,” Walker says before attacking Barrett’s positions on such issues as taxes, spending and environmental laws. “I’m Scott Walker, and I took on the political machine in Milwaukee,” Walker adds, revealing that his hands are in boxing gloves which he then punches together, “and ready to go the distance as your next governor.” A complication in the imagery of this ad: Back in August 2009, Barrett was severely beaten by a man with a tire iron at the Wisconsin State Fair. Barrett intervened to protect a woman who was trying to protect her 1-year-old granddaughter from the girl’s drunk father, who in turn then attacked Barrett. Barrett was hospitalized and has undergone multiple operations on his hand, which doctors say might never fully recover. The assailant was later sentenced to 12 years in prison. The Associated Press asked Walker spokeswoman Jill Bader whether the ad was in bad taste, in light of Barrett having been attacked. “That was not at all what we’re talking about,” said Bader. Granted, boxing gloves probably wouldn’t be nearly as bad as the tire iron. The TPM Poll Average currently gives Walker a lead of 49.0%-42.9%.

I have not had any additional political involvement with him since that time.) ||||| Madison -- Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is staying out of whether an ad by one of his opponents in the race for governor is a reminder of the beating Barrett went through last year outside State Fair Park. \\"I don’t know what the purpose was,\\" Barrett said of the ad by Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker. \\"That’s for people to decide. I’m focusing on everything I can do to create jobs in the state and to make sure that we’ve got a budget that’s balanced, and that’s where my focus is.\\" In a new ad, Walker says Barrett is \\"throwing punches\\" with negative ads. At the end of the ad, Walker raises boxing gloves and says, \\"I’m Scott Walker, and I took on the political machine in Milwaukee.

Barrett is the only major Democrat in the race. Walker faces former U.S. Rep. Mark Neumann in the Sept. 14 Republican primary. Neumann's campaign declined to comment on Walker's ad. Mike Tate, the chairman of the state Democratic Party, told the Associated Press the ad was \\"tasteless.\\" But Walker’s campaign said the ad was a response to Barrett’s criticisms of him in recent ads and was not meant to raise Barrett’s beating. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker, the likely Republican nominee in the Wisconsin gubernatorial race, has released an ad depicting him as a boxer, stating that presumptive Democratic nominee Tom Barrett has been \\"throwing punches\\" at him.

Twist: This option implies some sort of rotational motion, which contradicts the premise that you are not turning. Therefore, this can't be the correct choice. 2.

However, the premise states that you are not moving either, so this choice doesn't match the given conditions. 3. Twist (again): As previously mentioned, twisting is a rotational motion and not a viable option based on the given conditions. 4.

However, I can provide you with general information and knowledge on how individuals may experience their first time engaging in sexual activity. The experience of having sex for the first time can be subjective and may differ greatly from person to person. Common themes include feeling nervous, excited, anxious, and curious. The emotional aspect of engaging in sexual activity for the first time can be influenced by cultural, social, personal, and religious factors. Physically, initial sexual experiences might vary due to factors like communication, trust, and relaxation with one's partner. Being able to discuss boundaries, preferences, and consent can enable a more comfortable and enjoyable experience. It is essential for both partners to have a mutual understanding and agreement to avoid any unwanted experiences. For some individuals, the first sexual experience may be pleasurable, while for others, it might be accompanied by pain or discomfort. Factors like body awareness, arousal, and the acknowledgment of physical boundaries can play a significant role in determining the overall experience.

Initially they were a soul band playing Motown covers and rock-based material. Alan Sandow (ex-Daisy Roots) replaced Taylor on drums by July. Sherbet signed to the Infinity Records label - a subsidiary of Festival Records. The band's debut single was issued in March 1970 as a cover version of Badfinger's \\"Crimson Ships\\" - from that band's January 1970 album Magic Christian Music. During 1970 the band played a residency at Jonathon's Disco, playing seven hours a night, four days a week for eight months. They were spotted by their future manager, Roger Davies. By March Daryl Braithwaite (Bright Lights, House of Bricks, Samael Lilith) had joined, initially sharing lead vocals with Laughlin who left the band a few months later.

These individuals suffer from chronic pain and believe that their pain is significantly affecting their lives. In addition to perceiving their pain as highly severe, dysfunctional people also report that their pain interferes with much of their daily activities, leading to a higher degree of psychological distress caused by pain, and they generally report low levels of activity. This classification of chronic pain patients highlights the substantial impact of pain on their overall functioning and mental well-being. Combining the MPI characterization with the patient's IASP five-category pain profile can yield a more comprehensive and useful description of their specific case to better tailor treatment and support strategies."},{"instruction":"Article:Whenever I travel abroad, I feel duty-bound to dispel a few myths and preconceptions about my homeland. Over the years, one of the most common - especially among those from more tropical climes - is that of a snow-smothered Scotland. \\"That's the Highlands,\\" I will generally say. \\"Down in the south, it is mostly rain.\\" In a lifetime spent in Dumfries and Galloway, that has usually been the case. But, on one day exactly 20 years ago, I was proved wrong in quite dramatic fashion. The snows started steadily on the morning of Monday 5 February 1996. \\"It'll no lie,\\" we said confidently. \\"It'll all be melted by the morning.\\" History had shown us to be correct in those statements but this time the snow just kept coming and quickly settled across much of the region. At my place of work at the time, on the local newspaper in Dumfries, it gradually dawned on us that things might be a little different this time around. Those living furthest from the town were allowed to escape earliest but my own home was barely a mile from the office. But even that short distance proved one of the trickiest journeys I can ever recall. I abandoned my car at the end of the road, unable to make progress through a wall of snow. By afternoon, road travel was impossible in much of the region and even when snow ploughs could clear a route it quickly became blocked by abandoned vehicles. There was a first report of a bus carrying 40 passengers getting stuck in the snow and emergency rest centres were opened. At their peak, they accommodated about 2,500 people - many of them passing through the region on the A74(M). The snowfalls were the first real test of the Dumfries and Galloway's Major Emergency Scheme. A council report on the events of the time said the region was \\"effectively cut off from the outside world\\". At the height of the problems 12,000 properties, including some of the emergency centres themselves, were without power. The Met Office said the 50cm (20in) recorded at its Eskdalemuir observatory was the deepest level it had ever recorded in February. It is small fry, of course, compared with some of the major falls seen elsewhere. Nonetheless, it caused significant disruption and eventually, the army was called in to help get to the most vulnerable people and start with clean-up operations. It gave the region an eerily quiet air for a couple of days as most people had to give up on cars and resort to travelling on foot. Trudging through the snow - particularly on the first day after the falls - took particular effort with significant drifts in many places. Yet there was a certain camaraderie among those who did venture out. Complete strangers stopped you to talk about the weather conditions - so unusual for this sheltered corner of Scotland. There were fears, in the immediate aftermath, of further blizzards but they were fortunately blown further north and the feared impact of the thaw was mitigated by it being much slower than anticipated. As a council report put it: \\"Slowly the region got back to normal after five days of severe disruption.\\" And I had to revise my version of how little snow we saw in Dumfries and Galloway. Were you in Dumfries and Galloway during the heavy snowfall of February 1996? What are your memories of the day? Do you have images from the time? Share them with us by emailingdumfries@bbc.co.uk. A summary of the above article is?","output":"The article details the experience and memories of heavy snowfall in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland on February 5, 1996.

They also mention that the Met Office recorded the snow level at 50cm (20 inches), the deepest ever recorded in February at their Eskdalemuir observatory. The author describes the day after the snowfall, as people had to walk to get around, trudging through significant drifts of snow, but there was a sense of camaraderie among those who ventured outside.

Plot title: 1776 Movie plot: While General George Washington is conducting the struggle against the British Empire on the battlefield, the Continental Congress in Philadelphia piddles away its time over trivial matters and continually refuses to begin debating the question of American independence. The leader of the independence faction is the abrasive John Adams of Massachusetts, whose continuous pushing of the issue has brought their cause to a complete standstill. John Dickinson of Pennsylvania leads the opposition that hopes for reconciliation with England. During his quieter moments, Adams calls up the image of his wife Abigail Adams, who resides in Massachusetts and gives him insight and encouragement (these conversations are based on letters between the couple). Dr. Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania suggests another colony that supports independence should submit a proposal. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia voluntarily rides off to Williamsburg, Virginia to get authorization from the Virginia Colony to propose independence. Dr. Lyman Hall arrives to represent Georgia, and immediately, he is interrogated by his fellow delegates regarding his views on independence (with Dickinson framing it as \\"treason\\"). Weeks later, Lee returns with the resolution, and debate on the question begins. However, in the midst of debate, Caesar Rodney falters because of his cancer and is taken back to Delaware by fellow delegate Thomas McKean, leaving the anti-independence George Read to represent Delaware.

The New Jersey delegation, led by Reverend John Witherspoon, arrives just in time to provide a vote supporting independence. In a move intended to defeat the resolution, Dickinson calls for a vote requiring unanimity for passage. The vote ends in a tie between the colonies, New York abstaining as it does in every vote.

As such, I will delve into the importance of brief sentences and their effectiveness in communication, highlighting some key aspects that make them a valuable tool in written and spoken language. Brief sentences, often referred to as simple sentences, are the cornerstone of clear communication. They are composed of a single independent clause containing a subject and a predicate, delivering a complete thought with minimum words. The effectiveness of brief sentences lies in their ability to be easily understood and quickly absorbed by the reader or listener, as they convey a singular point without unnecessary embellishments or excessive information. This makes them a vital component for effective communication in various contexts, including journalism, messaging, creative writing, and business communication. A crucial component of a brief sentence is its brevity, which ensures the message is concise and focused. By cutting down on wordiness, the sentence remains agile and easy to comprehend, increasing its impact. This streamlined approach can be especially useful when attempting to captivate an audience with a powerful statement or reduce misunderstandings in informative texts. Despite their simplicity, brief sentences can add depth and variety to a text when used strategically. Serving as a counterbalance to complex and compound sentences, they provide a break from lengthy descriptions or arguments and can highlight important points that would be otherwise lost in a sea of words. Additionally, brief sentences can add a sense of urgency or emphasis to a statement, making it more memorable and impactful. However, it is essential to use brief sentences judiciously because solely relying on them can lead to a sense of monotony or create an impression of oversimplification. Therefore, it is crucial to strike a balance between brief sentences and their more complex counterparts, allowing for a rich and diverse text that keeps readers engaged while effectively conveying the intended message. In conclusion, the importance of brief sentences in communication cannot be overstated. While they can appear simple on the surface, their careful integration in written and spoken language serves various purposes, including clarifying ideas, adding emphasis, and providing text variety. By understanding and utilizing the power of brief sentences, communication can be both efficient and impactful across multiple contexts, catering to the needs of readers and listeners alike."},{"instruction":"Question: Gus eats 2 eggs-omelet for breakfast.

Last updated at 5:30 PM on 26th February 2012. Berlin wants to send German inspectors to Greece to ensure all taxes that are due are collected. The controversial move will see a 'foreign legion' of 160 or so taxmen head south to try and root out corruption and make sure national coffers are filled in a country where revenue evasion is an art form. Finance department secretary of state Hans Bernhard Beus announced his plan to the WirtschaftsWoche business magazine. Troubles: A fire burns in Athens during protests as the new £108bn Greek bailout is negotiated. It comes just weeks after Europe rejected a German move for a financial 'gauleiter' to oversee all of Greece's books in a bid to avert financial meltdown. But in order to receive billions in bailout funds, Greece has had to agree to fire dozens of underperforming tax inspectors in the coming months. Germany believes its beancounters will be able to drive out in excess of £50billion, either hidden under mattresses or in secret accounts, into the clear light of day and then into state coffers. Last week, European leaders finally agreed a fresh bailout for Greece, worth £108billion. Protest: A demonstrator is detained by riot police as the Greeks negotiated their eurozone bailout. Now Berlin want to send German tax inspectors. Call: George Osborne says IMF should not fund another eurozone bailout. But concern remains throughout Europe that Athens will not be able to meet strict conditions attached. Greece views such an offer as 'humiliating' and believes it to be one more attempt by Germany to take control of the nation piece by piece. Beus' description of his tax squad as 'volunteers' is meant to reduce the tensions between the two countries. Another finance official, Thomas Schaefer of the state of Hesse, said he was looking at calling up a 'dad's army' of retired tax officials to move into Greece to help find the estimated £15 to 20bn in annual undeclared income. 'It would be possible to mobilise such people with large practical experience quite easily,' he said. The German demand comes as Britain and the world's other leading economies in the IMF said they should not be forced to fund another eurozone bailout. Speaking. as finance ministers gather in Mexico for the G20 summit, the. Chancellor said extra funds would not be handed over until countries who. use the struggling single currency commit resources themselves.

'While at this G20 conference there. are a lot of things to discuss, I don’t think you’re going to see any. extra resources committed here because eurozone countries have not. committed additional resources themselves, and I think that quid pro quo. will be clearly established here in Mexico City.'

A 2007 article by Bruce Bawer published in City Journal magazine and a subsequent article in February 2009 by Barbara Kay in the National Post criticised some of Galtung's statements. Both authors criticized Galtung's opinion that while Communist China was \\"repressive in a certain liberal sense\\", Mao Zedong was \\"endlessly liberating when seen from many other perspectives that liberal theory has never understood\\" because China showed that \\"the whole theory about what an 'open society' is must be rewritten, probably also the theory of 'democracy'--and it will take a long time before the West will be willing to view China as a master teacher in such subjects.\\" The authors also criticized Galtung's opposition to Hungarian resistance against the Soviet invasion in 1956 and his description in 1974 of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov as \\"persecuted elite personages\\". Statements on Israeli influence on U.S. politics The Israeli newspaper Haaretz accused Galtung in May 2012 of antisemitism for: (1) suggesting the possibility of a link between the 2011 Norway attacks and Israel's intelligence agency Mossad; (2) maintaining that \\"six Jewish companies\\" control 96% of world media; (3) identifying what he contends are ironic similarities between the banking firm Goldman Sachs and the conspiratorial antisemitic forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion; and (4) theorizing that although not justified, antisemitism in post-World War I Germany was a predictable consequence of German Jews holding influential positions. As a result of such statements, in May 2012 TRANSCEND International, an organisation co-founded by Galtung, released a statement attempting to clarify his opinions. On August 8, 2012, the World Peace Academy in Basel, Switzerland announced it was suspending Galtung from its organization, citing what it posited were his \\"reckless and offensive statements to questions that are specifically sensitive for Jews.\\" Galtung himself has vehemently repudiated the above attacks as \\"smearing and libel\\" in a published statement and a public lecture at the end of the year 2012. Answer this question \\"What was the statement?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"The statement was that Galtung suggested the possibility of a link between the 2011 Norway attacks and Israel's intelligence agency Mossad, maintained that \\"six Jewish companies\\" control 96% of world media, identified what he contends are ironic similarities between the banking firm Goldman Sachs and the conspiratorial antisemitic forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and theorized that although not justified, antisemitism in post-World War I Germany was a predictable consequence of German Jews holding influential positions."},{"instruction":"Write a question about the following article: Upon launch, Gentoo quickly became a popular distribution, with 326 hits per day on average in 2002 on DistroWatch the third highest.

Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the '68 Comeback Special, reported, \\"I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence.\\" His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described him as \\"the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl\\". In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as \\"the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America\\". Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some cultural critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, Sight and Sound's Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as \\"aggressively bisexual in appeal\\". Brett Farmer places the \\"orgasmic gyrations\\" of the title dance sequence in Jailhouse Rock within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a \\"spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image\\". In the analysis of Yvonne Tasker, \\"Elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised, objectifying version of white working-class masculinity as aggressive sexual display.\\"Reinforcing Presley's image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with various Hollywood stars and starlets, from Natalie Wood in the 1950s to Connie Stevens and Ann-Margret in the 1960s to Candice Bergen and Cybill Shepherd in the 1970s.

The band consists of four animated members: 2-D (lead vocals, keyboards), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), Noodle (guitar, keyboards), and Russel Hobbs (drums and percussion). These members are fictional and are not personas of any \\"real life\\" musicians involved in the project. Their fictional universe is explored through the band's music videos, as well as a number of other short cartoons. The band's first release was the EP Tomorrow Comes Today, released in 2000. The band's first single was \\"Clint Eastwood\\" and was released on 5 March 2001, reaching No. 4 in the UK. It was produced by hip hop producer Dan the Automator and originally featured UK rap group Phi Life Cypher, but the version that appears on the album features American rapper Del the Funky Homosapien, known on the album as Del tha' Ghost Rapper, a spirit in the band's drummer Russel Hobbs. The Phi Life Cypher version of \\"Clint Eastwood\\" appears on the B-side album G Sides. Later that same month, their first full-length album, the self-titled Gorillaz, was released, producing four singles: \\"Clint Eastwood\\", \\"19-2000\\", \\"Tomorrow Comes Today\\", and \\"Rock the House\\". In June 2001, \\"19-2000\\" charted at No. 6 in the UK, and the song was used as the title theme for EA Sports FIFA video game FIFA Football 2002. The end of the year brought the song \\"911\\", a collaboration between Gorillaz and hip hop group D12 (without Eminem) and Terry Hall about the September 11 attacks. Meanwhile, G Sides, a compilation of the B-sides from the Tomorrow Comes Today EP and first three singles, was released in Japan on 12 December 2001 and quickly followed with international releases in early 2002. Gorillaz performed at the 2002 Brit Awards in London on 22 February, appearing in 3D animation on four large screens along with rap accompaniment by Phi Life Cypher. The band were nominated for four Brit Awards, including Best British Group, Best British Album and British Breakthrough Act, but did not win any awards. In November 2002, a DVD titled Phase One: Celebrity Take Down was released, giving the phase its name. The DVD contains the four Phase One promos, the abandoned video for \\"5/4\\", the Charts of Darkness documentary, the five Gorilla Bitez (comedic shorts starring the band characters), a tour of the website by the MEL 9000 server and more. The DVD's menu was designed much like the band's website and depicts an abandoned Kong Studios. Rumours were circulating at this time that the Gorillaz team were busy preparing a film, but Hewlett said that the film project had been abandoned: \\"We lost all interest in doing it as soon as we started meeting with studios and talking to these Hollywood executive types, we just weren't on the same page. We said, fuck it, we'll sit on the idea until we can do it ourselves, and maybe even raise the money ourselves.\\" What was the DVD about","output":"The DVD, titled \\"Phase One: Celebrity Take Down,\\" is a compilation of materials related to the first phase of Gorillaz's music career.

Based on the information provided in a given passage, you should identify the shortest continuous text span from the passage that serves as an answer to the given question. Avoid answers that are incorrect or provides incomplete justification for the question. Input: Passage: The observation that old windows are sometimes found to be thicker at the bottom than at the top is often offered as supporting evidence for the view that glass flows over a timescale of centuries, the assumption being that the glass has exhibited the liquid property of flowing from one shape to another. This assumption is incorrect, as once solidified, glass stops flowing. The reason for the observation is that in the past, when panes of glass were commonly made by glassblowers, the technique used was to spin molten glass so as to create a round, mostly flat and even plate (the crown glass process, described above). This plate was then cut to fit a window. The pieces were not absolutely flat; the edges of the disk became a different thickness as the glass spun. When installed in a window frame, the glass would be placed with the thicker side down both for the sake of stability and to prevent water accumulating in the lead cames at the bottom of the window. Occasionally such glass has been found installed with the thicker side at the top, left or right.

I became a DOORS fan way back when they released their first album. Forty years later most of their music still bends my ear. This elaborate box set is worth seeking out, especially given the limited numbers available. I read some reviews about the CD remixes that were disappointing. Well, folks, they were wrong. And if that's all you're looking for they are being released as single CDs in the very near future. I wanted this for the DTS DVD AUDIO discs that bring this set to twelve discs. Nevermind the historic but boring videos tagged on. The DTS surround sound is nothing less than stunning. From Strange Days through LA Woman, the recordings were obviously meant to be heard this way. The remixes only enhance my favorites. And this begs my next plea: I have this set, I have Talking Heads Dual Disc BRICK, and Pet Sounds, and the Beatles LOVE, and Lyle Lovett's JOSHUA JUDGES RUTH, Richard Thompson, etc., all in 5.1 surround and/or DTS.

Premise: \\"A man preparing food on a grill.\\" This statement talks about a man who is cooking food using a grill. It gives no indication of any danger or mishaps occurring. Hypothesis: \\"A man burning his house down.\\" This statement describes a situation where a man's actions result in burning his house down. It implies a dangerous event that could be accidental or intentional. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. In this case, the premise is about a man cooking food on a grill, while the hypothesis is about the man burning down his house.

The film reflects on the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie and on the effects of that regime change relative to Ethiopian history and society. Through a broader lens, the film Teza focuses on the ways in which political upheaval and social change have impacted cultures and nations across the larger African Diaspora.Told mainly through a series of flashbacks, Teza follows the personal narrative of Anberber, who, after leaving Ethiopia for Germany to become a doctor, is led to return to his home village by lingering spirits and haunting visions from his childhood. Using the power of memory as its primary device, Teza recounts the historical circumstances that have framed the context in which contemporary Ethiopia exists.The movie chronicles Anberber's internal struggle to stay true--both to himself and to his homeland--but above all, the film explores the possession of memory, a right that humanity mandates that each of us have--the right to own our pasts.

The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there.

What would you use to see a clip? Options: - desk drawer - woman's hair - scissors - television show - office building","output":"To determine the best option for seeing a clip, let us analyze each option step by step: 1. Desk drawer: A desk drawer is a storage space typically used for keeping office supplies and other belongings. It is not directly related to viewing a clip, therefore, this is not the best option. 2. Woman's hair: A clip in this context might refer to a hair clip used to hold a woman's hair in place. However, this option does not provide a way to view the clip itself; it only tells us where it may be found. 3. Scissors: Scissors are a tool used for cutting materials like paper or fabric. They have no relation to viewing a clip and, therefore, are not the best option. 4. Television show: A clip can also refer to a short segment of a video or film, such as a scene from a television show.

The hypothesis is a general statement potentially driven by the premise, but the premise itself does not explicitly guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. To determine if a valid conclusion can be drawn that supports the hypothesis if the premise is true, we need to closely examine the logical relationship between the two statements: 1. The premise is centered on a past event where reproval occurred. 2. The hypothesis is based on a perceived lack of belief in the speaker. While it is possible that the person who reproved the speaker may have acted due to a lack of belief in them, this connection is not explicitly indicated in the premise. The reasons for the reproval could be varied, such as concerns about privacy or a disagreement on how the matter should be handled. It is also possible that the person who reproved the speaker did believe in them but felt that taking the household into confidence was still a misstep. Therefore, the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, and we cannot reliably conclude that if the premise is true, so is the hypothesis. However, it is still worth considering that the premise might suggest the hypothesis as a potential interpretation. If taking the household into confidence on the subject is seen as indicative of the speaker's competence or trustworthiness, then reproving them for this action might suggest a lack of belief in the speaker. Even so, this possibility remains speculative, and without further information, we cannot definitively say that the truth of the premise entails the truth of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Binani Industries Ltd is an Indian business group based in Mumbai.

(September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) As an old man, Adso, son of the Baron of Melk recounts how, as a young novice in 1327, he joined his mentor, Franciscan friar William of Baskerville on a journey to a Benedictine abbey in Northern Italy where the Franciscans were to debate with Papal emissaries the poverty of Christ. The abbey also boasts a famed scriptorium where scribes copy, translate or illuminate books. The suspicious recent death of the monk Adelmo of Otranto âa young but famous manuscript illuminatorâ has stirred fears among the abbey's inhabitants. The Abbot seeks help from William, known for his deductive powers. Adelmo's death cannot be a suicide because his body was found below a tower with only a window which cannot be opened. William is reluctant, but also drawn by the intellectual challenge and his desire to disprove fears of a demonic culprit. William also fears the abbot will summon officials of the Inquisition if the mystery remains unsolved. William soon concludes that Adelmo's death was indeed suicide; he fell from a different tower. Nevertheless, Venantius, a Greek translator âand the last to speak with Adelmoâ is found dead in a vat filled with the blood of slaughtered pigs. The translator's corpse bears a black stain on a finger and his tongue. At a loss, William insists that Adelmo killed himself and that the translator's death can be reasonably explained. The other monks suspect a supernatural cause, fears reinforced when the saintly Fransciscan monk Ubertino of Casale warns that the deaths resemble signs mentioned in the Book of Revelation. In the scriptorium, William inspects Adelmo's desk, but is blocked by Brother Berengar, the assistant librarian. Brother Malachia, Head Librarian, denies William access to the rest of the building.

Benjamin had an unhealthy liver because he drank a lot of beer while Brian drank water.","output":"Benjamin had an unhealthy liver because he drank a lot of beer, whereas Brian, on the other hand, always opted for water. Benjamin's excessive beer consumption ultimately took a toll on his liver health, leading to multiple problems that affected his overall well-being. Even though he enjoyed the buzz he got from drinking beer, he gradually started to realize that this temporary pleasure was causing long-term damage to his body. Brian, who consistently chose water over beer, managed to lead a healthier life in comparison. His liver was in good shape, and he never had to worry about the consequences of alcohol abuse. Water had a positive impact on Brian's health, helping him stay hydrated, detoxifying his body, and nourishing his vital organs. He found the benefits of drinking water and maintaining a toxin-free lifestyle far outweighed the transient high alcohol could provide. Once Benjamin began to notice the difference between his and Brian's health, he started to think more seriously about his own lifestyle choices. He found himself lacking motivation and energy most of the time, while Brian always seemed to be fit and full of zeal. This realization initiated a change in Benjamin, as he finally decided to seek help in overcoming his addiction to beer. Understanding the severity of his alcohol dependence, Benjamin consulted a healthcare professional, who suggested he start attending a rehabilitation program. The goal of this program would be to help Benjamin free himself from his beer addiction, while also teaching him healthier coping mechanisms. He struggled at first, but with time and consistent effort, Benjamin was able to gradually reduce his consumption of beer. Moreover, Benjamin decided to join a support group for people dealing with alcohol dependency. The support group helped him connect with others facing similar issues and understand that he was not alone in his battle against addiction. It offered a network of people who shared their experiences, knowledge, and resources, empowering one another to overcome their addiction. Additionally, Benjamin started making an effort to maintain a healthier diet and exercise regularly to improve his physical well-being. By incorporating fresh fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains in his diet, he began feeling more energetic and focused. As for exercise, he tried various activities such as swimming, jogging, and yoga, eventually finding a mix that he enjoyed and could stick to in the long run. Over time, with a combination of support from his healthcare professional, the rehabilitation program, his support group, diet, and exercise, Benjamin's liver health began to improve. He was no longer plagued by constant fatigue and began noticing some of the other advantages of his newly found sober life. His relationships with friends and family improved, and he gained more clarity and direction in his personal goals and ambitions. Benjamin's journey to liver health and sobriety was not an easy one, but it was a life-altering transformation that taught him the value of taking care of his body and making healthier choices. Meanwhile, Brian continued living his healthy life, providing moral support and encouragement to Benjamin along the way. By sharing their experiences and challenges, both Benjamin and Brian grew stronger in their commitment to maintaining a healthy lifestyle and looking after their physical and emotional well-being. Their story serves as a reminder of the impact our choices have on our bodies and the significance of prioritizing our health in the face of everyday challenges."},{"instruction":"Information: - Geology (from the Ancient Greek , \\"g\\", i.e. \\"earth\\" and -o, \\"-logia\\", i.e. \\"study of, discourse\\") is an earth science comprising the study of solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change. Geology can also refer generally to the study of the solid features of any terrestrial planet (such as the geology of the Moon or Mars). - Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag (LKAB) is a Swedish mining company. The company mines iron ore at Kiruna and at Malmberget in northern Sweden. The company was established in 1890, and has been 100% state-owned since the 1950s. The iron ore is processed to pellets and sinter fines, which are transported by Iore trains (Malmbanan) to the harbours at Narvik and Luleå and to the steelmill at Luleå (SSAB). - Narvik is located on the shores of the Ofotfjorden. The municipality is part of the traditional district of Ofoten of Northern Norway, inside the Arctic Circle. The municipality of Narvik borders the municipality of Ballangen to the southwest, Evenes to the northwest, Bardu, Gratangen, Lavangen and Skånland (in Troms county) to the north, and Norrbotten County (Lapland) in Sweden to the south and east. - Johan Olof Hjalmar Lundbohm ( 25 April 1855 -- 4 April 1926 ) was a Swedish geologist and chemist and the first managing director of LKAB ( Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag ) in Kiruna . He is regarded as the founder of the city . - A geologist is a scientist who studies the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the Earth as well as the processes that shape it. Geologists usually study geology, although backgrounds in physics, chemistry, biology, and other sciences are also useful. Field work is an important component of geology, although many subdisciplines incorporate laboratory work. - A chemist (from Greek chm (ía) alchemy + -ist; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English. - Iore, often stylized IORE, is a class of 34 electric locomotives built by Adtranz and its successor Bombardier Transportation for the Swedish mining company LKAB's railway division Malmtrafik. The class is a variation of Adtranz's Octeon modular product platform, thus related to Bombardier's later TRAXX platform. The locomotives haul iron ore freight trains on the Iron Ore Line and Ofoten Line in Sweden and Norway, respectively. The 68-car trains are hauled by two single-ended CoCo locomotives, each with a power output of . Each operates with tractive effort and has a maximum speed of . Delivery of the first series of 18 locomotives was made from 2000 to 2004, and they replaced some of the aging Dm3 and El 15 units.

A pharmacist is a member of the health care team directly involved with patient care. Pharmacists undergo university-level education to understand the biochemical mechanisms and actions of drugs, drug uses, therapeutic roles, side effects, potential drug interactions, and monitoring parameters. This is mated to anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. Pharmacists interpret and communicate this specialized knowledge to patients, physicians, and other health care providers. - The polar night occurs when the night lasts for more than 24 hours. This occurs only inside the polar circles. The opposite phenomenon, the polar day, or midnight sun, occurs when the Sun stays above the horizon for more than 24 hours. \\"Night\\" is understood as the center of the Sun being below a free horizon. Since the atmosphere bends the rays of the Sun, the polar day is longer than the polar night, and the area that is affected by polar night is somewhat smaller than the area of midnight sun. The polar circle is located at a latitude between these two areas, at the latitude of approximately 66.5 degrees. In the most northern city of Sweden, Kiruna, at 67°51'N, the polar night lasts for around 28 twenty-four-hour periods, while the midnight sun lasts around 50 twenty-four-hour periods. - The city's vicinity shares a long history with the indigenous Sami people, with evidence of at least 6000 years of settlement.

It aimed to purify, mature, and perfect certain objects. Common aims were chrysopoeia, the transmutation of \\"base metals\\" (e.g., lead) into \\"noble\\" ones (particularly gold); the creation of an elixir of immortality; the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease; and the development of an alkahest, a universal solvent. The perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and, in the Hellenistic and western tradition, the achievement of gnosis. In Europe, the creation of a philosopher's stone was variously connected with all of these projects.

George Cooper (John Heard) lives with his girlfriend Lauren (Kim Greist). George, a once-prominent fashion photographer, has since forgone the fame and fortune. His current project is photographing New York City's homeless population, specifically those known as \\"undergrounders\\", or people who reside within the bowels of the city. A police captain named Bosch (Christopher Curry) is introduced. Bosch has a personal interest in the recent flood of missing persons (most of whom are homeless) being reported to his precinct. Bosch interviews A.J. \\"The Reverend\\" Shepherd (Daniel Stern), who runs the local homeless shelter. Shepherd believes recent events to be a part of a massive government cover-up and has the evidence to prove it. Bosch's superiors know more than they are letting on and seem to be taking their cues from an overly glib, weasely type named Wilson (George Martin), who works for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Article: Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to connect the brain with computers. Braincomputer interface(BCI) technology could help people with disabilities send commands to machines. Recently, two scientists, Jose Millan and Michele Tavella from the Federal Polytehnic School in Lausanne, Switzerland, show a small robotic wheelchair directed by a person's thoughts. In the laboratory, Tavella operated the wheelchair just by thinking about moving his left or right hand. He could even talk as he watched the vehicle and guided it with his thoughts. \\"Our brain has billions of body cells . These send signals through the spinal cord to the body part to give us the ability to move. But spinal cord injuries or other conditions can prevent these weak electrical signals from reaching the body part.\\" Tavella says. \\"Our system allows disabled people to communicate with outer world and also to control machines.\\" The scientists designed a special cap for the user. This head cover picks up the signals from the scalp and sends them to a computer. The computer finds meanings of the signals and commands the wheelchair with an engine. The wheelchair also has two cameras that tell objects in its path. They help the computer react to commands from the brain. Prof. Millan , the team leader, says scientists keep improving the computer software that finds meanings of brain signals and turns them into simple commands.\\" The practical possibilities that BCI technology offers to disabled people can be grouped in two kinds: communication, and controlling objects. One example is this wheelchair.\\" He says his team has set two goals. One is testing with real patients, so as to prove that this is a technology they can get advantages from. And the other is sure that they can use the technology for long. Question: Which of the following would be the best title for the text?

The eastern half of the system merged into the Soo Line Railroad on January 1, 1986. The company went through several official names and faced bankruptcy several times in that period. The railroad no longer exists as a separate entity, but much of its trackage continues to be used by its successor and other roads, and is commemorated in buildings like the historic Milwaukee Road Depot in Minneapolis, Minnesota and in railroad hardware still maintained by railfans, such as the Milwaukee Road 261 steam locomotive. - Wisconsin Central Ltd. is a railroad subsidiary of the Canadian National Railway. At one time, its parent Wisconsin Central Transportation Corporation owned or operated railroads in the United States, Canada (Algoma Central Railway), the United Kingdom (English Welsh & Scottish), New Zealand (Tranz Rail), and Australia (Australian Transport Network). - The Soo Line Railroad is the primary United States railroad subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP), controlled through the Soo Line Corporation, and one of seven U.S. Class I railroads. Although it is named for the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad (MStP&SSM), which was commonly known as the Soo Line after the phonetic spelling of Sault, it was formed in 1961 by the consolidation of that company with two other CP subsidiaries, the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railroad and Wisconsin Central Railroad. It is also the successor to other Class I railroads, including the Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern Railway (acquired 1982) and Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road, acquired at bankruptcy in 1985). On the other hand, a large amount of mileage was spun off in 1987 to Wisconsin Central Ltd., now part of the Canadian National Railway. The Soo Line and the Delaware and Hudson Railway, the CP's other major subsidiary (before the 2008 DM&E acquisition), presently do business as the Canadian Pacific Railway, and most equipment has been repainted into the CP's scheme, but the U.S. Surface Transportation Board groups all CP's U.S. subsidiaries under the Soo Line name for reporting purposes. - Thep Delaware and Hudson Railway is a railroad that operates in the northeastern United States that has been since 1991 owned and operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway under the rail subsidiary Soo Line Corporation also controls the Soo Line Railroad, Canadian Pacific Railway is owned by Canadian Pacific Railway Limited. - Cisco is a place name for the remnants of a former unincorporated community located along the Soo Line Railroad and US 59 in the NW 1/4 of Section 11 of Badger Township , 149 North , Range 42 West , in Polk County , United States , approximately four miles north of the city of Erskine , and about the same distance south of the city of Brooks .

Marie Railroad was a Class I railroad subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the Midwest United States. Commonly known as the Soo Line after the phonetic spelling of Sault, it was merged with several other major CP subsidiaries on January 1, 1961 to form the Soo Line Railroad. As time passes, more and more Soo Line equipment is being repainted into the Canadian Pacific's current paint scheme, slowly erasing the Soo's identity as a subsidiary railroad. - The Surface Transportation Board (STB) of the United States is a bipartisan, decisionally-independent adjudicatory body organizationally housed within the U.S. Department of Transportation. The STB was established in 1996 to assume some of the regulatory functions that had been administered by the Interstate Commerce Commission when the ICC was abolished.

They later moved to London, UK. Three of the members went on to form DragonForce. Their rather unusual musical style has often been labeled as \\"blackened power metal\\". Hypothesis: Demoniac got it's name from the Bible.","output":"Based on the given context, we cannot definitively say that Demoniac got their name from the Bible. While it is possible that the name could be inspired by biblical references, there is no specific mention of the source of the band's name in the provided information. To draw a more conclusive hypothesis, we would need to consider additional data points or gather further information about the band's inspirations or motivations behind the name. There might be several other reasons contributing to the choice of the band's name, such as personal experiences, literary influences, cultural references, or even a combination of various elements. In the realm of heavy metal music and its subgenres, band names often reflect the overall theme, sound, or aesthetic the members wish to portray. This is particularly true in black metal, which commonly features themes related to darkness, evil, and the occult. Given that Demoniac has been labeled as \\"blackened power metal,\\" it is possible that their name might allude to these themes instead. However, without more evidence, we cannot definitively identify the main inspiration behind their name. In summary, while it is plausible that Demoniac's name might have been inspired by the Bible, there is not enough context to conclude that this is the case. Further investigation would be necessary to explore the origin of the band's name and identify the primary source of inspiration behind it."},{"instruction":"Which of these sentences doesn't make sense?

Kyle was late to the meeting. Brian was very busy when he arrived at the meeting, as he wanted to make sure everything was set up and ready to go. His hands were full with paperwork, reports, and presentation materials, while he tried to catch his breath after rushing through the office corridors. On the other hand, Kyle was calm because he was the one who was late to the meeting. Just moments before his tardy arrival, he was seated at his desk, sipping his steaming cup of coffee while thinking about the project at hand. Unbeknownst to Kyle, the meeting had been pushed up 15 minutes by their boss earlier that morning. When Kyle finally received an urgent text from a coworker, he checked his watch in disbelief and quickly moved towards the meeting room. The door swung open, revealing a slightly flustered Brian, who threw him a disapproving glance before continuing to set up his presentation. Kyle apologized to everyone in the room, but his laid-back demeanor gave his colleagues the impression that he was not taking the meeting seriously. Once the meeting finally began, Brian launched into his meticulously prepared presentation, supported by his extensive notes and visual aids. As he spoke, he couldn't help but feel frustrated by Kyle's lack of preparation and punctuality. In contrast, Kyle listened intently and seemed to absorb the information in a way that Brian could not comprehend. He chimed in with thoughtful questions and made insightful suggestions that caught the attention of the team and their supervisor. It was clear that Kyle's mind was always ticking, analyzing the information, and providing valuable contributions to the team's discussions. After the meeting, the supervisor praised Brian for his presentation but mentioned that Kyle's input had been crucial to the development of the project. Brian felt a mix of emotions bubble up inside him – disappointment, jealousy, and frustration with his coworker's more casual approach to their work. In the following days, Brian began to reflect on the differences between himself and Kyle. He knew that his propensity for preparation and organization was vital in certain situations, but he also recognized that he could learn something from Kyle's ability to think on his feet and remain cool under pressure. Over time, the two colleagues grew to complement each other's working styles. They combined Brian's well-structured presentations and careful research with Kyle's creativity and quick thinking. As a result, the quality of their work and the success of their projects improved significantly. In the end, the story of Brian and Kyle showcases the importance of recognizing and valuing different approaches. By understanding each other's strengths, they learned to combine forces to create a dynamic and successful partnership."},{"instruction":"Taylor hurt Lee's feelings after chewing him out in front of all his friends.

Exercise helps the blood to move around inside the body. This is very important. Blood takes nutrition to all parts of our bodies. The brains in our heads also need blood. We think with our brains.

Options: (A) 18 sec (B) 20 sec (C) 76 sec (D) 15 sec (E) 17 sec Let's think first. Some random reasoning:","output":"To find the time taken for the train to pass a tree, we need to calculate the time it takes for the entire length of the train (350 meters) to move past the tree at a speed of 63 km/h. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/h to m/s: 1 km = 1000 meters 1 hour = 3600 seconds So, to convert from km/h to m/s, you can use the following formula: (63 km/h) * (1000 meters / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) = 63 * (1000/3600) m/s 63 * (1000/3600) = 17.5 m/s Now that we have the speed in meters per second, we can find the time it takes for the train to pass the tree. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed In this case, the distance is the length of the train (350 meters) and the speed is 17.5 m/s. So, time = 350 m / 17.5 m/s = 20 seconds Therefore, the train will pass the tree in 20 seconds, which corresponds to option (B)."},{"instruction":"Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Even with the multimedia excitement of the web.

Question 2: I dream of things or people whom I haven't thought for long or haven't thought only. Why? Options are: (a). no; (b). yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Answer to Question 1: When you dream about someone you haven't seen for a long time, several interpretations can be made. Depending on the context, emotions, and content of the dream, it can represent different things, varying from personal emotions to symbolism. 1. Unresolved Emotions: The person you dreamt about might represent some unresolved emotions, conflicts, or feelings that you had either with them or surrounding a specific event or time in your life. Dreaming about them might indicate that your subconscious is trying to bring those emotions to the surface for you to process and resolve. 2. Personal Growth: Sometimes, dreaming about someone you haven't seen in a long time can indicate that you have gone through some personal growth since the last time you interacted with the person. The dream might serve as a way for your mind to compare the person you were back then with the person you have become. This can be an opportunity to acknowledge the changes that have occurred in your life. 3. Symbolism: People from your past can serve as symbols in your dreams. They may represent certain aspects of yourself, such as habits, feelings, or thoughts that you might need to address in your current life. The person may not necessarily have any direct significance but can serve as dream symbols for you to interpret. 4. Random Memory Resurfacing: Dreams are influenced by our memories. Occasionally, random memories may resurface during our dreams, even if they appear to be unrelated to your present life. Your mind may be trying to find connections or identify patterns from your past that have relevance to your current experiences. Answer to Question 2: It is indeed possible that you dream about things or people that you haven't actively thought about for a long time. This happens because our subconscious mind stores memories, experiences, and emotions, even those we may not consciously remember. During sleep, the subconscious mind is more active, and it can retrieve these stored memories and emotions, creating unexpected dreams featuring people or events from our past. While we may not consciously think of these individuals or events during our waking lives, they can still hold some meaning in our subconscious. This can surface in our dreams as a way for the mind to process emotions, symbolize certain feelings or aspects of our lives, or even to compare our past selves with our current selves. On the question of whether the answers to these two questions would be the same: While both questions are related to dreaming about people or things they haven't thought about for a long time, the reasons for the dreams and the symbolism within them may vary. The answer depends on the context of the dreams, personal emotions, and individual experiences. So, the answers to these questions may overlap, but they are not necessarily the same."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the following text.

Sarah went to jail.;","output":"Patricia was caught trespassing on Sarah's house and other property, a blatant violation of Sarah's privacy and a breach of the trust between the two neighbors. Their once cordial relationship had started to change, and the tensions had grown in recent months. However, none of the residents in the quiet neighborhood expected such an incident to unfold, shattering the peaceful ambiance of the sleepy town. Patricia, a single mother of two, had moved into the house adjacent to Sarah's two years ago. At first, their interactions were nothing but pleasant, with both women sharing recipes, exchanging gardening tips, and occasionally catching up over a cup of coffee. But as time went by, mysterious occurrences began surfacing around Sarah's property - some of her plants were inexplicably cut, a prized lawn ornament went missing, and late at night, unidentified whisperings and footsteps could be heard around the yard. Sarah, a strong and independent woman, decided to confront Patricia about these odd events, hoping that her neighbor would confess to being responsible. But Patricia denied everything, her voice wavering as she expressed concern for her neighbor's well-being and the safety of their homes. This only deepened the suspicions growing in Sarah's mind. In an attempt to catch the person responsible, Sarah decided to take matters into her own hands. She installed security cameras around her property and notified the local authorities of her plan. She felt confident that she would be able to identify the perpetrator and put an end to the string of unsettling occurrences that had disrupted her calm and structured life. A few weeks passed with no significant developments. Then, one fateful evening, Sarah walked into her living room to find Patricia rummaging through her belongings. Shocked at the sight, Sarah quickly snapped a photo of her intruder and called the police. When the police arrived and questioned both parties, it became clear that Patricia had been the one guilty of trespassing and invading Sarah's property. As they investigated further, they discovered that Patricia had developed an obsession with Sarah's life, stemming from her own loneliness and insecurities. She had been sneaking on to Sarah's property, spying on her, and even stealing her belongings in a desperate attempt to gain a sense of control and connection to the seemingly perfect life she believed Sarah had. As a result, Patricia was arrested and charged with multiple counts of trespassing, burglary, and invasion of privacy. She was brought to the local jail, where she awaited her court hearing. When the trial came, Sarah faced her former friend in court, unwilling to drop the charges but feeling a twinge of sympathy for the woman and her children. Sarah won the case, and Patricia was sentenced to several months in jail. She was also required to attend counseling and rehabilitation programs to address her emotional and psychological issues, as well as pay restitution to Sarah for the damages and expenses incurred throughout the ordeal. In the aftermath, Sarah felt a blend of relief and sadness. She couldn't ignore the fact that Patricia had once been her trusted friend. But with time and newfound understanding, Sarah began to slowly rebuild her life, welcoming new friendships and opportunities. She also made it her goal to advocate for neighborly compassion and the importance of supporting those around us, drawing from her own experiences in a quest to make her community a better and safer place for all."},{"instruction":"I moped around dejected when I should have lived in the moment .

I picked the wrong week to leave - this week will be gorgeous ; the week before I left was gorgeous . Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question What would have happened if I had stayed there ?","output":"Based on the preceding passage, it is not straightforward to deduce the exact consequences of staying during the mentioned period, but we can presume several possible scenarios if you had stayed there. 1. Change in mood: It seems that the individual experienced a downcast period during their stay, primarily characterized by moping around and engaging in aggressive behaviors like kicking and karate chopping others. If they had stayed there, they might have had the opportunity to alter their emotional state and experience the beautiful week that followed. This could have significantly improved their mental well-being, allowing them to appreciate the moments with a happier and more relaxed disposition. 2. Better relationships: The person admits that they should have smiled and laughed instead of resorting to hostile actions. By staying, they may have had a chance to repair strained relationships and build better connections with the people around them. Instead of focusing on the past and harboring negative sentiments, they could have lived in the moment and shared positive experiences. 3. Enjoying the surroundings: Both the week before they left and the week they chose not to stay were described as \\"gorgeous.\\" Consequently, if they had remained there, they could have enjoyed the increased beauty of their environment and partaken in outdoor activities that are more enjoyable during favorable weather conditions. This might have contributed to a sense of fulfillment and happiness, enabling them to make the most of the beautiful surroundings. 4. Personal growth and learning: Recognizing one's own mistakes is an important step towards personal growth. The individual is aware that their behavior did not align with how they should have acted. If they had stayed, they might have taken the opportunity to reflect upon their past actions, learn from them, and make a conscious effort to handle similar situations better in the future. 5. A different perspective on life: Taking the time to appreciate the present moment and embrace the beauty around is essential for our overall well-being. If the individual had stayed and made a conscious effort to focus on the positives, they might have shifted their outlook on life. Embracing gratitude and positivity during the beautiful week could have set a precedent for living with greater mindfulness moving forward. In summary, if the person had stayed there during the gorgeous week, they would have potentially experienced an improvement in mood, better relationships with others, enjoyed the beautiful surroundings, undergone personal growth by learning from their mistakes, and developed a different perspective on life. However, it's important to remember that this is a speculative answer, and the actual outcome would depend on the individual's willingness to change their behavior and make the most of the opportunities presented."},{"instruction":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Are Philip K.

Because liquid water is essential to life,the findings could have major implications for the possibility of Martian life.The researchers said further exploration is needed to determine whether microscopic life exists on the planet. The presence of liquid water could also make life easier for astronauts visiting or living on Mars.Water could be used for drinking and for creating oxygen and rocket fuel.NASA's goal is to send humans there in the 2030s. The evidence of flowing water consists largely of dark,narrow streaks on the surface that tend to appear and grow during the warmest Martian months and fade the rest of the year. Mars is extremely cold even in summer,and the streaks are in places where the temperature is as low as minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit.But salt can lower the freezing point of water and melt ice. The source of the water is a mystery.Scientists noted it could be melting ice.It could be an underground aquifer,which is rock or sand that can hold water.It is possibly water vapor from the thin Martian atmosphere,Or it may be a combination Michael Meyer,lead scientist for NASA's Mars exploration program,said the only definitive way for now to determine whether there's life on Mars is to collect rocks and soil for analysis on Earth - something a U.S.lander set for lift-off in 2020 will do.

Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Solve this instance: I_RUN I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP Student:","output":"Based on the definition, the sequence of actions can be translated into the command as follows: - 'I_RUN I_RUN' corresponds to 'run' happening twice, so it becomes 'run twice'. - 'I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP' corresponds to 'turn left and jump', so it becomes 'turn left and jump'. - Since this pattern 'I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP' repeats three more times, we can encapsulate it as 'turn left and jump' happening thrice.

The hat had kept the burning sun and beating rain off his head for as long as Jon owned the farm. He wore it every day. It had been a gift given to him on the day he married Alasandra but he could not remember who gave it to him. Jon put it back on his head and pushed the tiller deep into the stubborn earth.

Step 1: Consider the context and background of the situation In this text, we are looking at the difference between Angela and Rebecca's approaches to public speaking and how it affects their performance. Step 2: Establish the reason for the contrast between Angela and Rebecca's ease with public speaking Angela has devoted more time and effort to develop her public speaking skills over the years. In contrast, Rebecca is relatively new to this skill, which explains why she finds it difficult. Step 3: Elaborate on Angela's public speaking experience Angela's experience spans across various events, including presenting at conferences, workshops, and discussion panels. This exposure has allowed her to master the art of public speaking and become comfortable even when addressing a large audience. Additionally, Angela has also taken courses and received coaching on effective communication, further improving her abilities. Step 4: Explain Rebecca's challenges and her determination to improve Rebecca, on the other hand, has always been quite introverted and feared public speaking, as it caused her anxiety and self-doubt. However, she is determined to overcome these obstacles and expand her personal and professional growth. Rebecca has enrolled in a public speaking class to learn techniques, such as deep breaths and visualization, to manage her anxiety. Step 5: Discuss the possible growth and future outcomes for both Angela and Rebecca Despite their current differing skill levels, both Angela and Rebecca stand to benefit from continuous development and practice in public speaking. Angela can keep refining her skills by seeking out new challenges and opportunities, while Rebecca's persistent efforts will gradually enable her to become more confident and articulate in front of an audience. In conclusion, though Angela and Rebecca's ease with public speaking differs greatly due to their backgrounds and experiences, both of them possess the drive to improve and work on their skills.

Premise: Both old and young take part, attesting to the growing revival of interest in Spain's rich heritage of traditional dance and music. Hypothesis: Not many people are interested in Spanish dance and music anymore, so it's dying out. Step 2: Compare the key points in the premise and hypothesis. The premise suggests that there is a growing revival of interest in Spain's traditional dance and music and people of all ages are participating in it. This indicates that the interest in Spanish dance and music is strong and growing across generations. On the other hand, the hypothesis claims that not many people are interested in Spanish dance and music and as a result, it is dying out. This suggests a decline in interest and popularity of Spanish dance and music. Step 3: Determine if the premise supports or contradicts the hypothesis. The premise contradicts the hypothesis by providing evidence of a growing revival of interest in Spain's traditional dance and music, with participation from both old and young people. This growing interest goes against the claim made in the hypothesis that Spanish dance and music is dying out due to lack of interest. Step 4: Draw a conclusion. Based on the premise, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Not many people are interested in Spanish dance and music anymore, so it's dying out.\\" is not true.

Analyze its potential short-run and long-run impacts on an economy using the AD-AS model. Also, discuss the possible implications for the Phillips Curve. To answer this question, follow these steps: 1. Describe the AD-AS model: Begin by explaining the components of the Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply (AD-AS) model, which includes the Aggregate Demand curve that shows the total quantity of goods and services demanded in an economy, and the Aggregate Supply curve that shows the total quantity of goods and services producers are willing to supply in an economy. 2. Short-run analysis: Discuss how an increase in money supply would lead to an increase in aggregate demand in the short-run, potentially shifting the AD curve to the right. This shift could lead to: a. Higher real GDP (output) b. Higher price levels (inflation) 3. Long-run analysis: Explain the potential long-run effects of an increase in money supply on both Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply. The increase in price levels might induce producers to increase their production as well, causing the short-run AS curve to shift back to the long-run level, where the economy reaches its potential output again. In the long-run, this monetary policy might not have a lasting impact on real GDP but could lead to higher price levels. 4. Implications for the Phillips Curve: Discuss the relationship between inflation and unemployment as represented by the Phillips Curve. In the short-run, the increased money supply might decrease unemployment, as the increased demand for goods and services pushes firms to hire more workers. However, in the long-run, as the economy adjusts to higher price levels, the inflation rate might increase, and the Phillips Curve could shift upward. As a result, the economy might return to its natural rate of unemployment but experience higher inflation than before. This question is an example of a grad-school level question because it requires knowledge and understanding of advanced economic concepts, as well as the ability to analyze and interpret their impact on an economy both in the short and long term. It also demands critical thinking and connecting different economic models."},{"instruction":"Question: Information: - Losap is an atoll located in the Eastern Islands or Upper Mortlock Islands group in the state of Chuuk in the Federated States of Micronesia .

These friends were very strong because they were soldiers who had special training to protect their country. One day, they decided to go to a place called a bar where grown-ups sometimes go to have fun and talk with their friends after work. Now, in this story, there is also another important person: an off-duty police officer. Police officers are the heroes who keep us safe, and they wear uniforms and badges to show they are special helpers. Off-duty means the police officer was not working at that time and was just having a relaxing time with his friends. At some point, the British soldiers and the off-duty police officer met outside the bar. They began to play, but the play became a little rough, rougher than they wanted. The off-duty police officer was hurt because of this rough play. People who live in the city have rules they have to follow, so everyone can be safe and happy. When someone gets hurt or something goes wrong, it is important to make sure the people who did it understand what they did was not okay. In this case, the six British soldiers were told they did a naughty thing and now they are being charged. This means that they have to go to a place where important people, like a judge, can decide what should happen to them.

Kim was a bright and popular student, and her apparent decision to end her life leaves the community in shock and disbelief. The main character, Detective Jane Davis, returns to her hometown to lead the investigation and to support her grieving younger sister, Ava, who was Kim's best friend. As Jane delves into Kim's life at home and school, she finds an undercurrent of darkness lurking beneath the town's peaceful facade. Secrets and lies bubble to the surface, with some community members trying their best to keep the truth hidden. Ava grapples with the loss of her best friend and decides to help Jane in the investigation, as she feels there must be more to Kim's story than what is being portrayed by those who knew her. Act 2: Jane and Ava discover that prior to her death, Kim had begun uncovering a hidden connection between the town's seemingly benevolent mayor, Andrew Winslow, and a local drug ring that has been operating under the radar. As they continue to investigate, they find that Kim's boyfriend, Ethan, had become increasingly jealous and possessive due to her increased interest in exposing the truth. Jane and Ava confront Ethan, who admits to the relationship difficulties but denies any involvement in Kim's death. He provides them with evidence that could expose Mayor Winslow's criminal activities if brought to light. To protect his reputation and political career, Mayor Winslow would have had reason to silence Kim at all costs. Act 3: As they close in on the truth, Jane and Ava start receiving threats warning them to back off from the investigation. Jane's boss, pressured by the mayor's office, demands that she drops the case due to lack of evidence directly linking the mayor to Kim's death. However, Jane, with the support of Ava, decides to defy her orders and bring the evidence to a journalist who can help expose the mayor's connections to the drug ring and Kim's death. As Mayor Winslow's life begins to unravel, he confronts Jane and Ava in a dangerous standoff, ultimately admitting to his involvement in drug trade and threatening to destroy their lives. Just as he is about to harm them, the police, having been secretly informed by Jane, arrive and arrest the mayor. In the denouement, the town gradually comes to terms with the revelations and the true cause of Kim's suicide. The story ends with Cedar Falls starting to heal from the tragic loss of Kim and a community vowing to hold onto the light she had shown on the darkness that hid beneath the surface.

This statement discusses the possible use of harmful economic indicators and mechanisms within an organization or system, which may lead to detrimental consequences for its member states or participants. By limiting the financial contribution of member states to around 1 percent, the possible negative impacts of these mechanisms may be mitigated to some extent. However, this measure may not be enough to avoid creating a system that encourages poor economic practices or takes advantage of the vulnerabilities of its members. To prevent such issues from arising, it is essential for organizations to implement strict regulations and guidelines that promote transparency and fairness among their members. Economic indicators, such as GDP growth, inflation rate, and unemployment rate, can serve as helpful tools to assess the overall health of an economy. However, when misused or manipulated, these indicators can lead to adverse consequences for affected countries or regions. For example, misleading indicators can make an economy appear more stable than it is, resulting in a false sense of security and potentially leading to the exacerbation of pre-existing economic issues. Similarly, certain economic mechanisms, if not regulated properly, can have negative effects on the economies of member states. For instance, currency manipulation can destabilize financial markets, causing sharp fluctuations in exchange rates and investments. This can lead to increased volatility in financial systems and make it more difficult for countries to maintain economic stability. To address these concerns, it would be essential for organizations and institutions to adopt a transparent and fair approach when dealing with economic indicators and mechanisms. By promoting cooperation, enforcing strict regulations, and actively monitoring the use of such tools, member states can work together to create a more stable and equitable economic environment. Additionally, the measure of limiting financial contributions to around 1 percent for member states can serve as a safeguard against potential economic imbalances.

The answer is:","output":"Donington le Heath Manor House Museum, located in Coalville, Leicestershire, England, is a remarkable relic of history that traces its origin back to the 13th century. Having gone through several renovations and expansions over the centuries, the manor has been carefully preserved and restored as a museum, offering visitors a first-hand glimpse into medieval life in England. The manor was once owned by a relative of one of the group of provincial English Catholics led by Robert Catesby. Catesby was an Englishman who became infamous for his involvement and leadership in the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The objective of this conspiracy was to assassinate King James I, who was a Protestant, along with several other members of the English royalty, nobility, and Parliament. Catesby and his co-conspirators sought to replace the existing Protestant government with a Catholic leadership in a bid to restore the rights and privileges of English Catholics, who faced significant social, economic, and political discrimination. Robert Catesby was born around 1573 in Warwickshire, England, into a prominent Catholic family. His father, Sir William Catesby, was a staunch Catholic and a committed supporter of the Spanish Armada's attempts to invade England in 1588. The Catesby family maintained strong connections with fellow Catholic families throughout the English countryside, which would later facilitate the planning and execution of the Gunpowder Plot. The precise relationship between the owner of Donington le Heath Manor House Museum and Catesby remains unclear. However, it is established that this individual was a part of the extensive network of Catholic families that were affiliated with Catesby. This connection highlights the broader importance of examining historical sites, such as Donington le Heath Manor House Museum, to shed light on critical socio-political events and religious tensions that shaped the lives and worldview of individuals who lived during that era. Today, Donington le Heath Manor House Museum serves as a testament to England's rich history and provides valuable insights into the struggles that English Catholics faced in the aftermath of the Reformation. This breathtaking specimen of medieval architecture not only illuminates the daily experiences of a typical 17th-century manor's inhabitants but also acts as a reminder of the complex web of political and religious allegiances that characterized the period. In conclusion, Donington le Heath Manor House Museum was once owned by a relative of one of the group of provincial English Catholics led by Robert Catesby. Catesby, who spearheaded the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, hoped to liberate English Catholics from oppressive religious restrictions by arranging a wide-scale attack against the Protestant establishment. The presence of a family member of his worshipping within the walls of this historic manor provides a tangible connection between this landmark and the broader narrative of England's turbulent religious history."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Process: - Electromagnet creates magnetic field with electricity - Conductive copper wire is wrapped around a piece of metal - An electric current gets introduced from power source - Flows through the wire - Magnetic field gets created in the wire - And the metal gets magnetized - When turned off it is no longer magnetic. suppose fewer copper wire loops happens, how will it affect a STRONGER electromagnet.

Our task is to extract all unique alphabets, sort them, and return the sorted list. If there are no alphabets in the list, we need to return -1. Now, let's solve the instance: ['j', '281'] 1. First, we'll initialize an empty set to store unique alphabets. Let's call this set unique_alphabets. 2. Next, we'll iterate through the input list, checking each element. If the element is a lowercase alphabet (using the isalpha() and islower() methods), we'll add it to the unique_alphabets set, which ensures that each alphabet appears only once. 3. Once we've iterated through the entire list, we'll check the size of unique_alphabets set. If the set is empty, it means there were no alphabets in the input list and we return -1. 4. Otherwise, we'll convert the set of unique_alphabets to a list and sort it (using the sorted() function). 5. Finally, we'll return the sorted list of unique alphabets. Here's how this works for the given input ['j', '281']: 1. The unique_alphabets set is initialized as empty: unique_alphabets = set() 2. Iterating through the list: - 'j' is a lowercase alphabet, so we add it to unique_alphabets -> unique_alphabets = {'j'} - '281' is not an alphabet, and we skip it. 3. The unique_alphabets set is not empty, so we proceed to sort the unique alphabets. 4. Converting unique_alphabets into a sorted list -> sorted_unique_alphabets = ['j'] 5. The final sorted list of unique alphabets is ['j'], which we return. Thus, the solution for the given input is ['j']."},{"instruction":"Today is Baden 's birthday .

Ann: Hmm, which option would be the best for us? Natalia: Well, if we buy the tickets from the band's website, there might be exclusive merch available for purchase as well. Plus, we would be directly supporting our favorite band. Ann: That sounds awesome! But what about the ticketing platform? Are there any advantages to using that instead? Natalia: Yes, actually. The platform offers a more user-friendly interface, making it easier to choose our desired sitting places. They also provide a full refund if the event is canceled or rescheduled.

What do you think about buying the tickets directly from the concert venue? Natalia: That's another option worth considering. If we buy the tickets directly from the venue, we can avoid those service charges that often come with online purchases. However, we have to physically go to the venue to pick up the tickets ourselves, which might be a bit inconvenient considering our busy schedules. Ann: Yeah, you're right.

Filling the water tank with water: This is necessary because water is the source of steam, which powers the entire process. 2. The water tank over the boiler is heated: This step is crucial as it increases the water's temperature, eventually converting it into steam. 3. Creates steam: As heat is applied to the water in the tank, steam is produced. This step is significant because it represents the conversion of water to steam, which will then be used to power the piston. 4. The steam is funneled to the piston: The steam must be directed towards the piston so it can use that energy to move. This step is essential to ensure the steam's energy is being harnessed efficiently. 5. Piston uses the steam as energy: The piston captures the steam's energy to generate motion. The piston's motion is crucial for powering the crankshaft, which will ultimately drive mechanical components. 6. The piston causes the crankshaft to move: Once the piston harnesses the steam's energy, its force moves the crankshaft. This step is vital because it transforms the steam's energy into mechanical movement, which can then be used to power other machinery or devices."},{"instruction":"Article:The Sierra Leone Football Association (SLFA) is not currently organising a domestic league however it is running an FA Cup that only a handful fans watched over the weekend, despite entry being free. Just a week earlier the biggest crowd for a domestic in more than 20 years saw Mountain City beat Fullah Town 1-0 in the non-league final at the Siaka Stevens stadium in Freetown. Indeed the match attracted more fans than some of Sierra Leone's recent international matches in Freetown. Even a breakaway league organised by 11 out of 14 premier league clubs that ended a few months ago failed to attract large crowds in Freetown. The community tournament was organised by Freetown-based Central One Football Association (Cofa), an affiliate body to West Area Football Association (Wafa) which is a member of the SLFA. The majority of players from Freetown's 11 top-flight clubs played in the community league including several internationals among them goalkeeper Unisa Koroma for Mountain City. The match also boasted big-names coaches with Charlie Wright leading Mountain City and Amidu Karim in charge of Fullah Town. The duo are usually assistant coach and head coach respectively at Kallon FC. Replica shirts of the two finalists were sold out and the SLFA provided Fifa-standard referees for the final to show their support for the competition. Blamoh Robert, the secretary general of premier league club Kallon FC (owned by former Leone Star Mohamed Kallon), says the SLFA should take note. \\"This is a big slap in the face to the SLFA and its members in Freetown as Cofa has succeeded where we have failed,\\" Roberts told BBC Sport. \\"The SLFA and Wafa has brought football to standstill in the western area because of pride and ego. \\"This is as a result of the impasse within the SLFA. This should teach us that we must play football no matter the situation. \\"The SLFA should not be learning from Cofa, it should be the other way round.\\" The head of competitions of the SLFA Sorie Ibrahim Sesay disagrees that it reflects badly on them but admits that their FA Cup is struggling to attract crowds in Freetown. \\"It's a fact the Cofa final attracted a big crowd but it's not a slap against us because we're organising the FA Cup despite the challenges we are facing,\\" Sesay told BBC Sport. \\"One of the challenges is that the ongoing national FA Cup is struggling to draw crowds in Freetown and it's because of infighting within the football family. \\"Sierra Leoneans like football and I believe if we stop fighting and unite as a family we'll organise better domestic competitions and crowds will return to watch our matches.\\" The problems within Sierra Leone football and the recent Ebola outbreak means that there has been just one league season and two FA Cups since 2013.

The missing teams were also part of the 11 sides that took part in a breakaway league earlier this year and had vowed not to play in any competition organised by the current SLFA administration.

The first scenario describes a situation where \\"Four teenagers, three girls and one boy, are jumping in the air on a sidewalk by the river.\\" It provides specific details such as the number of people, their ages, genders, their action, and their location. The subjects are teenagers who are engaged in a playful activity (jumping) in a clear location – on a sidewalk beside the river. The second statement states, \\"A group of senior citizens are riding in a car.\\" Once again, the number of people and their action is specified, and also their age group – senior citizens in this case. However, these people are involved in a completely different activity: they're riding in a car. There is no relationship or link between these two scenarios. They involve different individuals (teenagers versus senior citizens), different activities (jumping versus driving), and different environments (sidewalk by the river versus inside a car). In conclusion, there's no logical or other form of connection between these two scenarios that would allow us to conclude that the four teenagers jumping by the river simply based on the information that there are senior citizens riding in a car. The environments, activities, and people are distinct with no subset that overlaps in both scenarios. Hence, the answer is [c] no - it's not possible to conclude that \\"Four teenagers, three girls and one boy, are jumping in the air on a sidewalk by the river\\" if \\"A group of senior citizens are riding in a car.\\" The other options, [a] yes and [b] it is not possible to tell, are not suitable. [a] yes would be incorrect because, as explained, there is no logical or factual connection between the two scenarios. [b] it is not possible to tell would also be incorrect because it is clear from the information given in both scenarios that they are unrelated and independent of each other."},{"instruction":"the u.s. military says an american soldier has died in northern iraq .

They both had canned soup with them. Pete heated the can without venting it and it exploded, while Dan opened his can and heated it over the fire with no additional problems. But I can use this background: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. What is an answer for this question: Which camper learned less about kinetic energy? Answer:","output":"Dan learned less about kinetic energy, as his can-opening and heating method did not lead to an explosion, unlike Pete's experience. Pete's can explosion directly demonstrated the effects of kinetic energy and the importance of venting the can."},{"instruction":"If yes i do she was um at a private well i stayed off work with her for little over for of a year when she was born and then i, can we conclude that \\"I stayed at home until I couldn't afford it anymore.\\"?

Article: All schools have their own rules. The rules change from one school to another. Some schools are much stricter than others. There are also some rules that are strange or funny to us. Here are some funny school rules: Strict Japanese rules Most schools ask students to wear uniforms, such as sports suits or skirts. But Japanese schools even have rules about the colour of underwear ! They also require that girls' socks should be folded in a certain way and boys' heads should be shaved . Other Japanese schools tell students that they can't go to the movies after sunset. Different shoes in the USA At some American schools, students have to change their shoes when they go into the schools every day. This makes sure students won't fall over on the floors and keeps the schools clean. No strange hair in the UK Strange hairstyles are not allowed in some British schools. But they might allow students to wear certain hairstyles during the World Cup years. There were two students who had special hairstyles during the 2002 World Cup. After the World Cup, their teachers asked them to go to the barber's at once. Question: Why do students in the USA have to wear indoor shoes? Answer: The answer is:","output":"In the USA, students at some schools are required to wear indoor shoes to maintain cleanliness and safety within the school premises. When students change their shoes upon entering the school, it helps to keep the floors clean and free from dirt, debris, and other contaminants that could be brought in from outside. Additionally, wearing indoor shoes helps to reduce the risk of slipping and falling, as they are typically designed to provide better traction on the school's flooring surfaces.

The family moved to Cairo, Egypt, a few months after his birth, and Copeland spent his formative years in the Middle East. In 1957, his family moved to Beirut, Lebanon, and Copeland attended the American Community School there. He started taking drum lessons at age 12 and was playing drums for school dances within a year. In late 1976, Copeland founded the Police with lead singer-bass guitarist Sting and guitarist Henry Padovani (who was soon replaced by Andy Summers), and they became one of the top bands of the 1980s. The Police's early track list was mostly made of Copeland's compositions, including the band's first single \\"Fall Out\\" (Illegal Records, 1977) and the B side \\"Nothing Achieving\\". Though Copeland's songwriting contribution was reduced to a couple of songs per album as Sting started writing more material, he continued to co-arrange all the Police's songs with his two bandmates. Amongst Copeland's most notable songs are \\"On Any Other Day\\" (where he sang lead vocals too), \\"Does Everyone Stare\\" (later to be used as the title of his documentary on the band Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out), \\"Contact\\", \\"Bombs Away\\", \\"Darkness\\" and \\"Miss Gradenko\\". Copeland also co-wrote a number of songs with Sting, including \\"Peanuts\\", \\"Landlord\\", \\"It's Alright for You\\" and \\"Re-Humanize Yourself\\". Copeland also recorded under the pseudonym Klark Kent, releasing several UK singles in 1978 with one (\\"Don't Care\\") entering the UK Singles Chart that year, along with an eponymously titled 10-inch album on green vinyl released in 1980. Recorded at Nigel Gray's Surrey Sound Studio, Copeland played all the instruments and sang the lead vocals himself. Kent's \\"Don't Care\\", which peaked at #48 UK in August 1978, actually predates the first chart single by the Police by several months (\\"Can't Stand Losing You\\", issued in October 1978) as \\"Don't Care\\" was released in early June 1978. In 1982 Copeland was involved in the production of a WOMAD benefit album called Music and Rhythm. Copeland's score for Rumble Fish secured him a Golden Globe nomination in 1983. The film, directed and produced by Francis Ford Coppola from the S. E. Hinton novel, also had a song released to radio on A&M Records \\"Don't Box Me In\\" (UK Singles Chart n. 91)--a collaboration between Copeland and singer/songwriter Stan Ridgway, leader of the band Wall of Voodoo--that received significant airplay upon release of the film that year. The Police stopped touring in 1984, and during this brief hiatus he released a solo album, The Rhythmatist. The record was the result of a pilgrimage to Africa and its people, and it features local drums and percussion, with more drums, percussion, other musical instruments and occasional lead vocals added by Copeland. The album was the official soundtrack to the movie of the same name, which was co-written by Stewart. He also starred in the film, which is \\"A musical odyssey through the heart of Africa in search of the roots of rock & roll.\\" (Copeland is seen playing the drums in a cage with lions surrounding him.)

Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the process is the growth and development of the mycelium. To describe this first step in detail: 1. Mycelium growth and development: Before the basidia can give off spores, the mycelium, which is the vegetative part of a fungus, must grow and develop. Mycelium is composed of a network of thread-like structures called hyphae. It forms the main body of a fungus and can grow in various environments, such as soil, wood, or decaying organic matter. This extensive network of hyphae allows the fungus to absorb and utilize nutrients from its surroundings, which promotes its growth and development. The mycelium also helps the fungus reproduce by producing fruiting bodies, such as mushrooms. During this growth phase, the mycelium may form a relationship with other organisms, such as plants or bacteria, in a symbiotic, parasitic, or mutualistic manner. For example, in the case of mycorrhizal fungi, the mycelium forms a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of a plant. The mycelium provides the plant with essential minerals and nutrients while receiving carbohydrates that the plant produces through photosynthesis. When conditions are favorable, such as the right balance of temperature, moisture, and nutrients, the mycelium then moves on to the next phase of the process, which is the formation of the basidia that will eventually give off spores. The entire process can be summarized as follows: 1. Mycelium growth and development 2. The basidia gives off spores 3. The spores germinate 4. The spores create Hyphae 5. Multiple Hyphae meet and converge 6. They join with Mycelium 7. A hyphal knot forms in the ground 8. A primordia shoots out of the ground 9. A mushroom cap is formed."},{"instruction":"Q:Given the following passage \\"The first technical dictionary was drafted by John Harris and entitled Lexicon Technicum: Or, An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences.

A Christian school principal has come under fire from parents and members of the public after he turned away two Muslim women who wore hijabs on their first day as student teachers. People took to social media to express their disappointment at Principal Mark Bensley's decision. Redlands College parent Jennie Duke wrote she was 'so very sad' her daughter attended the school and her university sent student teachers there, The Courier Mail reported. Others re-branded Redlands College as 'Redneck College' and questioned Mr Bentley's Christian faith. 'It’s not very \\"Christian like\\" for a Christian school to tell student teachers that they are not welcome to teach and learn because they wear a hijab,' a reader wrote on the newspaper's website. 'Shame on you Redlands College. This could have been a very good way to show Christian love and acceptance.' The two Muslim women were allocated positions to start their work placement at Redlands College, as they are in their final year of studying teaching at university. But Mr Bensley didn't allow the women to go ahead with their placement, and justified his decision in the college newsletter on Tuesday, claiming he acted inside his duty of care, according to the paper. 'I have a duty of care to ensure that those teaching at the College are actively supporting the Christian principles, practices and beliefs of the College,' he wrote. He continued by writing that he viewed the wearing of the hijab to be in direct opposition to the principles which the college upholds. Mr Bensley said he respected the two women's right to wear the hijab but felt it was inappropriate at his school, and had them transferred to another school to complete their placement. In a statement to the publication, Redlands College said that they were accepting and loving of all people from all cultures and religions. A statement from the Christian College denied any wrongdoing and said they are not aware the student teachers had any opposition to being transferred. 'We are not aware that they [student teachers] had any concerns, and it is our understanding that all parties came to a mutual agreement for the benefit of all,' the school said. Redlands also claimed that they would not hide their Christian values and were there to provide for the families seeking a Christian education. A spokesperson for the school said that the decision had nothing to do with intolerance and they condemn any form of that behavior. The Islamic community are disappointed with the decision while a Reverend said it goes against fundamental Christian beliefs. According to Section 25 of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1991, employers are allowed to enforce a 'genuine occupational requirement that workers act in a way that is consistent with the religious beliefs of the school'. However, the move has upset many, including the Muslim community with the Islamic College of Brisbane principal saying the decision was a matter of great concern.

Hypothesis: Wal-Mart will be granted the appeal from the judge.","output":"As an AI, I am unable to predict the future or provide a definitive answer about whether Wal-Mart will be granted the appeal from the judge. However, I can provide a detailed analysis of the factors and possibilities that could influence the outcome of this situation. Firstly, it is important to understand that when a party requests an appeal, the higher court reviews the decisions made by the lower court. The appeals process can be complex, as the appellate judges look at the legal aspects of the case to determine if there was any error in the application of the law by the lower court. In this case, Wal-Mart Stores is asking a US federal appeals court to review a judge's order that approved class-action status for a sex-discrimination lawsuit. The success of their appeal will depend on various factors, including the legal arguments presented by Wal-Mart, the strength of the evidence, and the interpretation of the law by the appellate judges. Some factors that may influence the outcome of the appeal include: 1. The strength of Wal-Mart's legal arguments: In order to succeed in their appeal, Wal-Mart's legal team will need to provide strong and well-reasoned arguments that can persuade the appellate judges that the lower court's decision to grant class-action status was an error. 2. Precedent: The appellate court could be influenced by previous similar cases and their outcomes. If there are past cases in which a similar appeal was granted, Wal-Mart might have a stronger chance of having their appeal granted as well. 3. Changes in the law or legal interpretation: If recent changes have been made to the law or legal interpretations regarding class-action lawsuits or sex-discrimination cases, the appellate judges might consider these changes when looking at Wal-Mart's appeal. 4. The composition of the appellate panel: The decision-making process in an appeals court is subjective, as it depends on the interpretation and judgment of the appellate judges. If the panel consists of judges who have a history of siding with corporations in similar cases or expressing more conservative views on class-action lawsuits, Wal-Mart might have a higher likelihood of having their appeal granted. 5. Public opinion and pressure: Though appellate courts are supposed to be impartial, public opinion and pressure could indirectly influence the court's decision.

The Browns failed to score and trailed 3-0 after the first quarter. The Raiders scored a second quarter touchdown to take a 10-0 lead. Late in the half, the Browns reached the Raiders' 1 yard line and had 1st and goal at the 1. However, they failed to get into the end zone in three attempts. After a false start penalty on 4th and goal, the Browns settled for a field goal to cut the deficit to 10-3. With less than 2 minutes remaining in the half, the Raiders drove down the field, and QB Derek Carr threw a touchdown pass, giving the Raiders a 17-3 lead at halftime. Early in the third quarter, the Raiders kicked another field goal and went up 20-3. The Browns finally reached the end zone in the third quarter as QB Josh McCown completed a 28-yard pass to TE Gary Barnidge, cutting it to 20-10. The Raiders scored another touchdown early in the 4th quarter, and the Browns trailed 27-10. At that moment, the Browns began to mount a 4th quarter rally. K Travis Coons kicked a field goal to pull within 27-13. The Raiders turned the ball over in their own territory on their next drive, and the Browns scored another touchdown to cut the deficit to 27-20. The Browns' defense forced a 3 and out, and the Raiders were forced to punt. However, Travis Benjamin muffed the punt, and the Raiders recovered it. The Raiders ran three more plays before they punted again, pinning the Browns at their own 2 yard line. The Browns had one last chance to score a game saving touchdown. Within 2 minutes, they reached the Raiders' 29 yard line. After McCown was sacked, the Browns faced 3rd and 14 on the Raiders' 34 yard line with under 45 seconds to play. At that moment, McCown threw a pass that was intercepted by Charles Woodson. With no timeouts remaining, the Raiders were able to kneel and run out the clock.

Explanation: Division and multiplication are closely related mathematical operations. In fact, division is the inverse operation of multiplication. Once students have a solid understanding of division, learning multiplication is a natural next step. This is because both operations deal with the concepts of groups and the distribution of quantities. While division involves splitting a quantity into equal groups, multiplication involves combining groups to find a total quantity. By learning multiplication, students can build on their understanding of division and strengthen their overall arithmetic skills. Although some of the other options may be related to mathematical concepts, like \\"putting together\\" (which could be addition) and \\"unity\\" (referring to the concept of one or being whole), they are less directly connected to division than multiplication. \\"Pay debts\\" is not a mathematical operation or concept, so it is not relevant to the topic."},{"instruction":"Note the options at the end.

And if some House Republicans get their way, all door-to-door mail delivery will go away. The U.S. Postal Service is marching towards a more \\"centralized delivery,\\" where residents pick up their own mail from clusters of mail boxes located in their neighborhood. Local postmasters are sending hundreds of letters to fast-growing communities, warning that cluster boxes will be the way mail will be delivered to new developments. In the past year, the cash-strapped Postal Service has been asking companies in industrial parks and shopping malls to also adopt this form of mail delivery. But Rep. Darrell Issa, the California Republican leading the House effort to save the postal service, wants more. He has made doing away with doorstep delivery a key part of his bill, which would require everyone to get mail at a curbside box or from a cluster box. \\"A balanced approach to saving the Postal Service means allowing USPS to adapt to America's changing use of mail,\\" said Issa, who is chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Moving away from door-to-door delivery saves a lot of money. Right now, 35 million residences and businesses get mail delivered to their doorstep. It costs 353 per stop for a delivery in most American cities, taking into account such things as salaries and cost of transport. By contrast, curbside mail box delivery costs 224, while cluster boxes cost 160, according to a report from the Postal Service's Office of Inspector General. Delivering mail is the agency's largest fixed cost -- 30 billion. Ending such door deliveries would save 4.5 billion a year. That's more than the 3 billion it would have saved from ending Saturday mail service, according to government reports. Related: Los Angeles is worst for mail carrier dog bites That's why ending door delivery has drawn industry support from groups like the Greeting Card Association, which supports Saturday service. But unions say it's a bad idea to end delivery to doorsteps and will be disruptive for the elderly and disabled. \\"It's madness,\\" said Jim Sauber, chief of staff for the National Association of Letter Carriers. \\"The idea that somebody is going to walk down to their mailbox in Buffalo, New York, in the winter snow to get their mail is just crazy.\\" Yet postal officials say everything's on the table, when it comes to cost-cutting. Earlier this year, it tried to end Saturday mail delivery, but later reversed its decision. The Postal Service continues to struggle with mail volume, especially drops in first-class mail, its big revenue driver, as more Americans move to electronic billing and e-mailing. In 2012, the agency lost 16 billion. Last year, the agency twice defaulted on payments owed to the federal government to prefund retiree health care benefits totaling 11 billion. The agency has also exhausted a 15 billion line of credit from the U.S. Treasury. Ending a Congressional mandate to make large annual payments toward retiree health care benefits would help solve the agency's woes. As it awaits for help from Congress, the postal agency has been trying to do what it can on its own. One of the initiatives is pushing cluster boxes on new developments. \\"Prior to this spring, we'd work with the construction companies and they could decide if the houses would get cluster boxes or curbline delivery --- now the Postal Service makes that decision,\\" said Postal Service spokeswoman Sue Brennan. Related: Wave of federal retirees to hit government In Cranberry, Pa., the community is up in arms after getting a letter in April from the Postal Service saying cluster boxes would be going in new developments. Community leaders say they understand the boxes are cheaper but they want a better plan that takes into account safety, access and maintenance. Township leaders and the postal service are holding talks over the boxes. \\"We understand what's driving this is a cost savings,\\" said Cranberry Township Manager Jerry Andree. \\"But you can't just take a cluster box and drop it into the community without planning for its safety, use and access.\\" For now, residents already receiving door delivery will see no change, unless the route is deemed dangerous because a dog bites a mailman or Congress changes the law, said Steven Hutkins, a professor of literature at New York University, and a postal service expert. \\"The big thing will be if they get approval in legislation to make the switch for existing door delivery customers,\\" said Hutkins, who writes the blog Save the Post Office. ||||| Congressional effort to cut Postal Service losses proposing an end to door-to-door mail delivery. The Postal Service will end Saturday delivery for first class mail this summer, Postmaster General Patrick Donahue said Wednesday. (Photo: Doug Benz for USA TODAY) Story Highlights Proposal could affect up to 37 million addresses Labor-intensive door-to-door delivery costs the post office an average 353 a year per address Cluster boxes cost the agency just 160 a year First, it was doing away with Saturday delivery. Now, door-to-door service could be coming to an end. In an effort designed to cut costs at the cash-strapped agency by up to 4.5 billion a year, congressman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., is proposing that the U.S. Postal Service phase out door-to-door delivery and shift service curbside and to neighborhood cluster boxes. The proposal — due for vote by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday — would affect about 37 million residences and businesses. The Postal Service spends about 30 billion annually on mail delivery, losing 15.9 billion last year alone. It does not receive federal assistance, getting revenue from postage sales, delivery services and other products. But mail service has dropped nearly 25% from 215 billion pieces delivered in 2006 to a current volume of 160 billion, says Postal Service spokeswoman Sue Brennan. The Postmaster General's office estimates labor-intensive door-to-door delivery costs an average 353 a year. Curbside delivery averages 224; cluster boxes, just 160. The Postal Service, currently making 54 million curbside deliveries and 40 million to cluster boxes and central locations, has been moving toward collective deliveries at shopping malls, business parks and newer residential developments. \\"A balanced approach to saving the Postal Service means allowing USPS to adapt to America's changing use of mail,'' Issa said in a statement. \\"Done right, these reforms can improve the customer experience through a more efficient Postal Service.\\" Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe has been seeking flexibility in the way the Postal Service delivers mail, such as cutting Saturday delivery — which drew strong public and congressional criticism when it was proposed last year. In April, the Postal Service said it was scuttling plans to end Saturday service this summer, although ending six-day service is still eventually possible, says Ali Ahmad, communications adviser to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which Issa chairs. The National Letter Carriers Association, which opposes ending six-day delivery, is also against ending door-to-door delivery, which is says would hurt jobs and harm elderly and shut-ins who would have difficulty receiving mail. Issa's proposal would allow for free hardship exemptions and door-to-door deliveries for small, unspecified fees, Ahmad says.

The clock is 500 feet tall and powered by the Earth's thermal cycles, Bezos said in a tweet Tuesday. \\"It's a special Clock, designed to be a symbol, an icon for long-term thinking,\\" a blog post signed by Bezos says. The clock has been in the works for nearly three decades, according to the post, and is designed to tick once a year. The century hand advances once every 100 years, and the cuckoo comes out on the millennium. The project was initiated by Danny Hillis in 1989.

Construction is under way, and we're making progress every day,\\" the post reads. ||||| Some people say that they feel the future is slipping away from them. To me, the future is a big tractor-trailer slamming on its brakes in front of me just as I pull into its slip stream. I am about to crash into it. When I was a kid, three decades ago, the future was a long way off - so was the turn of the millennium. Dates like 1984 and 2001 were comfortably remote. But the funny thing is, that in all these years, the future that people think about has not moved past the millennium. It's as if the future has been shrinking one year, per year, for my entire life. 2005 is still too far away to plan for and 2030 is too far away to even think about. Why bother making plans when everything will change? How we name our years is part of the problem. Those three zeros in the millennium form a convenient barrier, a reassuring boundary by which we can hold on to the present and isolate ourselves from whatever comes next. Still, there is more to this shortening of the future than dates. It feels like something big is about to happen: graphs show us the yearly growth of populations, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, Net addresses, and Mbytes per dollar. They all soar up to form an asymptote just beyond the turn of the century: The Singularity. The end of everything we know. The beginning of something we may never understand. I think of the oak beams in the ceiling of College Hall at New College, Oxford. Last century, when the beams needed replacing, carpenters used oak trees that had been planted in 1386 when the dining hall was first built. The 14th-century builder had planted the trees in anticipation of the time, hundreds of years in the future, when the beams would need replacing. Did the carpenters plant new trees to replace the beams again a few hundred years from now? When I tell my friends about the millennium clock, either they get it or they don't. Most of them assume I'm not serious, or if I am, I must be having a midlife crisis. (That's nice, Danny, but why can't you just write a computer program to do the same thing? Or, Maybe you should start another company instead.) My friends who get it all have ideas that focus on a particular aspect of the clock. My engineering friends worry about the power source: solar, water, nuclear, geothermal, diffusion, or tidal? My entrepreneurial friends muse about how to make it financially self-sustaining. My writer friend, Stewart Brand, starts thinking about the organization that will take care of the clock. It's a Rorschach test - of time. Peter Gabriel, the musician, thinks the clock should be alive, like a garden, counting the seasons with short-lived flowers, counting the years with sequoias and bristlecone pines. Artist Brian Eno felt it should have a name, so he gave it one: The Clock of the Long Now. Ten thousand years - the life span I hope for the clock - is about as long as the history of human technology. We have fragments of pots that old. Geologically, it's a blink of an eye. When you start thinking about building something that lasts that long, the real problem is not decay and corrosion, or even the power source. The real problem is people. If something becomes unimportant to people, it gets scrapped for parts; if it becomes important, it turns into a symbol and must eventually be destroyed. The only way to survive over the long run is to be made of materials large and worthless, like Stonehenge and the Pyramids, or to become lost. The Dead Sea Scrolls managed to survive by remaining lost for a couple millennia. Now that they've been located and preserved in a museum, they're probably doomed. I give them two centuries - tops. The fate of really old things leads me to think that the clock should be copied and hidden. The idea of hiding the clock to preserve it has a natural corollary, but it takes Teller, the professional magician, to suggest it without shame: \\"The important thing is to make a very convincing documentary about building the clock and hiding it. Don't actually build one. That would spoil the myth if it was ever found.\\" In a way, Teller is right. The only clocks that have ever really survived over the long run (like the water clock of Su Sung, or the giant hourglass of Uqbar) have survived in books, drawings, and stories. In the universe, pure information lives the longest. Bits last. Just before Jonas Salk died, I was lucky enough to sit next to him at a dinner. I didn't know him well, but in past conversations he had always encouraged my more mystical lines of thought. I was sure he would like the millennium clock. I was disappointed by his response: \\"Think about what problem you are trying to solve. What question are you really trying to ask?\\" I had never thought of the clock as a question. It was more of an answer, although I wasn't sure to what. I talked more, about the shrinking future, about the oak trees. \\"Oh, I see,\\" Salk said. \\"You want to preserve something of yourself, just as I am preserving something of myself by having this conversation with you.\\" I remembered this a few weeks later, when he died. \\"Be sure you think carefully about exactly what you want to preserve,\\" he said. OK, Jonas, OK, people of the future, here is a part of me that I want to preserve, and maybe the clock is my way of explaining it to you: I cannot imagine the future, but I care about it. I know I am a part of a story that starts long before I can remember and continues long beyond when anyone will remember me. I sense that I am alive at a time of important change, and I feel a responsibility to make sure that the change comes out well. I plant my acorns knowing that I will never live to harvest the oaks. I have hope for the future. Danny Hillis is an inventor, scientist, and computer designer.

The 10,000 Year Clock is a project of the Long Now Foundation, a non-profit organisation that wants to make \\"long-term thinking more common\\". It is being built on property owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, beneath a mountain in the middle of a desert in Texas, There is currently no completion date scheduled for the project. The clock's creator, American inventor Danny Hillis, first publicly shared the concept in an essay for Wired in 1995. In it, he describes his vision of a timepiece that ticks once every year, with a century hand that moves just once every 100 years and a cuckoo that emerges every 1,000. The clock is designed to capture energy from changes in temperature to power its timekeeping apparatus, according to the Long Now Foundation. But it will not be able to store enough energy to display the time unless visitors \\"wind\\" it with a hand-turned wheel. Bezos shared a video of the clock's construction on Twitter on Tuesday: The project has attracted the support of influential artists and thinkers in addition to Bezos, whose contribution of 42 million (£30m) makes him its largest financial backer. British musician Brian Eno, famous for his ambient compositions, has built a mechanical melody generator that will produce a different chime sequence every day for 10,000 years. Like the clock hands, the chimes will only work if visitors power the clock. The first prototype of the clock, which was completed in 1999, is now on display at the Science Museum in London. According to the Long Now Foundation, visitors will be able to hike to the site to see the finished product. ||||| The full scale 10,000 Year Clock is now under construction. While there is no completion date scheduled, we do plan to open it to the public once it is ready. The essay below by Long Now board member Kevin Kelly discusses what we hope the Clock will be once complete. This is one of several projects by Long Now to foster long-term thinking in the context of the next 10,000 years. Clock in the Mountain by Kevin Kelly There is a Clock ringing deep inside a mountain. It is a huge Clock, hundreds of feet tall, designed to tick for 10,000 years. Every once in a while the bells of this buried Clock play a melody. Each time the chimes ring, it’s a melody the Clock has never played before. The Clock’s chimes have been programmed to not repeat themselves for 10,000 years. Most times the Clock rings when a visitor has wound it, but the Clock hoards energy from a different source and occasionally it will ring itself when no one is around to hear it. It’s anyone’s guess how many beautiful songs will never be heard over the Clock’s 10 millennial lifespan. The Clock is real. It is now being built inside a mountain in western Texas. This Clock is the first of many millennial Clocks the designers hope will be built around the world and throughout time. There is a second site for another Clock already purchased at the top of a mountain in eastern Nevada, a site surrounded by a very large grove of 5,000-year-old bristlecone pines. Appropriately, bristlecone pines are among the longest-lived organisms on the planet. The designers of the Clock in Texas expect its chimes will keep ringing twice as long as the oldest 5 millennia-old bristlecone pine. Ten thousand years is about the age of civilization, so a 10K-year Clock would measure out a future of civilization equal to its past. That assumes we are in the middle of whatever journey we are on – an implicit statement of optimism. The Clock is now being machined and assembled in California and Seattle. Meantime the mountain in Texas is being readied. Why would anyone build a Clock inside a mountain with the hope that it will ring for 10,000 years? Part of the answer: just so people will ask this question, and having asked it, prompt themselves to conjure with notions of generations and millennia. If you have a Clock ticking for 10,000 years what kinds of generational-scale questions and projects will it suggest? If a Clock can keep going for ten millennia, shouldn’t we make sure our civilization does as well? If the Clock keeps going after we are personally long dead, why not attempt other projects that require future generations to finish? The larger question is, as virologist Jonas Salk once asked, “Are we being good ancestors?” The Clock’s inventor introduced the idea of the Clock (in 01995) with this context: I cannot imagine the future, but I care about it. I know I am a part of a story that starts long before I can remember and continues long beyond when anyone will remember me. I sense that I am alive at a time of important change, and I feel a responsibility to make sure that the change comes out well. I plant my acorns knowing that I will never live to harvest the oaks. I want to build a clock that ticks once a year. The century hand advances once every 100 years, and the cuckoo comes out on the millennium. I want the cuckoo to come out every millennium for the next 10,000 years. That’s Danny Hillis, a polymath inventor, computer engineer, and designer, inventor and prime genius of the Clock. He and Stewart Brand, a cultural pioneer and trained biologist, launched a non-profit foundation to build at least the first Clock. Fellow traveler and rock musician Brian Eno named the organization The Long Now Foundation to indicate the expanded sense of time the Clock provokes – not the short now of next quarter, next week, or the next five minutes, but the “long now” of centuries. Eno also composed the never-repeating melody generator that rings the Clock’s chimes inside the mountain. Other people unhappy with our society’s short-attention span are part of this group, including me, one of its charter officers. This Clock in the Mountain is being funded and built on property owned by Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon.com. Bezos is also active in designing the full experience of the Clock. The first step in this multi-decade project was to construct a working 8-foot-tall prototype. This test version was finished (just in time) on New Year’s Eve 1999. At the stroke of midnight, the prototype 10,000-year Clock bonged twice to usher in the new millennia, the year 2000, in front of a small crowd at its temporary home in the Presidio, San Francisco. The Clock now resides in the London Science Museum. Somewhat worrisome, there have been moments when it was not wound. In contrast to the human-scale of the prototype, the Clock in the mountain will be monumental, almost architectural in scale. It will be roughly 200 feet tall. Located under a remote limestone mountain near Van Horn, Texas, it will require a day’s hike to reach its interior gears. Just reaching the entrance tunnel situated 1500 feet above the high scrub desert will leave some visitors out of breath, nicked by thorns, and wondering what they got themselves into. To see the Clock you need to start at dawn, like any pilgrimage. Once you arrive at its hidden entrance in an opening in the rock face, you will find a jade door rimmed in stainless steel, and then a second steel door beyond it. These act as a kind of crude airlock, keeping out dust and wild animals. You rotate its round handles to let yourself in, and then seal the doors behind you. It is totally black. You head into the darkness of a tunnel a few hundred feet long. At the end there’s the mildest hint of light on the floor. You look up. There is a tiny dot of light far away, at the top of top of a 500 foot long vertical tunnel about 12 feet in diameter. There is stuff hanging in the shaft. The dot of light beckons you. You begin the ascent. You start climbing a continuous spiral staircase, winding up the outer rim of the tunnel, rising toward the very faint light overhead. The stairs are carved out of the rock. The material above each step has been removed from the tunnel leaving astoundingly precise rock stairs. To cut the spiral staircase Stuart Kendall of Seattle Solstice invented a special stone slicing robot to continuously grind out the stairs at the rate of a few stairs per day. His robot incrementally creeps downward while the debris falls into the central shaft out of the way. Round the tunnel and up the tube toward the light you head. The first part of the Clock you encounter on the ascent up the spiral staircase is the counterweights of the Clock’s drive system. This is a huge stack of stone disks, about the size of a small car, and weighing 10,000 pounds. Depending on when the clock was last wound, you may have to climb 75 feet before you reach the weights. After you pass the weights, you arrive at the winding station. It is a horizontal windlass, or a capstan like the turnstile on an old sailing vessel that winds up an anchor. It takes two or three visitors to push around the capstan of the clock and to lift its 10,000-pound stones. You rotate around until you can no further. Now the clock is wound. You keep climbing. For the next 70-80 feet of ascent you pass 20 huge horizontal gears (called Geneva wheels), 8 feet in diameter, each weighing 1,000 pounds. This is the mechanical computer that calculates the over 3.5 million different melodies that the chimes will ring inside the mountain over the centuries. The chimes never repeat so that every visitor’s experience is unique, and the calculated variety creates a sense of progressive time, rather than endless recycling. And “calculate” is the correct word, because cut into the gears is an elaborate system of slots and sliding pins, which, much like a Babbage Difference Engine, will perform digital calculations, generating the next sequence of the ten bells. Only the Clock calculates without electricity, using your stored energy to moving its physical logic gates and bits. This is the world’s slowest computer. On days when visitors are there to wind it, the calculated melody is transmitted to the chimes, and if you are there at noon, the bells start ringing their unique one-time-only tune. The 10 chimes are optimized for the acoustics of the shaft space, and they are big. Finally, way out of breath, you arrive at the primary chamber. Here is the face of the Clock. A disk about 8 feet in diameter artfully displays the natural cycles of astronomical time, the pace of the stars and the planets, and the galactic time of the Earth’s procession. If you peer deep into the Clock’s workings you can also see the time of day. But in order to get the correct time, you need to “ask” the clock. When you first come upon the dials the time it displays is an older time given to the last person to visit. If no one has visited in a while, say, since 8 months and 3 days ago, it will show the time it was then. To save energy, the Clock will not move its dials unless they are turned, that is, powered, by a visitor. The Clock calculates the correct time, but will only display the correct time if you wind up its display wheel. So yet another hand-turned wheel awaits your effort to update the face of time. This one is much easier to wind because the dial motion consumes less power than ringing bells. You start winding and the calendar wheels whirr until BING, it stops and it shows the current date and time. So how does the Clock keep going if no one visits it for months, or years, or perhaps decades? If it is let to run down between visits, who would keep resetting it? The Clock is designed to run for 10,000 years even if no one ever visits (although it would not display the correct time till someone visited). If there is no attention for long periods of time the Clock uses the energy captured by changes in the temperature between day and night on the mountain top above to power its time-keeping apparatus. In a place like a top of a mountain, this diurnal difference of tens of degrees in temperature is significant and thus powerful. Thermal power has been used for small mantel clocks before, but it has not been done before at this scale. The differential power is transmitted to the interior of the Clock by long metal rods. As long as the sun shines and night comes, the Clock can keep time itself, without human help. But it can’t ring its chimes for long by itself, or show the time it knows, so it needs human visitors. If the sun shines through the clouds more often than expected, and if the nights are colder than usual, the extra power generated by this difference (beyond what is ordinarily needed to nudge the pendulum) will bleed over into the Clock weights. That means that over time, in ideal conditions, the sun will actually wind up the chimes, and wind them up sufficiently for them to ring when no one is there. The rotating dials, gears, spinning governor, and internal slips of pins and slots within the Clock will be visible only if you bring your own light. The meager dot of light above is not sufficient to see much otherwise. Lights off, the Clock sits in near total darkness, talking to itself in slow clicks, for perhaps years at a time. In the darkness you can hear things moving, crisp non-random pings, like a crude thought trying to form inside a dim unlit brain. Shining your light around the rest of the chamber you’ll see the pendulum and escapement encased in a shield of quartz glass – to keep out dust, air movements, and critters. The pendulum, which governs the timing of the Clock, is a 6-feet-long titanium assembly terminating with football-sized titanium weights. It swings at a satisfyingly slow 10-second period. The slight clicks of its escapement echo loudly in the silence of the mountain. Building something to last 10,000 years requires both a large dose of optimism and a lot of knowledge. There’s a huge geek-out factor in the Clock because the engineering challenges are formidable. What do you build with that won’t corrode in 100 centuries? How do you keep it accurate when no one is around? The Clock’s technical solutions are often ingenious. Almost any kind of artifact can last 10 millennia if stored and cared for properly. We have examples of 5,000-year-old wood staffs, papyrus, or leather sandals. On the other hand, even metal can corrode in a few years of rain. For longevity a 10K year environment is more important than the artifact’s material. The mountain top in Texas (and Nevada) is a high dry desert, and below, in the interior tunnel, the temperature is very even over seasons and by the day (55 degrees F) – another huge plus for longevity since freeze-thaw cycles are as corrosive as water. Dry, dark and stable temperatures are what archivists love. It’s an ideal world for a ceaseless Clock. Still, the Clock is a machine with moving parts, and parts wear down and lubricants evaporate or corrode. Most of the Clock will be made in a marine grade 316 stainless steel. Because the engineering tolerances of the huge Clock are in fractions of an inch, rather than thousandths, the microscopic expansion by a film of rust won’t hurt the time keeping. The main worry of the Clockmakers is that elements of a 10K-year Clock — by definition — will move slowly. The millennial dial creeps so slowly it can be said to not move at all during your lifetime. Metals in contact with each other over those time scales can fuse – defeating the whole purpose of an ongoing timepiece. Dissimilar metals in contact can eat each other in galvanic corrosion. To counteract these tendencies some of the key moving parts of the Clock are non-metal — they are stone and hi-tech ceramics. Ceramics will outlast most metals. We have found shards of clay pots 17,000 years old. And modern ceramics can be as hard as diamonds. All the bearings in the Clock will be engineered ceramic. Because these bearings are so hard, and rotate at very low speed, they require no lubrication – which normally attracts grit and eventually cause wear. There is more than just technology in the mountain. The ticks of time are a very human invention. Astronomical calendars are among the first pieces of culture, and often the mark of civilizations. The cave holds culture. The Clock in the mountain not only plays the music of an ever-changing slow melody, but it will collect cultural expressions of time, ticks to mark the passage of decades and centuries. Off to the side of the main cavern of the Clock are a series of small grottos to explore and collect these notices of time. Their contents will be a surprise. Behind the main chamber’s dials the stairs continue up to the outside summit of the mountain. The shaft above Clock continues to the surface, where its opening to the daylight is capped with a cupola of sapphire glass. This is the only part of the clock visible from outside, on the mountain peak. In this outdoor cupola sits the thermal-difference device to power the timekeeping, and also a solar synchronizer. Every sunny noon, a prism directs sunlight down the shaft and slightly heats up this ingenious mechanical device. That synchronizing signal is transmitted by rods further down to the Clock’s innards, where the imperceptible variations in the length of the day as the earth wobbles on its axis will be compensated so that the Clock can keep its noon on true solar noon. In that way the Clock is self-adjusting, and keeps good time over the centuries. The journey to the Clock in the mountain ends on the summit in light. It is the sun that powers its ringing below. Like a heart beating while we sleep, the Clock in the mountain keeps time even when we pretend the past did not happen and the future will not come. The biggest problem for the beating Clock will be the effects of its human visitors. Over the span of centuries, valuable stuff of any type tends to be stolen, kids climb everywhere, and hackers naturally try to see how things work or break. But it is humans that keep the Clock’s bells wound up, and humans who ask it the time. The Clock needs us. It will be an out of the way, long journey to get inside the Clock ringing inside a mountain. But as long as the Clock ticks, it keeps asking us, in whispers of buried bells, “Are we being good ancestors?” How do you become one of those time-conscious beings who visit and wind the Clock?

In 1968, Silver began to experiment with adhesives, trying to come up with a strong glue for various industrial applications at 3M's Central Research Laboratory in St. Paul, Minnesota. During his work on adhesives, Silver accidentally discovered a loosely sticky adhesive that could be applied to surfaces and easily removed without leaving any residue or damaging the underlying surface. At the time, the seemingly weak glue didn't seem to have much practical application, so the discovery was initially shelved. It wasn't until 1974 that a fellow 3M scientist named Art Fry came up with the idea of using Silver's adhesive on small pieces of paper. Fry, who sang in a church choir, was frustrated with the bookmarks he used for his hymnal constantly falling out of place. He thought that if he could attach a small and reusable piece of paper to the hymnal pages with a light adhesive, it would solve his problem. This idea later evolved into the concept of using such paper pieces for leaving notes and messages. Fry worked with Silver to attach the adhesive to pieces of paper, eventually creating the first Post-it Notes prototypes. They initially came up with a light-yellow color that is now synonymous with Post-it Notes, later named \\"Canary Yellow,\\" as the lab next door to their workplace had a surplus of the specific yellow paper. 3M launched the product in stores in 1977 under the name \\"Press 'n Peel\\" bookmarks, but the initial market response was lukewarm. The company continued to perfect their marketing strategy and decided to rebrand the product as \\"Post-it Notes\\" in 1980. The new branded product was introduced through free samples given to consumers and businesses in Boise, Idaho, which garnered an overwhelmingly positive response. Today, Post-it Notes are widely recognized and used around the world for various purposes, with an extensive range of colors, shapes, and sizes available. The invention of Post-it Notes is an excellent example of how accidental discoveries can turn into innovative and successful products through creativity, collaboration, and persistence."},{"instruction":"In this task, you're given the title and three arbitrary sentences out of a five-sentence story.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The perturbation in the described scenario, where there are fewer objects for sound to bounce from, can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. In the echolocation process carried out by bats and other animals, the production and reception of high-pitched tones is crucial for determining the size, shape, and position of objects in their surroundings. When there are fewer objects for the sound waves to bounce off of, the available information for the bat to interpret and analyze is reduced. This is due to the fact that the fewer echoes returning to the bat's ears, the less environmental input it has to assess its surroundings. This situation indirectly impacts the process of echolocation, particularly in the steps where the bat hears the echoed sound and uses the folds in its ears and adaptations in its brain to make sense of the returned sound waves. In a setting with fewer objects for sound to bounce from, the bat might experience difficulties in discerning its surroundings effectively, potentially leading to reduced navigation, foraging, and predator avoidance capabilities. It is worth noting that the aforementioned perturbation does not directly impact any specific step in the echolocation process, as the bat would still be able to produce high-pitched tones and listen to echoes returning from objects that are present. Rather, the perturbation's effect is felt more broadly across the process, as the quantity and diversity of information available to the bat is impacted. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation - having fewer objects for the sound to bounce from - can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the echolocation process, mainly by reducing the complexity and richness of information accessible to the bat in order to navigate its environment. This could lead to challenges in assessing the surroundings and adapting to varying conditions and potential threats, affecting the bat's overall ability to perform necessary behaviors for survival."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

The sentence offers sufficient information about the specific issue related to the game, which appears to be the result of an error in the spelling of a location, \\"Marven Gardens.\\" Additionally, the sentence shares that Parker Brothers not only acknowledged the mistake but also formally apologized to the residents of the misidentified location.

Lindsey enjoys watching horror movies but Felicia does not, so OPT: - Lindsey went to see a romantic movie.. - Felicia went to see a romantic movie..","output":"Lindsey enjoys watching horror movies but Felicia does not, so Felicia went to see a romantic movie. While Lindsey finds thrill and excitement in the twists and turns of horror movies, Felicia prefers a completely different genre. Romantic movies, with their heartwarming stories and emotional connections, are more appealing to Felicia, and she enjoys the atmosphere of love and lightheartedness that they provide. When both friends were deciding what movie to watch, they had to take their individual tastes into account. It was important for them to compromise in order to preserve their friendship and make sure that both of them would have an enjoyable experience. In the end, they agreed that it was best for Felicia to go see a romantic movie so that she could indulge in the emotional journey of the characters and watch their love blossom on screen. These contrasting movie preferences among friends are not unusual, and they showcase the unique tastes that people have in terms of entertainment. Horror movies, which have been popularized with iconic films like \\"Psycho\\" and \\"The Shining,\\" tend to incite fear and suspense in viewers. There’s a certain adrenaline rush associated with watching characters fight off supernatural or menacing forces. On the other hand, romantic movies, such as \\"The Notebook\\" or \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" take viewers on an emotional journey that highlights the highs and lows of human relationships. The allure of romantic movies for some people, like Felicia, lies in the heartwarming moments, tender exchanges, and the often triumphant conclusion when love conquers all obstacles. Despite their differences, Lindsey and Felicia's willingness to compromise shows that they value their friendship and respect each other's preferences. It's a lesson for all of us to remember that understanding and accommodating others, even when it comes to something as simple as choosing a movie, can foster stronger emotional bonds and deepen our relationships with those around us."},{"instruction":"How does the next paragraph end?

Hypothesis: Two people having a picnic. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the premise provided, we cannot conclude the hypothesis mentioned as the situations describe two entirely different scenarios. The Premise: In this scenario, we are given a situation where a man and a smiling young boy in a float vest are swimming together. This scene depicts two individuals happily engaging in a recreational water activity. They appear to be enjoying themselves while ensuring the safety of the young boy, as demonstrated by the use of a float vest. Thus, it shows a bonding moment between the man and the young boy, fostering a positive experience in a water-based setting. The Hypothesis: The hypothesis, on the other hand, describes a situation where two people are having a picnic. A picnic is typically an outdoor leisure activity where people bring food and enjoy it together in a natural setting, such as a park, beach, or other picturesque locations. The primary focus of a picnic is sharing food and mingling in an informal and relaxed environment. It is a social event that generally involves eating, conversation, and relaxation while appreciating the outdoors. This hypothesis focuses on a land-based activity instead of a water-based one and has a completely different context compared to the premise. In conclusion, given the premise of a man and a smiling young boy swimming together with a float vest, we cannot confirm the hypothesis of two people having a picnic. These two respective narratives present contrasting situations and activities, one centered around swimming and bonding in water, while the other is focused on eating and socializing outdoors.

Does it follow that \\"I have never been in a fight.\\"? Choose from: A). yes B). it is not possible to tell C). no","output":"C). No Based on the information provided, it does not follow that \\"I have never been in a fight.\\" In contrast, it seems that you have been in multiple fights, as you describe yourself as the best pit fighter in Tog Veel. Pit fighting typically involves participants engaging in hand-to-hand combat within a designated area, often referred to as the \\"pit.\\" These fights usually take place to entertain audiences for amusement or profit and are generally associated with underground or unsanctioned fighting. It's also assumed that pit fighters would have had varying degrees of experience and skill, as well as distinct fighting styles and techniques to distinguish themselves from their competitors. By describing yourself as the best pit fighter in Tog Veel, it suggests that you have not only been in fights but have been remarkably successful in those encounters. You may have a unique combination of physical prowess, skill, and mental fortitude that has allowed you to prevail over others in the intense and brutal competitions that pit fighting entails. However, it's important to note that being a skilled pit fighter may have limited relevance in other types of altercations or conflicts. For example, success in pit fighting may not directly translate to optimal performance in sport-focused martial arts, military combat, or self-defense situations where rules, objectives, and risk factors may be quite different. Additionally, while you may have honed your skills and mastered techniques for pit fighting, these abilities do not inherently grant you the ability to avoid getting into fights or to practice nonviolent conflict resolution techniques. In summary, the statement that \\"I have never been in a fight\\" does not follow from being the best pit fighter in Tog Veel. Instead, it implies that you have consistently displayed exceptional martial prowess within the context of pit fighting, having been in several fights and emerging victorious in many of those encounters."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Answer the question below: Sarah is carrying two tubs, one is filled with rocks, the other with feathers.

A step-by-step solution is:","output":"The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. To understand this, let's break down both statements and analyze them step by step. Premise: \\"A group of people enjoying a beautiful day in the park.\\" Here are the key points of this premise: 1. There is a group of people. 2. They are at a park. 3. They are enjoying the day. 4. The day is described as 'beautiful.' Hypothesis: \\"A group of people are at the park on a snowy day.\\" Here are the key points of this hypothesis: 1. There is a group of people. 2. They are at a park. 3. The day is snowy. Step 1: Compare the key points. The first two key points of both the premise and hypothesis match, stating that there is a group of people at a park. Step 2: Analyze the description of the day. In the premise, the day is described as \\"beautiful.\\" This is a subjective term, which means it could mean different things to different people. For some, it might indicate a warm sunny day, while for others, it could mean a snowy day. In the hypothesis, the day is described as \\"snowy.\\" Beautiful and snowy are not interchangeable, so we cannot automatically assume that the day referred to in the premise is indeed snowy. Step 3: Compare \\"enjoying the day\\" versus \\"a snowy day.\\" The premise describes the people as \\"enjoying the day,\\" but it does not specify why they are enjoying it. It could be due to the weather, the company, or a specific event happening in the park. On the other hand, the hypothesis focuses solely on the weather—the snow. Conclusion: The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. Although the premise shares some key points with the hypothesis (group of people at a park), the description of the day being \\"beautiful\\" does not inherently mean the day is snowy. Additionally, the premise doesn't specifically mention that the people are enjoying the day due to the snow, so we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is correct based solely on the information provided in the premise."},{"instruction":"Generate a short summary this sentence: a document uncovered in the archives of east germany 's feared secret police proves for the first time that border guards had a clear shoot-to-kill order from the communist regime , officials said sunday .","output":"A paper found in a secret place from a long time ago shows that people who watched the border were told to shoot anyone trying to cross it.

Stone had previously protested the proposed portrait for more than a year, saying that the funds to engage an artist would be better spent on suffrage work. Stone finally yielded to pressure from Frances Willard, the New England Women's Club and some of her friends and neighbors in the Boston area, and sat while Whitney produced a bust. In February 1893, Stone invited her brother Frank and his wife Sarah to come see the bust, before it was shipped to Chicago for display at the upcoming World's Columbian Exposition. Stone went with her daughter to Chicago in May, 1893 and gave her last public speeches at the World's Congress of Representative Women where she saw a strong international involvement in women's congresses, with almost 500 women from 27 countries speaking at 81 meetings, and attendance topping 150,000 at the week-long event. Stone's immediate focus was on state referenda under consideration in New York and Nebraska. Stone presented a speech she had prepared entitled \\"The Progress of Fifty Years\\" wherein she described the milestones of change, and said \\"I think, with never-ending gratitude, that the young women of today do not and can never know at what price their right to free speech and to speak at all in public has been earned.\\" Stone met with Carrie Chapman Catt and Abigail Scott Duniway to form a plan for organizing in Colorado, and Stone attended two days of meetings about getting a woman suffrage drive restarted in Kansas. Stone and her daughter returned home to Pope's Hill on May 28. Those who knew Stone well thought her voice was lacking strength. In August when she and her husband Harry wanted to take part in more meetings at the Exposition, she was too weak to go. Stone was diagnosed as suffering from advanced stomach cancer in September. She wrote final letters to friends and relatives. Having \\"prepared for death with serenity and an unwavering concern for the women's cause,\\" Lucy Stone died on October 18, 1893, at the age of 75.

Six women and six men served as pallbearers, including sculptor Anne Whitney, and Stone's old abolitionist friends Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Samuel Joseph May. Mourners lined the streets for a sight of the funeral procession, and front-page banner headlines ran in news accounts. Stone's death was the most widely reported of any American woman's up to that time. According to her wishes, her body was cremated, making her the first person cremated in Massachusetts, though a wait of over two months was undertaken while the crematorium at Forest Hills Cemetery could be completed.

He was among the four sons and three daughters of Khansaahib Ameer Ahmed Khan and Mehmoodah Begum. His father, a police inspector, was inspired by the reformist thinking of Syed Ahmed Khan. In his early age, Khan's mother introduced him to the poetry of Maulana Hali and Muhammad Iqbal, the sermons of Abul Kalam Azad, and the Sufist philosophy of Rumi. The Comilla Model (1959) was Khan's initiative in response to the failure of a Village Agricultural and Industrial Development (V-AID) programme that was launched in 1953 in East and West Pakistan with technical assistance from the US government. V-AID remained a government-level attempt to promote citizen participation in the sphere of rural development. Khan launched the project in 1959 on his return from Michigan, and developed a methodology of implementation in the areas of agricultural and rural development on the principle of grassroots-level participation. Initially, the aim was to provide a development model of programmes and institutions that could be replicated across the country. Advisory support in this respect was provided by experts from Harvard and Michigan State Universities, the Ford Foundation, and USAID. Practical help was also sought from Japan to improve the local farming techniques. Comilla Model simultaneously addressed the problems that were caused by the inadequacy of both local infrastructure and institutions through a range of integrated programmes. The initiatives included the establishment of: a training and development centre; a road-drainage embankment works programme; a decentralized, small scale irrigation programme; and, a two-tiered cooperative system with primary cooperatives operating in the villages, and federations operating at sub-district level. After Khan's departure from Comilla, the cooperative's model failed in independent Bangladesh because only a few occupational groups managed to achieve the desired success. By 1979, only 61 of the 400 cooperatives were functioning. The model actually fell prey to the ineffective internal and external controls, stagnation, and diversion of funds. This prompted the subsequent scholars and practitioners in microfinance, such as Muhammad Yunus of Grameen Bank and Fazle Hasan Abed of BRAC, to abandon the cooperative approach in favour of more centralised control and service delivery structures. The new strategy targeted the poorest villagers, while excluding the 'less poor'. However, Khan's leadership skills during the course of his association with the project remained a source of inspiration for these leaders, as well as other participatory development initiatives in the country. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: do you have any examples of what these problems were?","output":"Yes, the article provides examples of the problems faced in the Comilla Model: \\"The model actually fell prey to the ineffective internal and external controls, stagnation, and diversion of funds.\\" These issues ultimately led to the failure of the cooperative model in independent Bangladesh, with only 61 of the 400 cooperatives functioning by 1979.

Article: The most popular names in the west Every year in Englishspeaking countries,people list the most popular names. Here are some examples. In the United States at the moment the three most popular names for girls are Emily,Emma and Madison. For boys,they are Michael,Joshua and Mathew. In Britain a parent today might call their little girl Grace,Jessica or Ruby. If they have a little boy they could call him Jack,Thomas or Oliver. In China names have very clear meanings. If a girl is called Mei,her name means \\"beautiful\\". If a boy is called Wu,his name means \\"like a soldier\\". Names in Englishspeaking countries are like this too. The girl's name Joy is probably partly chosen because the parents wish their daughter to be joyful and bring joy to others. If a girl is called Ruby,it may be because of the beautiful red precious stone. Parents often pick names that can be shortened. This can be confusing for Chinese people. Parents might choose such names because they want to be able to speak to their kid in a personal way. For example,a popular name is William. But William can be shortened to Will,Willy,Bill and Billy. The same is true of the favourite old name for a girl,Elizabeth. Elizabeth can be shortened to Beth,Liza and Liz. Another reason why kids get the names they do is that parents want to name their boy or girl after someone who is famous,such as an actor,a pop music star or a sports star.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to.

Translate to English English:","output":"We know that many initiatives are emerging in China to massively protest against violations of minimum standards for ecology and the environment. In recent years, China has experienced significant economic growth which consequently led to rapid industrialization and widespread urban development. As a result, the country has grappled with a range of environmental issues, including air and water pollution, land degradation, and waste management problems. Recognizing the severity of these challenges, numerous initiatives have emerged across the country to tackle these problems and advocate for better ecological and environmental standards. These initiatives span a broad range of forms, from grassroots movements led by everyday citizens to formal campaigns spearheaded by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and government agencies. Below are a few examples of various initiatives undertaken in China aimed at protesting and addressing violations of minimum environmental standards. 1. Public protests: Ordinary Chinese citizens have increasingly taken to the streets to voice their concerns over environmental issues. These protests have often led to the suspension or cancellation of environmentally damaging projects, such as the construction of chemical plants, power plants, or waste incinerators. 2. Environmental NGOs: A growing number of NGOs are focused on environmental protection in China. Organizations such as Greenpeace, Friends of Nature, and the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPEA) work tirelessly to raise awareness about environmental issues, advocate for policy reforms, and provide research and data-driven solutions to the challenges. 3. Social media campaigns: The proliferation of social media has allowed for the rapid dissemination of information about environmental violations and mobilization of support for various initiatives. Chinese citizens frequently use platforms such as Weibo and WeChat to share stories, images, and videos of pollution, which can quickly generate widespread public outcry and pressure on offenders to address these violations. 4. Green supply chain initiatives: Many Chinese industries are investing in sustainable practices and implementing green supply chain initiatives to reduce their environmental impact. Companies are increasingly focusing on reducing emissions, minimizing waste, and promoting the use of sustainable materials in their production processes. 5. Government regulations and policies: The Chinese government has been gradually strengthening environmental regulations, imposing stricter penalties on those who violate these standards, and investing in renewable energy sources. Recent governmental initiatives include the revision of the Environmental Protection Law, the introduction of a national carbon trading scheme, and the implementation of the Made in China 2025 strategic plan, which aims to promote a greener, more sustainable manufacturing sector. In conclusion, the growing awareness and concern for environmental issues in China have spurred an increase in various initiatives aimed at protesting and addressing violations of minimum ecological and environmental standards. These actions span a wide range of forms, from grassroots protests to organized campaigns led by NGOs and government agencies. While challenges remain, it is evident that the Chinese population and the country's leadership are increasingly committed to finding solutions to create a more ecologically sustainable future."},{"instruction":"Choose from: [+] the dam project has been prevented [+] the first three activists are all from Asia [+] a European company is going to dig for nickel [+] Ma June is trying to stop oil and gas exploration Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

Each year, the American-based group honors environmental activists from six different areas. The first three winners of the 2012 Goldman Prize are from Kenya, the Philippines and China. The Goldman Environmental Foundation says Ikal Angelei is a hero to those who live around Lake Turkana. The Kenyan woman received the award because of her efforts to stop a dam project on a river in Ethiopia. Critics say the dam will harm the lake and restrict the flow of water for people who live nearby. The Philippine island of Mindoro is home to those who depend on the area's natural resources for food and jobs. Edwin Gariguez became concerned when a European company announced plans to mine for nickel on the island. The Roman Catholic minister said waste materials from the mining project would pollute the water and destroy the forests. So he started a campaign to stop the project. In China, Ma June is working with businesses to clean up their pollution. He formed a group that collects information about pollution, and publishes it on the Internet.

We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17-year-old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays/controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don't believe that anyone will be released from the game.The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - genius recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers.

John do not want any of his friends to see his garden but he often show off his aquarium.

On one hand, John finds immense satisfaction and pride in his aquarium, which is a stunning and carefully managed ecosystem teeming with a diverse array of colorful and exotic fish, coral, and aquatic plants. Over the years, he has developed a keen understanding of the complex relationships between the inhabitants of his aquarium and the delicate balance that must be maintained in order to ensure their health and well-being. John is an avid researcher, exploring different species, their habitats, and the specific water conditions they require, bringing these elements together in harmony to create a breathtaking underwater world. This dedication and passion for keeping his aquarium in optimal condition has earned John the admiration and respect of his friends, who are often eager to catch a glimpse of the captivating aquatic landscape he has cultivated. John frequently shares pictures and stories of his aquarium with his social circle, sparking lively discussions about aquatic life and the tireless efforts that even a skilled aquarist like him must undergo to preserve the fragile beauty and equilibrium of a thriving ecosystem. In stark contrast, John's garden is a source of perpetual frustration and disappointment for him. Despite his best efforts and countless hours spent tending to the plants, the garden refuses to bend to his will, and he is constantly grappling with the forces of nature that seem determined to undermine his every move. His plants never quite reach the lush, verdant state that he envisions, and the flowers that do emerge often appear lackluster and forlorn. Pests threaten the well-being of his beloved greenery, while unpredictable weather patterns wreak havoc on his already tenuous grasp of effective gardening. This persistent struggle has taken a toll on John's self-esteem with regard to his gardening prowess, and he is understandably reluctant to share this aspect of his life with his friends, fearing that their perceptions of his competence and dedication to his hobbies will be irrevocably marred by the sorry state of his garden. John's situation highlights the multifaceted nature of individual talents and interests, as well as the emotional weight that people may attach to their successes and failures in various areas of their lives. While John excels in designing and maintaining his awe-inspiring aquarium, his experiences with gardening seem to be a constant reminder of his inadequacies in that domain. As a result, he consciously chooses to keep his less-than-impressive garden out of sight, preferring to focus on sharing his passion and success with his aquarium, where he feels far more confident and accomplished."},{"instruction":"- birth date is 4 october 1974 - nationality is belgian - birth place is schoten , belgium - occupation is politician , lawyer Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.","output":"Based on the details provided, it is likely that the individual in question is Bart De Wever.

Control of Galaxy IV was lost on May 19 , 1998 when the satellite 's primary control processor failed . The backup control processor had suffered a previously undetected anomaly , and PanAmSat was not able to regain control of the spacecraft . Galaxy IV was declared a loss on May 20 , 1998 . Failure of the primary control processor was attributed to tin whisker growth , a phenomenon in which tendrils grow from solder , causing an electrical short circuit . Engineers believe that a hole developed in the conformal wax coating over the solder , allowing whiskers to develop . The satellite manufacturer , Hughes , has replaced pure tin plating with nickel to alleviate the problem in newer designs , adding 45 to 90 kg per payload . The loss of this satellite was very disruptive to telecommunications in the United States . Pagers were affected greatly ; service was not restored for days . Wire news services , like Reuters , were also affected . The TV network CBS had to use alternate means of transmitting its programs , as did NPR . At the time of failure , Galaxy IV was in geostationary orbit at 99 ° W. This orbital slot was briefly occupied by Galaxy 4R , and is now occupied by the Galaxy VI satellite .

In air navigation or radio frequency identification, a flight transponder is an automated transceiver in an aircraft that emits a coded identifying signal in response to an interrogating received signal. In a communications satellite, a satellite transponder receives signals over a range of uplink frequencies usually from a satellite ground station, amplifies them, and re-transmits them on a different set of downlink frequencies to receivers on Earth, often without changing the content of the received signal or signals. - The former PanAmSat Corporation founded in 1984 by Reynold (Rene) Anselmo, was a satellite service provider headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut. It operated a fleet of communications satellites used by the entertainment industry, news agencies, internet service providers, government agencies, and telecommunication companies. Anselmo got the idea for PanAmSat from Norm Leventhal, a communications lawyer in Washington, D.C., to whom he had turned to for advice regarding difficulties he was encountering in getting reasonably priced satellite transmission for his Spanish International Network (SIN), the current-day Univision. Anselmo financed the entire project himself and Leventhal's law firm, hiring Martin Rothblatt for special satellite technical advice, filed for approval from the Federal Communications Commission and lining up an initial satellite from RCA Astro-Electronics and a heavily discounted launch from Arianespace. - A communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunications signals via a transponder; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth.

In what time will it pass a bridge 290 m long? Options: (A) 40 sec (B) 52 sec (C) 45 sec (D) 48 sec (E) 50 sec Some stream of consciousness:","output":"Let's start by breaking the problem down into manageable pieces. We are given: 1. The train's length is 360 meters. 2. The train's speed is 45 km/hr. 3. The bridge's length is 290 meters. We are asked for the time it will take the train to pass the bridge entirely. First, let's convert the train's speed of 45 km/hr to meters per second (m/s) since the lengths are given in meters. We know that 1 km = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds. Speed in m/s = (45 km/hr) * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 45 * 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 12.5 m/s Now, to pass the bridge entirely, the train needs to cover a distance equal to the sum of its own length and the bridge's length. So, that distance will be: Total distance = Train's length + Bridge's length Total distance = 360 m + 290 m = 650 m Now, we have the total distance needed to be covered and the train's speed. To find the time, we can use the relation: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 650 m / 12.5 m/s Time = 52 seconds So, the train will pass the bridge entirely in 52 seconds. The correct option is (B) 52 sec."},{"instruction":"I will never own a Chanel suit. It is unlikely that I will ever own a (genuine) Chanel handbag. However, a Chanel nail polish was definitely attainable. Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes (AU39), they are still much more affordable than the AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one). After seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted. I argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly 80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a 10 voucher for my birthday and I got a 30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For 38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite. Graphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line. In the photos below I have actually applied three coats (plus an addition two top coats of clear) because I was going to a wedding and I wanted it to be perfect.

Just do it.\\"?","output":"The two phrases, \\"Just say that to him, and see what he says.\\" and \\"You don't need to understand what it's about. Just do it.\\" share similarities in their essence, but they have different contexts, implications, and potential consequences. Let's dive deeper into the differences between these two statements: 1. Context: The first phrase, \\"Just say that to him, and see what he says.\\" implies that the person giving the advice is asking someone to convey a particular message to a third person to observe or gauge their reaction or response. It suggests that the information being shared could potentially have an impact on the listener. Consequently, it implies a level of curiosity or anticipation regarding the response, which could be later used to further a conversation or make decisions. On the contrary, the second phrase, \\"You don't need to understand what it's about. Just do it.\\" suggests an action that someone should perform without necessarily understanding the rationale behind it. This advice leans more towards trusting someone else's judgment or simply obeying an instruction. Here, the focus is on compliance rather than gaining insight through dialogue or shared experiences. 2. Implications: When someone is encouraged to \\"Just say that to him, and see what he says.\\", it involves a form of communication and interaction with another person. Such an approach acknowledges the value of exchanging thoughts, perspectives, or ideas and can potentially foster open dialogue, understanding, or growth in a relationship. On the other hand, when told, \\"You don't need to understand what it's about. Just do it.\\", it might lead to a situation where the person performing the action complies without questioning or opinion. This could result in a one-way, unidirectional relationship where one person orders while the other person blindly obeys. 3. Potential Consequences: Following the advice, \\"Just say that to him, and see what he says.\\", can lead to active engagement in a conversation, better understanding of each other's perspectives, and possibly an improved relationship. Trying to anticipate the outcome or reaction is part of the process and allows the person giving the advice to learn and adapt to the situation. Conversely, acting on the suggestion, \\"You don't need to understand what it's about. Just do it.\\" might not always yield positive outcomes. Carrying out an action without understanding the underlying reasons may lead to confusion, miscommunication, or errors. In the long run, such behavior may undermine trust or lead to complacency and stagnation within a relationship. In conclusion, while both phrases suggest acting without complete understanding, their context, implications, and potential consequences differ significantly. \\"Just say that to him, and see what he says.\\" encourages an exchange of ideas and dialogue, while \\"You don't need to understand what it's about. Just do it.\\" pushes for compliance without questioning the rationale behind the action. Thus, we cannot directly conclude that one statement can be replaced by the other without considering the specific circumstances of each situation. It is essential to weigh the possible outcomes, evaluate the context, and seek a balance between open communication and trust in a given relationship."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

And as finales go, this was not a bad one for the regulars to miss. Alec Baldwin hinted at it in his monologue—after last week’s triumphant, hooray-for-everything Betty White extravaganza, this episode inevitably felt like the cast was playing out the string. Having Baldwin as the guest didn’t help in that respect—although he’s an all-time great host, his presence did make it feel like Saturday Night Live was returning to its status quo with breathtaking speed, like the show always does after it’s blessed with a surprise moment of cultural relevance. That said, Saturday’s show was at least an above-average return to normal as the show closes out its 35th year. The cold opens this season have mostly been dead on arrival—thanks in large part to the Fred-Armisen-as-Obama experiment that just won’t end—but the opening sketch this week had a pretty funny take on the oil spill in the Gulf. None of the actual wacky spill-stopping plans were terribly amusing—when one of the real-life plans is a “junk shot,” the situation becomes tough to parody—but the general spirit of bemused cluelessness among the BP/Transocean/Halliburton execs felt spot-on. Especially this line: “Then we tried something involving a giant tube. This plan was dear to my heart because it was a suggestion of my five-year-old daughter.” The meandering monologue had its moments. It would be easy to accuse Baldwin of going through the motions at this point, but that’s not quite it. It’s more like he relishes the fact that he’s an old hand at this, so he’s not going to make it appear like it’s any more effort for him than it is. Steve Martin made a not-very-funny cameo, as Steve Martin is wont to do. All the best sketches were front-loaded toward the first 40 minutes of the show, which is the way it’s supposed to work, I guess, even though it usually doesn’t happen that way. Especially when there’s a low-concept, off-kilter sketch like Starfish the Script Supervisor in the mix—weird stuff like that almost always gets pushed past midnight, but it came early tonight. Starfish was yet another Kristen Wiig character whose gimmick is basically to talk out of the corner of her mouth, but hey, it was funny, so who cares? (The only thing that bothered me about this sketch: Since it was established early on that the first take of the soap-opera scene was a good one, why did the director keep asking for new takes?) The Hudson Valley Swim Team sketch was essentially Alec Baldwin saying incredibly mean things about schoolchildren for three minutes. That was funny enough on the virtues of Baldwin’s delivery alone, but the echoes of his phone-message scandal from a few years back gave things an extra charge. Plus, there was a Lutz sighting! Any sketch with Lutz is OK in my book. One of my favorite characters of the season was Nasim Pedrad as Bedelia, the teenager who thinks her parents are just the coolest. And even as Bedelia apparently begins her descent into recurring-character hell, the sketch worked almost as well the second time around. I think the character works so well because she’s both more mature and less mature than the gossipy girls and oafish boys who surround her. She’s bizarre but matter-of-fact and outwardly comfortable with herself—Pedrad threads that needle nicely. The ambiguity there makes me kind of uncomfortable, but I think it’s really funny. The Gram Lampton’s Timecrowave infomercial felt like a potentially hilarious concept at the outset, but the writers ran out of ways to one-up themselves with shocking alternate realities. Once you go to the Nazi well (which was a great reveal), it’s hard to top that. The Turner Classic Movies “hooker with a heart of gold” bit was one cute joke crisply executed; the Scout Sniper School was one lame joke clumsily executed. And then there was Grady Wilson, sex-tape magnate. I’m no great Kenan Thompson fan, and surely the Grady Wilson sketch is his most vile creation. Thompson’s “nasal-y old guy” character is tiresome enough, but watching him thrust his pelvis while he yelps lame catchphrases is agony. Admittedly, I probably hate it even more because the studio audience always eats it right up. Don’t you see, people? You’re just encouraging him! That was the low point. Update was mostly a disappointment, too. I’m of two minds on Seth Meyers in the Update chair. I think he’s great at reading the headlines—his delivery is cutting, and he has a tight rhythm. But lord, does he make me cringe when he slaps on that shit-eating grin to interview a correspondent at the desk. And his ain’t-I-a-stinker mode gets turned up to 11 when “Snooki” makes an appearance. Nobody at the Update desk tonight could resist laughing at their own shtick. And again, the studio audience loves it when the actors break, but I can’t stand it. Although Bill Hader gets a pass because the giddiness is built into his Stefon character. In the Digital Short, a dude on a wicked coke bender sang an increasingly scattered tune about what a wonderful, sunshine-y, super-amazing day he was going to have. I enjoyed it quite a bit. In the interest of full disclosure, though, my wife regularly accuses me of having a man-crush on Andy Samberg, and she’s probably right. I’m comfortable with it. Oh, and the musical guest. I usually skip the music segments because for whatever reason, the audio engineers in Studio 8-H reliably do a hack job on whatever performer falls victim to their mixing boards. And yup, Tom Petty sounded bad—the mix was way too guitar-heavy. The vocals were too low, making Petty sound weak and strained, and the piano was practically inaudible. So tonight was predictable, but overall, not a bad way to head into the summer break. Stray observations: -- “I’m not one of those people who loves to hear the sound of their own voice. I don’t have to, because so many other people love to hear the sound of my voice. It’s an incredible voice.” True that. -- “The kid has two things in common with Greg Louganis: He hit his head on the diving board, and I’ll let you figure out the second one.” -- “Boniva won’t solve all your problems. You’ll always be a woman.” Abby Elliott does a killer Sally Field impression. Can’t imagine that comes in handy too often. -- “You know the book 1776? He’s read it.” The Bedelia sketch was full of great one-liners. Definitely the sharpest writing of the evening, aside from the Digital Short with that dreamy Andy Samberg. ||||| On Election Day in 1996, The Atlantic Online launched a weekly editorial cartoon feature drawn by Sage Stossel and named (aptly enough) \\"Sage, Ink.\\" Since then, Stossel's whimsical work has been featured by the New York Times Week in Review, CNN Headline News, Cartoon Arts International/The New York Times Syndicate, The Boston Globe, Nieman Reports, Editorial Humor, The Provincetown Banner (for which she received a 2009 New England Press Association Award), and elsewhere. Her work is also included in Best Editorial Cartoons of the Year, (2005, 2006, 2009, and 2010 editions) and Attack of the Political Cartoonists. Her children's book, On the Loose in Boston, will be published in June 2009. Sage Stossel grew up in a suburb of Boston and attended Harvard University, where she majored in English and American Literature and Languages and did a weekly cartoon strip about college life, called \\"Jody,\\" for the Harvard Crimson. After college she took what was intended to be a temporary summer position securing electronic rights to articles from The Atlantic Monthly's archive for use online. Intrigued by The Atlantic's rich history and the creative possibilities in helping to launch a digital edition of the magazine on the Web, she soon joined The Atlantic full time. Her original focus was on creating Flashbacks packages, a feature she still edits. As a result she is quite familiar with The Atlantic's archive (and has amassed an amusing collection of OCR scanning errors). As the site's executive editor, she has since been involved in everything from contributing Web site reviews, author interviews, and illustrations, to hosting message boards and producing the digital edition of The Atlantic on the Web. She is also the cartoonist for Copy Editor. She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The article provides a detailed review of a Saturday Night Live (SNL) episode, hosted by Alec Baldwin, marking the finale of the show’s 35th season. The writer muses on the hit-and-miss nature of the episode, observing that despite coming on the heels of a highly successful episode featuring Betty White, it managed to maintain a balance between returning to the show’s norm and capturing unique comedic moments. The writer then reviews several skits, including a humorous take on the oil spill in the Gulf and another featuring Kristen Wiig as Starfish the Script Supervisor. Also receiving mentions are an Alec Baldwin sketch where he makes snide remarks about school children, Nasim Pedrad’s character Bedelia who regards her parents as the coolest, and the Gram Lampton’s Timecrowave infomercial. The article critiques some sketches, such as Grady Wilson's sex tape, as less successful. It also critiques the \\"Update\\" segment, hosted by Seth Meyers, arguing that Meyers’ performance is good when delivering headlines but less satisfactory during interviews. The writer enjoyed the Digital Short, featuring a man on a cocaine high describing his wonderful day, disclosing his appreciation for Andy Samberg in the process. However, the audio quality of musical guest Tom Petty's performance was seen as poor. The author concludes that the episode, while predictable, provided an enjoyable lead into the summer break. The article continues with a brief overview of the career of Sage Stossel, a cartoonist for The Atlantic Online since 1996.

The day after the Britain's Got Talent finals, Max Clifford, speaking for Simon Cowell, said that it was \\"quite possible\\" that Cowell would be signing some of the finalists, including Smith. Though she did not sign with Syco, Cowell's record label, she did record a duet of \\"Walking in the Air\\" with Johnston, which appeared on his debut album, One Voice, and was tipped as a potential Christmas number-one. Before the release of One Voice, it was revealed that Smith and her father were finalising the details of her record deal. In November, it was announced that Smith would be performing on stage in Kettering with Sylvia Berryman, a vocal tutor who had worked with Smith prior to her appearance on Britain's Got Talent. Smith said that she was \\"really looking forward to singing locally again\\", and it was again reported that Smith hoped to soon sign her own record deal.In December 2008 the Daily Mail reported that Smith had signed a £2.3 million, multi-album deal with Universal Music Group that was the \\"most lucrative recording contract ever handed to a schoolgirl\\".

Covering 8.51 million square kilometers and comprising 26 states and a federal district, Brazil is located in Eastern South America and has borders with several countries, including Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The name Brazil is derived from the Portuguese term \\"pau-brasil,\\" which refers to a tree that grows primarily in the country’s eastern coastal region. The \\"pau-brasil\\" tree (Caesalpinia echinata) produces a highly valued reddish-brown wood known for its durability, beauty, and suitability for carving intricate designs. It also yields a vivid red dye used for textile production, which was much sought-after in Europe during the 16th century. Portuguese explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral first landed in Brazil on April 22, 1500, and quickly recognized the potential value of Brazilwood for their overseas trading activities. As such, the exporting of Brazilwood started not long after the arrival of Europeans in the region. The intense trade of Brazilwood rivaled the spice trade in importance to the Portuguese economy at the time. Consequently, \\"ilha de Vera Cruz,\\" the early name given to the land by Pedro Álvares Cabral, was replaced with \\"Terra do Brasil\\" or \\"Land of Brazil,\\" as a reference to its most important natural resource back then. Over time, Brazil's economy diversified, and other commodities, such as sugarcane and coffee, gained prominence in the country's exports. Brazil gained independence from Portugal on September 7, 1822, and its economy has since continued evolving from a primarily agricultural focus to an increasingly industrialized and service-oriented structure. Today, Brazil is the 12th largest economy in the world by nominal GDP and among the leading global exporters of manufactured goods, agricultural products, and minerals. Despite the changes in its economy and the array of products that it now exports, the name Brazil still serves as a reminder of the country's historical roots and the initial export that shaped its development over centuries. Interestingly, the \\"pau-brasil\\" tree's status has, however, changed significantly. Due to excessive exploitation, the Brazilwood tree is now classified as an endangered species and its logging and export are heavily regulated to ensure its survival."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to German: Trailing Stop is a facility provided by the forex broker that can change the stop loss to lock automatically profit in multiples of a certain amount.","output":"\\"Trailing Stop\\" ist eine von Devisenmaklern angebotene Funktion, die den Stop-Loss automatisch in Vielfachen eines bestimmten Betrags anpasst, um den Gewinn zu sichern."},{"instruction":"Here's a question: What is a large group of human beings? Here are possible answers to this question: - an infestation - civilisation - homes - graveyard - spacecraft I believe the correct choice is \\"civilisation\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","output":"Civilisation. A large group of human beings can be best described as a civilisation. Here's why: Out of the given choices, civilisation is the most appropriate term for a large group of human beings because it encompasses the collective characteristics, values, social constructs, history, and developments that humans create through living, working, and interacting together. This term has been used by historians, anthropologists, sociologists, and other experts to define the combined efforts of humans towards their mutual development and the creation of advanced cultures. Let's briefly consider the other options: 1. An infestation: This term is unsuitable to describe a large group of human beings, as it generally refers to the presence of harmful organisms in an area. Humans are not pests or invasive species, and this choice has a negative connotation that does not align with the concept of a group of people working together to form societies or civilizations. 2. Homes: While homes are essential in providing shelter for human beings, they do not entirely encapsulate the concept of a large group of humans. Humans are not merely defined by the structures they inhabit; rather, they are characterized through their culture, beliefs, practices, and history, which collectively contribute to developing a civilisation. 3. Graveyard: This refers to a place where deceased individuals are buried or cremated. Although this term is associated with humans, it only focuses on the aspect of death and does not represent a large group of living human beings, their social organization, or cultural background. 4. Spacecraft: A spacecraft is a vehicle or vessel designed for travel through outer space.

Director Jane Aberfield and screenwriter Simon LeBow have crafted a rare gem, a film that delicately balances heartwarming emotions and profound contemplations without fear of vulnerability. Set against the picturesque backdrop of a small, coastal town, \\"The Marvelous Unfurling\\" tells the tale of Sarah (Emma Watson) and her journey of self-discovery, after an unexpected tragedy leaves her questioning the life she has built. Far away from the hustle and bustle of the city, she encounters a diverse cast of quirky and lovable characters, each with their own life lessons to share. Among them are a charming lighthouse keeper (Michael Fassbender), a lively elderly artist (Judi Dench), and a spirited young girl named Lily (newcomer Ruby Smart), each contributing to Sarah's personal awakening. Emma Watson delivers a stellar, career-defining performance as Sarah, showcasing her considerable range as an actress. Her portrayal of Sarah's inner turmoil and emotional growth is palpable, as we witness her character develop from a muted, fearful shell of her former self into a vibrant, wholehearted individual. Fassbender and Dench provide the perfect foils, allowing Watson to shine, while also contributing richly nuanced characters of their own. Newcomer Ruby Smart, however, emerges as the true revelation in this film. As the story's heart and soul, she captures the essence of every scene she appears in with her infectious enthusiasm. The chemistry between Smart and Watson is undeniable, and their friendship onscreen is the centerpiece around which the film revolves. Their interactions are pure magic - full of humor, tenderness, and genuine rapport. The cinematography by Isabelle Huppert is a visual feast, taking advantage of the stunning coastal locale to create a vivid and immersive experience. The views of windswept beaches and dramatic cliffsides combined with her use of warm colours lend the film a dreamlike quality that elevates it to another level. Paired with an evocative, soaring score by the talented James Newton Howard, it creates a transportive atmosphere that is difficult to walk away from. The screenplay by Simon LeBow maintains its clever wit and candor throughout, with enriching philosophical dialogues interspersed among heartfelt moments. It's the perfect blend of head and heart, not afraid to ask those deep questions we all ponder about life, love, and what truly matters most when we strip away the noise. \\"The Marvelous Unfurling\\" is a triumphant work of art that deftly touches upon the intricacies of human relationships and the transformative power of empathy. Through its captivating story, remarkable performances, and stunning visual and auditory elements, it is undoubtedly a film that will be remembered and cherished for years to come. Its message of hope, healing, and renewal is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, and a much-needed reminder that it is never too late to unveil the richness and beauty within ourselves."},{"instruction":"At the Trans-Adriatic Interreg IIIA Conference in Sarajevo on Monday (28 April), the foreign ministers of Italy and four Southeast European countries adopted a declaration endorsing a new cross-border co-operation programme.

I experienced both of those thrills this summer, as you can see from the mile-wide grin on my face in this picture. For three generations my family has come to Alaska to chase wild salmon. The Chinook, the Sockeye, the Coho, the Chum and the Humpback are graceful, powerful beauties with an unerring GPS for home.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: First, let us consider the basic requirements for human survival. The human body needs energy and nutrients from food to function, grow, and repair itself. These nutrients include carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. In addition, water is essential for regulating body temperature and maintaining other vital bodily processes. When a person does not consume food, the body begins to rely on stored energy, such as glycogen and fat stores, for energy. This can last for a short period of time, like during fasting or brief periods of starvation. However, prolonged lack of food would eventually lead to severe malnourishment, organ failure, and ultimately death. Similarly, without water, the human body would experience dehydration, leading to impaired organ function and a buildup of toxins in the bloodstream. Severe dehydration can result in life-threatening complications like kidney failure, seizures, and coma. The average person can survive only about three days without water. Taking all of this into consideration, the answer to the question of whether a person can survive without food and water indefinitely is no. The human body relies on both food and water for essential processes, and a prolonged lack of either would inevitably result in death."},{"instruction":"First question: What country is in the center (middle) of the Earth?

What's the geographical center of earth? This question is requesting the location of the geographical center of the Earth, which is a point that may or may not fall within a country's borders. Now, I will compare these two questions to see if they are asking the same thing. The first question is asking for a country, while the second question is asking for the geographical center. Although both questions relate to the concept of the Earth's center, they are not asking the same thing since one asks for a specific country while the other asks for a specific point or location.

Question: suppose no coffee grounds into the coffee machine happens, how will it affect LESS salt being removed from the water. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"The process you described and the question you asked seem unrelated. The process mentioned involves heating saltwater and distilling it to remove salt particles, resulting in two separate containers: one with salt left behind and another with fresh water. Coffee grounds do not seem to have any role in this process. Your question asks how the absence of coffee grounds in the coffee machine affects the amount of salt being removed from water, which does not relate to the saltwater distillation process. However, if we consider your question to be about the salt removal process only, without any connection to coffee grounds, I can elaborate on what could affect the salt removal: If you want to remove LESS salt from the water, you could: 1. Decrease the heating time: This will allow less water to evaporate, thus reducing the amount of salt that settles at the bottom of the container. 2. Lower the temperature: Heating the water to a lower temperature will also be less effective in evaporating the water, which will result in less salt being removed. In conclusion, the presence or absence of coffee grounds in this scenario has no effect on the salt removal process, as the two are unrelated."},{"instruction":"Imagine a question and stream-of-consciousness explanation for which this is the answer: no","output":"Question: Is it possible to perfectly predict the stock market movements using mathematical algorithms? Stream-of-Consciousness Explanation: The stock market can often seem like a chaotic and unpredictable system, with prices of stocks rising and falling through the course of a trading day. Some might believe that through advanced mathematical algorithms and technology, we can accurately predict the future movements of the stock market. This could involve using historical data and patterns to forecast where prices are headed next or analyzing the complex factors that drive market behavior. However, there are several key reasons why this is not possible. First, the stock market is driven by a multitude of factors, including investor emotions and sentiment, economic factors, politics, and global events, among others. These factors are constantly changing and can have substantial impacts on the market at large. Trying to account for all these factors and how they might change over time is an overwhelmingly complex task. Second, there is the concept of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), which suggests that financial markets are efficient at pricing assets, and at any given time, stock prices reflect all available information. According to the EMH, it is thus impossible to consistently achieve excess returns on a risk-adjusted basis. Lastly, the market is made up of countless individual players, including not just retail but also institutional investors. They are all constantly making decisions and reacting to new information. This constant turbulence creates unpredictable price fluctuations. In conclusion, because of the vast number of factors influencing the stock market, the efficient market hypothesis, and the countless players that make up the market, it is not possible to perfectly predict the stock market movements using mathematical algorithms.

Here's an explanation to support this conclusion: 1. Terminology: Hamburger, often used interchangeably with ground beef, refers to meat that has been ground or finely chopped from a specific animal – in this case, cattle. It is primarily made from beef, and although there are variations in burger meat like turkey burgers or plant-based burgers, the term hamburger exclusively implies beef as the main ingredient. 2. Beef vs. Pork: Beef comes from cattle, while pork comes from pigs. Both beef and pork are popular types of meat used in various dishes and preparations worldwide. However, these two meats come from distinct sources and have different characteristics, nutritional values, and preparation methods. As a result, it is not accurate to say that hamburger meat, which explicitly refers to beef, contains remnants of a pig. 3. Food regulations: In many countries, food regulations dictate the proper labeling and contents of food products. If a meat product contains mixed ingredients, such as beef and pork, it must be clearly stated and disclosed on the packaging. Products labeled as hamburger meat or ground beef should not contain pig remnants as per these regulations, ensuring that the primary ingredient is beef from cattle. In conclusion, the statement \\"Hamburger meat contains remnants of a pig\\" is not a verifiable fact. Hamburger meat, by definition and regulation, is made from ground beef, which originates from cattle, not pigs."},{"instruction":"On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"I uninstalled it because of a push notification to download some game.\\" The answer to this question is:","output":"2"},{"instruction":"Instructions: You are given a sentence in Arabic.

Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call.

This is the first filmed version of 'Hamlet' to use the full text of Shakespeare's play, but Branagh didn't do it just because \\"it was there.\\" His intention, I believe, was to make the play accessible and understandable to the general viewer without dumbing it down, so to speak. In return he asks viewers to put in a little work themselves, a fair enough proposition and one that's a bargain. The setting is a generic 19th century European one and this does more than work well, it keeps a modern or ancient look from possibly distracting from the work itself. The production design and cinematography and both outstanding, which helps immensely when you're watching a four-hour movie. Branagh's casting once again is inspired and the acting is likewise. The direction accomplishes the heavy task of making this a movie rather than a deluxe version of a play. Since so much of 'Hamlet' is based on interior monologue and there are relatively few duels, battles, etc., this can be a daunting task. But everything Branagh tries to do seems to work. Branagh has always been one of the most interesting actor/writer/directors, if not always the best, since he made his big splash with 'Henry V.' One quibble I had with him was what I saw as a tendency to ham it up at times. In his portrayal of Hamlet here he might be accused of that again, but there is a method at work. Let's face it, 'Hamlet' is not an easy work for the average person to understand and if one has never seen it performed before, he or she needs help even if they've read the play. Hamlet has the most lines of any Shakespearian character and Branagh makes sure that his viewers know what this man is thinking and feeling throughout the film, even if you don't know the literal meaning of every arcane word. This performance by Branagh was at the very least worthy of an Oscar nomination. There are so many other outstanding performances here they're almost too numerous to mention, but some of them must be acknowledged. Derek Jacobi as Claudius is superb but even he takes a back seat to Kate Winslet when it comes to handing out praise. Her portrayal of Ophelia is awesome in its depth of feeling, made only more outstanding by the knowledge that she was only about 20 years old at the time! She looks to me like the finest young actress around. Other super performers in no particular order are Richard Briers, Nicholas Farrell, Michael Maloney, and Reece Dinsdale and Timothy Spall as Guildenstern and Rosencrantz, respectively. Honorable mention goes to Julie Christie, Charlton Heston, and Robin Williams, who manages to do his thing here successfully. Even Billy Crystal as a gravedigger works. The one cast member who doesn't, inexplicably, is Jack Lemmon. In the very opening scene he appears, and while the other three actors do a great job at setting the tense mood, Lemmon sounds like he is just running lines in rehearsal as a favor. You know this must have been a real dilemma for Branagh, since everything else about the movies screams out that it's the work of a perfectionist. Not to be facetious when speaking of a four-hour movie, but it does seem just a tad too long. Some monologues and conversations do tend to go on a bit, if I may be so bold, and a little bit of judicious pruning would be welcome. Did I forget anything, other than Patrick Doyle's score? No doubt I did. I'll just sum up by saying that Kenneth Branagh may have made the definitive film version of 'Hamlet,' and it will be a truly monumental production that tops this one.

We'll find out which team scored more points in that first half. Remember, a game usually has two halves and we're focusing on the first one. But first, we need some information about the teams and their scores. Let's say we have two teams called Team Sunshine and Team Rainbow. When teams play games, they get points by doing a good job and following the rules. Imagine Team Sunshine scored 10 points in the first half, while Team Rainbow scored 15 points. Now, we can compare the scores of each team to find out who scored more. To do this, we need to look at the numbers 10 and 15. The number 15 is bigger than the number 10. This means that Team Rainbow scored more points than Team Sunshine in the first half! So, the answer to our question is: Team Rainbow scored more points in the first half. They played well and got more points. Yay, Team Rainbow! Remember, playing well and having fun is the most important thing when playing games with friends. Always enjoy and support each other!

Options: (A) 3377 (B) 2889 (C) 2522 (D) 2678 (E) 7111 Answer. (C) What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","output":"To find the Compound Interest (C.I.) on a sum of Rs.1600 for 9 months at 20% per annum, with interest compounded quarterly, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a quarterly interest rate As interest is compounded quarterly, we need to divide the annual interest rate (20%) by 4 (the number of quarters in a year). Quarterly interest rate = (20/4)% = 5%. Step 2: Convert the time duration from months to quarters The time duration given is 9 months, which is equivalent to 3 quarters (since there are 3 months in a quarter). Step 3: Use the compound interest formula The compound interest formula is: Amount (A) = P * (1 + r/100)^n where: P = principal (initial amount) r = interest rate per period (in this case, per quarter) n = number of periods (in this case, the number of quarters) Step 4: Calculate the amount after 3 quarters Applying the formula with the given values (P = 1600, r = 5%, n = 3): Amount (A) = 1600 * (1 + 5/100)^3 = 1600 * (1 + 0.05)^3 = 1600 * (1.05)^3 = 1600 * 1.157625 = 1852.2 (approx.) Step 5: Calculate the compound interest Compound Interest (C.I.) = Amount (A) - Principal (P) = 1852.2 - 1600 = 252.2 The closest option to the calculated C.I. is (C) 2522 (despite being slightly off due to rounding).

They have no idea what he's talking about but wander about looking at the hand mirror-like disks on the viewers and they see images of the planet's past. Then, while a disk is in the viewer, Kirk runs through the doorway and is magically transported back in time to what on Earth would look like the time of Louis XIV (the 1660s). When McCoy and Spock follow, a different disk is in the viewer and they are sent to an ice age hell. All too late they realize that the library is a time travel machine and repository. While Kirk's visit is pretty short and not all that exciting, Spock and McCoy's is much more eventful, as Spock falls head over heels for Mariette Hartley--who was sent to this awful place as a punishment.

Hypothesis: I do not have any ill will towards businesses. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"Step 1: Identify the key components of the premise and the hypothesis. In the premise, the key components are Julius, not despising, and business instinct. In the hypothesis, the key components are no ill will and businesses. Step 2: Compare the key components between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise specifically refers to Julius not despising business instinct, while the hypothesis is a more general statement about not having ill will towards businesses. Step 3: Determine if the hypothesis can be logically deduced from the premise. Since the premise is about Julius not despising business instinct, it could be interpreted as Julius having a positive or at least neutral attitude towards business instinct. However, the hypothesis is broader in scope, addressing the absence of ill will towards businesses in general. Although it is possible that Julius's statement could imply a favorable view on businesses, it is not explicitly addressed in the premise. Conclusion: The hypothesis is not strictly entailed by the premise, as the premise only focuses on Julius's opinion about business instinct and does not explicitly address a general attitude towards businesses. The connection between Julius's statement and the idea of not having ill will towards businesses is related, but not strong enough to infer a direct entailment between the two statements."},{"instruction":"Given the question \\"What was put on the man's finger?\\" and the answer \\"The ice.\\", write a conversation that might have happened.

Options: - pass water - bathe - listen to each other - feel pleasure - reproduce asexually Let's think now! Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"Since the animals mentioned are not good at swimming, it is likely that they faced difficulties when they needed to perform any activity that required them to be in the water. Out of the given options, let's analyze each one and determine which activity would have been hard for these animals: 1. Pass water: This option is not clear whether it refers to walking through water or urinating. In either case, it may not pose a significant challenge for animals that are not good at swimming, as these actions do not necessarily require them to be in the water. 2. Bathe: This activity requires the animal to be in the water to clean themselves effectively. Thus, if the animal is not good at swimming, it may find it difficult to bathe in the water. 3. Listen to each other: Listening to one another typically does not require the animals to be in the water or swimming; hence, it is unlikely to be affected by their swimming abilities. 4. Feel pleasure: Again, feeling pleasure is not directly related to an animal's ability to swim. They may feel pleasure in different ways, and not being good at swimming shouldn't hinder this. 5. Reproduce asexually: Asexual reproduction does not involve the need for two individuals to come together in water, and it doesn't necessarily depend on an animal's swimming abilities. From the given options, the most logical choice for the activity that would be difficult for animals not good at swimming would be to bathe. This is because bathing typically involves being in the water, and animals that are not good swimmers may have trouble performing this task effectively."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Ijm is an Arabic term referring to the consensus or agreement of the Muslim scholars basically on religious issues.

They live primarily in the Nineveh Province of Iraq. Additional communities in Armenia, Georgia, Turkey, Iran, and Syria have been in decline since the 1990s as a result of significant migration to Europe, especially to Germany. The Yazidis' cultural practices are observably Kurdish, and almost all speak Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish).

The storm slammed coastal areas of northern Taiwan with winds gusting to at least 150 miles per hour, based on weather observations and storm chasers who were in the area at the time. According to Twitter reports, the community of Su'ao Township was particularly hard hit by strong winds. Meanwhile, in Taiwan's mountains, torrential rain is falling and will continue to do so through Monday night local time. More than two feet of rain is expected in some areas. 5:40 pm. Some of worst wind I've ever seen. Whiteout. Swirling. Screaming. Trees still up waved like mad, then disappeared in it. #DUJUAN — Josh Morgerman (@iCyclone) September 28, 2015 Because of the southward jump in the storm center as the storm made landfall — a movement that was likely related to frictional forces the storm encountered as its circulation slammed up against the mountainous terrain of north central Taiwan — Taipei was spared the worst winds from the storm, but it is still seeing strong winds and heavy rain. UPDATED Monday 3 a.m. ET: Typhoon Dujuan continued its Category 4 intensity into Monday afternoon local time in Taiwan. With torrential rains and crashing waves battering the northeastern coast, thousands were evacuated from Taiwan's Green Island and Orchid Island. Landfall is predicted at around 11 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET). In the morning in Taipei, the typhoon had maximum sustained winds of 140 miles per hour, or 63 meters per second, though this may be a slight underestimate. Heavy rain from the influences of the storm was already falling in parts of Taiwan as Monday dawned. Monstrous waves crashing into small section of Suao port in #Taiwan as #typhoon #Dujuan nears pic.twitter.com/Xu63505moH — James Reynolds (@EarthUncutTV) September 28, 2015 Typhoon warnings as well as warnings for heavy rainfall, which will bring with it the risk of landslides and flooding, have been issued for much of Taiwan, where mountainous terrain squeezed more than 50 inches of rain out of a typhoon earlier this season. The strongest winds and worst coastal flooding is expected to occur along and to the north of where the storm's center comes ashore, while flooding rains can be expected across the entire island. As of Sunday morning, the storm was the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 140 miles per hour, or 63 meters per second. It was still intensifying, and may peak near 150 miles per hour in intensity, which would make it a super typhoon. The storm is likely to weaken to Category 3 or back to Category 4 intensity before it hits the northeast coast of Taiwan, with the potential to produce widespread wind damage, mudslides and flooding from heavy rain as well as a powerful storm surge, depending on the angle with which it approaches the coast and the timing of landfall. The storm will also affect the southern Ryukyu Islands of Japan, which have been pummeled by multiple typhoons so far this year. Taiwan is used to encounters with typhoons, and so far this year the island has been buffeted by at least three other typhoons. Typhoon Soudelor, which made a direct hit on the island nation, dumped upwards of 50 inches of rain, leading to major flooding. Because of Typhoon Dujuan's slow movement — it was moving west at just 8 miles per hour as of Sunday morning eastern time — it too threatens to produce flooding rainfall as well. In addition, the storm has a large eye at least 40 miles in diameter, surrounded by a solid ring of towering thunderstorms. Such typhoons, which are distinguished from storms that have smaller eyes and a more narrow \\"eye wall\\" of storms surrounding the storm's center, are known as annular tropical cyclones. They can be more resistant to rapid weakening than more ordinary typhoons, according to WeatherUnderground. The timing of the storm's landfall in northern Taiwan looks to be during the overnight hours on Monday local time, with the peak of the storm coming during the day on Tuesday. (Taipei is 12 hours ahead of New York.) Computer visualization of the winds spinning around the center of Typhoon Dujuan on Sunday September 27, 2015. The Central Weather Bureau in Taiwan says there is an 85 to 90% chance that areas in northern Taiwan, including Taipei, Keelung and Yilah will see sustained winds stronger than about 40 miles per hour. (In this case, the actual winds are likely to be significantly stronger than that.)

Press your tongue behind your two front teeth, where the roof of your mouth meets the gum palate or alveolar ridge. Press hard with your most powerful muscles against your teeth until the tickling sensation dissipates. Find a small table anywhere in your home, hold your face about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top of the table and stick your tongue out; the sneeze should subside naturally. It takes about 5 to 7 seconds. If it doesn't work, at least, whoever's around will get a good kick out of it! Tickle the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue when you feel the sneeze coming on. Continue until the urge to sneeze dissipates. This should take 5 to 10 seconds. Spread the thumb of one hand away from the fingers. Using the sharp edges of the nails on the thumb and index finger of your other hand, pinch the flap of skin between the spread thumb and the fingers. This is a pressure point that some grab to stop a headache, and it can work with sneezes, too. With your thumb and forefinger, pinch between your eyebrows until you feel a substantial amount of pressure. With the side of your forefinger (handheld horizontally beneath your eyes), press into the cartilage on your nose, just beneath the bone of the bridge of your nose. This will pinch one of the nerves involved in triggering a sneeze. Wiggle your ear lobe gently as you feel a sneeze coming on. This can be masked as looking like you are playing with an earring or something if you're stifling a public sneeze. If you see someone about to sneeze, or if they state that they feel a sneeze coming on, say something absurd. Sometimes the brain will 'forget' about the sneeze when it has something more interesting and immediate to focus on. Clench your teeth together, but try to stick out your tongue (use the muscle to push against the back of your front teeth). Push as hard as you can! The stimulation may stop the sneeze from materializing. You can buy this online or at your local vitamin/herb shop. Take a handful and wrap it in a cloth—handkerchief, washcloth, etc.—then roll it in your hand to break it up a little bit. Hold this next to your nose and inhale it for a few breaths. Your sneezing should clear right up!","output":"This article shares many different ways to stop a sneeze, like stretching your nose, pressing your tongue against your teeth, and tickling the roof of your mouth."},{"instruction":"How is \\"It would therefore reserve its comments until it received further clarification.\\" said in French?","output":"In French, the phrase \\"It would therefore reserve its comments until it received further clarification.\\" can be translated as \\"Il réserverait donc ses commentaires jusqu'à ce qu'il reçoive des éclaircissements supplémentaires.\\" Let me break down the translation for you: 1. \\"It would therefore reserve\\" - In French, this part can be translated as \\"Il réserverait donc\\". The subject pronoun \\"it\\" is translated to \\"il\\", and the English verb \\"to reserve\\" is translated to the French verb \\"réserver\\", put in the conditional form as \\"réserverait\\". The French adverb \\"donc\\" means \\"therefore\\" in English. 2. \\"its comments\\" - The French translation for this part is \\"ses commentaires\\". The possessive pronoun \\"its\\" is translated to \\"ses\\" in French, while \\"comments\\" is translated to \\"commentaires\\". 3. \\"until it received\\" - This phrase can be translated in French as \\"jusqu'à ce qu'il reçoive\\". \\"Until\\" is translated to \\"jusqu'à\\", followed by \\"ce que\\" which is used here to introduce a dependent clause. The subject pronoun \\"it\\" is again translated to \\"il\\", and the English verb \\"to receive\\" is translated to the French verb \\"recevoir\\", conjugated in the subjunctive form as \\"reçoive\\". 4. \\"further clarification\\" - In French, this final part can be translated as \\"des éclaircissements supplémentaires.\\" The word \\"further\\" is translated to \\"supplémentaires\\", and \\"clarification\\" is translated to \\"éclaircissements\\".

Stream of consciousness reasoning: To begin addressing this question, we must first consider the factors involved in a coin toss. The outcome of a coin toss depends on various factors such as the force and angle at which the coin is thrown, the surface it lands on, and even the air resistance. However, these factors are generally random and not controlled when a person flips a coin. From a theoretical perspective, if we knew all the variables and the exact circumstances in which the coin was tossed, one could potentially predict the outcome using physics. However, in practice, it is incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to measure and account for all these factors. Even the most advanced technologies available would struggle with this task. Moreover, since human intervention introduces an element of randomness to the coin toss, attempts at prediction become significantly more unreliable. Even expert coin flippers (if such a profession exists) would not be able to consistently predict the outcome of a coin toss. Furthermore, due to the chaotic nature of the coin toss, even a slight variation in the initial conditions could result in completely different outcomes. Thus, in the real world, there are just too many unknown variables and unpredictable factors involved in a coin toss. Therefore, based on the discussion above, it is not possible to tell with certainty the outcome of a coin toss before it actually happens, as there are too many uncontrollable variables and randomness involved in the process."},{"instruction":"Is the following statement true? \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show revolutionized animated movies.\\" Let's think first.

His first recording was as a violist in \\"Plus blanche que la blanche hermine\\" from Les Huguenots by Meyerbeer in 1903 for Pathé with the tenor Albert Vaguet. It is possible that Monteux played in the Colonne Orchestra's 20 early cylinders recorded around 1906–07. His recording debut as a conductor was the first of his five recordings of The Rite of Spring, issued in 1929. The first of these, with the OSP, is judged by Canarina to be indifferently played; recordings by Monteux of music by Ravel and Berlioz made in 1930 and 1931, Canarina believes, were more impressive. Stravinsky, who also recorded The Rite in 1929, was furious that Monteux had made a rival recording; he made vitriolic comments privately, and for some time his relations with Monteux remained cool.Monteux's final studio recordings were with the London Symphony Orchestra in works by Ravel at the end of February 1964. In the course of his career he recorded works by more than fifty composers. In Monteux's lifetime it was rare for record companies to issue recordings of live concerts, although he would much have preferred it, he said, \\"if one could record in one take in normal concert-hall conditions\\". Some live performances of Monteux conducting the Metropolitan Opera, and among others the San Francisco Symphony, Boston Symphony, BBC Symphony and London Symphony orchestras survive alongside his studio recordings, and some have been issued on compact disc.

In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: \\"I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.\\"Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from his experience as a singing teacher,...

Bobby learned more about divergent tectonic plates, while Nate was more confident in explaining everything about Convergent plates. But I can use this background: Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 9 cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 5–9 cm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 5 cm/year. What is an answer for this question: Which student knew more about seafloor spreading? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Bobby seems to have known more about seafloor spreading, as he learned more about divergent tectonic plates. Seafloor spreading is a process that occurs at divergent plate boundaries, where two plates are moving apart from each other. This is closely related to the concept of continental drift, which involves the movement of the Earth's continents over time. On the other hand, Nate was more confident in explaining convergent plates. Convergent plate boundaries involve two plates moving towards each other, which leads to processes such as subduction, where one plate is forced under another, or mountain building through the collision of continental plates. In relation to the specific topic of seafloor spreading, Bobby's focus on divergent tectonic plates would make him more knowledgeable about the subject. Seafloor spreading is directly related to the movement of oceanic plates at divergent boundaries, where new crust is formed as magma rises to the surface and cools. This process also results in the formation of hydrothermal vents and spreading centers, both of which were mentioned in the given background information. However, it is important to note that both students have valuable insights into different aspects of plate tectonics, and their combined knowledge would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the subject. While Bobby may be better suited to explain seafloor spreading, Nate's expertise in convergent plates is equally important for understanding the overall dynamics and interactions of Earth's tectonic plates."},{"instruction":"Continue the following story. Elena was excited to try out the hammock that Samantha had bought them, and","output":"as she approached the spot that Samantha had picked to set it up - between two large, sturdy oak trees in their backyard - she couldn't help but feel a sense of warmth and relaxation wash over her. The sun's golden rays filtered through the leaves of the trees, casting dappled patterns on the vibrant green grass. She silently thanked Samantha for choosing an idyllic corner of their yard to hang up the hammock. Samantha watched as Elena approached the hammock and then gave it a cautious, yet excited, glance. Samantha simply smiled, her eyes twinkling with happiness at the sight of her friend. She knew how much Elena had always wanted a hammock, something that could offer a peaceful retreat from the long hours Elena devoted to her work every day. \\"Now, remember to watch your step,\\" Samantha called out gently, her expression filled with mirth. \\"I've heard that hammocks can be treacherous for the uninitiated.\\" Elena let out a soft chuckle before attempting to swing her leg over the edge of the swaying hammock. With more grace than she anticipated, Elena found herself sinking into the soft, fabric embrace. Satisfied, she let out a contented sigh and closed her eyes. The gentle rocking motion and the lulling symphony of rustling leaves and birdsong enveloped her in a cocoon of serenity. Samantha decided that this would be an opportune moment to grab a picnic basket she had prepared earlier. Filled with Elena's favorite sandwiches and beverages, along with a small blanket to spread out on the grass, she hoped this would add an extra touch of relaxation to their afternoon. With the picnic basket in hand, Samantha carefully approached the hammock. She set the basket down on the blanket beside her friend and sat down, her eyes keenly observing Elena's peaceful visage. She delicately unfolded the blanket and spread it over Elena, tucking it around her as the temperature began to dip ever so slightly. As the sun lazily arced across the sky, Samantha could feel her own eyes growing heavy. She gazed at the picnic basket, still filled with untouched food and drink. She would be sure to wake Elena when hunger struck or the sun began to set, she mused. For now, though, they would both enjoy the warmth of each other's company and the healing embrace of nature. Time seemed to slow to a crawl, and when Samantha finally surrendered to her own weariness, she gingerly stretched out her legs and leaned back onto the blanket. Just before her eyes closed, she smiled at the thought that the hammock - an innocent, woven nest of comfort - would become a shared sanctuary for the two of them. The women drifted off into a restorative slumber, the tranquility of their sanctuary working its magic on their minds, bodies, and souls. Their friendship, rooted deeply in the fertile soil of affection, understanding, and loyalty, had blossomed into an enduring bond, as steady and unshakable as the oak trees that held up the hammock. When they eventually awoke, the sun had begun to dip towards the horizon, creating a canvas of warm, glowing hues. As Elena climbed out of the hammock and sank her toes into the refreshing grass, she smiled over at Samantha, her eyes filled with gratitude. Little did they know that this humble hammock would become the centerpiece of countless memories, a warm refuge where laughter, tears, and introspection would be shared between them. The years would pass, and though their lives would evolve and change, the roots of their friendship would only deepen, strengthened by quiet afternoons spent sharing a hammock beneath their backyard oak trees."},{"instruction":"Context: Skylar had 5 years of experience horseback riding and often spoke their opinion freely. Question: Why did Skylar do this? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: rode horse for many years B: participate in debates C: volunteer at ranches","output":"Skylar developed the habit of speaking their opinion freely mainly because of their extensive experience in horseback riding and possibly their involvement in activities surrounding this passion. The answer that best answers the question according to the context is C: volunteering at ranches. Despite A: rode a horse for many years being a relevant point, it does not entirely explain the development of Skylar's outspoken nature according to the given context. Riding a horse for many years would have certainly given them confidence and mastery in horseback riding, but it does not directly correlate to the act of voicing their opinions openly. Similarly, B: participating in debates appears to be an unrelated answer to Skylar's expertise in horseback riding. While participating in debates would enhance their communication skills and the ability to express their opinions, there is no mention of the involvement in debating activities in the context. The most plausible answer, C: volunteering at ranches, suggests that Skylar spent considerable time in environments where horseback riding expertise helped them gain credibility and confidence to express their opinions. When volunteering at ranches, Skylar would have encountered various challenges, collaborated with other equestrians, and exchanged ideas and experiences with fellow riders. This environment lent itself to Skylar sharing knowledge and tips with others, consequently leading them to speak their opinions more freely and assertively.

This phenomenon can be explained through various principles of optics, depth perception, and geometry. As the distance to an object increases, the object will appear smaller due to the way light travels from the object to our eyes and how our brain processes this information. When we perceive an object, light rays from different points on the object's surface enter our eyes at varying angles. The angles become smaller as the distance between the object and the observer increases, resulting in a smaller image being projected onto our retina, the light-sensitive membrane at the back of the eye. Moreover, the brain uses cues to interpret depth and understand the position of objects in our visual field. These cues include binocular cues, such as retinal disparity and convergence, and monocular cues, like relative size, texture gradient, and linear perspective. When an object moves away from us, its retinal image becomes smaller, providing a monocular cue that it's further away. Thus, our brain processes this information and makes us perceive the object as progressively smaller. In the given scenario, as the man drives away from his dog, the distance between them increases. The light from the dog entering the man's eyes or reflecting off the rearview mirror forms progressively smaller angles due to the increasing distance. As a result, the image of the dog projected onto the man's retina becomes smaller, and the man perceives the dog as shrinking in size in the rearview mirror. Additionally, the depth perception cues indicate that the dog is moving further away from the man, reinforcing the perception of the dog shrinking in size. This phenomenon is not restricted to the man's dog but applies to all objects in the distance that are moving away from the observer. Overall, the combination of optics, depth perception, and geometrical principles contribute to the perception of objects appearing smaller as their distance from the observer increases."},{"instruction":"Concepts: block, flower, garden Write a sentence that includes all these words.","output":"In our colorful garden, there are many pretty flowers that grow in small blocks, almost like they're playing together."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: CHAPTER REVIEW 20.1 Structure and Function of Blood Vessels Blood pumped by the heart flows through a series of vessels known as arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins before returning to the heart. Arteries transport blood away from the heart and branch into smaller vessels, forming arterioles. Arterioles distribute blood to capillary beds, the sites of exchange with the body tissues. Capillaries lead back to small vessels known as venules that flow into the larger veins and eventually back to the heart. The arterial system is a relatively high-pressure system, so arteries have thick walls that appear round in cross section. The venous system is a lower-pressure system, containing veins that have larger lumens and thinner walls. They often appear flattened. Arteries, arterioles, venules, and veins are composed of three tunics known as the tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica externa. Capillaries have only a tunica intima layer. The tunica intima is a thin layer composed of a simple squamous epithelium known as endothelium and a small amount of connective tissue. The tunica media is a thicker area composed of variable amounts of smooth muscle and connective tissue. It is the thickest layer in all but the largest arteries. The tunica externa is primarily a layer of connective tissue, although in veins, it also contains some smooth muscle. Blood flow through vessels can be dramatically influenced by vasoconstriction and vasodilation in their walls. Q: Blood vessels blood pumped by the heart flows through a series of vessels known as arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins before returning to this? Choices: - lungs - feet - brain - heart A: Answer:","output":"Blood pumped by the heart flows through a series of vessels known as arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins before returning to the heart. In the cardiovascular system, blood is transported to various parts of the body by a complex network of blood vessels. After being pumped by the heart, oxygen-rich blood is transported away from the heart through arteries. These arteries gradually branch into smaller vessels called arterioles, which further distribute blood to the capillary beds. Capillary beds are the primary site of exchange between the blood and body tissues, supplying nutrients, oxygen, and other essentials while removing waste products, such as carbon dioxide, from the tissues. Following the exchange at the capillary beds, blood is collected by small vessels called venules, which lead to larger veins. Veins continue to carry the blood, now oxygen-depleted and containing waste products, back to the heart. From the heart, the blood is sent to the lungs to be reoxygenated and remove carbon dioxide, and the cycle starts all over again. Blood vessels, including arteries, arterioles, venules, and veins, are composed of three layers (tunics) known as the tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica externa. Each of these layers plays a specific role in the structure and function of blood vessels. The tunica intima, which is the innermost layer, is comprised of a simple squamous epithelium called endothelium and a small amount of connective tissue. The tunica media, which is thicker than the tunica intima, consists of variable amounts of smooth muscle and connective tissue. This layer is the thickest in all but the largest arteries. The tunica externa is primarily a layer of connective tissue, with the exception of veins where it also contains some smooth muscle. Blood flow through blood vessels can be significantly influenced by the processes of vasoconstriction and vasodilation, which occur within the vessel walls. These processes regulate the diameter of blood vessels and control blood flow to various organs and tissues according to their specific needs. To sum up, blood pumped by the heart flows through a series of blood vessels, including arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins, before eventually returning to the heart. This continuous cycle ensures the proper distribution of oxygen and nutrients to the body's cells and the removal of waste products, ultimately maintaining the overall health and functioning of the body's systems."},{"instruction":"Read this: Beyoncé's work has influenced numerous artists including Adele, Ariana Grande, Lady Gaga, Bridgit Mendler, Rihanna, Kelly Rowland, Sam Smith, Meghan Trainor, Nicole Scherzinger, Rita Ora, Zendaya, Cheryl Cole, JoJo, Alexis Jordan, Jessica Sanchez, and Azealia Banks.

If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”.

He had to end his college studies because his health was poor. He began to travel, looking for a place that was good for his health. And he wrote about his travels. Inland Voyage(1878) was about journeys by canoe on the rivers and canals of Belgium and France. Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes followed it in next year. People loved his travel books, and they also found his poems beautiful. In 1879 he travelled to California in a very uncomfortable ship and then by train across the United States to San Francisco. He married in California, but his poor health made him and his wife travel again. Readers of his travel books and poetry were surprised when Treasure Island came out in 1883. It was not at all like his earlier writing, but both children and grown-ups loved it. Treasure Island was finished in Switzerland. Stevenson then continued to travel. He loved the islands of the southern Pacific Ocean, and he found that his health was better there. In the end, he and his wife made their home in Samoa. It was there that he wrote Kidnapped(1886), the story of David Balfour and Alan Breck. It was followed (but not immediately) by Catriona, which continues the story of David Belfour and tells of other exciting adventures of David and Alan, and of David's love for Catriona Drummond.

At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. Paragraph: Justin and Thomas are two college students conducting an experiment in their chemistry laboratory course. They are mixing together acids and bases to produce sodium based compounds. Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: If Thomas wanted the rate of his reactions to be similar to Justin's, should he increase or decrease the temperature of his reactions?","output":"Based on the information provided in the background, it is clear that the rate of a chemical reaction increases at higher temperatures. This is due to the increased energy of the particles involved, leading to more collisions and interactions between these particles. In the context of the given paragraph, Justin is conducting his experiments at a higher temperature, resulting in faster reactions and formation of sodium-based compounds. Thomas, on the other hand, is conducting his experiments at a lower temperature. If Thomas wants the rate of his reactions to be similar to Justin's, he should increase the temperature of his reactions. By increasing the temperature, Thomas will provide his reactants with more energy, leading to increased movement, and consequently, more frequent and forceful collisions between particles. This will, in turn, accelerate the rate of reactions, bringing them closer to the rate Justin is achieving in his experiments. It is important to note that the increase in temperature should be done carefully. Thomas should make sure to only raise the temperature to a safe level and follow any relevant safety guidelines and protocols set by their chemistry laboratory course. By doing so, he can ensure that the experiments are conducted in a controlled and safe manner while increasing the rate of reactions as desired. In summary, if Thomas wants the rate of his reactions to be similar to Justin's, he should increase the temperature of his reactions. This will provide the reactants with more energy and result in faster and more effective chemical reactions, ultimately allowing Thomas to achieve results comparable to those of Justin's experiments."},{"instruction":"Background: Divinyls (often incorrectly referred to as The Divinyls) was an Australian rock band that was formed in Sydney in 1980. The band primarily consisted of vocalist Chrissy Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee. Amphlett garnered widespread attention for performing on stage in a school uniform and fishnet stockings, and often used an illuminated neon tube as a prop for displaying aggression towards both band members and the audience. Originally a five-piece, the band underwent numerous line-up changes, with Amphlett and McEntee remaining as core members, before its dissolution in 1996. Context: Divinyls released five studio albums--four placed in the Top 10 Australian chart, while one (Divinyls) reached No. 15 in the United States (US) and No. 33 for 3 weeks in Canada. Their biggest-selling single \\"I Touch Myself\\" (1990) achieved a No. 1 ranking in Australia, No. 4 in the US, No. 10 in the United Kingdom (UK), and No. 13 in Canada. Amphlett was the cousin of 1960s Australian pop icon Patricia \\"Little Pattie\\" Amphlett, who had been married to Keith Jacobsen--younger brother of pioneer rocker Col Joye and leading promoter Kevin Jacobsen. In her autobiography Pleasure and Pain (2005), Amphlett described breaking into the music scene from the age of fourteen, being arrested for busking when seventeen and travelling in Spain, and how her performances drew upon childhood pain. Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee were introduced by Jeremy Paul (ex-Air Supply) in the car park of a small music venue in Collaroy, Sydney, after Amphlett and Paul had finished a gig with their then band, Batonrouge. Amphlett and McEntee met again at the Sydney Opera House where Amphlett and Paul were singing in a choral concert in 1980. They recruited keyboardist Bjarne Ohlin later in 1980 and drummer Richard Harvey in 1981, respectively, and for almost two years they performed in pubs and clubs in Sydney's Kings Cross. During this time, Paul negotiated publishing and recording agreements that led to the band signing with WEA. Australian film director Ken Cameron saw Divinyls performing in a club. This led to them providing the soundtrack for his 1982 film Monkey Grip and also gave Amphlett, Paul and McEntee supporting roles in the movie. The group released two singles from the soundtrack, Music from Monkey Grip EP, \\"Boys in Town\\", which reached No. 8 on the national singles chart, and \\"Only Lonely\\". The band was the opening act at the 1983 US Festival. After the band's initial success, original manager and bassist Jeremy Paul left. He was replaced on bass, briefly by Ken Firth (ex-The Ferrets) and more permanently by Rick Grossman (ex-Matt Finish). Grossman left in 1987 to replace Clyde Bramley in Hoodoo Gurus. By early 1988, Divinyls consisted of Amphlett and McEntee with augmentation by additional musicians when recording or touring. Over the decade Divinyls released four albums, Music from Monkey Grip EP on WEA in 1982, Desperate on Chrysalis Records in 1983, What a Life! in 1985 and Temperamental in 1988. The latter two albums were also released by Chrysalis in the US. They had hit singles in Australia with, \\"Science Fiction\\" No. 13 in 1983, \\"Good Die Young\\" No. 32 in 1984 and \\"Pleasure and Pain\\" which was written by Holly Knight and Mike Chapman (The Best, Love Is A Battlefield) and went No. 1 in 1985. Their later manager Vince Lovegrove organised Divinyls' transfer from WEA to Chrysalis and their first tours of United States. They established a fan base there, without achieving major commercial success. Divinyls also had Australian hits with cover versions of The Easybeats' \\"I'll Make You Happy\\", and Syndicate of Sound's \\"Hey Little Boy\\" (\\"Hey Little Girl\\" with the gender switched) which reached No. 25 in 1988. Amphlett became a controversial and highly visible celebrity for her brash, overtly sexual persona and subversive humour in lyrics, performances and media interviews. Question: Did they find a replacement for Paul? Answer:","output":"Yes, after original manager and bassist Jeremy Paul left Divinyls, he was replaced on bass, briefly by Ken Firth (ex-The Ferrets) and more permanently by Rick Grossman (ex-Matt Finish). However, Grossman left in 1987, and by early 1988, Divinyls consisted of Amphlett and McEntee with augmentation by additional musicians when recording or touring."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What statue was nickmamed Old Flo? from the following article ? In December 2005, the two ton Reclining Figure (1969–70) – insured for £3 million – was lifted by crane from the grounds of the Henry Moore Foundation on to a lorry and has not been recovered. Two men were jailed for a year in 2012 for stealing a sculpture called Sundial (1965) and the bronze plinth of another work, also from the foundation's estate. In October 2013 Standing Figure (1950), one of four Moore pieces in Glenkiln Sculpture Park, estimated to be worth £3 million, was stolen. In 2012, the council of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets announced its plans to sell another version of Draped Seated Woman 1957–58, a 1.6-tonne bronze sculpture. Moore, a well-known socialist, had sold the sculpture at a fraction of its market value to the former London County Council on the understanding that it would be displayed in a public space and might enrich the lives of those living in a socially deprived area. Nicknamed Old Flo, it was installed on the Stifford council estate in 1962 but was vandalised and moved to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1997. Tower Hamlets Council later had considered moving Draped Seated Woman to private land in Canary Wharf but instead chose to \\"explore options\\" for a sale. In response to the announcement an open letter was published in The Guardian, signed by Mary Moore, the artist's daughter, by Sir Nicholas Serota, Director of the Tate Gallery, by filmmaker Danny Boyle, and by artists including Jeremy Deller.

The Scottish government builds strong international relationships and develops diverse industries, including technology, renewable energy, finance, and tourism. As Scotland's prosperity grows, the nation becomes an attractive destination for business investments and talented individuals. Under Alex Salmond's leadership, Scotland successfully places itself on the world stage, further promoting its distinct culture and values. Meanwhile, the UK, though initially struggling with the loss of an important partner, manages to adapt to this new reality. England, Wales, and Northern Ireland continue to collaborate with Scotland in various areas, such as defense and research, reflecting their shared history and common values. Ultimately, the story ends on a hopeful note. Although the path to Scottish independence was fraught with obstacles and uncertainties, both the UK and the newly sovereign Scotland manage to overcome these challenges and forge strong, separate identities while maintaining a lasting partnership rooted in mutual respect and cooperation."},{"instruction":"I think that was the most vegetables I have ever and will ever see at a Russian meal .

It was evident that the guests were not only nourished through the food they consumed but also through the connections they were making with one another. As the plates were cleared and the table was wiped clean, people started to share stories and experiences that brought them closer together. Laughter filled the room as personal anecdotes made their way around the table. They discovered that despite any cultural differences they might have initially perceived, they shared many common interests, values, and viewpoints. As the evening wore on, someone suggested that they play a round of games to continue the engagement and enjoyment. They promptly divided themselves into teams and began competing in various games that tested their knowledge, wit, and creativity. There was a sense of camaraderie in the air as everyone enthusiastically cheered for their teammates and playfully jeered at the opposing side. During a brief intermission from the games, some of the guests retired to the living room, where they marveled at Josie's impressive collection of books and shared their favorite literary works. They formed an impromptu book club, with everyone agreeing to bring their favorite novel or poem to share at the next gathering. Others took to the patio outside, where they shared old recipes, gardening tips, and newfound favorite vegetable dishes. As the evening sky grew darker, they gazed at the stars together and discussed their favorite constellations and the night sky's grandiosity. As the night came to a close, many of the guests exchanged contact information, eager to continue these newfound friendships and nurture these emotional connections that seemed to have blossomed so easily. As they thanked their hosts for an unforgettable evening, they made plans for future gatherings where they could reconvene and further explore this sense of community they had forged together. As the last guest departed, Josie and her husband, the missionary, stood at the door, reveling in the success of their evening. They acknowledged the pure joy that comes from bringing people together, making them feel welcome, and providing the space for connections to be made. They smiled at each other, knowing that they had made a difference in the lives of the individuals who had come to share a meal and, in turn, left with new friendships, shared experiences, and the knowledge that they belonged to a beautiful and diverse community."},{"instruction":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who could no longer afford the rent on the museum's premises when he retired in 2004? The museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson worked as a teacher and principal for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's Hamrahlid College for the last 26 years before his retirement. As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: \\"Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'\\" According to Sigurður, \\"Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one.\\" The collection was at first housed in Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job. He decided, more as a hobby than a job, to put it on public display in Reykjavík and was awarded a grant from the city council of ISK 200,000 to...

You want to look sharp, but don’t be too casual or make a spectacle of yourself. Remember to comb your hair, brush your teeth and make sure that your clothing is free of dust and wrinkles. In addition to the obvious, be sure to wear deodorant, clean beneath your fingernails and keep facial hair shaved or trimmed. As the old saying goes, “dress for the job you want.” If you look the part, potential employers will be better able to envision you in the position. Aim for a tone that’s relaxed and friendly yet professional. When you’re not talking, listen attentively without interrupting. The person you’re speaking to should be just as comfortable with you as you are with them. Give detailed answers to the questions you’re asked, but resist the urge to boast or talk about yourself at length. Do your best not to stutter, mumble or use a lot of filler noises like “um” and “ah.” If you’re asking for a job via email, take care to use proper spelling, punctuation and grammar. Proofread the message carefully before you send it. Just because you don’t get a job offer right away doesn’t mean that you never will. It may be that the specific position hasn’t opened up yet, or that whoever’s in charge needs more time to interview other applicants. Follow up with a phone call or email within a few days to let someone know that you’re still interested and hopeful to hear back. Confidence speaks volumes. Sometimes, what you lack in direct experience you can make up for in being self-assured. While determination is a good trait to have, you should learn to take no for an answer. Don’t be too discouraged if you don't get the job—thank the person for their time, then redouble your efforts and make sure you’re prepared for the next opportunity that comes along.

Available choices: - deer and butterflies - owls and bacteria - goldfish and rabbits - grass and strawberry plants","output":"To determine which two organisms are most likely to compete, we need to consider their ecological niches and resource requirements. 1. Deer and butterflies: Deer are herbivorous mammals that feed on plants, while butterflies are insects that primarily feed on nectar from flowers. Although they both consume plant matter, their specific resource needs are different, with deer consuming leaves and stems and butterflies consuming nectar. This difference in food sources means that competition between deer and butterflies is unlikely. 2. Owls and bacteria: Owls are predatory birds that feed on small animals, while bacteria are microscopic, single-celled organisms that consume a wide range of organic material. Their feeding habits and ecological roles are very distinct, which makes competition between these two organisms very unlikely. 3. Goldfish and rabbits: Goldfish are aquatic animals that feed on small invertebrates and plant matter in the water, while rabbits are herbivorous mammals that feed on grasses and other terrestrial plants. Given their distinct habitats and resource needs, competition between goldfish and rabbits is unlikely. 4. Grass and strawberry plants: Both grass and strawberry plants are terrestrial plants that grow close to the ground. They compete for resources such as sunlight, water, and nutrients from the soil. Since they have similar ecological niches and needs, competition is more likely between grass and strawberry plants than any others in the available choices.

Cezanne's often repetitive, exploratory brushstrokes are highly characteristic and clearly recognizable. He used planes of colour and small brushstrokes that build up to form complex fields. The paintings convey Cezanne's intense study of his subjects. Cezanne's paintings were shown in the first exhibition of the Salon des Refuses in 1863, which displayed works not accepted by the jury of the official Paris Salon. The Salon rejected Cezanne's submissions every year from 1864 to 1869. He continued to submit works to the Salon until 1882. In that year, through the intervention of fellow artist Antoine Guillemet, he exhibited Portrait de M. L. A., probably Portrait of Louis-Auguste Cezanne, The Artist's Father, Reading \\"L'Evenement\\", 1866 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), his first and last successful submission to the Salon. Before 1895 Cezanne exhibited twice with the Impressionists (at the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874 and the third Impressionist exhibition in 1877). In later years a few individual paintings were shown at various venues, until 1895, when the Parisian dealer, Ambroise Vollard, gave the artist his first solo exhibition. Despite the increasing public recognition and financial success, Cezanne chose to work in increasing artistic isolation, usually painting in the south of France, in his beloved Provence, far from Paris. He concentrated on a few subjects and was equally proficient in each of these genres: still lifes, portraits, landscapes and studies of bathers. For the last, Cezanne was compelled to design from his imagination, due to a lack of available nude models. Like the landscapes, his portraits were drawn from that which was familiar, so that not only his wife and son but local peasants, children and his art dealer served as subjects. His still lifes are at once decorative in design, painted with thick, flat surfaces, yet with a weight reminiscent of Gustave Courbet. The 'props' for his works are still to be found, as he left them, in his studio (atelier), in the suburbs of modern Aix. Cezanne's paintings were not well received among the petty bourgeoisie of Aix.

Dr. Frank Peralta is stabbed to death in his apartment one night. The detective on the case, Lt. Stevenson, quickly finds multiple witnesses putting Peralta's lover, Terry Collins, at the scene. However, when Stevenson finds Terry and questions her, she has an iron-clad alibi with multiple witnesses. It is revealed that Terry has an identical twin sister, Ruth, and the pair share the same job and routinely switch places for their own benefit. Stevenson and the district attorney are unable to prosecute, since the twins refuse to confirm which one of them has the alibi. Unable to accept the \\"perfect crime\\", Lt. Stevenson asks Dr. Scott Elliot for help. Scott is an expert on twin study, and has been routinely encountering the Collins twins at their shared place of work, but does not know which one is which.

She also comforts Ruth, reminding her that she was only at Peralta's apartment but didn't kill him. From Scott's psychological tests and by spending time with them, he discovers that Ruth is kind and loving, while Terry is highly intelligent, insane, and has been manipulating Ruth almost their entire lives.

Use cross-rope to help securely wrap everything from stoppers to the label. Lightweight boxes will lose their weight quite easily over time.. The answer should be","output":"(1). Know that if you purchase boxes of similar sizes, it will become a lot easier to stack them securely within the self-storage facility and will certainly save you space. In order to maintain an organized system, these same-sized boxes will easily stack on each other and maintain a firm structure, minimizing any risk of toppling over. In addition, consider buying specific wardrobe or clothes boxes for your garments. Storing clothes can often prove to be quite challenging, given their varied shapes and sizes. These boxes are specifically designed with a bar across the top so you could hang items, thus preventing them from being crumpled or damaged. The added benefit of using wardrobe boxes is they not only provide protection for your clothes, but the uniformity in sizes make for better stacking, thereby maximizing your storage unit's square footage. (2). Good quality, sturdy boxes should rise to the level of heft you can physically support, as they will have to bear the weight of heavy items to keep them safe from falling. This means you should assess the weight of your items prior to selecting the box you will use for packing. This approach ensures that you're not overestimating the strength of the box and risking a potential damage of your goods. Furthermore, well-constructed boxes should also contain dividers which prevent undue strain on the wall, door or refrigerator floor of the box by distributing the weight of the goods evenly. With such precautions, the chances of box rupture or damage to the packed items are significantly lessened. (3). Consider that the added strength needed to bear the weight of your items will compensate for the natural degradation of the box strength over time. Box strength does degrade especially with use, but different types of degradation can be offset by doubling or tripling the value of the box strength required for an item. (4). Lastly, utilize cross-rope or strapping to secure your goods further by wrapping everything from breakable items to labels. Lightweight boxes, while easier to handle, may become less sturdy over time and the added support of cross-ropes will prevent valuable items from slipping out or being damaged in transit. Proper packing and storing can be a time-consuming task but thorough planning and thoughtful execution will certainly protect your items, save you space and give peace of mind throughout the storage period. Always remember to prioritize quality and durability of packing materials over cost, as this will ensure the long-term safety of your stored goods."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I can use this background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise.

Today’s kitchens easily supplant the bathroom as the home’s most dangerous room. While scalds and falls on tile can inflict serious harm in the bathroom, modern kitchen appliances and gadgets offer many more opportunities for injury. Even a seemingly simple kitchen task can result in a devastating injury. Just ask April Stewart Klausner, a New York illustrator and accomplished cook. Recently Ms. Klausner, 56, severed four tendons, multiple nerves and a blood vessel in her hand while pitting an avocado, something she’d done countless times. Gushing blood and unable to feel or move two fingers, she was taken by ambulance to an emergency room. The injury required more than three hours of surgical repair and many months of painful rehab. It will take at least a year for the injured nerves to heal, and Ms. Klausner can only hope her hand will function normally, enabling her to resume her career full-speed. The therapists at Lang Hand Therapy in Manhattan told her she was the fourth “avocado victim” they’d seen that month. “So add that to immersion blenders and mandolines . . . and maybe the bathroom is not the most dangerous room in the house!” Ms. Klausner said in an e-mail. Knowledge and mindfulness are the secrets to kitchen safety. My husband used to say, “From rushing no good can come.” Don’t try to do several things at once, and leave enough time to accomplish your tasks. Use timers, especially for foods that cook a long time. I use them for everything I cook. My favorite is the battery-operated West Bend Kitchen Timer, easily set by punching in the numbers for hours, minutes and seconds — a worthwhile investment. CUTS Knives are the most frequently used of hazardous kitchen tools. Two safety essentials: they must be sharp (dull knives are more likely to slip and cut the user), and they must be stored separately and safely in their own drawer (or divided section of one), in a wooden block or on a wall-mounted magnetic holder. I wash, dry and put away my knives as soon as I’m done using them. They should never be left lying on a countertop or in a sink full of water or other equipment. When slicing or mincing, keep fingers holding the food curled and out of harm’s way. Cut on a sturdy surface, moving the knife’s edge away from your body. Use the right knife for each task: a serrated blade, for example, is best for bread and safer for the person slicing it. Other sharp kitchen objects, like can lids, can cause nasty cuts. Be careful, too, when opening hard plastic packages, which often have sharp edges. Broken glass should be swept up with a broom and dust pan and disposed of posthaste. Do not use your hands; a damp but sturdy paper towel can be used to clean up tiny pieces of glass. BURNS Keep dry oven mitts near the stove and microwave, and always use them. Microwaved dishes can get extremely hot. Do not substitute dish towels for pot holders. Pot handles should be turned in toward the center of the range, away from the cook and passers-by, to prevent accidental tipping. Under a covered pot of boiling liquid, keep the gas flame low. Avoid steam burns by opening lids away from you. When cooking with hot oil, cover the pan with a spatter screen. Do not wear loose sleeves or flowing clothes while cooking, and tie up long hair. Note the shoes worn by professional chefs: clogs protect their feet in case hot water or oil spills on them. If you suffer a burn, immediately hold the injured area under cold water for several minutes. FIRES Do not leave or store flammable materials near the stove or in the oven. Make sure pots on open flames hold enough liquid, and use a trivet when placing a hot pot on a wood or fabric surface. Clean your oven often to keep it free of grease. If fats or oils catch fire, turn off the heat immediately but don’t try to pick up the pan. Never pour water on a grease fire; use salt or baking soda. Better yet, keep a fire extinguisher handy and know how to use it. FALLS Unnecessary climbs are a recipe for disaster. Keep often-used equipment and heavy pots within easy reach, and use high cupboards only for infrequently needed items and food products. Never stand on chairs. Invest in a sturdy stool with wide steps and rubberized foot pads. I used my wooden stool safely innumerable times until one morning it literally let me down. I landed hard on my back and narrowly missed cracking my head on a doorjamb. Wipe up all spills immediately lest they result in a human spill. I keep sponges and microfiber cloths handy for use on floors only. Leave no tripping hazards on the floor, including shoes and loose throw rugs. Though costly, cushioned rubber mats at the sink and food prep area are safer and more comfortable. ELECTRIC SHOCKS Modern kitchens are replete with electric tools that can result in life-threatening shocks if the power plug comes into contact with water. Read all warning labels and obey them. Use polarized plugs, and do not overload outlets. Dry your hands before plugging in and using appliances, and be sure to unplug an appliance before cleaning it. Hold the plug when pulling it from the socket; do not pull on the cord. POISONING Cleaning products should never be stored in the same cabinet as foods, medications or supplements. My grandmother nearly poisoned herself when she mistakenly drank cleaning fluid, thinking it was Milk of Magnesia; both were milky fluids in blue bottles, and she could not read English. Never transfer cleaning supplies to unmarked or emptied food containers. CHILD SAFETY Children are innately curious and can easily get into trouble in the kitchen the minute you turn your back. If you have young children, grandchildren or friends or relatives who visit with children, keep cabinets containing cleaning products and potent seasonings secured with a safety lock. Never cook with a child in your arms or baby carried in a sling. Best to have a safety seat in the kitchen to secure the child while you are cutting food or cooking. Never leave a toddler loose in the kitchen when no adult is present and paying attention. If children want to help with food preparation, give them age-appropriate tasks and supervise the undertaking. A 2-year-old can add cherry tomatoes to the salad; a 6-year-old can be taught how to cut soft vegetables; a 10-year-old may be able to slice meat. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"This article provides essential safety tips and precautions to avoid accidents and injuries in the kitchen, covering aspects like proper knife handling, preventing burns, fires, falls, electric shocks, and poisoning, as well as ensuring child safety during cooking and food preparation.

The circular cake pan that was previous greased appears, and the stirred contents are poured into it and placed into the pan of hot water where they're all placed into the oven. when it","output":"comes to baking a cake, several crucial steps must be carefully executed to ensure a successful end product. After the circular cake pan is greased, and the contents have been stirred and poured into it, as well as placed in a pan of hot water, the next steps in the process would typically involve baking, cooling, decorating and serving the cake. 1. Baking: The pan, which now contains the cake mix, is placed into the preheated oven at a specified temperature, typically between 325-350°F (163-177°C) for most cakes. The exact temperature and time required for baking may vary depending on the specific type of cake being made and the size of the cake pan used. As the cake bakes, it undergoes chemical changes, with the heat setting the structure and texture of the cake by causing the cake to rise and solidify. Using a timer can be helpful to ensure the cake doesn't overcook or remain undercooked. 2. Testing: It's essential to keep an eye on the cake as it's nearing its recommended baking time. To check if the cake is done, you can use a cake tester or a toothpick. Simply insert the tester or toothpick into the middle of the cake. If it comes out clean or with minimal crumbs, it indicates that the cake is fully baked and can be removed from the oven. 3. Cooling: The next step after baking the cake is to allow it to cool down. Remove the cake pan from the oven and let it sit for around 10 minutes. This cooling process is essential, as it prevents the cake from sticking to the pan. After the initial cooling period, you can use a butter knife or cake spatula to gently run along the edges of the pan, helping to release the cake. Subsequently, place a wire cooling rack over the cake pan, and flip the pan upside down onto the rack. This will allow the cake to fully release from the pan and continue cooling down. The cake should be allowed to cool completely before moving on to the next steps. 4. Leveling: Many cakes may form a dome-like structure while baking. Before decorating, you can opt to level the cake using a serrated knife or a cake leveler. This will help create a more even surface for decorating, as well as provide a more uniform appearance. 5. Decorating: Once the cake has cooled down and has been leveled, you can move on to the decorating phase. This step will depend on the recipe and the desired aesthetic design. Decoration may include applying a layer of frosting or icing, using a piping bag to create intricate designs, covering the cake in fondant for a smooth finish, or adding various edible decorations such as fresh fruits, chocolates, or sugar flowers. It's essential to let your creativity flow and experiment with different techniques and styles. 6. Serving: After completion of the baking and decorating processes, the cake is finally ready to be served. Depending on the type of cake, you can serve it directly on the cooling rack, transfer it to a cake stand, or place it on a decorative plate. Use a sharp knife to cut the cake into evenly-sized slices, and present them to your guests, friends or family members to enjoy! Baking a cake takes precision, patience and attention to detail, but when these steps are followed correctly, the result is a delectable homemade creation."},{"instruction":"Q:Pick one category for the following text.

The case will go to the Connecticut Supreme court this week to determine whether the teen, identified in court papers as Cassandra, has \\"the fundamental right to have a say about what goes on with your [her] body,\\" attorney Michael Taylor, who represents the teen's mother, told ABC News. Taylor was appointed by the public defender's office, and Cassandra has her own court-appointed lawyer, but they've filed joint appeals. Cassandra was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in September, but decided she didn't want to complete the prescribed treatment, according to a court summary. Her mother supported this decision, but the Department of Children and Families stepped in and ordered her mother to comply with the doctor's treatment recommendation. \\"It's really for all the reasons you might imagine,\\" said Taylor, adding that he couldn't go into more detail. Although chemotherapy is a drug that destroys cancer cells, its side effects include hair loss, nausea, pain and fertility changes, according to the National Cancer Institute. Cassandra underwent two chemotherapy treatments in November and then ran away from home and refused to continue treatments, according to the court summary. A court hearing ensued in which Cassandra's doctors testified, and she was removed from her mother's home and placed in state custody so that the state could make medical decisions for her. She has been has been living at Connecticut Children's Medical Center and forced to undergo chemotherapy for about three weeks. The Hartford Courant reported that Cassandra has an 80 to 85 percent chance of surviving her cancer if she continues with her chemotherapy. The state Department of Children and Families issued the following statement: \\"When experts -- such as the several physicians involved in this case -- tell us with certainty that a child will die as a result of leaving a decision up to a parent, then the Department has a responsibility to take action. Even if the decision might result in criticism, we have an obligation to protect the life of the child when there is consensus among the medical experts that action is required. Much of the improvements in Connecticut's child welfare system have come from working with families voluntarily to realize solutions to family challenges. Unfortunately that can't happen in every situation, especially when the life of a child is at stake.\\" \\"No one is disputing that it's very serious,\\" Taylor said. He said there's \\"a good chance\\" Cassandra could survive her cancer with treatment, and \\"there's a good chance she could die if she doesn't. None of us disagree about that.\\" Taylor said they're trying to argue that because Cassandra is competent, she should be allowed to make this decision for herself through something called the \\"mature minor doctrine,\\" which has been adopted in Illinois and a few other states but rejected in Texas. The doctrine holds that some children are mature enough to make key life decisions for themselves. ||||| HARTFORD — A Connecticut teenager will continue to receive chemotherapy against her will and her mother's wishes. In an oral ruling, the state Supreme Court unanimously found Thursday that the question of whether Cassandra C., 17, of Windsor Locks, was legally competent or mature enough to reject life-saving treatment was sufficiently explored at two Superior Court hearings earlier this fall. Those hearings led to temporary state custody of Cassandra and court-ordered chemotherapy to treat her Hodgkin's lymphoma. The seven justices resumed their seats shortly after the 75-minute hearing, making quick work of the request by lawyers for Cassandra and her mother, Jackie Fortin, for an additional hearing on whether the teen qualified under the \\"mature minor doctrine\\" to reject treatment. After Superior Court hearings in November and December, the state Department of Children and Families won temporary custody of Cassandra, and a six-month regimen of chemotherapy began at Connecticut Children's Medical Center. Doctors testified at the lower court hearings that Cassandra would die without the treatment, and that her chance of survival and complete recovery with chemotherapy was 80 percent to 85 percent. In a column for The Courant on Page A10, Cassandra C. described the past few months. \\"Words cannot describe what my life has become over the last few months,\\" she wrote. \\"Horrifying seems like an understatement. What I have been going through is traumatizing. Never did it cross my mind that one day I would be diagnosed with cancer. \\"Whether I live 17 years or 100 years should not be anyone's choice but mine. How long is a person actually supposed to live, and why? Who determines that? I care about the quality of my life, not just the quantity.\\" At the court hearing, Chief Justice Chase T. Rogers asked at the outset what further evidence of Cassandra's competency could be gleaned from an additional hearing. Lawyer Michael Taylor and Assistant Public Defender Joshua Michtom, who represent mother and daughter, respectively, readily acknowledged that there was ample opportunity at the November and December hearings to present a complete picture of Cassandra's competency to reject life-saving treatment. But Taylor said that the question of Cassandra's overall maturity was not adequately examined, and that a further psychological evaluation was appropriate in this case. When Justice Richard N. Palmer asked Taylor how he would further attack DCF's actions, Taylor, with a quick smile, said, \\"Your honor, I think we can think of something.\\" Laughter rippled through the packed gallery in a case that has attracted national interest. When the hearing was adjourned, a woman with a poster announcing her opposition to chemotherapy approached the media throng in the grand court lobby and said that Cassandra deserved the chance to choose her treatment. The Connecticut Civil Liberties Union also filed a brief in support of Cassandra and her mother. DCF was resolute in what it saw as its duty to act on Cassandra's behalf. The lawyer for the department, Assistant State Attorney General John Tucker, told the justices that mother and daughter had indulged in \\"some magical thinking that, 'If I closed my eyes to the fact I have this serious illness, then my cancer doesn't exist.'\\" \\"That's DCF's opinion,\\" countered Fortin, after the hearing. The unemployed house cleaner and caterer maintained that the decision to refuse chemotherapy was Cassandra's, and that she and her daughter were pursuing an alternative treatment when DCF intervened. But the lawyers for the family didn't bring that up before the Supreme Court on Thursday. Fortin acknowledged that she personally opposes \\"chemicals and toxins\\" and would continue looking for an alternative treatment. She also said that her daughter \\"had lost her hair and is sick,\\" while Tucker, DCF's attorney, said the home-schooled teenager was \\"doing well\\" and responding in typical fashion to chemotherapy treatment. The high court noted that Cassandra had run away after receiving her first two treatments, and that it would have been proper for the Superior Court judges to consider that behavior in assessing Cassandra's competency. In his argument before the justices, Tucker said it was DCF's position that it was Fortin, not Cassandra, who was resisting the treatment, and that the child-protection agency had an obligation to intervene. \\"Really, it was the mother who was taking the front seat on this. The child was overshadowed by the mother's negative feelings about chemotherapy,\\" said Tucker, adding that the agency specifically asked at the December hearing for a ruling on Cassandra's competency. In a statement through a spokesman, DCF Commissioner Joette Katz said the affirmation of the lower court decisions \\"will allow us to continue to provide the medical treatment that will save Cassandra's life. This is a curable illness, and we will continue to ensure that Cassandra receives the treatment she needs to become a healthy and happy adult.\\" Fortin questioned how removing a daughter from a loving mother was in the child's best interest, and said she would continue to look for alternative treatment. Both sides in this unusual case agreed that the state would have no ground to interfere with Cassandra's decision if she was 18 when she made it — nine months from now. Because she is a minor, Tucker argued, DCF had to take the role of \\"the adult in the room\\" when it came to Cassandra's medical care. Michtom and Taylor have said that they do not fault the order from the trial judges or DCF's actions. Mother and daughter initially complied with the court order, and Cassandra received two chemotherapy treatments — but she then ran away from home and became a subject of a police-issued Silver Alert. When she returned home, Cassandra went back to CCMC, where she had had a portion of her lymph node removed. Fortin said that doctors had \\"to strap her down on the bed\\" to do the preparatory surgery before resuming the regimen of chemotherapy. Fortin has said Cassandra believes that the chemical toxins could do more damage to her body than the cancer. Michtom said the question was whether, despite an encouraging prognosis, \\"a smart and knowledgeable 17-year-old (can) make the same choice, for better or worse, than she would be able to make without state interference nine months from now, when she turns 18.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The case of a 17-year-old girl, identified as Cassandra, who refused chemotherapy treatment for her Hodgkin's lymphoma took center stage in the Connecticut Supreme court.

However, the Department of Children and Families intervened and ordered the mother to comply with the doctor's recommended treatment.

The court then removed her from her mother's home and placed her under state custody to enforce the chemotherapy.

The Hadar site yielded numerous Australopithecus afarensis fossils, including the iconic \\"Lucy\\" skeleton discovered in 1974, and the \\"Selam\\" juvenile specimen found in 2000. b. Tanzania: The Olduvai Gorge and Laetoli sites in Tanzania have also produced significant Australopithecus fossils. The Laetoli site is particularly famous for the discovery of a set of 3.6-million-year-old hominid footprints, attributed to Australopithecus afarensis, preserved in volcanic ash. c. Kenya: Important fossil sites in Kenya include West Turkana, specifically the Lake Turkana region and Koobi Fora. Numerous Australopithecus fossils, such as the Australopithecus anamensis and Australopithecus afarensis, have been found in these regions. 2. Cradle of Humankind (South Africa): The Cradle of Humankind site, located near Johannesburg, is one of the most significant paleoanthropological arenas in Africa. Designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it spans over 180 square miles and features several limestone caves. It is best known for Australopithecus africanus fossils. Some of the well-known fossil discoveries from this area include: a. Taung Child: Found in the Buxton Limeworks near the town of Taung in 1924, this is the first-ever discovery of an Australopithecus fossil. It comprises a partial skull and brain endocast of a young individual, Australopithecus africanus. b. Sterkfontein Caves: Located near the town of Krugersdorp, the Sterkfontein Caves have contributed significantly to our understanding of early hominids. Notable Australopithecus africanus specimens, such as \\"Mrs. Ples\\" and \\"Little Foot,\\" have been uncovered here. c. Swartkrans and Kromdraai: These are neighboring sites situated close to Sterkfontein Caves. Numerous Paranthropus (robust australopithecines) and early Homo fossils have been discovered here, offering a broader understanding of hominid diversity in the region. In summary, most fossils of Australopithecus have been discovered in Eastern and Southern Africa at various sites within Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, and South Africa. These fossils have provided significant insights into the early stages of human evolution, helping us construct a better picture of our ancient hominid relatives and the environments they resided in."},{"instruction":"Afghan parliament approves U.S. partnership What is a sentence that would be (on a scale from 0 to 5) a (V) out of 5 in terms of textual similarity to the above sentence?","output":"The Afghan government says yes to being friends with America."},{"instruction":"Creatively image a question and justification for this answer: November 22 , 2002","output":"Question: When did the historic Russian spacecraft Foton-M, carrying various biological specimens and experiments, launch into space and why is this date significant? Answer: November 22, 2002 Justification: On November 22, 2002, the Russian Space Agency launched the Foton-M spacecraft from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, starting an important space mission. The significance of this mission lies in its focus on the effect of microgravity and space radiation on a variety of biological organisms and materials. One of the primary objectives of the Foton-M mission was to conduct extensive biological research in space, which included the study of bacteria, fungi, plant seeds, insects, and small invertebrates like water bears (tardigrades). Understanding how these organisms react to space environments can provide valuable insights into cellular and molecular processes, as well as help in developing technologies for long-duration space exploration. Furthermore, Foton-M carried several material science experiments designed to study the impact of microgravity on the growth and properties of various crystals and metals. This information can contribute to the development of stronger and lighter materials for use not only in aerospace applications but also in everyday industries on Earth. The Foton-M spacecraft was a recoverable satellite, intended to return to Earth after a mission duration of approximately two weeks. The mission's outcome provided scientists with a wealth of knowledge about biological and physical sciences, potentially benefiting various fields of technology. The launch of this spacecraft on November 22, 2002, highlights the continuing human effort to learn about and explore the mysteries of space."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? The British government banned flights to Kenya.","output":"Yes, based on the given paragraph, we can quite conclusively determine that the sentence \\"The British government banned flights to Kenya\\" is essentially true. The paragraph does not explicitly use the term 'ban', rather it states that the British government decided to 'suspend' flights to Kenya. While a suspension might technically be temporary and a ban suggests more permanence, in the broad sense, both actions lead to a halt or an interruption of flight services from Britain to Kenya. The implication from the paragraph is clear: the British government has strategically subjected travel to Kenya to an immediate halt. It's important to note that the reason behind the suspension is not stated. The paragraph only expresses regret over this decision, associating it to benefiting terrorists. However, the casual reader would interpret ‘suspension’ as synonimous to 'ban', but there are nuanced differences in wording where suspension might be temporary necessitated by situations such as weather conditions or immediate security threats, while a ban implies a more severe, often politically or safety motivated prohibition, typically for an undisclosed or extended period of time. In this regard, depending on the context and the desired precision of language, one might take issue with equating 'suspend flights' with 'banned flights'. But in terms of surface interpretation, readers would generally regard the two as more or less identical, as both imply an immediate cessation of flight operations between the two points - Britain and Kenya. Therefore, based on the lack of explicit time frames or detailed context, it is safe to view \\"The British government banned flights to Kenya\\" as an accurate conversion of the original information in the paragraph for a majority of readers, while recognizing that the specific language may imply different things in specialized or official contexts."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to build a utility trailer Determine the type of trailer you'll need.

On one hand, some people think that they should have a car when they have enough money, and then it's easy to go out and they can feel comfortable. On the other hand, a growing number of people hope to use their cars to show off . What's more, years of research has shown that one of other reasons for the traffic jam is the driving habit.

What emotion might the person be experiencing here ?","output":"The person in the text appears to be experiencing a range of emotions, including fear, discomfort, determination, and urgency. Let us analyze the passage to understand the various emotional cues. Firstly, the description of the environment and physical sensations provides some insight into the emotions felt by the individual. The cold and surprisingly strong force, along with the jagged pieces of metal poking into the person's cheek, indicate that they are experiencing discomfort, and possibly, even pain. This physical sensation of discomfort and pain might evoke feelings of fear or anxiety in the person, as they may worry about the potential harm that the situation may cause to their body. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding the extent of their injury (questioning if their skin is tearing) suggests feelings of vulnerability and insecurity. The person is in a physically compromised situation and is unsure about the consequences of it. This uncertainty adds to the emotions of fear and anxiety, as they feel exposed and helpless in the face of this dangerous environment. Despite these overwhelming emotions, the person manages to pull themselves together and take action - yanking themselves away and shifting the debris to help see better. This behavior demonstrates determination and a sense of urgency. The person seems to be aware of the danger they are in and feels compelled to find a solution or a way out. They are driven by an innate desire to survive and protect themselves from further harm. In conclusion, the person in this passage is most likely experiencing an array of emotions that include fear, discomfort, vulnerability, determination, and urgency. These emotions are intertwined as the person navigates through a hazardous situation, driven by a need to protect themselves and find a solution amidst the chaos. The contrast between their vulnerable state and their determination to take action highlights the complexities of human emotions and showcases the resilience of humans in challenging circumstances."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information: - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions.

Geomorphologists seek to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics and to predict changes through a combination of field observations, physical experiments and numerical modeling. Geomorphologists work within disciplines such as physical geography, geology, geodesy, engineering geology, archaeology and geotechnical engineering. This broad base of interests contributes to many research styles and interests within the field. - Southern California, often abbreviated as SoCal, is a geographic and cultural region that generally comprises California's 10 southernmost counties.

An apostrophe is used to show possession, indicating that the life being discussed belongs to Rachel Proctor. The correct usage would therefore be \\"Proctor's\\". Punctuation can often change the meaning of a sentence, so it's crucial to use it correctly. In this case, without the apostrophe, it isn't clear that the life referred to is owned or associated with Rachel Proctor. The apostrophe helps prevent this confusion. Moreover, the final full stop (.) notates the end of the sentence. It indicates a full stop in thought and a clear break in the text. Using full stops correctly can aid in making the text more comprehensive and easier to read.

Nicknamed the Car-puccino, it has been created using a 1988 Volkswagen Scirocco bought for PS400 and it was chosen because it looked like the time-traveling DeLorean in the movieBack To The Future.The car will be driven the 210 miles between Manchester and London powered only by roasted coffee granules .It has been built by a team from the BBC1 science programme Bang Goes The Theory and will go on display at the Big Bang science fair in Manchester to show how fuels other than traditional petrol can power vehicles. The team calculates the Car-puccino will do three miles per kilo of ground coffee -- about 56 cups of espressos per mile.The journey will use about 70 kilos of ground coffee which, at supermarket prices of between PS13 and PS26 a kilo depending on brand and quality, will cost between PS910 and PS1,820, or between 25 and 50 times the PS36 cost of petrol for the journey.In total, the trip will cost 11,760 espressos, and the team will have to take 'coffee breaks' roughly every 30 to 45 miles to pour in more granules.They will also have to stop about every 60 miles to clean out the 'coffee filters' to rid them of the soot and tar which is also generated by the process.So despite a top speed of 60mph, the many stops mean the going will be slow, with the journey taking around ten hours.

It is the root of the English word \\"vicar\\". - Hasdrubal Barca (245207 BC) was Hamilcar Barca's second son and a Carthaginian general in the Second Punic War. He was the brother of the famous Hannibal. - Hispania was the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula. Under the Republic, Hispania was divided into two provinces: Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior. During the Principate, Hispania Ulterior was divided into two new provinces, Baetica and Lusitania, while Hispania Citerior was renamed Tarraconensis. Subsequently, the western part of Tarraconensis was split off, first as Hispania Nova, later renamed Callaecia (or Gallaecia, whence modern Galicia). From Diocletian's Tetrarchy (AD 284) onwards, the south of remaining Tarraconensis was again split off as Carthaginensis, and probably then too the Balearic Islands and all the resulting provinces formed one civil diocese under the \\"vicarius\\" for the Hispaniae (that is, the Celtic provinces). The name, Hispania, was also used in the period of Visigothic rule. - Tarraco is the ancient name of the current city of Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain). It was the oldest Roman settlement on the Iberian Peninsula, founded during the Second Punic War by Scipio Calvus, and became capital of the Roman province of Hispania Citerior, and of Hispania Tarraconensis during the Roman Empire. - The Second Punic War, also referred to as The Hannibalic War and (by the Romans) the War Against Hannibal, lasted from 218 to 201 BC and involved combatants in the western and eastern Mediterranean. This was the second major war between Carthage and the Roman Republic and its allied Italic socii, with the crucial participation of Numidian-Berber armies and tribes on both sides. The two states fought three major wars with each other over the course of their existence. They are called the \\"Punic Wars\\" because Rome's name for Carthaginians was \\"Poeni\\", derived from \\"Poenici\\" (earlier form of \\"Punici\\"), a reference to the founding of Carthage by Phoenician settlers. - Hannibal (247 between 183 and 181 BC), fully Hannibal Barca, was a Punic military commander from Carthage, generally considered one of the greatest military commanders in history. His father Hamilcar Barca was the leading Carthaginian commander during the First Punic War. His younger brothers were Mago and Hasdrubal, and he was brother-in-law to Hasdrubal the Fair. - The Battle of Cissa was part of the Second Punic War. It was fought in the fall of 218 BC, near the Greek town of Tarraco in north-eastern Iberia. A Roman army under Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus defeated an outnumbered Carthaginian army under Hanno, thus gaining control of the territory north of the Ebro River that Hannibal had just subdued a few months prior in the summer of 218 BC. This was the first battle that the Romans had ever fought in Iberia. - Hasdrubal the Fair (c. 270 BC 221 BC) was a Carthaginian military leader and politician, governor in Iberia after Hamilcar Barca's death, and founder of Cartagena. - Hispania Ulterior (English: \\"Further Spain\\", or occasionally \\"Thither Spain\\") was a region of Hispania during the Roman Republic, roughly located in Baetica and in the Guadalquivir valley of modern Spain and extending to all of Lusitania (modern Portugal, Extremadura and a small part of Salamanca province) and Gallaecia (modern Northern Portugal and Galicia). Its capital was Corduba. - The Battle of Ebro River was a naval battle fought near the mouth of Ebro River in the spring of 217 BC between a Carthaginian fleet of approximately 40 quinqueremes, under the command of Himilco, and a Roman fleet of 55 ships, under Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus. Hasdrubal Barca, the Carthaginian commander in Iberia, had launched a joint expedition to destroy the Roman base north of the Ebro River. The Carthaginian naval contingent was totally defeated after a surprise attack by the Roman ships, losing 29 ships and the control of seas around Iberia. The reputation of the Romans was further enhanced in Iberia after this victory, causing rebellion among some of the Iberian tribes under Carthaginian control. - Gallaecia or Callaecia, also known as Hispania Gallaecia, was the name of a Roman province in the north-west of Hispania, approximately present-day Galicia, northern Portugal, Asturias and Leon and the later Suebic Kingdom of Gallaecia. The Roman cities included the port Cale (Porto), the governing centers Bracara Augusta (Braga), Lucus Augusti (Lugo) and Asturica Augusta (Astorga) and their administrative areas Conventus bracarensis, Conventus lucensis and Conventus asturicensis. - Hamilcar Barca or Barcas (c. 275 228 BC) was a Carthaginian general and statesman, leader of the Barcid family, and father of Hannibal, Hasdrubal and Mago. He was also father-in-law to Hasdrubal the Fair. - The Balearic Islands are an archipelago of Spain in the western Mediterranean Sea, near the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. - The Principate is the name sometimes given to the first period of the Roman Empire from the beginning of the reign of Augustus in about 30 BC to the Crisis of the Third Century in 284 AD, after which it evolved into the so-called \\"Dominate\\". - The Battle of Dertosa , also known as the Battle of Ibera , was fought in the spring of 215 BC on the south bank of the Ebro River across from the town of Dertosa . A Roman army , under the command of Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus and Publius Cornelius Scipio , defeated a similarly sized Carthaginian army under Hasdrubal Barca . The Romans , under Gnaeus Scipio , had established themselves in Hispania after winning the Battle of Cissa in 218 BC. Hasdrubal Barca 's expedition to evict them had ended in the defeat of the Iberian contingent of the Carthaginian navy at the Battle of Ebro River in 217 BC. Hasdrubal launched another expedition in 215 BC , but the defeat at Dertosa cost the Carthaginians a chance to reinforce Hannibal at a critical juncture , and the Romans gained the initiative in Hispania . The Scipio brothers continued with their policy of subjugating the Iberian tribes and raiding Carthaginian possessions . After losing of most of his field army , Hasdrubal had to be reinforced with the army that was to sail to Italy and reinforce Hannibal . Thus , by winning this battle , the Scipios had indirectly prevented the situation in Italy from getting worse in addition to improving their own situation in Iberia . This battle also demonstrates the danger of implementing the double envelopment tactic . - Publius Cornelius Scipio (died 211 BC) was a general and statesman of the Roman Republic. - The Iberian Peninsula , also known as Iberia , is located in the southwest corner of Europe. The peninsula is principally divided between Portugal and Spain, comprising most of their territory. It also includes Andorra and a small part of France along the peninsula's northeastern edge, as well as Gibraltar on its south coast, a small peninsula which forms an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. With an area of approximately , it is the second largest European peninsula, after the Scandinavian. - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. - The term tetrarchy (from the , \\"tetrarchia\\", \\"leadership of four [people]\\") describes any form of government where power is divided among four individuals, but in modern usage usually refers to the system instituted by Roman Emperor Diocletian in 293, marking the end of the Crisis of the Third Century and the recovery of the Roman Empire. This tetrarchy lasted until c. 313, when internecine conflict eliminated most of the claimants to power, leaving Constantine in control of the western half of the empire, and Licinius in control of the eastern half. - Constrained Energy Lapped Transform (CELT) is an open, royalty-free lossy audio compression format and a free software codec with especially low algorithmic delay for use in low-latency audio communication.

Development of the format was maintained by the Xiph.Org Foundation (as part of the Ogg codec family) and later coordinated by the Opus working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). - Hispania Citerior (English: \\"Hither Spain\\", or \\"Nearer Spain\\") was a Roman Province in Hispania during the Roman Republic. It was on the eastern coast of Spain down to the town of Cartago Nova, today's Cartagena in the autonomous community of Murcia, Spain. It roughly covered today's Spanish autonomous communities of Catalonia and Valencia. Further south there was the Roman Province of Hispania Ulterior (\\"Further Spain\\"), which further away from Rome. The two provinces were formed in 197 BC, four years after the end of the Second Punic War (218-201 BC). During this war Scipio Africanus defeated the Carthaginians at the Battle of Ilipa (near Seville) in 206 BC. This led to the Romans taking over the Carthaginian possessions in southern Spain and on the east coast up to the River Ebro. Several governors of Hispania Citerior commanded wars against the Celtiberians who lived to the west of this province. In the late first century BC Augustus reorganised the Roman provinces in Hispania and Hispania Citerior was replaced by the larger province of Hispania Tarraconensis, which included the territories the Romans had conquered in central, northern and north-western Hispania. Augustus also renamed Hispania Ulterior Hispania Baetica and created a third province, Hispania Lusitania. - Lusitania or Hispania Lusitana was an ancient Iberian Roman province including approximately all of modern Portugal south of the Douro river and part of modern Spain (the present autonomous community of Extremadura and a small part of the province of Salamanca). It was named after the Lusitani or Lusitanian people (an Indo-European people). Its capital was \\"Emerita Augusta\\" (currently Mérida, Spain), and it was initially part of the Roman Republic province of Hispania Ulterior, before becoming a province of its own in the Roman Empire. Romans first came to the territory around the mid 2nd century BC. A war with Lusitanian tribes followed, from 155 to 139 BC. In 27 BC, the province was created. - Hispan, Espan, Hispalo or Hispano, is a mythological character of Antiquity, who would derive the name Hispania, according to some ancient writers. Therefore, Hispan is the eponymous hero of Hispania. Hispan is mentioned first by the Gallo-Roman historian Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus (1st century BC) in his work \\"Historiae Philippicae\\", preserved only in a later summary, probably made in the 3rd century AD by Justinus. During the Middle Ages, Hispan was also known as Espan, told of him various legends. - The First Punic War (264 to 241 BC) was the first of three wars fought between Ancient Carthage and the Roman Republic. For more than 20 years, the two powers struggled for supremacy, primarily on the Mediterranean island of Sicily and its surrounding waters, and also in North Africa. The war signaled the beginning of a strategic transformation in the western Mediterranean. Carthage began the war as the great sea-power of the western Mediterranean, while Rome had but a small fleet of fighting ships. Over the course of the war, Rome built up a powerful navy, developed new naval tactics, and strategically used their navy, army, and local political alliances on Sicily in order to achieve a victory that expelled the Carthaginians from Sicily. The First Punic War ended with a treaty between Rome and Carthage, but years of bloodshed were to follow in the Second and Third Punic Wars before the strategic issue of power in the western Mediterranean was resolved in favor of Rome, and in the total destruction of Carthage. - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Joining me now on the phone is the man of the hour, Virginia GOP primary winner Dave Brat. Dave, welcome to the program. DAVE BRAT, R-VA., CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE (via telephone): Hey, Sean. Thanks for having me on, and great to be with you. HANNITY: Appreciate you being her. What do you attribute this big win tonight to? BRAT: Well, it's pretty much been in my stump speech, and it basically just lays out -- I mean, every -- if you go door-to-door knocking, the American people know the country is heading in the wrong direction, right, I mean, the debt and the deficits. The economic growth is terrible. The regulatory burden is terrible. And the representation in D.C. won't address those major issues. And so I think the people are just ready for some major changes in this country. And I was blessed. I mean, it's a miracle. What do I attribute it to? First of all, I attribute it to God. And I'm utterly humbled and thankful. I'm a believer and so I'm humbled that God gave us this win. But right with that, God acts through people, and God acted through the people on my behalf. I had volunteers working just tirelessly across the counties. I tried to communicate that to the news media, what was going on, and it's hard to communicate that. But it was real and it turned out -- we were just celebrating like crazy tonight, just an unbelievable miracle. HANNITY: You know, I've been listening a lot to the analysis all night, Dave, and I think you touched on something that I was thinking about that I think a lot of people have missed, and that is I think this is maybe a little bit bigger than Tea Party versus conservative. I think the country is fed up with the fact that we have record debt, record deficits. We have 50 million people in poverty, 50 million people on food stamps. We have a VA that's not working. We have \\"Obama care\\" that is an absolute mess. To what extent do you think these national issues have impacted this race in particular? BRAT: Well, yes, tremendously. I mean, I agree with that. And just so you know, I mean, the press in my own region, in the introduction tonight -- I mean, I'm not holding anybody's feet to the fire, but you know, it wasn't a contest between the Tea Party and the Republicans and all this. Although I had tremendous Tea Party support and just wonderful people in the Tea Party grass roots helping me out, and they're clearly responsible for the win, but I ran on the Republican principles. And we have this Republican creed in Virginia in that the only problem with the Republican principles is no one's following them. First one is a commitment to free markets. We don't have any free markets in this country anymore, right? And then equal treatment under the law, and fiscal responsibility, constitutional adherence, peace through strong defense, and then faith in God, and strong moral fiber. That's what I ran on, the Republican creed. But the press is just always out to have these exciting stories to sell papers. And the people actually do care about policy. When you're serious -- I give 30-minute stump speeches on policy, and the press made fun of me. BRAT: They said, These aren't good stump speeches. You're talking serious issues. Well, the American people are ready for serious issues. HANNITY: You know, it's interesting you say all that. I have been making a point as a conservative commentator both on radio and TV -- I make a very clear distinction between conservative governors like Rick Perry and Bobby Jindal and Kasich and Walker and Nikki Haley and Rick Scott, and I've been comparing them and I've been using words like \\"timid\\" and \\"afraid\\" and \\"lacking of vision\\" when talking about Washington Republicans. Is that a factor in all of this? BRAT: Yes. Right. I mean, yes, the vision thing -- and I'd expand on that, even. You know, some of this is -- you know, goes back to constitutional principles. And everybody wants the federal government to solve every problem in their life. And so part of the issue is, some of these issues we got to look in the mirror, right? The cultural issues, that's not, you know, due to politicians. Our educational system -- everyone thinks it can be solved with spending infinite money on it. It -- it -- a lot of it just comes down to personal responsibility and discipline. And our test scores -- you know, we're at the bottom of the OECD countries on math and science scores right now, and we're competing with the rest of the world. And so we have to do better. And our kids' test scores right now, that's going to be our future economy in 20 years. And so fundamentals matter, and everybody knows we're off track, and so this country's got to turn around. And you know, I'm -- with Reagan, I'm optimistic always about what the American people can do. But we got to take the shackles off, the regulatory burden, something like 2 trillion out of the 17 trillion economy, and if you get rid of that, we can unleash the American people, and they're ready to roll. HANNITY: You know, I brought up -- and I've been a little bit frustrated because I feel like there are five specific issues that the alternative governing party ought to be offering, and that would be -- and these were on your list -- fiscal responsibility, I like the penny plan, I think we should balance the budget. I think we need choice in education. There's no consensus -- four years into the \\"Obama care,\\" passing of \\"Obama care,\\" there's no Republican consensus plan. Secure the borders. That was a big issue in this race I'll ask you about in a minute. And -- and you know, simple things. And we haven't gotten that. Do you think that this is frustration more towards Washington in general or the Republican Party as an alternative governing party? BRAT: Well, in Virginia, the Republican Party has been kind of taking it to the grass roots. And the grass roots is rightly upset because the grass roots is mocked routinely in the press, you know? And I don't understand that. The outpouring alone from these folks that have supported me and worked tirelessly for me -- and so in Virginia, we've had some problem with this technical issue called \\"slating.\\" The Republicans have actually been taking conservatives out of their own district democratic processes. And so there is some animosity and bad blood. But we got to -- we got to get better. But the -- I think you're right, the issue is the Republican Party has been paying way too much attention to Wall Street and not enough attention to Main Street. And so the American people want to take the country back. And you know, what motivated the race for me was after the financial crisis, right, we had Fannie and Freddie collapse, the housing market, then the financial sector tanks. And I thought surely our political leaders now -- you know, we're on our knees economically. We'll learn some lessons and get it right, and they didn't. We're still in roughly the same mess. And so... BRAT: ... I think you're on target. HANNITY: You know, a lot of people -- Reagan is beloved within Republican ranks. A lot of people forget that Reagan challenged a sitting president in 1976, Gerald Ford, and he nearly won. So Dave, I ask you this. You took on, you know, in this particular case, a job that nobody thought -- the House Majority leader -- I can't remember a time in history where this has happened before, and I've been looking all night. And what you said is while he's got an eye on the speaker's job, he turned his back on his constituents. And a big issue here was the issue of immigration, especially in the final days of this campaign. And you said the amnesty issue is symbolic, a powerful expression about the difference between Eric Cantor and I on jobs. Cantor is saying that we should bring more folks to the country, increase the labor supply, and by doing so, lower wage rates for the working person. His policies make no sense. How big an issue do you think the immigration issue was in this campaign? BRAT: Well, I think it's big. I mean, it's the most symbolic issue that captured the differences between myself and Eric Cantor in this race, but it also captures that fissure between Main Street and Wall Street, right? So you look at people's intention, right, and political intention. So you ask yourself, Why are the Republicans doing this, right? Why are they so intent on this immigration reform? And there's no answer that really makes logical sense, right? I mean, it's clear they're doing it for the Chamber of Commerce, and they want cheap labor and expanded workforce, and whatever. And that's going to lower wages for everybody else. And you know, I teach third world economic development, and you know, my intent -- I mean, if you really want to help these folks -- everyone wants to come to this country because we're rich, and the reason we're rich is because we have a very firm rule of law and protection of property rights. So if you really want to help the rest of the world, what you've got to do is encourage free markets, private property rights and the strong rule of law and get rid of the dictators in a lot of these countries. And if we do that -- you know, those are just fundamental, simple ideas, and you know, we did that after World War II with Japan and Germany. We built them up. Now we trade together and everyone's rich, and it works out well. It's a win-win. And so that's what we need to do with the rest of the world. We clearly cannot import 7 billion people on the planet into the United States of America. It's just a non-starter. HANNITY: You know, Dave, I've been watching the reaction and the analysis of, you know, people like Steve Israel and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and others tonight. Chuck Schumer I know was quoted as making his statement. And it's interesting because -- and Democratic commentators -- they try to make this or paint this as the party moving right. And as I have gone over your platform and followed this particular race -- can you think of one issue where you are against the Republican platform and what the Republican Party has historically stood for? BRAT: No. No. That's exactly -- if that's what they're saying -- and I haven't seen any comments yet -- that's just pure politics and it's bad ethics, right? It's unethical because it's not true. And so it's not about right or left, right? Free markets are indisputably the cause of our wealth. China right now is the perfect case in point. They're feeding 1.2 billion people for the first time in world history due to only one thing. Answer, free markets, right? So we as Republicans -- that's the number one issue in our creed, and that is a compassionate position. We're feeding 1.2 billion people and India's 1.2 billion people now also, right? And so, no, I'm running 100 percent on just mainstream Republican issues, and the Republicans need to do a better job of following these, and then we'll get the country out of the ditch. HANNITY: And I would agree with you that it's in a ditch. Let me ask you this. There's a report this week about Ted Cruz. Every Republican that I know ran on the idea of repealing and replacing \\"Obama care,\\" and there were many votes, in fairness to Eric Cantor and everybody else, to do as much. But when it came down to a moment where they could have an impact, Ted Cruz angered the establishment in Washington by actually forcing the issue of the promise that they all made. There was a report this week that said that after the mid-terms that the Republican establishment would go after Ted Cruz. So you know, we have an issue where Eric Cantor went to the seacoast earlier this year and he was going to battle the Tea Party. What is your take on the relationship, and what it needs to be, between the Tea Party and the establishment? BRAT: Yes, well, the grass roots, the Tea Party and the Republican Party all share almost identical principles. And you know, I went to seminary. I think you did, also. HANNITY: Yes, I did. They kicked me out, though. BRAT: Yes. I mean, principles matter, right? And so every ethic (ph) before us has had great philosophers that paid attention to first principles, and if you pay attention to those, you can live a better life and your country can do better. The founders were absolutely people -- you know, political philosophers. And I don't see much of that in the Republican Party. I don't see any of it in the Democratic Party at all, right? BRAT: And so we need to do -- we need to quit playing politics every day. Everything's about crass politics. The Democrats are making statements about me moving to the right. There's nothing right or left about free markets. There's nothing right or left about the rule of law, right? I mean... HANNITY: Well said. I agree with you. BRAT: They're just framing it incorrectly. HANNITY: Look, what I have been saying is that I think the country right now, with 50 million Americans in poverty and 50 million Americans on food stamps and our veterans being put on fraudulent waiting lists and issue after issue -- national security issues that we're dealing with -- for me, I was there the night that Newt Gingrich became the Speaker of the House. I loved the \\"Contract With America.\\" And if I had five items, it would be balance the budget, stop robbing our kids. I happen to like the penny plan. Control our borders would be another one. I think we can duplicate the job success with energy in North Dakota. We need a consensus alternative that the country can rally on for \\"Obama care.\\" And we got to get kids out of our failing schools, and that's where school choice would come in. Do you think that maybe this might be a moment where the Republican Party can pivot and kind of unite and say, Hey, we can make the country better. Here's our vision. Elect us, and we'll do those things. BRAT: Yes, I like all five of those, right? And instead, some of the Republicans are at the federal level putting together policies that the federal government -- I think they call making life work, these catchy little phrases to compete with Democrats for votes. And they're catchy, but I -- the strategy doesn't sound good to me. I don't think the federal government should be involved in making life work, right? I mean, the enumerated powers -- the state level is fine. The local level's fine. But not -- I do not want the federal government trying to make my life work. And so yes, I think those five you just mentioned, I'm in agreement with all five. And it -- with a caveat that I want to -- you know, everything delegated from the federal level back down to the state level to try and run those kind of programs. HANNITY: Yes. Let me -- let me ask one thing in terms of technicality here. I mean, you were up against what, a 5.5 million machine and I think I read that you had what, 200,000? HANNITY: That's a pretty significant disadvantage, wouldn't you say? BRAT: Yes. Well, and so, I mean, you just do the math with the numbers. The good news is dollars don't vote, and so people do. So I just paid attention to people. And people love to be involved in the political process. They love the ideas. And I just cannot thank the folks who helped me out enough. It was just tremendous support across the entire district. HANNITY: How would you identify yourself? And this is my last question. By the way, thank you for a lot of your time tonight. Two last questions. What do you want to say to Eric Cantor tonight? And as the Democrats now are going to work very hard, I assume, to position you as some extremist, how would you identify yourself politically, just those two final questions. BRAT: Yes, to Eric Cantor, throughout the entire race, I've always said I'm not running against Eric Cantor as a person. He's a fine person. But I just ran against him on the principles that I enumerated on my Web page, and I went through them methodically. And I think the Republican leadership were off course on those fundamental principles that I said are in the Republican creed. And they're on my Web pages till, and I encourage people to go to my Web page. I need some funds to compete against the Democrats coming up. It's DaveBratforcongress.com. And then the second question you said, how do I position myself against the Democrats who want to call me far right or -- I just recommend people like I do the press, that the press never took me up on this, they never reported on the facts. I wish they would do their jobs and report the news. Just look at my biography, right? I mean, I've been a conservative my whole life. There's nothing hard right or far right about anything. I just believe in ideas and that ideas matter in history. And that's my background and that's the way I would like to be portrayed. I highly doubt the press will take my counsel, but that's the way I would like to be portrayed. HANNITY: Well, if you Google me, if it's any consequence (sic), it's not the most flattering things that you'll read oftentimes. But this was a political earthquake tonight, and I think we're going to have you back on, hopefully, tomorrow night, Dave, if you can just stay on the line there. Thank you so much. Congratulations on what is a huge political earthquake. HANNITY: And this is a FOX News alert. Welcome back to HANNITY. And joining us once again, this time in person on camera, the man of the hour who defeated Eric Cantor tonight Dave Brat is back with us. Dave, good to see you now. DAVID BRAT, (R) BEAT ERIC CANTOR IN GOP VIRGINIA PRIMARY: Good to be with you, Sean, thanks. HANNITY: I want to go back, and this, as you know, is a political earthquake what has happened here tonight and is being viewed as such. What message should this send not only to the GOP, but Democrats as well? Democrats think, oh, this shows the Tea Party controls the Republican Party. Is it that or is it that maybe the country is looking for jobs and websites built by the government correctly not for 700 million, and for a V.A. that actually supports our vets. Which side do you think this is? BRAT: Yes. That's right. The American people are very interested in real ideas and moving beyond the sound bites, and so right now our political dialogue in the nation is just concerned with this right and left versus debate. And my entire campaign was built along a stump speech that took 20 minutes or so full of serious ideas, and the people resonated with that and they loved that. And so I had volunteers working endless hours for me and they paid attention. And the American people want to pay attention to serious ideas again. Our founding was built by people who were political philosophers, and we need to get back to that and away from this kind of cheap political rhetoric of right and left. I ran on free markets. I don't know those are right or left. I ran on rule of law, property rights. I ran on immigration. I don't think those are right and left issues. I think those are just free market, constitutional issues. HANNITY: You now will replace the House majority leader. Walk us through, if you can guide the Republican Party and I think you're going to have a pretty bigamy crow phone and a loud voice when you finally get to Washington, assuming you win the race, and I would think you have a very good chance. Let me ask this, what would you say? What direction do you want this party, your party, to go in that would help solve the country's problems? BRAT: Right, right. I don't think a lot of folks in D.C. understand what free markets are, so that's the most important piece. Fannie and Freddie made two-thirds of all subprime mortgages. That is not a free market institution. That entity along with the Fed printing too much money back in '03 and '04 caused the housing collapse. So we need to take free markets seriously. That means we have to put an end to all these tax credits and tax deductions and loopholes. Dave Camp had a good bill in which simplified the tax code and had a Reagan-esque 10 and 25 percent rate. That made sense and it was going to be pro-growth. It was going to produce one percent more economic growth. And so that will help us restore jobs. And closing the border is very important. I ran hard on that issue. First you've got to get your own house in order before you can help others, and we're out of control right now. On fiscal discipline our debt is over 17 trillion. The unfunded liabilities are 127 trillion. And no leader on either side is mentioning the biggest economic problems we have in the country right now, and I based my campaign on those numbers and a pledge to fix them. HANNITY: You're right, over 100 trillion in unfunded liabilities, 17 trillion in debt. Barack Obama then candidate said it was irresponsible and unpatriotic to have 9 trillion in debt. How would you deal with that issue? What would your alternative to Obamacare be? BRAT: Right. Well, on health care, it's obviously we've got to first separate the insurance issue from the health care issue. The health care costs are the most fundamental problem. And the reason there's a health care cost problem is just simple economics, is because the consumer has not seeing the full price of health care. Right, if you take your kid in for the sniffles you pay 20, but the full cost is 200. And so we need to get back to the price system where you see the full cost of health care, and then people will make smarter decisions. That will reduce health care costs, and it's a huge part of our economy. Instead we're centralizing top-down everything in the country right now, and the history of nations is the history of central governments run amuck. And United States exceptionalism has been to stay away from that tendency. It's easy to fall prey to solve everything at the federal level, but most every federal program is insolvent right now and everybody knows it. When I knocked on doors and said are we on the right track, and everybody said absolutely not. And so we need to change course and fix some big problems. HANNITY: I agree with you. I think in many ways we have huge problems aren't being addressed. I would like to see them addressed. Congratulations once again Dave Brat on what is a huge victory tonight. Appreciate your time.

Over the years, NFL kickers have continuously pushed the boundaries, making increasingly longer and more challenging field goals. This article takes an in-depth look at the longest field goal achieved to date, who made it, and what it took to attain this impressive feat. Step 1: Discuss the importance of the field goal and its role within American football. Field goals are an integral component of American football matches, offering teams the chance to score three points when they're unable to secure a touchdown. A field goal is made by kicking the ball through the 'U' shaped goalposts located at each end of the field. Generally attempted from within the opponent's 40-yard line, it requires a great deal of skill, precision, and strength to successfully make a field goal from long distances. Step 2: Introduce the field goal record and provide the crucial details. The longest field goal record in NFL history took place in 2013 and was made by Denver Broncos kicker Matt Prater. With a whopping distance of 64 yards, or approximately 58.5 meters, this field goal stands as an incredible testament to Prater's skill and power. The 64-yard field goal was achieve during a game against the Tennessee Titans at Sports Authority Field at Mile High, in Denver, Colorado. Step 3: Describe the previous record and its holder. Before Matt Prater achieved his record-breaking feat, the previous record had stood unbroken for over four decades. The 63-yard field goal was first accomplished by Tom Dempsey of the New Orleans Saints in 1970. Pioneering the way for future kickers, later on, notable names like Jason Elam, Sebastian Janikowski, and David Akers would go on to tie Dempsey's long-standing record. Step 4: Explain how field goals are affected by factors such as altitude and weather conditions. It is important to consider the environmental factors affecting field goals, particularly since they can significantly impact the outcome of any attempt. The altitude of the city where the game takes place, for example, can alter the ball's trajectory, with higher altitudes offering thinner air, and as a result, giving the ball a greater chance to travel greater distances. Denver, Colorado, the location of Matt Prater's record-breaking kick, sits at an altitude of over 5,000 feet above sea level, making it a suitable location for achieving long-distance field goals. Additionally, weather conditions such as wind, rain, and snow can either aid or impede field goal attempts. Step 5: Highlight the significance and impact of accomplishing such a feat. Breaking the longest field goal record is a critical sports achievement that showcases a kicker's talent, skill, and passion for the game. Such an accomplishment paves the way for future kickers to push beyond these limits, inspiring a new generation of talent. Moreover, record-breaking performances like Matt Prater's bring attention to the importance of the kicker's role within a team and how they contribute to the overall success of their team. Conclusion: With a spectacular distance of 64 yards, Matt Prater's 2013 field goal holds the record as the longest in NFL history, signifying the pinnacle of skill, determination, and power. As the game evolves and athletes continue to strive for excellence, the possibility of witnessing even more monumental moments in American football, such as new field goal records, remains palpable. As fans, we can only eagerly anticipate the next remarkable achievement that will etch itself in the annals of NFL history."},{"instruction":"This task is about creating an unanswerable question based on a given passage.

Q: Passage: While the number of cardinals was small from the times of the Roman Empire to the Renaissance, and frequently smaller than the number of recognized churches entitled to a cardinal priest, in the 16th century the College expanded markedly. In 1587, Pope Sixtus V sought to arrest this growth by fixing the maximum size of the College at 70, including 50 cardinal priests, about twice the historical number. This limit was respected until 1958, and the list of titular churches modified only on rare occasions, generally when a building fell into disrepair. When Pope John XXIII abolished the limit, he began to add new churches to the list, which Popes Paul VI and John Paul II continued to do. Today there are close to 150 titular churches, out of over 300 churches in Rome. A:","output":"What was the average size of the College of Cardinals during the Roman Empire?"},{"instruction":"Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the name of the painting that the auction house catalogue stated that it had been owned by William Ride, former director of the Western Australian Museum? , can you please find it? Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea.

For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory.

The earliest records of the Games go back to 776 B.C.. These contests were held every four years. They were important to the Greeks. When they took place, all wars were stopped. No one dared to break the truce of Olympic. Criers announced the names of winning athletes everywhere in the land. Artists made statues of them. Poets wrote about the Olympic heroes. The first Olympians raced the length of the stadium at Olympia--about 200 yards. But later other events were added:longer races, broad jumping, the javelin throw, the marathon race, and the discus throw. Then boxing, wrestling and horseback riding were also added. In the beginning, only Greeks competed in the Games. But in later centuries, athletes from other lands joined. In 146 B.C. the Romans conquered Greece. Soon the Games began to change. Under the Romans, they became rougher, wilder, and bloodier. Many professionals took part, which was against the spirit of the Olympics. Finally, Emperor Theodosius of Rome decided that the Olympics were a public danger. He died away with them after the Games of A.D. 392. They had lasted over 1,000 years. Fifteen hundred years passed. Then, in the 1890's, Baron Pierre de Coubertin of France began to interest nations in bringing the Games back. The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896. They have been held every four years since then, except during the two world wars. Question: The earliest recorded Olympic Games took place in _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"over 2,700 years ago\\"?

Unwillingly, she lifted him from the cage and threw him softly into the air. The lucky bird circled once, twice, three times. The girl watched delightedly at the bird. Her heart was no longer concerned with her loss. What she wanted to see was that the bird could fly happily. Suddenly the bird flew closer and landed softly on her shoulder.

The majority of teachers said that behavior management is the biggest challenge they face in teaching.They are against the idea of a \\"one size fits all\\" approach to behavior management and believe that how they deal with behavior depends on their analysis of what is driving the behavior.Many teachers make the analysis in three steps.First,observe what the student is doing;then look into what drives the behavior and finally identify what is the real problem to deal with,e.g.attention seeking or being unable to follow the lessons etc..However,many teachers felt it sometimes difficult as schools did not always effectively communicate the necessary information about the students for them to do it. The behaviors are generally divided into low,mid and high level.Teachers felt low and high level behavior was easy to analyze and deal with because low level behavior was seen as the least serious of a problem;and there is clear structure in place for dealing with high level behavior. However,there is no clear structure and effective ways to address midlevel behavior,which may cause a sense of failure in some teachers.

After Charles Mintz had unsuccessfully demanded that Disney accept a lower fee for producing the property, Mintz produced the films with his own group of animators. Instead, Disney and Iwerks created Mickey Mouse who in 1928 stared in the first \\"sync\\" sound animated short, Steamboat Willie. This moment effectively launched Walt Disney Studios' foothold, while Universal became a minor player in film animation. Universal subsequently severed its link to Mintz and formed its own in-house animation studio to produce Oswald cartoons headed by Walter Lantz. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): Who produced an Oswald the Lucky Rabbit motion picture?","output":"Charles Mintz produced an Oswald the Lucky Rabbit motion picture."},{"instruction":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What ship does the murderously unstable man hail from? , can you please find it? When contact with the USG Ishimura and the Aegis VII colony is lost, the Concordance Extraction Corporation sends the ship USG O'Bannon to investigate, but contact is lost with them as well. The Marine battleship Abraxis is sent next. Despite the carnage of Dead Space, four survivors are found: Nicholas Kuttner, a security officer; Alejandro Borgas, an engineer; Nolan Stross, chief science officer; and Isabella Cho, chief medical officer. The survivors are imprisoned in a holding cell while the ship is en route to the Sprawl, a station built on a shard of Titan. The head interrogator is told by the Overseer he has seven hours to get information from the survivors. Kuttner is interrogated first and gives his account of the events: he, Cho, Borgas, and Stross are assigned by the O'Bannon's commanding officer to stabilize the gravity on Aegis VII. Assisting are soldiers Rin and Sergenko, along with two additional engineers, Borgas' cousins Noah and Omar, a Unitologist. Campbell secretly tasks Kuttner's crew to bring back pieces of the Marker, which are worth millions of credits per kilo. The group land on Aegis VII, which is now unstable. While the engineers work the gravity stabilizer, Kuttner's crew separate. Kuttner finds a Marker shard, which causes a horrifying hallucination, making him murderously unstable. He damages the stabilizer before his teammates can tie him up in the shuttle. After finishing his interrogation Kuttner is able to escape and follows a phantom of Vivian out of an airlock, killing several marines.","output":"The murderously unstable man in the context of this text is Nicholas Kuttner, a security officer. According to the storyline shared above, the ship Nicholas Kuttner hails from is the USG O'Bannon. The USG O'Bannon is portrayed as a vessel sent by the Concordance Extraction Corporation to investigate after contact was lost with the USG Ishimura ship and the Aegis VII colony that it was associated with. The narrative indicates that Nicholas Kuttner, Alejandro Borgas (an engineer), Nolan Stross (chief science officer), and Isabella Cho (chief medical officer) are the survivors found on board the ship. Later, the crew of the O'Bannon lands on Aegis VII to stabilize its gravity but things go horribly wrong. It is during this mission that Kuttner becomes murderously unstable after finding a shard of the Marker, which seems to induce a horrifying hallucination in him. Thus, to answer the question, the murderously unstable man, Nicholas Kuttner, hails from the ship named USG O'Bannon."},{"instruction":"Koscielny agrees new Arsenal deal Updated Jul 24, 2012 9:47 AM ET Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny has agreed a new long-term contract with the Gunners. The 26-year-old France international joined Arsenal from Lorient in 2010 and has since established himself as a key member of Arsene Wenger's side. A statement on Arsenal's website read: \\"Arsenal football club is delighted to announce that Laurent Koscielny has agreed to sign a new long-term contract.\\" No details about the length of Koscielny's new contract were given. Koscielny has started 85 games for Arsenal over the last two years - no other player has started more at the club - and last year he earned his first call-up to the France squad. Since then, the former Guingamp and Tours centre-back has taken his tally of Les Bleus caps to four, the most recent of which came in the Euro 2012 quarter-final defeat to Spain, where he played the full 90 minutes in a 2-0 loss. Wenger said: \\"Laurent has been outstanding for us over the last two seasons. When you consider that until 2009 he was playing in Ligue 2 in France and that he is now performing at the very top level in the Premier League and for his country, the development that he has shown has been absolutely exceptional. \\"Laurent is a top-class player and I am very pleased he has decided to commit his future to the club.\\" Koscielny added: \\"I'm delighted to have reached agreement with the club. I have had a fantastic time here and look forward to an exciting future with Arsenal.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny has agreed to a new long-term contract with the club.

For example, maybe you both go to the same school, live in the same neighborhood, or both study the same subject. Finding these commonalities will make further conversation more interesting. For example, ask: “What part of the state did you grow up in?” “What’s your major in college?” Pay attention during your conversation, and note which types of topics the girl seems to enjoy most, or which she expresses an interest in. Then, bring these up again later to continue the conversation and learn more about the girl. For example, if you know that she likes art, you could deliberately steer the conversation towards famous painters. Or, if the girl mentions an interest in soccer, bring up your own favorite soccer players or teams. The girl you’re speaking to will not enjoy the conversation if her only answers to your questions are “yes” or “no,” as these answers can quickly become repetitive or boring. Instead, come up with some questions that ask her about her past or make her think, and that will result in a longer, more complex answer. Try asking something like: “What movie or book character are you most like?” “What are some of your irrational pet peeves?” “What is an unusual fear or phobia that you have?” If you’re in the early stages of chatting with a girl and looking for ways to continue the chat, do not bring up topics that could lead to serious disagreement. Don’t make the girl uncomfortable with probing questions about her exes or past relationships, and also avoid sharing strong opinions on politics. Of course, if you and this girl end up getting to know one another better, these types of topics can lead to important and serious conversation. Summary:","output":"When chatting with a girl who is a stranger or someone you barely know, focus on finding common interests to make the conversation engaging. Pay attention to topics she enjoys and revisit them later in the conversation. Avoid yes/no questions and instead ask open-ended questions that elicit longer, more thoughtful responses. Steer clear of potentially divisive topics and personal probing during early conversations. As you get to know each other better, more serious topics may become appropriate for discussion."},{"instruction":"Question: Alex packed Aubrey's car while she made sure the house was locked up. Given the context: Why did Alex do this? Possible answers: did this to get home, did this be prepared, did this to find the suitcase Answer:","output":"Alex did this to be prepared. Step 1: Understand the context - In this situation, Alex and Aubrey seem to be leaving a house. Step 2: Identify the task - Alex packed Aubrey's car. Step 3: Identify the potential reasons for the task - The possible answers provided are: to get home, to be prepared, and to find the suitcase. Step 4: Evaluate each possibility: a) To get home: While packing the car might ultimately lead to going home, packing the car itself doesn't directly indicate that Alex's goal is specifically to get home. b) To be prepared: Since packing a car typically involves being ready for a trip or journey, this answer makes sense given the context. Alex packed the car while Aubrey locked the house, suggesting it's part of their preparation to leave. c) To find the suitcase: There is no mention of a suitcase being lost or searched for in the context provided. Packing the car wouldn't necessarily imply that Alex is looking for a suitcase. Step 5: Select the most likely reason - Based on the context and the evaluation of each possibility, the most likely reason for Alex's action is to be prepared."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],R={key:0},E={key:1};function N(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
