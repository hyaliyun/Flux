A hand opens a book, signed by Sherlock Holmes, and dated 9 May, 1894. It briefly explains that Professor Moriarty is a most dangerous criminal. The criminal case of Professor Moriarty (George Zucco) is completed, and due to a lack of evidence, he is found not guilty. The Justice of the Court (Holmes Herbert) is appalled and says, \\"It is undoubtedly a gross miscarriage of justice.\\" Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) bursts into the packed courtroom with new evidence against Moriarty, but he is too late. Holmes exits the courthouse and the Professor is waiting for him. They share a cab to 221B Baker Street. Moriarty gloats and provides Holmes with a challenge. He boasts that he will commit the crime of the century and Holmes will be discredited.At the Professor's home, Moriarty tends to some flowers in the greenhouse. A South American musician plays what will later be determined to be an Inca Funeral dirge. The butler, Dawes (Frank Dawson) replies to summons and tells his boss that Mr. Bassick has arrived. Bassick (Arthur Hohl) enters the study and is handed a letter to post. Curiosity, on the part of Bassick, provides a few more clues to the crime of the century, one of which, involves Sir Ronald Ramsgate, Constable of the Tower of London. After Bassick leaves, Moriarty turns his wrath on Dawes for not watering his plants.In Sherlock Holmes' room at Baker Street, he is plucking at a violin trying to find the note that will act as a fly repellant. Mrs. Hudson (Mary Gordon) removes the tea service. She gives Billy (Terry Kilburn) his cleaning instructions.

This task demands understanding of various physical components and their properties, as well as how they interact in order to create a functional and stable structure. 1. Identification and recognition of components: Prior to commencing the task, it is vital to identify the different pieces included in the package. These typically encompass wooden panels, screws, fastening devices, brackets, and pegs, which come in varying shapes and sizes. Familiarity with their material properties, such as the strength and flexibility of the wood and metal parts, is also needed. Some components may have specific markings or labels, indicating their particular use or installation orientation. 2. Comprehension of instructions: Assembling furniture entails following a step-by-step guide, which often incorporates visual diagrams. The builder must interpret these illustrations and comprehend the represented physical objects, as well as understand how they fit together. For instance, the instructions might depict a wooden panel with pre-drilled holes that align with the brackets on another piece. 3. Assembly process: The task requires the use of both hand and power tools, so a certain amount of skill and craftsmanship will be necessary to ensure that the individual parts are securely connected. Basic knowledge of tools such as screwdrivers, allen wrenches, and hammers, as well as their appropriate application to the various assembly steps, is mandatory. 4. Spatial awareness and alignment: One of the essential aspects of this task is being able to visualize and manipulate the physical objects in three-dimensional space. This skill helps in properly aligning and connecting the individual components, guaranteeing that the final structure is level, balanced, and stable. For example, bracket and screw placements must be accurate to prevent instability or unevenness in the finished bookshelf. 5. Problem-solving and adaptation: Unexpected complications can arise during furniture assembly, such as a missing screw or pre-drilled hole being too small. The person performing the task must possess the ability to troubleshoot and adapt to such issues by either finding alternative solutions or making adjustments to the component as needed. This might entail drilling a new hole or finding suitable replacement hardware. In conclusion, assembling a piece of furniture like a bookshelf necessitates the knowledge of the physical objects and their properties, understanding how they interact with one another, and having the skill to manipulate them effectively to create a functional and stable structure. It is a task that not only tests practical abilities but also requires spatial awareness, problem-solving, and improvisation when facing unexpected challenges."},{"instruction":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Heath Ledger is the poet, Dan is a pretty good con man and works a nice credit card scheme that keeps the cash coming in at a steady rate- for awhile. Then, of course, their luck runs out and it comes down to lying, stealing and manipulating Candy's family for money. Soon, as Dan and Candy sink further and further into a horrific heroin addiction; it comes down to prostitution, degradation and then withdrawal. This is ultimately a very sad story with a bittersweet ending. Dan's devotion to Candy is shown when the two suffer through horrible heroin withdrawal only to decide that they cannot quit the drug cold turkey and turn to methadone. Dan moves them to the country and takes on some menial labor jobs for money to put food on the table. Candy doesn't work and soon becomes more and more depressed and lonely; hanging out and smoking pot with a neighbor. Her behavior becomes more and more erratic and before long she flees the country.

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.

Although the statement does not explicitly say that the man is riding the bike, we can deduce that the man is indeed riding the bike based on certain clues. To analyze the situation, let's break down the statement into smaller elements: 1. \\"A man in spandex\\": This phrase establishes that there is a person involved who is wearing spandex, a stretchy fabric commonly used in tight-fitting athletic wear. It suggests that the man might be engaged in some physical activity or sport. 2. \\"maneuvers\\": The verb \\"maneuver\\" means to skillfully guide or navigate something through a complex or intricate situation. In this context, it implies the man is actively and precisely controlling the bike to achieve a specific outcome. 3. \\"his bike\\": This part of the statement indicates that the man possesses and is using a bike. The implication of possession suggests that the man is using the bike for its intended purpose or functionality. 4. \\"over an obstacle\\": This phrase indicates that there is some challenge or barrier that the man is working to overcome using the bike. It further strengthens the notion that the man is engaged in some physical activity or sport, as overcoming obstacles is often a component of various athletic disciplines. Taking these elements together, we can infer that the man is indeed riding the bike. The presence of the obstacle provides context that the man is actively engaged in navigating his bike and overcoming challenges. The use of the term \\"maneuver\\" further supports the idea that the man is in control of the bike as he navigates it through a potentially intricate or difficult situation. Moreover, wearing spandex implies that the man is dressed for a physically demanding activity, which also corroborates the conclusion that the man is riding his bike. In conclusion, based on the context and indirect clues provided in the statement, we can reasonably deduce that \\"a man is riding his bike\\" when \\"A man in spandex maneuvers his bike over an obstacle.\\""},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in English.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: First, let's consider the concept of time travel. Time travel, as popularized by science fiction, is the concept of moving between different points in time, either backward or forward. Now, let's focus on the idea of going back in time to change the course of history. Many scientists and researchers have proposed theories for time travel, such as utilizing wormholes or the general theory of relativity. However, the feasibility of these theories in a practical sense is still uncertain. Another point to consider is the potential paradoxes that may arise from changing the past. The grandfather paradox is a famous example in which going back in time to prevent a specific event, such as your grandfather's birth, would prevent your own existence, creating a contradiction. In addition to paradoxes, the multiple timeline theory suggests that even if an individual were able to travel back and change an event, it would only create an alternate timeline, leaving the original timeline untouched. This means that, in effect, you would not see the results of your actions in your own timeline. In conclusion, while the idea of time travel is thrilling and entertaining, the current understanding of physics, the potential paradoxes, and the idea of multiple timeline theory suggest that it is not possible to travel back in time and change the course of history.

Translate this to English?","output":"As the current strategy is based on a long-term strategic vision, the results must also be quantified in the long term. This statement emphasizes the importance of having a long-term strategic vision when implementing a current strategy. In any organization or project, having a clear and well-defined strategy allows for better planning and decision-making processes. It ensures that all the steps taken are aligned with the ultimate goals and objectives of the organization. When a strategy is based on a long-term vision, it means that the organization is considering not only its immediate needs and goals but also the future prospects. This long-term perspective allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the complex factors that can affect the success of the strategy. These factors can include economic trends, technological advancements, and changes in the industry landscape. Furthermore, this statement highlights the importance of quantifying the results of a long-term strategy. Quantifying the results means measuring and evaluating the outcomes of the strategic actions taken by the organization. This may involve collecting data, establishing key performance indicators (KPIs), or even conducting cost-benefit analyses to determine the return on investments made in pursuing the strategy. Quantifying the results of the long-term strategic vision enables the organization to assess the success of the current strategy, learn from its past experiences, and make necessary adjustments to improve future outcomes. It also helps the organization communicate its progress and achievements to stakeholders, such as investors or shareholders, who may have a specific interest in the long-term prospects of the organization. In summary, having a long-term strategic vision and quantifying the results in the same timeframe are essential components of an effective strategy. This approach ensures that an organization takes a comprehensive view of its goals and objectives, allowing for better planning and decision-making. By measuring and evaluating the outcomes, organizations can learn, adapt and improve their strategies, leading to better long-term performance and success."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What key details about bohdan ejmont can be extracted from the following bio?

You both think the other is too good for you . Question: What is the reason Travis is worried of rejection ?","output":"Travis's worry of rejection could stem from several factors, including his perception of self-worth, past experiences, and fear of vulnerability. A detailed analysis of these factors might better explain why Travis is concerned about facing rejection from Patrick. 1. Low self-esteem: Travis's belief that Patrick is \\"too good for him\\" suggests that he may have a low self-esteem or self-worth. This perception may make Travis think that he is not deserving or worthy of Patrick's love and affection. Consequently, this fear of not measuring up to what he believes Patrick deserves can result in Travis being afraid of being rejected. 2. Past experiences: Travis's fear of rejection could also be influenced by his past experiences of relationships or rejections. These experiences may have conditioned Travis to expect negative outcomes when expressing his feelings or pursuing a romantic relationship. If he has faced several instances of rejection in the past, he might be hesitant to take the risk of being rejected again. 3. Fear of vulnerability: Expressing one's feelings, especially when it comes to love, requires an individual to be vulnerable. Travis may fear being vulnerable in front of Patrick, as this act of openness may leave him emotionally exposed and at risk of getting hurt. The fear of vulnerability could fuel Travis's concerns about rejection, as he may not want to face the pain that could potentially come with it. 4. Insecurity about his emotions: Travis may also be worried about the intensity or genuineness of his feelings for Patrick. He may question if his emotions are valid or strong enough to warrant the risk of expressing them to Patrick. This insecurity could lead Travis to doubt himself and, in turn, become anxious about the possibility of rejection. 5. Social anxiety or pressure: Social expectations and pressures can also play a significant role in Travis's fear of rejection. He may be concerned about how others might perceive him or the potential relationship with Patrick, adding an additional layer of anxiety and preventing him from taking the risk. 6. Attachment style: Travis's attachment style could also be contributing to his fear of rejection. If he has an avoidant attachment style, he may subconsciously push away emotional closeness to protect himself. This may lead him to worry about the consequences of pursuing a relationship with Patrick, including the possibility of rejection. In conclusion, Travis's worry of rejection is likely a complex issue arising from a combination of factors such as low self-esteem, past experiences, fear of vulnerability, insecurity about his emotions, social pressure, and his attachment style. Understanding and addressing these underlying issues can help Travis gain the confidence and assurance needed to approach Patrick and express his feelings without being held back by the fear of rejection."},{"instruction":"Pick your answer from: (i) negative; (ii) positive; Short movie review: a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs -- sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"The critic is thinking (ii) positively of the movie.

What is this text about?","output":"This text is about a baseball exhibition game that took place between a team of Major League Baseball (MLB) players from the United States and a team of Japanese All-Stars. In this specific game, which was the fourth in a series of eight, the MLB players emerged victorious with a final score of 7-2. A key contributor to the win was Moises Alou, who played an instrumental role in securing the victory for his team. Moises Alou, an accomplished MLB player, managed to drive in two crucial runs during the first inning of the game. He achieved this through a timely single hit with the bases loaded, meaning that there were runners on all three bases when he came up to bat. This hit allowed two of these runners to advance and score, giving the MLB team an early lead in the match. This strong start provided significant momentum for the MLB players, who managed to maintain their advantage throughout the game and ultimately secured the win with a five-run margin. The context of this exhibition series is important to consider, as it highlights the friendly nature of the competition and serves as a showcase of baseball talent from both nations. The fact that these games are being played outside of the regular season allows the participating athletes to perhaps try new strategies and techniques, as well as to foster camaraderie and goodwill among players from different leagues and nations. In conclusion, this text describes a baseball game in which the MLB players defeated the Japanese All-Stars by a score of 7-2, with Moises Alou contributing significantly to this success through his actions in the first inning.

Here is a more detailed breakdown on how to choose coloured contacts for dark-skinned girls: 1. Research: Begin by gathering information about the types and varieties of coloured contact lenses available in the market. This includes learning about the difference between opaque lenses, which are designed to completely cover your natural eye color, and enhancement lenses, which work to accentuate your natural eye color. 2. Establish your purpose: Determine the main reason for using coloured contacts. Are they meant for daily wear, special occasions, or purely for cosmetic reasons? Your purpose will influence several factors, such as the desired color and style of the lenses and the duration you intend to wear them. 3. Consult an eye care professional: Before buying any coloured contacts, it's crucial to consult an eye care professional for proper fitting and recommendations. They can also help you identify if you need prescription lenses and assess whether certain materials are compatible with your eyes, thereby reducing the risk of eye irritation or infections. 4.

The dominant figure of Canadian Confederation, he had a political career which spanned almost half a century. He drank heavily, and in 1873 was voted out during the Pacific Scandal, in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Pacific Railway. Macdonald's greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion, using patronage to forge a strong Conservative Party, promoting the protective tariff of the National Policy, and building the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway. Economic growth was slow during his years in office, as Canada verged on stagnation; many residents migrated to the fast-growing United States. He fought to block provincial efforts to take power back from Ottawa. His most controversial move was to approve the execution of Métis leader Louis Riel for treason in 1885; it alienated many Francophones. - Charles Joseph \\"Joe\\" Clark, (born June 5, 1939) is a Canadian statesman, businessman, writer, and politician who served as the 16th Prime Minister of Canada, from June 4, 1979, to March 3, 1980. - Joseph Philippe Pierre Yves Elliott Trudeau (; October 18, 1919 September 28, 2000), better known as Pierre Trudeau or Pierre Elliott Trudeau, was a Canadian politician who served as the 15th Prime Minister of Canada from 19681979 and 19801984.

Mantle played his entire Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the New York Yankees as a center fielder and first baseman, from 1951 through 1968. Mantle was one of the best players and sluggers, and is regarded by many as the greatest switch hitter in baseball history. Mantle was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974 and was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. Mantle was invited to the Yankees instructional camp before the 1951 season. After an impressive spring training, Yankees manager Casey Stengel decided to promote Mantle to the majors as a right fielder instead of sending him to the minors. Mickey Mantle's salary for the 1951 season was 7,500. Mantle was assigned uniform #6, signifying the expectation that he would become the next Yankees star, following Babe Ruth (#3), Lou Gehrig (#4) and Joe DiMaggio (#5). Stengel, speaking to SPORT, stated \\"He's got more natural power from both sides than anybody I ever saw.\\" Bill Dickey called Mantle \\"the greatest prospect [he's] seen in [his] time.\\" After a brief slump, Mantle was sent down to the Yankees' top farm team, the Kansas City Blues. However, he was not able to find the power he once had in the lower minors. Out of frustration, he called his father one day and told him, \\"I don't think I can play baseball anymore.\\" Mutt drove up to Kansas City that day. When he arrived, he started packing his son's clothes and, according to Mantle's memory, said \\"I thought I raised a man. I see I raised a coward instead. You can come back to Oklahoma and work the mines with me.\\" Mantle immediately broke out of his slump, going on to hit .361 with 11 homers and 50 RBIs during his stay in Kansas City. Mantle was called up to the Yankees after 40 games with Kansas City, this time wearing uniform #7. He hit .267 with 13 home runs and 65 RBI in 96 games. In the second game of the 1951 World Series, New York Giants rookie Willie Mays hit a fly ball to right-center field. Mantle, playing right field, raced for the ball together with center fielder Joe DiMaggio, who called for the ball (and made the catch). In getting out of DiMaggio's way, Mantle tripped over an exposed drain pipe and severely injured his right knee. This was the first of numerous injuries that plagued his 18-year career with the Yankees. He played the rest of his career with a torn ACL. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he get injured any other time","output":"Yes, Mickey Mantle faced numerous injuries throughout his 18-year career with the Yankees. The first significant injury occurred in the second game of the 1951 World Series when he tripped over an exposed drain pipe and severely injured his right knee, resulting in a torn ACL. This incident marked the beginning of a series of injuries that would plague Mantle's baseball career. However, despite these setbacks, he is still regarded as one of the best players and sluggers in the history of baseball."},{"instruction":"Возможно, вам потребуется установить Outlook и Exchange на один компьютер в демонстрационных целях.

It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a \\"social science\\". The main social sciences include economics, political science, human geography, demography, and sociology. In a wider sense, social science also includes some fields in the humanities such as anthropology, archaeology, jurisprudence, history, and linguistics. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century. A more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences can be found at Outline of social science. - Brigham Young University (often referred to as BYU or, colloquially, The Y) is a private research university in Provo, Utah, United States. It is owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and excluding online students, is the largest of any religious university and the third largest private university in the United States, with 29,672 on-campus students. Approximately 99 percent of the students are members of the LDS Church, and one-third of its US students are from Utah. - Psychology of religion consists of the application of psychological methods and interpretive frameworks to religious traditions, as well as to both religious and irreligious individuals. It attempts to accurately describe the details, origins, and uses of religious beliefs and behaviors. Although the psychology of religion first arose as a self-conscious discipline as recently as the late 19th century, all three of these tasks have a history going back many centuries before that. - Anthropology is the study of various aspects of humans within past and present societies. Social anthropology and cultural anthropology study the norms and values of societies. Linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life. Biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans. - Theology is the critical study of the nature of the divine. It is taught as an academic discipline, typically in universities, seminaries and schools of divinity. - A religious experience (sometimes known as a spiritual experience, sacred experience, or mystical experience) is a subjective experience which is interpreted within a religious framework. The concept originated in the 19th century, as a defense against the growing rationalism of Western society. William James popularised the concept. - An academic or scholarly journal is a periodical publication in which scholarship relating to a particular academic discipline is published. Academic journals serve as permanent and transparent forums for the presentation, scrutiny and discussion of research. They are usually peer-reviewed or refereed. Content typically takes the form of articles presenting original research, review articles, and book reviews. The purpose of an academic journal, according to the first editor of the world's oldest academic journal Henry Oldenburg, is to give researchers a venue to \\"impart their knowledge to one another, and contribute what they can to the Grand design of improving natural knowledge, and perfecting all Philosophical Arts, and Sciences.\\" - The Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion (\\"J Sci Study Relig\\", also sometimes abbreviated as \\"JSSR\\") is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal published by Wiley-Blackwell in the United States of America under the auspices of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, dedicated to publishing scholarly articles in the social sciences, including psychology, sociology and anthropology, devoted to the study of religion. It is not a theology journal, as its publications tend to be empirical papers in the aforementioned disciplines, rather than papers assessing the truth or falsity, or otherwise attempting to clarify, theological doctrines. However, the eminent theologian Paul Tillich wrote a preface to the first edition, published in 1961. A former editor, Ralph W. Hood, is a major name in the psychology of religion, having published scales to assess religious experience and mystical experience. Hood was succeeded as editor in 1999 by Ted Jelen, the first ever political scientist to edit the journal. Jelen was later succeeded as editor by sociologist Rhys Williams. The current editor of the journal is Laura Olson (Clemson University). - The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the LDS Church or, informally, the Mormon Church) is a Christian restorationist church that is considered by its followers to be the restoration of the original church founded by Jesus Christ. The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and has established congregations and built temples worldwide. According to the church, it has over 74,000 missionaries and a membership of over 15 million. It is ranked by the National Council of Churches as the fourth-largest Christian denomination in the United States. It is the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith during the period of religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening. - The term social order can be used in two senses. In the first sense, it refers to a particular set or system of linked social structures, institutions, relations, customs, values and practices, which conserve, maintain and enforce certain patterns of relating and behaving. Examples are the ancient, the feudal, and the capitalist social order. In the second sense, social order is contrasted to social chaos or disorder, and refers to a stable state of society in which the existing social order is accepted and maintained by its members. The problem of order or Hobbesian problem, which is central to much of sociology, political science and political philosophy, is the question how and why it is that social orders exist at all. - Psychology is the study of behavior and mind, embracing all aspects of conscious and unconscious experience as well as thought. It is an academic discipline and a social science which seeks to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases. In this field, a professional or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive scientist. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors. Psychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including perception, cognition, attention, emotion (affect), intelligence, phenomenology, motivation (conation), brain functioning, and personality. This extends to interaction between people, such as interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind. Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In addition, or in opposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, someespecially clinical and counseling psychologistsat times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques. Psychology has been described as a \\"hub science\\", with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, humanities, and philosophy. While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts psychology ultimately aims to benefit society. The majority of psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing in clinical, counseling, or school settings. Many do scientific research on a wide range... - The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion (founded in 1949) was formed to advance research in the social scientific perspective on religious institutions and experiences. - Sociology is the study of social behaviour or society, including its origins, development, organization, networks, and institutions. It is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about social order, disorder, and change. Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the micro-sociology level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social structure. - Welfare is the provision of a minimal level of well-being and social support for citizens without current means to support basic needs. In most developed countries, welfare is largely provided by the government from tax income, and to a lesser extent by charities, informal social groups, religious groups, and inter-governmental organizations. - Brigham Young (June 1, 1801August 29, 1877) was an American leader in the Latter Day Saint movement and a settler of the Western United States. He was the second President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1847 until his death in 1877. He founded Salt Lake City and he served as the first governor of the Utah Territory. Young also led the foundings of the precursors to the University of Utah and Brigham Young University. - Marie Cornwall ( born 1949 ) is the editor of the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion , a professor of sociology and women 's studies at Brigham Young University ( BYU ) and a former director of BYU 's Women 's Research Institute . - Paul Johannes Tillich (August 20, 1886 October 22, 1965) was a German American Christian existentialist philosopher and theologian who is widely regarded as one of the most influential theologians of the twentieth century. - Clemson University is an American public, coeducational, land-grant and sea-grant research university in Clemson, South Carolina.

The noodles soups are top notch, especially the Hot Pot seafood soup, as well as the simply delicious in a bowl, Roasted Pork noodle soup with ramen.

My friend and I, shared two starters, the Smoked \\"Pig Face\\" dumplings and the Peking Duck bun. The dumplings were scrumptious because of the pork, yum but i'm not sure if the price is justified at 8 for 4 pieces, it's pretty much the size of a gyoza dumpling, so, it's not large but taste factor it's on point.

Not terrible or hateful or anything, just forgettable. It had a sort of, um, hesitant, diluted air, like it never properly knew whether it wanted to go for laughs or for sweetness or for satire. So we were left with weak mix of the three. The actors seemed kinda lost. Also, the ideas were really tired and recycled, almost zombified themselves. How many more times do we have to be told the 50's in the States were infected with a banal sense of conformity? And that this was perpetuated by aggressive consumerism? And that emotional repression in men is a baaaaad thing? Old hat. Its biggest crime in my eyes though was just how detached from reality it was. I know it was a comedy and all, but - especially in a full movie where you must keep the interest of an audience for a prolonged period - you still need some sort of emotional anchor, some relatable guide through the story, to make it engaging. For the 'hero' kid to watch an old woman, two fellow school pupils and ultimately his father die painfully at the hands of zombies or whatever and for him to greet it all with a cheery smile and a shrug of the shoulders, then I just struggle to deal with that in any sort of positive way. The mum was the same. If you make your two main characters so inhuman on that level, then you risk losing me and that's what happened. Biggest positive I can offer is that I love the look of that sort of apple pie suburbia and this captured it well enough, it was a handsome film, especially some of those wide angled shots of the street and inside the Robinsons' house. Also, the opening newsreel was cute, in a been-done-before-but-still-funny sort of way. And I thought Billy Connolly was OK and that comes from someone who isn't a big fan of Billy Connolly: Movie Star. I just had this fear he was going to be hamming it up and trying to steal every scene, but he played it pretty low-key for him and probably came out the most sympathetic character in the whole film.

Please remove spaces between words.","output":"Inthesocialisttradeunionsallthoseleadingelementswhichtoanydegreerepresentedtheindependenceofthetradeunionmovementwerepushedout. To elaborate on the initial statement, under a socialist regime, trade unions often experience a suppression or elimination of their independence. This is because these political systems emphasize centralized control and decision-making, which can be at odds with the decentralized and autonomous nature of labor unions. In a socialist society, the government plays a significant role in the management and regulation of the economy. This means that the state may also exert considerable influence over trade unions, aiming to ensure that they align with official policies and goals. The government's intervention in labor relations can be achieved through various means, such as legal and institutional mechanisms, participation in the administration of trade unions, or controlling the selection and appointment of union leaders. As a result, independence and autonomy may be compromised within socialist trade unions. The leading elements within these organizations, which advocate for and embody the democratic and self-governing nature of the labor movement, may find themselves sidelined or removed from positions of power. This can manifest in several ways: 1. Purging and replacing independent-minded leaders: Socialist governments might systematically expel those individuals who are seen as challenging or opposing the state's authority and replace them with party loyalists or ideologues. 2. Restricting or abolishing democratic practices: The government can impose structural changes within trade unions that undermine the democratic processes essential to their functioning, such as regular elections, open debates, and member participation in decision-making. 3. Merging or dismantling unions: In order to exert greater control over the labor movement, the state might decide to merge smaller, autonomous unions into larger, more centralized bodies. This can lead to the dissolution of independent unions and the subsequent subsuming of their members and interests under the guise of larger, state-controlled organizations. 4. Suppressing dissent and opposition: The government may resort to more forceful tactics, such as intimidation, surveillance, or outright repression against labor activists and organizers who challenge the state's control over the trade union movement. 5. Limiting the scope and influence of trade unions: By restricting the legal and political powers of trade unions, a socialist government can effectively limit their ability to engage in collective bargaining, organize strikes, or pursue other forms of labor activism. Despite these obstacles, socialist trade unions can still potentially play significant roles in the struggle for workers' rights and social justice. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that under such systems, the independence and autonomy of trade unions may be at risk, and considerable efforts must be made to safeguard and nurture the democratic and emancipatory potential of the labor movement."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question.

Ventura was born James George Janos on July 15, 1951 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of George William Janos and his wife, Bernice Martha (nee Lenz). Both of his parents were World War II veterans. Ventura has an older brother who served in the Vietnam War. Ventura has described himself as Slovak, since his father's parents were from what is now Slovakia; his mother was of German descent. After the legislature refused to increase spending for security, Ventura attracted criticism when he decided not to live in the governor's mansion during his tenure, choosing instead to shut it down and stay at his home in Maple Grove. Critics pointed to the loss of jobs for several working-class people at the mansion and the extra cost of reopening the mansion later. In 1999, a group of disgruntled citizens petitioned to recall Governor Ventura, alleging, among other things, that \\"the use of state security personnel to protect the governor on a book promotion tour constituted illegal use of state property for personal gain.\\" The petition was denied. The proposed petition was dismissed by order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Minnesota. Under Minnesota law, a proposed petition for recall is required to be reviewed by the Chief Justice for legal sufficiency, and, upon such review, the Chief Justice determined that it did not allege the commission of any act that violated Minnesota law. Ventura sought attorney's fees as a sanction for the filing of a frivolous petition for recall, but that request was denied, on the ground that there was no statutory authority for such an award. In November 2011, Ventura held a press conference in relation to a lawsuit he had filed against the Transportation Security Administration. During that press conference, Ventura stated that he would \\"never stand for a national anthem again, I will turn my back and raise a fist the same way Tommy Smith and John Carlos did in the '68 Olympics, Jesse Ventura will do that today.\\" During his tenure as governor, Ventura drew frequent fire from the press in the Twin Cities. He referred to reporters as \\"media jackals,\\" a term that even appeared on the press passes required to enter the governor's press area. Shortly after Ventura's election as governor, author and humorist Garrison Keillor wrote a satirical book about the event, spoofing Ventura as \\"Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente,\\" a self-aggrandizing former \\"Navy W.A.L.R.U.S. (Water Air Land Rising Up Suddenly)\\" turned professional wrestler turned politician. Initially, Ventura responded angrily to the satire, but later, in a conciliatory vein, said that Keillor \\"makes Minnesota proud\\". During his term, Ventura appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, in which he responded controversially to the following question: \\"So which is the better city of the Twin Cities, Minneapolis or St. Paul?\\". Ventura responded, \\"Minneapolis. Those streets in St. Paul must have been designed by drunken Irishmen\\". He later apologized for the remark, adding that it was not intended to be taken seriously.","output":"This text is about James George Janos, better known as Jesse Ventura. He was born on July 15, 1951, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Ventura is a former professional wrestler, actor, and politician who served as the 38th Governor of Minnesota from 1999 to 2003.

David Maume, a sociologist and sleep researcher, analyzed federal health data, which interviewed 974 teenagers when they were 12, and then again at 15. He found that family dynamics have much to do with how well kids sleep. Teens, who had warm relations with their parents and felt like they could talk to them or their parents were supportive of them, tended to sleep better. However, families that were going through a divorce or a remarriage tended to affect teens' sleep. And problems at school also affected teens' sleep. Feeling safe at school and having good relations with teachers tended to promote better sleep. As did good relationships with friends. Kids who took part in sports or other positive social activities or shared similar academic goals with their friends were also more likely to get a good night's sleep. These add up to what makes lots of sense: a general feeling of well-being helps teens sleep. If we're happy and contented, we're much more likely to sleep better than if we're sad and anxious. Now, of course, teens can hardly resist being drawn to their computers and social networking. Maume also found that when parents were strict not only about bedtime, but also about limiting technology, kids slept better. It's a finding that seems obvious, but parents really do matter when it comes to health habits of their teenagers. Clearly, teenagers aren't getting 9 to 10 hours a night, which puts them at risk for all the consequences of lack of sleep, including poor academic performance, colds and stress.

Jason Granger, from Yuma, Arizona, was killed just before noon on Friday after he made a hard landing, according to the coroner's report. Police in the city of Perris responded at around 11:20 a.m. to reports of an air emergency at the popular skydiving site of Perris Valley airport. They arrived to find Granger, an Army skydiver who trained other jumpers, suffering serious injuries after a parachuting accident. Tragic: Jason Granger, pictured with his family, from Yuma, Arizona, was killed just before noon on Friday after he made a hard landing, according to the coroner's report. Paramedics rushed the man to Menifee Valley Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 12:17 p.m. Perris Valley Skydiving general manager Dan Brodsky-Chenfeld told the Press Enterprise the man was coming in for a landing when he made a turn at low altitude. Such turns increase a jumper's speed and are prohibited below 300 feet at that drop zone for that reason, Brodsky-Chenfeld said. He said he didn't know Granger's elevation when he turned, but it was very low. Injuries: Granger, pictured left and right, was an Army skydiver who trained other jumpers.

By stating that they cannot stand Americans who \\"pretend to know everything about Japan and Japanese people/culture,\\" the narrator highlights their irritation with those who act in a superior or self-important manner without sufficient experience or knowledge about Japan. In this context, the narrator also makes an effort to distance themselves from this group of pretentious Americans, implying that they have some level of genuine experience with Japanese culture. This self-awareness allows them to maintain a level of authenticity and credibility in their own encounters in Japan, as opposed to assuming a know-it-all attitude that can irritate locals and fellow Americans alike. In addition, the narrator mentions their enjoyment of previous visits to Japanese schools, further emphasizing their sincere interest and experience in Japanese culture. It is important to note that the narrator does not dismiss or express anger towards all Americans – just those who exhibit a particularly arrogant or misguided understanding of Japan. Overall, the narrator's frustration stems from witnessing or experiencing the consequences of cultural ignorance or pretentiousness that some Americans display towards Japan. As someone who seems to appreciate the value of authentic engagement and cultural understanding, the narrator is likely irritated by those who undermine the genuine and meaningful experiences that others, like themselves, strive to foster."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given this review: \\"It is awesome I have never seen something better than this\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

The term \\"Viking metal\\" has sometimes been used as a nickname for the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, which was \\"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies\\". It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial. Thus, Viking metal is more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a certain sound. Ashby and Schofield write that \\"The term 'Viking metal' is one of many that falls within a complex web of genres and subgenres, the precise form of which is constantly... Answer:","output":"Viking metal is influenced by three primary genres: black metal, folk metal, and death metal. Black metal serves as the foundation for the harsh and aggressive sound that characterizes Viking metal, with its fast tempos, shrieking vocals, and chaotic instrumentals. Folk metal contributes the incorporation of traditional Nordic instruments and melodies, adding a distinct cultural element to the music. Finally, death metal plays a role in shaping Viking metal through the use of heavy guitar riffs, growling vocals, and themes related to Viking mythology and history. While Viking metal is primarily defined by its thematic and imagery content, these three genres are crucial in shaping its unique sound."},{"instruction":"Question: It is a very nice Sunday morning.

The Angevin kings of England became Dukes of Aquitaine after Henry II married the former Queen of France, Eleanor of Aquitaine, in 1152, from which point the lands were held in vassalage to the French crown. By the 13th century the terms Aquitaine, Guyenne and Gascony were virtually synonymous. At the beginning of Edward III's reign on 1 February 1327, the only part of Aquitaine that remained in his hands was the Duchy of Gascony. The term Gascony came to be used for the territory held by the Angevin Kings of England in southwest France, although they still used the title Duke of Aquitaine. For the first 10 years of Edward III's reign, Gascony had been a major point of friction. The English argued that, as Charles IV had not acted in a proper way towards his tenant, Edward should be able to hold the duchy free of any French suzerainty. This argument was rejected by the French, so in 1329, the 17-year-old Edward III paid homage to Philip VI. Tradition demanded that vassals approach their liege unarmed with heads bare. Edward protested by attending the ceremony wearing his crown and sword. Even after this pledge of homage, the French continued to pressure the English administration. Gascony was not the only sore point. One of Edward's influential advisers was Robert III of Artois. Robert was an exile from the French court, having fallen out with Philip VI over an inheritance claim. He urged Edward to start a war to reclaim France, and was able to provide extensive intelligence on the French court. Question: What year did the province of Guyenne and Gascony become held by the French? Answer:","output":"The province of Guyenne and Gascony became held by the French crown after the marriage of Henry II, who became Duke of Aquitaine, to Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152. However, it is essential to understand that this territory was held in vassalage, meaning that the Angevin kings of England had control over the region but still owed allegiance to the French crown. The French influence persisted through the centuries, even during Edward III's reign throughout the 14th century."},{"instruction":"Information: - San Diego (Spanish for \\"Saint Didacus\\") is a major city in California, United States.

Some scientists think because the Earth was hotter, that plate tectonic activity was more vigorous than it is today, resulting in a much greater rate of recycling of crustal material. This may have prevented cratonisation and continent formation until the mantle cooled and convection slowed down.

A:","output":"The state bird of Illinois is the Northern Cardinal. The Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), also known commonly as the redbird, was chosen by schoolchildren as Illinois' state bird in the Illinois centennial year of 1929. Northern Cardinals are easily spotted due to their bright red plumage, a feature that's more pronounced in males, while the females are usually a subtle mix of gray, red-orange, and brown color. One distinctive trait of the Northern Cardinal, both males and females, is the black \\"mask\\" that they have around their eyes. Young Cardinals have a similar coloring to the females until they reach maturity. The Northern Cardinal is known for its clear and lovely song. During courtship, the male collects food and brings it to the female, feeding her beak to beak. If the female agrees to pair, they usually stay together for life. About 8.5 to 9 inches long, they feature a distinctive crest on their head, and they have a relatively long tail. The robust conical beak is adapted to eating seeds and insects. The cardinal's diet primarily consists of fruits, seeds, and insects. The Northern Cardinal is known for its radiant red coloring and delightful melodic bird song, often considered the first sign of spring when the males start marking their territory. During the winter months, you may still often see flashes of red in the snow when the other birds have migrated for the winter, as cardinals don't migrate and are year-round residents. While the cardinal is the state bird of Illinois, it's also the state bird of seven other states in the United States, including: Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia. Recognizing the state bird can not only provide a unique way to connect with the nature and distinctive features of the place, but also underline the importance of bird conservation, as many bird species face threats due to habitat loss and climate change. The Northern Cardinal with its striking appearance and melodious song indeed represents a wonderful symbol for the state of Illinois."},{"instruction":"Teacher:Combine the given two facts to write a concluding fact.

Recognize the forms of sexual harassment. Identify who can be victims and who can be harassers. Article:","output":"Title: Understanding the Difference between Harassment and Other Social Circumstances Introduction It is crucial to understand the boundaries between harassment and other social circumstances to ensure a safe, healthy, and respectful environment in which everyone can thrive. This article aims to differentiate between harassment and other social situations, discuss the various forms of sexual harassment, and identify potential victims and harassers. Differentiating Between Harassment and Other Social Circumstances Step 1: Define Harassment and Other Social Circumstances Harassment is any unwanted and unwelcome behavior, often persistent and repetitive, that demeans, belittles, or humiliates an individual, causing a hostile or offensive environment. On the other hand, other social circumstances are general interactions that occur daily between individuals, which can include disagreements, miscommunications, or jokes. Step 2: Identify Characteristics of Harassment Certain features can help distinguish harassment from other social situations: 1. Unwanted and Unwelcome: A key aspect of harassment is that the behavior is unwanted and unwelcome by the recipient. 2. Intentional and Malicious: Harassment often involves a clear intention to cause distress or discomfort to the individual. 3. Repeated Behavior: Harassment typically consists of persistent and repetitive actions or comments. 4. Hostile or Offensive Environment: Harassment creates an environment that feels threatening or offensive to the individual. Recognizing the Forms of Sexual Harassment Sexual harassment can take various forms, including but not limited to: 1. Verbal Sexual Harassment: It includes inappropriate comments, sexual jokes, and explicit language. 2. Nonverbal Sexual Harassment: This refers to actions or gestures that are sexual in nature, such as leering, suggestive looks, or sexually charged body language. 3. Physical Sexual Harassment: It involves unwanted touching or advances, pinching, groping, or other forms of inappropriate physical contact. 4. Quid Pro Quo Harassment: In this form of harassment, an individual may be expected to perform sexual favors in exchange for job benefits or favorable treatment in the workplace. 5. Online Sexual Harassment: Technology has enabled new forms of harassment, such as sending explicit images or engaging in inappropriate conversations via email or social media platforms. Identifying Who Can Be Victims and Harassers 1. Victims: Anyone can be a victim of harassment, regardless of their age, gender, or social background. It is essential to recognize that men, women, and people of all genders can be affected by harassment. 2. Harassers: Similarly, harassers can come from any gender, age, or social background. They could be coworkers, supervisors, friends, acquaintances, or even strangers. Conclusion Understanding the difference between harassment and other social circumstances is crucial in fostering a respectful, inclusive, and safe environment for everyone. By recognizing the various forms of harassment, as well as identifying potential victims and harassers, individuals and organizations can better address and prevent harassment in all its forms."},{"instruction":"Queen Victoria: Victoria was physically unprepossessing—she was stout, dowdy and no more than five feet tall—but she succeeded in projecting a grand image. She experienced unpopularity during the first years of her widowhood, but was well liked during the 1880s and 1890s, when she embodied the empire as a benevolent matriarchal figure. Only after the release of her diary and letters did the extent of her political influence become known to the wider public. Biographies of Victoria written before much of the primary material became available, such as Lytton Strachey's Queen Victoria of 1921, are now considered out of date. The biographies written by Elizabeth Longford and Cecil Woodham-Smith, in 1964 and 1972 respectively, are still widely admired.

The reviewer mentions that the exercise ball inflated fine, which implies that the initial experience with the product was satisfactory. This aspect of the review can be perceived as positive, indicating that the product's initial performance met the user's expectations. However, the review takes a negative turn when the reviewer states that the exercise ball popped within 2 weeks of use. This demonstrates a significant issue with the product's durability and reliability, as a customer would reasonably expect an exercise ball to maintain its quality and structural integrity for an extended period of time. Furthermore, the reviewer mentioned that they had filled it to the measured size of 29 inches tall, suggesting that they followed the provided instructions or recommendations and that the product should have performed as expected. Moreover, the reviewer is mostly certain that there was nothing on the floor that could have potentially popped the exercise ball. This statement suggests that the issue could be due to a manufacturing defect or overall insufficient quality and durability of the product itself. While the review begins with a positive aspect regarding the initial inflation of the exercise ball, the lasting impression and overall experience of the reviewer is negative due to the product's failure to withstand regular use. Consequently, this product review cannot be considered positive as the negative aspects significantly outweigh the initial positive experience. Instead, it serves as critical feedback for the manufacturer to potentially improve the quality and durability of their exercise balls to ensure higher customer satisfaction in the future."},{"instruction":"See the multi-choice question below: Sentence 1: I couldn't even build a doghouse.

Whales have evolved from land-living mammals. As such whales must breathe air regularly, although they can remain submerged under water for long periods of time. Some species such as the sperm whale are able to stay submerged for as much as 90 minutes. They have blowholes (modified nostrils) located on top of their heads, through which air is taken in and expelled. They are warm-blooded, and have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin. With streamlined fusiform bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers, whales can travel at up to 20 knots, though they are not as flexible or agile as seals. Whales produce a great variety of vocalizations, notably the extended songs of the humpback whale. Although whales are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and migrate to the equator to give birth. Species such as humpbacks and blue whales are capable of travelling thousands of miles without feeding. Males typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for one to two years. Once relentlessly hunted for their products, whales are now protected by international law. The North Atlantic right whales nearly became extinct in the twentieth century, with a population low of 450, and the North Pacific grey whale population is ranked Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Besides whaling, they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution. The meat, blubber and baleen of whales have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Whales have been depicted in various cultures worldwide, notably by the Inuit and the coastal peoples of Vietnam and Ghana, who sometimes hold whale funerals.

A. left foot B. wedding C. closet D. shoebox E. house The best answer is A:","output":"The best place to keep a shoe depends on various factors such as the purpose, frequency of use, and storage space available. Analyzing the given options: A. Left foot: If the purpose is to wear the shoe for comfort, protection, and enhancing mobility, then placing the shoe on the left foot is the most suitable option. It should be noted that this option is specifically for the left shoe of the pair and will be chosen when you intend to wear it to walk or perform activities that require footwear. While this is a good place to keep a shoe for an extended period, it is not recommended for storage purposes when the shoe is not in use. B. Wedding: A wedding is an event, not a specific location or place to keep a shoe. However, a wedding might call for specific types of shoes depending on the dress code and venue. Shoes worn to a wedding are likely to be more elegant, formal, and could be either opened or closed, depending on the occasion and the individual's preference. Once the event is over, it is advisable to have a designated storage space like a closet or shoebox that can maintain the shoe's quality and extend its lifespan. C. Closet: A closet serves as an organized and clutter-free space for storing shoes when they are not in use. Shoes stored in a closet are less prone to dust, damage by sunlight, and becoming a tripping hazard. Furthermore, a closet allows easy access to shoes when required as they will be clearly visible and neatly arranged. This is an excellent place to keep a shoe for storage purposes. D. Shoebox: A shoebox is a perfect place to store shoes that are not worn frequently or shoes that require additional preservation from dust, moisture, and sunlight. Storing a shoe in its original box or a designated shoebox ensures that the shoe maintains its original shape, color, and quality for an extended time. This is also a suitable storage option for delicate, expensive, or highly cherished shoes. E. House: A house is a more general location for storing shoes. While keeping shoes in a house reduces external wear and tear, it is crucial to have a designated storage area within a home, such as a closet or shoe rack, to maintain a tidy appearance and prevent shoes from becoming misplaced, damaged, or causing a tripping hazard. In conclusion, the best option can vary depending on the footwear's purpose. If the intent is to wear the shoe, placing it on the left foot (Option A) is ideal. For storage purposes, keeping shoes in a closet (Option C) or a shoebox (Option D) are the best places based on the shoe type, frequency of use, and available storage spaces."},{"instruction":"Do those Russian brides really exist or all those ads are scams?

Answer the above question based on the context below: Following their 2004 reunion, the Pixies felt that recording a new song would \\"break the ice\\" between band members after their acrimonious split in 1993. As the band were announcing dates for their reunion world tour, DreamWorks contacted manager Ken Goes to enquire whether they would be interested in recording a song for the title sequence of Shrek 2. The band agreed, and frontman Black Francis and Deal began composing riffs for a song aimed at children. Deal had been experimenting with a chord progression for a while, and since her band The Breeders were then inactive, she decided to donate her new composition to the Pixies. The Pixies chose Deal's riff, as it was a \\"poppier, more kid-friendly thing,\\" and Francis agreed to let her sing lead vocals and write the new song; significantly, Francis is relegated to backing vocals on the track. Francis' move was meant to warm the previously cold relations between the two—in the previous two Pixies studio albums, Bossanova (1990) and Trompe le Monde (1991), Francis, the band's principal songwriter, had not let Deal contribute any songs or sing lead vocals. This became one of the reasons for the Pixies' 1993 split. However, the two appeared at the time to have resolved their differences: Francis praised \\"Bam Thwok,\\" as \\"a really good song.\\" despite joking in interviews about how he planned to remove as many of her compositions as possible from a hypothetical new album. However, Deal eventually left the band in June 2013, before the release of the band's next album, Indie Cindy.

Since they are going to be brothers soon, they have to look out for each other.Doug goes to talk to his father-in-law, Sid Garner (Jeffery Tambor), and is given permission to take his Mercedes to Vegas for the bachelor party since Sid remembers what it was like to be a young man.

In the 2009 film \\"The Hangover,\\" the trio - Phil, Stu, and Alan - are not technically arrested, but they do encounter plenty of trouble and law enforcement officers throughout their chaotic adventure. The story revolves around a bachelor party in Las Vegas gone terribly wrong, as the trio wake up the morning after the party with no memory of the previous night. As they attempt to piece together what happened and find their missing friend, Doug, they discover that they have gotten involved in numerous incidents with potentially serious consequences. Here is a brief list of some encounters and issues that could have theoretically led to an arrest, though none resulted in the characters being taken into custody: 1. They stole a police cruiser: The trio ends up taking a police car that was left unattended after stealing it the night before. They then drive around Las Vegas with the car, which logically could lead to their arrest if caught by the police. However, they manage to return the car without getting caught. 2. They kidnapped a tiger: During their wild night, they involuntarily take possession of a tiger that belongs to Mike Tyson. This could have resulted in criminal charges if they were caught, considering that owning, stealing, or transporting exotic animals is illegal in many jurisdictions. Again, they manage to return the tiger without getting into trouble. 3. Stu marries a stripper: When retracing their steps, they realize that Stu married a stripper named Jade (Heather Graham) during their blackout. While this situation does not directly result in an arrest, the impromptu relationship further complicates their mission. 4. Illegal possession of drugs: Alan unknowingly spiked their drinks with a drug meant to help them relax but ended up causing severe memory loss instead. If the truth about the drugs were discovered, it could lead to charges against him. 5. Involvement with a criminal: Throughout their adventure, they learn that they have crossed paths with an eccentric Asian mobster named Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong), who was initially kidnapped but later escapes, ensuing in high-stakes problems with the mobster. Their involvement with Mr. Chow could have put them in trouble with law enforcement if their ties were exposed. To sum it up, while the trio is never specifically arrested in the film, they find themselves in a series of dangerous and illegal situations throughout their Las Vegas bachelor party escapade. Their journey entails solving these predicaments while trying to locate Doug before his wedding ceremony."},{"instruction":"Attributes: name = The Waterman, eatType = restaurant, food = Italian, priceRange = high, customer rating = 1 out of 5, area = riverside, familyFriendly = yes.

These processes include natural selection, common descent, and speciation. The discipline emerged through what Julian Huxley called the modern synthesis (of the 1930s) of understanding from several previously unrelated fields of biological research, including genetics, ecology, systematics and paleontology. Current research has widened to cover the genetic architecture of adaptation, molecular evolution, and the different forces that contribute to evolution including sexual selection, genetic drift and biogeography. The newer field of evolutionary developmental biology (\\"evo-devo\\") investigates how embryonic development is controlled, thus creating a wider synthesis that integrates developmental biology with the fields covered by the earlier evolutionary synthesis. Evolution is the central unifying concept in biology. Biology can be divided in various ways. One way is by the level of biological organisation, from molecular to cell, organism to population. An earlier way is by perceived taxonomic group, with fields such as zoology, botany, and microbiology, reflecting what were once seen as the major divisions of life. A third way is by approach, such as field biology, theoretical biology, experimental evolution, and paleontology. These alternative ways of dividing up the subject can be combined with evolutionary biology to create subfields like evolutionary ecology and evolutionary developmental biology.

But government advisers say it may not lower UK energy prices much. Opponents say fracking can cause water contamination and environmental damage. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, involves drilling deep underground and releasing a high-pressure mix of water, sand and chemicals to crack rocks and release gas stored inside. The British Geological Survey estimates there may be 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas present in the north of England. Mr Cameron says this could deliver a large economic boost and ensure the supply of cheaper, more secure energy. In his speech to political and business leaders, Mr Cameron said foreign investment was contributing to a turn-around in the UK economy. But he argued the UK has to do more to encourage \\"re-shoring\\" - the return of businesses that have moved abroad to cut costs. Q&A: What is fracking?Cuadrilla vows not to frack Balcombe He said: \\"There is no doubt that when it comes to re-shoring in the US, one of the most important factors has been the development of shale gas, which is flooring US energy prices, with billions of dollars of energy cost-savings predicted over the next decade.\\" The prime minister called for a greater competitiveness, saying: \\"The key challenge for politicians and business leaders in Europe is how we make a success of globalisation. \\"For years the West has been written off. People say that we are facing some sort of inevitable decline. They say we can't make anything any more. \\"Whether it's the shift from manufacturing to services or the transfer from manual jobs to machines, the end point is the same dystopian vision - the East wins while the West loses; and the workers lose while the machines win. I don't believe it has to be this way. \\"Of course, we shouldn't be starry-eyed about globalisation - it presents huge challenges as our economies and societies try to adapt - but neither should we take this pessimistic view.\\" And Mr Cameron will point to a \\"small but discernible trend\\" of jobs coming back from the East to the West, highlighting a practice where production facilities were moved to low-cost countries. \\"A recent survey of small and medium-sized businesses found that more than one in 10 has brought back to Britain some production in the past year, more than double the proportion sending production in the opposite direction. \\" Mr Cameron warned other European countries about imposing \\"burdensome, unjustified and premature\\" regulations on fracking firms, saying these would force developers to go elsewhere. The UK Independence Party, which has also warned about EU rules hampering fracking in the UK, accused Mr Cameron of copying its policy. A spokesman said: \\"It's absolutely staggering. This is almost verbatim what (UKIP energy spokesman) Roger Helmer has been saying for months. \\"It just goes to show how much UKIP is steering UK politics from the wings when the prime minister reads out our policy to the World Economic Forum\\" Government advisers on the Committee on Climate Change, as well as Energy Secretary Ed Davey, have cast doubt on whether exploiting shale gas reserves in the UK will lead to lower energy prices. They suggest that relying heavily on gas for future electricity supplies will leave households vulnerable to higher bills in the long run as the price of gas on the international market is volatile. The UK will not benefit from substantially lower prices unless the rest of Europe decides to back shale gas too, as Europe has a gas grid that allows gas to be traded to the highest bidder. Meanwhile, some environmentalists fear potentially carcinogenic chemicals used in the process may escape and contaminate groundwater and that fracking could cause small earth tremors. They also argue that fracking is distracting energy firms and governments from investing in renewable sources of energy, and encouraging continued reliance on fossil fuels. \\"Shale gas is not the solution to the UK's energy challenges,\\" said Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Tony Bosworth. \\"We need a 21st Century energy revolution based on efficiency and renewables, not more fossil fuels that will add to climate change.\\" Labour said the government had failed to deliver a \\"balanced recovery\\". \\"Any help for manufacturers is welcome after three damaging years of flatlining and in a month where factory orders have fallen back,\\" shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said. \\"But after so many government schemes have failed to deliver for business, manufacturers will want to see what this one offers in practice.\\" \\"Labour would create a proper British Investment Bank supported by a network of regional banks, a skills system which delivers for businesses of all sizes and would cut business rates to help growing firms.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"Attending the World Economic Forum at Davos, former UK Prime Minister David Cameron argued that hydraulic fracturing (fracking) could lead to lower energy prices and serve as a driver for economic growth in the country. He highlighted the impact of fracking on energy prices in the US and called for the development of shale gas in the UK while cautioning against imposing regulations on the industry. However, the Committee on Climate Change and Energy Secretary Ed Davey expressed doubts about whether exploiting shale gas would actually lead to lower energy costs and warned against reliance on volatile gas prices. Environmentalists and opponents of fracking raised concerns about potential water contamination, environmental damage, and maintaining a continued reliance on fossil fuels instead of investing in renewable energy sources."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence in this story.

In order to get ready for it, this summer, many Beijing middle school students had a different kind of vacation. Instead of hanging out with friends or traveling, they trained hard for the 60th birthday of China this year. Students trained from 7:30 am to around 10:00 am or from 4 pm to 6:30 pm, because it was very hot this summer. They wore white hats, T-shirts and blue trousers. The hats and T-shirts were printed with a red logo, the number \\"60\\". The first week of training was PE. Students practiced standing and squatting. Then they moved on to practice the group show.

The suspect's name has not been released, but Eichenwald says the suspect is facing federal charges and will likely get additional charges from the Dallas DA, according to the Verge. Raw Story reports the sender of the strobe had already been suspended by Twitter. Eichenwald, who has covered President Trump since before his foray into politics, was sent the tweet after appearing on Fox News' Tucker Carlson Tonight. He says more than 40 people sent him the same strobe after he spoke out about the first attack. Eichenwald says the FBI now has their information, as well, and people should stop sending him strobes. Article:","output":"Title: Arrest Made in Twitter Strobe Attack on Journalist Kurt Eichenwald, Further Charges Expected Last year, a malicious social media user targeted Kurt Eichenwald, a Vanity Fair contributing editor and Newsweek senior writer, with a harmful tweet aimed at his epilepsy condition. Today, the FBI reports that it has arrested the suspect involved in this disturbing incident. What may have initially seemed like a cruel prank on the surface has more severe underlying implications for those like Eichenwald who suffer from such health disorders. In late 2016, a flashing video was sent to Eichenwald via Twitter, accompanied by the message, \\"You deserve a seizure.\\" The intention of the tweet quickly became apparent as Eichenwald – who has been vocal about his epilepsy in the past – was indeed triggered into having a seizure. The sender of the strobe had their Twitter account suspended in light of the incident. Although the suspect's name has not been released, Eichenwald confirmed that the individual now faces federal charges, with the possibility of additional charges from the Dallas District Attorney, according to the Verge. This highlights the seriousness of the situation and the potential consequences for those who engage in such harmful online behavior. Eichenwald, who has been covering reports on President Trump even before his venture into politics, was targeted with the strobe image shortly after appearing on Fox News' Tucker Carlson Tonight. It's a sad reality that targets of online harassment continue to endure personal attacks disguised as intended jokes or pranks. Unfortunately, following the first attack, more than 40 other individuals followed suit and sent out similar strobes to Eichenwald. Taking immediate action against this harassment, Eichenwald made sure the FBI was informed with their details as well, urging people to stop sending him strobes. This incident brings to the forefront discussions around online harassment and the potential dangers of using social media as a platform for personal attacks. Those who engage in activities intended to inflict harm on others must be held accountable for their actions. The arrest of the responsible individual involved in the strobe attack on Eichenwald serves as a warning to others who may consider engaging in such harmful behavior online. For people with epilepsy or other disabilities, the consequences can be severe and potentially life-threatening. Thus, these types of incidents and cyber-attacks cannot be taken lightly. The internet has opened doors for many positive aspects, including the ability to share information and connect with people worldwide. However, it also comes with a darker side – providing an avenue for malicious users to target and inflict harm on others. As in the case with Eichenwald, such attacks exemplify the importance of holding offenders accountable and raising awareness about the potential risks and consequences associated with online harassment."},{"instruction":"By The Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — Trump affirms plan to deliver State of Union despite Pelosi’s request to postpone, says it would be ‘very sad’ to delay.

From the moment I stepped in, I could tell that the night was not going to be enjoyable. To begin with, the food was far from satisfactory. I ordered their signature dish, the grilled salmon, but it arrived overcooked and dry. It was accompanied by a lukewarm, bland vegetable medley that seemed to have been sitting out for hours. My partner's pasta was overly salty and swimming in oil. The slow service only added to our frustration. It took over 30 minutes for our main courses to arrive after ordering, and our server only checked on us once throughout the meal. We had to ask another staff member to refill our water glasses and bring us the check. The ambiance did little to redeem our evening. The poorly-lit dining area made it hard to read the menu, and the tables were crammed so tightly together that we could barely have a private conversation.

Daniel Ceballos, mayor of western city of San Cristóbal, which has been a crucible of anti-government protest, was detained by the national intelligence service Sebin and accused of \\"civil rebellion\\". The interior minister, Miguel Rodríguez Torres, who also heads Sebin, told state TV that Ceballos was detained by agents acting on an order from court in western Tachira state. \\"This is an act of justice for a mayor who not only failed to meet his obligations under the law, but also facilitated and supported all the irrational violence in this city,\\" he said. \\"In the coming hours he will be presented before the corresponding tribunals to begin the judgment process.\\" Ceballos was arrested in Caracas, where he had been attending a meeting of opposition mayors, according to his aide Ronni Pavolini. \\"They took him out of the hotel in Caracas and took him to Helicoide [Sebin headquarters],\\" Pavolini told the Associated Press. San Cristóbal, home to 250,000 people, has been the focus of the most sustained fights between hooded demonstrators barricading roads, armed pro-government radicals, and the security forces. Torres said a member of the national guard was shot dead in the city on Wednesday during what he called \\"vandalistic acts\\" by protesters targeting a national armed forces university. Later on Wednesday, the supreme court jailed another opposition mayor, Enzo Scarano of San Diego in central Carabobo state, for 10 months and 15 days for failing to comply with a previous order to take down barricades there. In a statement, the court said Scarano would be stopped from exercising his functions as mayor. \\"All our solidarity with Enzo Scarano before this indescribable aggression,\\" tweeted Ramón Muchacho, mayor of the staunchly pro-opposition Chacao municipality in eastern Caracas, which has been the site of near-nightly street clashes. The mayors joined a high-profile opposition leader, Leopoldo López, who is being held on charges of arson and conspiracy, as leading government opponents jailed by Maduro's administration since the unrest began last month. The anti-government protests that have shaken Venezuela for more than a month began in early February with students in San Cristóbal, an opposition stronghold along the border with Colombia. Since then it has seen intense clashes between authorities and protesters frustrated by soaring inflation, rampant violent crime and shortages of basic items such as cooking oil and toilet paper. Late on Wednesday, the federal prosecutor's office said that, according to preliminary information, national guardsman Jhon Rafael Castillo Castillo, 23, was killed while breaking up protests near a local university in San Cristóbal. He would be the fifth national guardsmen killed during the protests. Meanwhile, about 15 miles from San Cristóbal, national guardsmen firing plastic shotgun pellets and tear gas wounded at least 16 people in the town of Rubio as they cleared barricades that had been up for weeks, local officials said. \\"The situation is terrible here,\\" Francisco Rincon, vice-president of Rubio municipal council, told the Associated Press. He said soldiers with rifles were on the street corners. He said he had counted 16 wounded, four of them by bullets. Rincon, who is a member of the opposition Popular Will party, said their supporters had protested peacefully in the morning before being dispersed by tear gas and plastic buckshot by national guardsmen and pro-government civilians. In Caracas, officials said a municipal worker was shot and killed while removing a street barricade in a middle-class neighbourhood. His death raised to 28 the official toll from more than a month's worth of protests. The federal prosecutor's office said Francisco Alcides Madrid Rosendo, 32, was shot multiple times around 10pm on Tuesday while he and others were taking down a barricade in the Montalbán neighbourhood in Caracas's western section. The pro-government Caracas mayor, Jorge Rodríguez, through his Twitter account blamed unnamed \\"terrorists\\" for the killing, but provided no other details.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: How many devotional songs did Ambikapathi have to sing? Movie title: Ambikapathy Movie plot: The film is based on a story set in the Chola Empire in year 1083 AD. The titular character in the story is Ambikapathy (M K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar), the son of the Tamil poet Kambar (Serugulathur Sama) who is in love with the Chola princess and daughter of Kulothunga Chola, Amaravati (played by M. R. Santhanalakshmi). The king objects to their love and insists on testing Ambikapathy's literary mettle before judging his worth. The test given to Ambikapathi is that he should write and sing a hundred poems in the field of Puram (dealing with war and politics). The poems should not have any reference to the field of Aram (dealing of love and romance). Ambikapathi begins the test in the King's court with a Kadavul Vaazhthu (invocation to God). Amaravathi who is keeping the count, mistakes the invocation as a poem and counts it as poem number one. When he has sung only ninety nine Puram poems, she thinks he has completed the task and signals him that hundred poems have been sung. Declaring victory, Ambikapathy sings of his love for her and thus fails the test. He is executed by the king.[3] The answer is:","output":"Ambikapathi had to sing 100 devotional songs in the field of Puram (dealing with war and politics) to prove his worth to the King and win his approval for his love for the princess Amaravati. However, due to a counting mistake made by Amaravati, Ambikapathi ended up singing only 99 Puram songs before unintentionally expressing his love in the final song – resulting in failure of the test and his execution."},{"instruction":"I've trained here off and on over the past few years and now I am here for good.

This property makes it useful for precise timekeeping in quartz clocks and watches, regulating the frequency of radio transmissions, and in microphones and other electronic devices. 2. Glass-making: Since quartz is transparent and has a high melting point, it is used in the production of various types of glass, including specialized glass for laboratory equipment and optical devices. 3. Building materials: Crushed quartz is often used as an abrasive in sandpaper, as a filler in paint and other coatings, and in the production of engineered stone for countertops and other surfaces. 4. Metallurgy: Quartz is used in the manufacturing of silicon, which is an essential material for semiconductors and solar panels. If plants were to die off and there was no oxygen, the priorities of human society would likely shift dramatically, impacting the demand for materials like quartz. However, given its various applications, particularly in the electronics industry, quartz would likely continue to be a valuable resource. In this hypothetical scenario, humans might focus on developing technology to either replace the life-supporting role of plants or find alternative means of generating oxygen and sustaining life on Earth. Considering these potential technological developments, quartz could still play a crucial role."},{"instruction":"- Air is pulled into the lungs - Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream - Air is pushed through the vocal chords - A person talks What might be the last step of the process?","output":"- The person's brain sends signals to the muscles involved in speech, such as those controlling the lips, tongue, and vocal cords - These muscles work together to form words and produce sound - The person's message is successfully communicated to the listener Justification: After air is pushed through the vocal chords, the brain plays a crucial role in controlling the muscles involved in producing speech.

The people who read the news are called news presenters and because they appear on television every day, they are very famous. This is a popular news presenter in England called Trevor McDonald, in the news studio. He presents a program called \\"News at Ten\\"every Monday to Friday evenings. Another popular news presenter is Kirsty Young. She has a more modern style of reading the news, as you can see, she sits on the desk not on a chair! Television news presenters need to have worked as journalists because they have to write most of the news that they read. Sometimes an important new event happens after the program has started, so the presenter has to be able to read something without looking at it first. They must always keep calm even when there are many changes during the program. At the end of \\"News at Ten\\"Trevor McDonald says \\"And finally...\\". Then he reads an unusual or interesting item.

The second sentence, \\"In the United Kingdom, mescaline is a Class A drug in dried powder form, but cleaned cactus can be bought and sold legally,\\" is making the same statement but with slightly different wording.

The answer is:","output":"Title: The Enchanted Forest Genre: Mystery, Fantasy, Adventure Plot Outline: In a mystical, enchanted forest, Alcott, a valiant and resourceful huntsman, is informed that Snow White, the beloved princess of the realm, is dead. As he embarks on a dangerous journey to uncover the truth behind her apparent death, he encounters magical creatures, unscrupulous characters, and a sinister conspiracy that threatens the fate of the entire kingdom. Plot Synopsis: The story begins in the magical kingdom of Luminara, nestled within the heart of the Enchanted Forest. The kingdom is ruled by a kind and beloved King and Queen, who live in the splendid royal palace with their only daughter, the beautiful and spirited Snow White. The realm of Luminara is well-known for the mystical power that courses through the Enchanted Forest, as wild magic flourishes in every corner, and mythical beings call it home. Alcott, a skilled and honorable huntsman from a humble background, is employed by the royal palace to protect its inhabitants from the dark and treacherous creatures that lurk within the Enchanted Forest. Alcott is dedicated to his duty, but his loyalty is put to the test when he receives terrible news one fateful day. A shadowy messenger arrives at the palace, bearing the grim news that Snow White has been found dead in the heart of the Enchanted Forest. The kingdom is struck by grief and despair, as the King and Queen mourn the loss of their beloved daughter. Alcott, however, is unconvinced by the messenger's claims and decides to delve deeper into the matter. Baffled by the events, Alcott starts his treacherous journey through the Enchanted Forest, intending to find the truth behind Snow White's supposed demise. Along the way, he encounters an eccentric assortment of magical beings, including a wise old owl with cryptic messages, a mischievous trickster fox, and the enigmatic enchantress who protects the forest. As Alcott’s journey progresses, he learns about a wicked conspiracy masterminded by the malevolent sorcerer, Mordred, who seeks to exploit the Enchanted Forest's wild magic for his nefarious purposes. Mordred aims to seize control of the kingdom and plunge it into chaos to advance his sinister plans. To Alcott's surprise, he discovers that Snow White is not, in fact, dead, but was put under a deep, death-like enchantment by Mordred's commanding power. To break the spell, Alcott must gather the ingredients for an ancient antidote concealed within the Enchanted Forest’s most dangerous corners. In the thrilling climax, Alcott, with the help of his newfound magical allies, confronts Mordred in an epic battle between darkness and light. The group’s determination and strong alliance lead to the ultimate defeat of Mordred. Alcott then concocts the sought-after antidote and manages to revive Snow White, who thankfully awakens from her slumber. With Snow White's return, the kingdom of Luminara celebrates the triumph of good over evil. The Enchanted Forest is once again protected from dark forces, and the King and Queen of the realm express their deep gratitude to Alcott for his unwavering courage and loyalty. The story ends with the restoration of peace and prosperity to the kingdom. Snow White recognizes Alcott's exceptional valor, and the two find in each other a kindred spirit that grows into an enduring bond. United in friendship and love, they embark on a new chapter of their lives filled with hope, happiness, and the promise of even greater adventures to come."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: Heart valves prevent what kind of blood flow from happening in the heart?

Nick's flight attendant girlfriend, Diane (Angela Bassett), encourages this decision, promising to fully commit to their relationship if he does indeed go straight. Nick, however, is lured into taking one final score by his fence Max (Marlon Brando). The job, worth a 4 million pay off to Nick, is to steal a valuable French scepter, which was being smuggled illegally into the United States through Canada but was accidentally discovered and kept at the Montréal Customs House.Max introduces Nick to Jack Teller (Edward Norton), an ambitious, albeit foolhardy, thief who has infiltrated the Customs House and gained access to information regarding the security by pretending to be an intellectually disabled janitor named Brian. Nick hires his associate Steven (Jamie Harrold) to hack into the Custom House's security system to obtain the bypass codes, allowing them to temporarily manipulate the alert protocols of the system during the heist. Steven is caught, however, by a systems administrator who extorts Nick for 50,000 for the information. More complications arise when they're forced to move up their time-table after the Customs House becomes aware of the true value of the scepter and adds extra CCTV cameras to monitor it while preparing to return it to its rightful owners.Nick uses a sewer tunnel to enter the Customs House basement as Jack uses the bypass codes to rig the cameras to shut off while Nick sneaks into the storage room. One of the janitors stumbles upon Jack as he is working and realizes that he is not really Brian, but Jack locks him in a closet. Meanwhile Nick fills the enormous in-floor safe containing the scepter with water before inserting and detonating a depth charge to blow off the door. He quickly packs up the scepter in a carrying case to depart, but Jack double crosses him and at gunpoint...

One of the most persistent and popular stories regarding the Mormon pioneers was about three of the rescuers who helped the pioneers cross Sweetwater River. The most popular telling, by Solomon Kimball, states: Three eighteen-year-old boys belonging to the relief party came to the rescue; and to the astonishment of all who saw, carried nearly every member of that ill-fated handcart company across the snow-bound stream. The strain was so terrible, and the exposure so great, that in later years all the boys died from the effects of it. When President Brigham Young heard of this heroic act, he wept like a child, and later declared publicly, \\"That act alone will ensure C. Allen Huntington, George W. Grant, and David P. Kimball an everlasting salvation in the Celestial Kingdom of God, worlds without end. This version was quoted by Gordon B. Hinckley, James E. Faust and was previously taught in Sunday School in the LDS Church for both adults and children.Chad Orton notes it would be physically impossible for three boys to carry five hundred people across the river in two hours. In actuality, the rescue party had several rescuers instead of three, eighteen of which have been positively identified as being at the Sweetwater crossing. The rescuers brought ten rescue wagons in addition to the wagons the Martin Company had with them. Many survivors wrote about riding the wagons across. However, because of time constraints, not everyone could ride the wagons. Some were carried, but other survivors wrote that they crossed the river themselves or with the help of people other than the three boys. The boys mentioned in the story did help some people across, but not \\"nearly every member\\" as reported in the mythologized version of the story. While the three boys were among those that helped several across, the ages were wrong. C. Allen Huntington was 24, David P. Kimball was 17, and George W. Grant was 16. There is no medical evidence that they died from effects of the crossing, and most lived active and relatively long...

Both species are searching for Selene: the vampires seek justice for the death of Viktor, while the Lycans, led by Marius, intend to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids. Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted clemency and to train the coven's neophyte Death Dealers. She asks Thomas to plead Selene's case before the full council; the plea is successful and the council reluctantly agrees to a pardon in exchange for Selene's help. Selene arrives with David.

The Airbus A320 was making its final approach to Glasgow Airport on 2 December when an object passed about 300ft underneath it. The pilot of the aircraft said the risk of collision with the object, which did not show up on radar, had been \\"high\\". A report by the UK Airprox Board said investigators were unable to establish what the object had been. The A320 was flying with its landing lights on, in clear conditions and at an altitude of about 4,000ft above the Baillieston area of Glasgow, when the pilot and non-flying pilot saw an object \\"loom ahead\\" at a range of about 100m. Cockpit transcript The Airprox report included a transcript of the conversation that took place between the aircraft and the controller at 12:55: A320: \\"Glasgow Approach [A320 C/S]\\" EGPF: \\"[A320 C/S] pass your message\\" A320: \\"Er yeah we just had something pass underneath us quite close [1255:30] and nothing on TCAS have you got anything on in our area\\" EGPF: \\"Er negative er we've got nothing on er radar and we're n- not talking to any traffic either\\" A320: \\"Er not quite sure what it was but it definitely er quite large [1255:40] and it's blue and yellow\\" EGPF: \\"OK that's understood er do you have a an estimate for the height\\" A320: \\"Maybe er [1255:50] yeah we were probably about erm four hundred to five hundred feet above it so it's probably about three and a half thousand feet.\\" The object passed directly beneath the aircraft before either of the crew members had time to take avoiding action or had \\"really registered it\\". But they both agreed that it appeared to have been blue and yellow or silver in colour with a small frontal area, but \\"bigger than a balloon\\". The pilot asked the controller at Glasgow Airport if he was \\"talking to anything in the area\\" as he had \\"got quite close\\" to a blue and yellow aircraft, travelling in the opposite direction, which had passed just below him. The controller stated that he was not talking to anyone else in that area and that nothing was seen on radar. Search action was taken with no result and the A320 pilot stated his intention to file a report to Airprox, which investigates near misses. Air traffic control said they had no trace of any other objects in the area at the time of the incident, although the radar at Prestwick did spot an \\"unidentified track history\\" 1.3 nautical miles east of the A320's position 28 seconds earlier. Once the aircraft had landed, the pilot told the Glasgow Aerodrome Controller: \\"We seemed to only miss it by a couple of hundred feet, it went directly beneath us. Wherever we were when we called it in it was within about 10 seconds. Couldn't tell what direction it was going but it went right underneath us.\\" Members were unable to reach a conclusion as to a likely candidate for the conflicting aircraft Airprox Board report When asked if he thought it may have been a \\"glider or something like that\\" the pilot replied: \\"Well maybe a microlight. It just looked too big for a balloon.\\" The Airprox report concluded: \\"Investigation of the available surveillance sources was unable to trace any activity matching that described by the A320 pilot. Additionally there was no other information to indicate the presence or otherwise of activity in the area.\\" The report said the Airprox board had been of the opinion that the object was unlikely to have been a fixed wing aircraft, helicopter or hot air balloon, given that it had not shown up on radar. It was also thought that a meteorological balloon would be radar significant and unlikely to be released in the area. A glider could not be discounted, the report said, but it was unlikely that one would be operating in the area because of the constrained airspace and the lack of thermal activity because of the low temperature. Similarly, the board believed that a hang-glider or para-motor would be radar significant and that conditions precluded them, as they did para-gliders or parascenders. The report stated: \\"Members were unable to reach a conclusion as to a likely candidate for the conflicting aircraft and it was therefore felt that the board had insufficient information to determine a Cause or Risk\\". ||||| The captain of an A320 navigating just west of London’s Heathrow Airport said he was startled when he looked out his cockpit window and saw an unidentified flying object — an object he described as a cigar-shaped metallic object — flying right toward his plane. The Daily Mail said the pilot reported the near-miss with the unknown object way back in July, but that the U.K. Airprox Board was only bringing the matter to light now. The report: “Having very little time to focus, he was under the apprehension that they were on a collision course with no time to react. His immediate reaction was to duck to the right and reach over to ‘alert the [First Officer].’ There was no time to alert him. His first words to the FO were, ‘did you see that?’” The captain told aviation authorities the object was cigar and rubgy ball in shape, and made of some sort of bright and metallic material, The Daily Mail said. The pilot asked if other aircraft were in the area, but was told no. The reported also said: “Nevertheless the A320 pilot was subject to a powerful impression of immediate danger, caused by his perception of an object closing rapidly on his aircraft.” Investigators ruled out a meteorological balloon and a helium balloon. Some guessed that the pilot may have actually seen a reflection of the sun off on the remote airplanes in the far west. The Daily Mail cited the report’s response to that: “It was decided that, although the reflection theory had some merit, the overall dearth of information relating to the event rendered [any] meaningful finding impossible.” Copyright © 2016 The Washington Times, LLC.

The captain told the aviation authorities who have investigated the incident that he was certain the object was going to crash into his aircraft and ducked as it headed towards him. The investigation has been unable to establish any earthly identity for the mysterious craft, which left the aircrew with no time to take evasive action. The incident occurred while the A320 Airbus was cruising at 34,000ft, around 20 miles west of the airport, over the Berkshire countryside. The captain spotted the object travelling towards the jet out of a left hand side, cockpit window, apparently heading directly for it. A report into the incident states: “He was under the apprehension that they were on collision course with no time to react. His immediate reaction was to duck to the right and reach over to alert the FO (First Officer); there was no time to talk to alert him.” It adds: “The Captain was fully expecting to experience some kind of impact with a conflicting aircraft.” He told investigators he believes the object passes “within a few feet” above the jet. He described it as being “cigar/rugby ball like” in shape, bright silver and apparently “metallic” in construction. Once he had composed himself, he checked the aircraft’s instruments and contacted air traffic controllers to report the incident. However, there was no sign of the mystery craft. The incident was investigated by the UK Airprox Board, which studies “near misses” involving aircraft in British airspace. It checked data recordings to establish what other aircraft were in the area at the time, but eliminated them all from its quest to find out what had been responsible. It also ruled out meteorological balloons, after checking none were released in the vicinity. Toy balloons were also discounted, as they are not large enough to reach such heights. Military radar operators were also contacted but were unable to trace the reported object. The sighting occurred in daylight, at around. 6.35pm on July 19. It has only emerged now, following publication of the report, which concluded it was “not possible to trace the object or determine the likely cause of the sighting”. The report does not name the airline or flight involved. Even though it describes the aircraft as being \\"just to the west of Heathrow\\", aviation experts believe that at such an altitude it would be unlikely to have taken off from, or be preparing to land at, the west London airport. Instead, the A320, which is popular with many carriers, among them British Airways and Virgin, is likely to have been travelling between a regional airport elsewhere in the UK, and another on the Continent. The aircraft typically carry about 150 passengers. The Ministry of Defence closed its UFO desk in December 2009, along with its hotline for reporting such sightings. Following that change, the Civil Aviation Authority took the decision that it would continue to look into such reports, from aircrew and air traffic controllers, because they could have implications for “flight safety”. In 2012, the head of the National Air Traffic Control Services admitted staff detected around one unexplained flying object every month. Dr David Clarke, a Sheffield Hallam academic and the UFO consultant for the National Archives, said: “The aviation authorities obviously think this is something they should continue to look into and if you are a regular air traveller, you are likely to agree.” Dr Clarke, a sceptic on UFO issues, said: “This latest sighting is interesting, because it is detailed and clear. These pilots don’t file these reports for something and nothing. There was obviously something there.” Chris Yates, an aviation consultant, said: “Although we assume when these things happen, a UFO is responsible, there is usually an explanation that materialises at some point.” ||||| Write a summary.","output":"An Airbus A320 had a near miss with an unidentified flying object while approaching Glasgow Airport on 2 December. The pilot reported that the object passed about 300 feet underneath the aircraft and that the risk of collision had been high. The object did not show up on radar and neither the crew nor investigators were able to determine what it had been, though both crew members agreed that it appeared to have been blue and yellow or silver in color. The report by the UK Airprox Board stated that it considered various possibilities, but that the object was unlikely to have been a fixed-wing aircraft, helicopter, hot air balloon, meteorological balloon, glider, hang-glider, para-motor, paraglider, or parascender due to various reasons."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. I am facing a new situation today: Two earth-like planets orbited the same star. The inhabitants of Earth I released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Earth II ,however, was much more conscious about the environment and protected it from anthropogenic changes. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which planet caused more climate change?

A trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art would seem to reflect that notion: The Temple of Dendur, with its weatherworn sandstone, could fit in naturally with the earth tones of “Aida” or “The Mummy.” But Egyptologists know that this temple, like many others of the ancient world, was painted with vivid colors and patterns. In “Color the Temple,” a marriage of research and projection-mapping technology, visitors to the Met can now glimpse what the Temple of Dendur may have looked like in its original, polychromatic form more than 2,000 years ago. The Met’s MediaLab has installed a projector that fills in the temple’s carvings with color. Through March 19, one section of the structure’s south side is on view: a scene of the Roman emperor Augustus, dressed as a pharaoh and making an offering to the deities Hathor and Horus. Because the sun would wash out the projector’s light (the gallery has floor-to-ceiling windows), the scene is illuminated on Friday and Saturday evenings, when the Met offers extended hours. Ron Jenkins, 63, a theater professor at Wesleyan University, visited the Temple of Dendur on Friday with his 4-year-old son, Nicander. Mr. Jenkins said that he might have heard before that Egyptian temples were painted, but he was surprised by how rich and fresh the colors appeared in person. “You feel closer to the creators,” he said. “It’s not just dead stone.” The stone has long appeared lifeless to the naked eye. Threatened by its location on the banks of the Nile, the temple was subjected to centuries of annual flooding that stripped away the painted exterior. Still, in a 1906 survey Aylward Blackman, the British Egyptologist, wrote about painted scenes on the temple’s interior walls; he even drew diagrams that later proved handy for the Met. By the 1920s, Dendur was flooded nine months of the year, which contributed to further erosion. In the mid-1960s, Unesco led a salvage campaign that eventually moved the temple to the United States, and President Lyndon B. Johnson gave it to the Met in 1967. By then, no visible color remained. “We tried to find paint,” said Marsha Hill, a curator in the Met’s Egyptian art department, “but so far, nothing.” Even using imaging technology, the Met has been unable to detect any color. But bringing this temple’s colors to life became increasingly possible with the advent of the MediaLab and the arrival in 2013 of Erin Peters, then a fellow in the Met’s Egyptian art department and a doctoral candidate whose research included ancient polychromy. Ms. Peters helped provide information on how the Temple of Dendur could have looked when it was constructed around 15 B.C. Guiding her were Mr. Blackman’s survey, as well as illustrated, colored temples in the Napoleon-era publications “Description de l’Égypte.” The publications depicted brilliant paint inside the Temple of Hathor, from the same period as the Temple of Dendur. Eventually, Ms. Hill said, the Met arrived at a safe, confident idea of how the scene currently on view may have looked: Augustus in a white kilt, Horus colored a rich blue and Hathor with white skin and wearing purple. “But,” she said, “in the Roman period, they started doing pretty wonderful things with paint.” Kilts could have been colored with patterns, for example, or depictions of battle scenes. And the paint may have been finished with a wax or varnish to look bejeweled, she added. The MediaLab created alternate projections for those other possibilities, including one in which the entire temple is painted with a white background. Marco Castro Cosio, manager of the MediaLab, said the different patterns would be on view. His team can change the display to show the various options and to highlight objects in the scene — a useful tool for talks and tours. Mr. Castro said that visitors could expect projection mapping to appear elsewhere at the Met. He would even like to color the north side of the Temple of Dendur so people in Central Park could see it through the windows. “We’d love to do all of the scenes,” he said. But, he added, creating this first one took two years, and “it’s a big temple.” “Color the Temple: Scene 1” is on view Fridays and Saturdays from 5 to 9 p.m. through March 19 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; 212-535-7710, metmuseum­.org.

Article: This Mother's Day will be the 8thyear I have spent without my own mother. She _ less than a month before Mother's Day in the year 2000. She had been ill for almost two years, and I didn't cry when she died, or at her funeral, but on that first Mother's Day without her. On that day, I realized that this person I loved and depended on was gone forever. She still lives in family memories, in the thoughts of her friends and co-workers, in the values she had instilled in her children, and in the lovely flower gardens that she had so carefully tended. She loved her gladioli and irises. Each fall she would dig the bulbs out of the soil and carefully wrap them in paper. The bulbs would be stored until the following spring when they would be replanted. It seemed like a lot of effort to me, but each year her flower garden was more glorious than the year before. She put the same hard work into caring for her family, instilling in her children a sense of justice and fair play, compassion, and strong moral values so that we blossomed. Share anecdotes about your mother's life at your Mother's Day party. Too often, we avoid speaking of those loved ones who have passed away, fearful that we will unearth sad feelings. It doesn't have to be that way. Sharing fond memories and stories of the life we shared with her can be a healing process that binds the family together. My mother passed away when her oldest grandchild was only eight years old. Children will enjoy sharing pictures and stories of the grandmother they may have never known or have little memory of. Sharing anecdotes to pass on to the next generation will give children a feeling of family history and continuity, and may be one of the best ways to honor our mothers and grandmothers who have gone before us.

Therefore, the complete sentence would be: Carrie needs to hire someone to take Emily's place at the fabric store, as Emily has been the manager at the fabric store. The context of the sentence implies that Emily held an important role at the fabric store, specifically the role of the manager. By specifying that Emily has been the manager, it sets the stage for the reason why Carrie must find a replacement for her role. Otherwise, the statement would remain incomplete and would not provide the necessary detail for readers to understand the context behind the hiring process. Given that Carrie is responsible for hiring someone to fill the managerial position, it can be inferred that she may be in a position of higher authority or some sort of decision-making role within the fabric store. Moreover, this responsibility of hiring a replacement could arise from multiple possible situations, such as Emily's resignation, transfer, or any other unforeseen circumstances that may have led to her leave. The process of hiring a new manager might involve a series of steps that Carrie would have to undertake to guarantee that the new manager can effectively manage the fabric store in Emily's absence. It may include creating a detailed job posting, advertising the position, shortlisting candidates, conducting interviews, selecting the best candidate, and finally, training and onboarding the new manager. Carrie must ensure that the new manager possesses the requisite skills and qualifications to assume the role's responsibilities adequately. This could involve evaluating a candidate's experience in the industry or within a similar retail environment, their knowledge of operations, management skills, and interpersonal abilities, among other things. Overall, given the information provided within the sentence, it appears that Carrie faces the task of ensuring a smooth transition of managerial duties in the fabric store following Emily's departure. By clearly indicating that Emily has been the manager at the fabric store, the sentence effectively sets the stage for readers to understand the situation and the implications arising from her absence."},{"instruction":"Sam Benjamin Harris (born April 9, 1967) is an American author, philosopher, neuroscientist, blogger, and podcast host. He is a critic of religion and proponent of the liberty to criticize religion. He is concerned with matters that touch on spirituality, morality, neuroscience, free will, and terrorism. He is described as one of the \\"Four Horsemen of atheism\\", with Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens and Daniel Dennett. Harris considers Islam to be \\"especially belligerent and inimical to the norms of civil discourse,\\" relative to other world religions. He asserts that the \\"dogmatic commitment to using violence to defend one's faith, both from within and without\\" to varying degrees, is a central Islamic doctrine that is found in few other religions to the same degree, and that \\"this difference has consequences in the real world.\\" In 2006, after the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, Harris wrote, \\"The idea that Islam is a 'peaceful religion hijacked by extremists' is a dangerous fantasy--and it is now a particularly dangerous fantasy for Muslims to indulge. It is not at all clear how we should proceed in our dialogue with the Muslim world, but deluding ourselves with euphemisms is not the answer. It now appears to be a truism in foreign policy circles that real reform in the Muslim world cannot be imposed from the outside. But it is important to recognize why this is so--it is so because the Muslim world is utterly deranged by its religious tribalism. In confronting the religious literalism and ignorance of the Muslim world, we must appreciate how terrifyingly isolated Muslims have become in intellectual terms.\\" He states that his criticism of the religion is aimed not at Muslims as people, but at the doctrine of Islam. Harris wrote a response to controversy over his criticism of Islam, which also aired on a debate hosted by The Huffington Post on whether critics of Islam are unfairly labeled as bigots: Is it really true that the sins for which I hold Islam accountable are \\"committed at least to an equal extent by many other groups, especially [my] own\\"? ... The freedom to poke fun at Mormonism is guaranteed [not by the First Amendment but] by the fact that Mormons do not dispatch assassins to silence their critics or summon murderous hordes in response to satire. ... Can any reader of this page imagine the staging of a similar play [to The Book of Mormon] about Islam in the United States, or anywhere else, in the year 2013? ... At this moment in history, there is only one religion that systematically stifles free expression with credible threats of violence. The truth is, we have already lost our First Amendment rights with respect to Islam--and because they brand any observation of this fact a symptom of Islamophobia, Muslim apologists like Greenwald are largely to blame. Harris has criticized common usage of the term \\"Islamophobia\\". \\"My criticism of Islam is a criticism of beliefs and their consequences,\\" he wrote following a controversial clash with Ben Affleck in October 2014 on the show Real Time with Bill Maher, \\"but my fellow liberals reflexively view it as an expression of intolerance toward people.\\" During an email exchange with Glenn Greenwald, a critic of the New Atheists, Harris argued that \\"Islamophobia is a term of propaganda designed to protect Islam from the forces of secularism by conflating all criticism of it with racism and xenophobia. And it is doing its job, because people like you have been taken in by it.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Does Sam Harris consider Islam a relevant religion","output":"Sam Harris considers Islam a relevant religion, but he has strong criticisms against its doctrines and certain practices. He perceives Islam as \\"especially belligerent and inimical to the norms of civil discourse,\\" and asserts that the religion's \\"dogmatic commitment to using violence to defend one's faith\\" is a central Islamic doctrine, contributing to real-world consequences. Harris distinguishes his criticism of Islam as a religion from criticizing Muslims as individuals.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - The Country Music Association (CMA) was founded in 1958 in Nashville, Tennessee. It originally consisted of only 233 members and was the first trade organization formed to promote a music genre. The objectives of the organization are to guide and enhance the development of Country Music throughout the world; to demonstrate it as a viable medium to advertisers, consumers and media; and to provide a unity of purpose for the Country Music industry. However the CMA may be best known to most country music fans for its annual Country Music Association Awards broadcast live on network television each fall (usually October or November). - The Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance was first awarded in 1965, to Dottie West. The award has had several minor name changes: - The Country Music Association Awards, also known as the CMA Awards or CMAs, are presented to country music artists and broadcasters to recognize outstanding achievement in the country music industry. The televised annual presentation ceremony features performances and award presentations by popular country music artists. - A Grammy Award (originally called Gramophone Award), or Grammy, is an honor awarded by The Recording Academy to recognize outstanding achievement in the mainly English-language music industry. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest. It shares recognition of the music industry as that of the other performance awards such as the Emmy Awards (television), the Tony Awards (stage performance), and the Academy Awards (motion pictures). - The Academy of Country Music Awards, also known as the ACM Awards, were first held in 1966, honoring the industry's accomplishments during the previous year. It was the first country music awards program held by a major organization. The Academy's signature \\"hat\\" trophy was created in 1968. The awards were first televised in 1972 on ABC. In 1979, the Academy joined with Dick Clark Productions to produce the show. Dick Clark and Al Schwartz served as producers while Gene Weed served as director. Under their guidance, the show moved to NBC and finally to CBS, where it remains today. - Dottie West (born Dorothy Marie Marsh; October 11, 1932 September 4, 1991) was an American country music singer and songwriter. Along with her friends and fellow recording artists Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn, she is considered one of the genre's most influential and groundbreaking female artists. Dottie West's career started in the 1960s, with her Top 10 hit, \\"Here Comes My Baby Back Again\\", which won her the first Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance in 1965. - The Academy of Country Music (ACM) was founded in 1964 in Los Angeles, California as the Country & Western Music Academy. Among those involved in the founding was Eddie Miller and Tommy Wiggins, who joined Mickey Christensen and Chris Christensen. They wanted to promote country music in the western 13 states with the support of artist based on the West Coast. Artist such as Johnny Bond, Glen Campbell, Merle Haggard, Roger Miller, and many more influenced them. The ball finally started rolling in 1965 when a board of directors was formed to govern the Academy. - Miranda Leigh Lambert (born November 10, 1983) is an American country music singer and songwriter. She is best known as a solo artist, and is a member of the Pistol Annies (alongside Ashley Monroe and Angaleena Presley).

The banks will not automatically reach out when a cardholder becomes deceased. If you wait to cancel the cards, it's possible that the account will be charged late fees or interest in the interim. Can we draw the following conclusion? This is only applicable when the person has died Select from: a). Yes. b). It's impossible to say. c). No.","output":"a). Yes. The passage provided discusses the steps to be taken in canceling credit cards after someone has passed away. The need to cancel cards arises because the banks will not automatically take action upon someone's death, and may continue to charge late fees or interest in the meantime. Hence, we can conclude that this situation is applicable when the person has died. However, to provide a more comprehensive answer, here is a detailed guide on how to cancel credit cards after someone is deceased: 1. Obtain multiple copies of the death certificate: You will need to provide proof of the cardholder's death to the banks, and having multiple copies ensures you have enough for all institutions you'll need to contact. 2. Create a list of all credit card accounts: Gather statements and go through the deceased person's files to identify all the active credit cards they held. 3. Get in touch with the executor of the estate: If you are not the executor or administrator of the deceased person's estate, contact them as they will be responsible for settling debts and managing the deceased person's financial matters. 4. Contact the credit card companies: As the next of kin, executor, or administrator, call each credit card company and inform them of the account holder's death. You may be asked to provide the deceased person's Social Security Number, account number, and the date of death. Also, provide your contact information, your relationship to the deceased, and a copy of the death certificate, if required. 5. Verify if the deceased had any credit card protection plans: Some credit cards offer protection plans that cover outstanding balances in the case of the cardholder's death. If the deceased person had enrolled in such a plan, find out the process for filing a claim. 6. Pay any outstanding debts, if feasible: Debts of a deceased person are usually covered by their estate. If there are sufficient assets to cover the outstanding debts, you should initiate the process of repaying the credit card balances. Keep in mind that spouses or authorized users may also be responsible for paying off these debts. 7. Monitor the accounts: Track the accounts to ensure that they get canceled and no new charges or fees are added. In case you face any issues, contact the credit card company to resolve the matter. 8. Notify credit bureaus: Report the death to the three major credit bureaus — Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. This is important to prevent identity theft and to ensure that the individual's credit report is updated accordingly. By following these steps, you can handle the process of canceling credit cards after someone is deceased in a smooth and organized manner."},{"instruction":"next question: The shower obviously wasn't in the living room of the home, where was it?

The store, which only opened last Wednesday, will no longer operate its 24/7 drive thru operation because of multiple complaints from local residents. The opening of the store was accompanied by a mania not seen before in Ireland in relation to a food outlet. There was a queue of 300 people when it opened its doors at 7am on its first day of operation. Traffic jams, which resembled the Christmas rush hour, were blamed on customers trying to get access to the Krispy Kreme drive thru last weekend. Furthermore, local residents were disturbed by customers beeping their horns and disturbing people who lived in nearby apartment complexes. One resident, Salim Sanehi, recorded footage of cars beeping their horns at 2.30am on Sunday morning. He posted on his Facebook page: “This is what the people living right next to Krispy Kreme have to deal with now. It’s 2.30am and this sort of noise is what we’ve been dealing with since the grand opening. “This is still going on and now there seems to be people chanting and egging the cars to keep honking. Krispy Kreme hasn’t done anything about their customers’ behaviour. “Also for the people saying, ‘Well it’s your fault for living next to the centre’ have you seen the centre at this hour before? It’s a ghost town. This isn’t expected and it should never be expected, there’s literally no defending this sort of behaviour.” Others have been posting video footage on social media outlets showing long queues in the middle of the night. The company behind Krispy Kreme has concluded that enough is enough. “We are saying to our neighbours, we’ve listened and we’re making changes immediately,” said Krispy Kreme chief executive Richard Cheshire. “For the most part too, our drive thru has been a success. But we know that the late-night noise has been an upset for our neighbours.” The drive thru will be closed with immediate effect between 11.30pm and 6am. There will be a continuation of the traffic management action plan in the area which has sought to minimise the disruption caused by late night queuing.

Translate to English","output":"The European Central Bank must appoint its representative to the committee based on monetary policy, and the member states do the same based on the various components of economic policy. The European Central Bank (ECB) is the institution responsible for the monetary policy of the member countries of the European Union that use the euro as their currency. The ECB's primary objective is to maintain price stability within the euro area, which can contribute to sustainable economic growth and improved living standards. To achieve this goal, the ECB sets key interest rates and manages the money supply. In order to effectively manage the euro area's monetary policy, coordination and cooperation between the ECB and the European Union's member states are essential. This is achieved by the establishment of committees, where representatives from the ECB and the member states work together to exchange information, maintain a common understanding of economic developments, and determine the best course of action to achieve their shared objectives. The ECB appoints its representative to the committee based on their expertise in monetary policy. This ensures that the decisions made within the committee are well-informed and grounded in the principles of sound monetary policy management. Member states of the European Union also appoint their representatives to the committee, but instead of focusing solely on monetary policy, they focus on the various components of economic policy. Economic policy is a broad term that encompasses a range of policies and actions a government might take to influence the economy, such as fiscal policy (government spending and taxation), structural policies (aimed at improving labor market and business conditions), and financial regulation. By designating representatives based on their expertise in economic policy, member states ensure that the committee benefits from a wide range of perspectives and understanding of the diverse economic situations and challenges each nation faces. This allows the committee to develop a more comprehensive approach to achieving economic stability and sustainable growth within their respective jurisdictions and contributes to the overall well-being of the entire European Union."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information: - Tender Mercies is a 1983 American drama film directed by Bruce Beresford.

His cellmate, Gerry, has smeared the walls with faeces from floor to ceiling as part of the no wash protest. The two men get to know each other and we see them living within the cell.

Phoenix woman couldn't walk and was struggling to breathe when rushed to Chandler Regional Medical Center. Discharged in just three hours. Charged 39,652 each for two doses of anti-venom that costs 100 in Mexico.","output":"Title: The Exorbitant Cost of Healthcare: A Phoenix Woman's Struggle After a Scorpion Sting Marcie Edmonds, a 52-year-old woman from Phoenix, Arizona, experienced a terrifying ordeal that shed light on the exorbitant costs of healthcare in the United States. Marcie was going about her daily chores, opening a box of air-conditioner filters in her garage when she was unexpectedly stung by a scorpion. The seemingly minor incident quickly escalated into a life-threatening situation as she found herself unable to walk and struggling to breathe. Given the severity of her symptoms, Marcie was rushed to Chandler Regional Medical Center, where the healthcare professionals tasked with her care administered two doses of the anti-venom, Anascorp. The life-saving treatment worked effectively, and Marcie was discharged from the hospital in just three short hours. But that's when her relief turned into bewilderment and outrage. Upon receiving her hospital bill, Marcie was shocked to discover that she was charged an astounding 39,652 for each dose of the anti-venom medication. This came as a particular shock because Anascorp, the anti-venom she was given, is readily available in Mexico for as little as 100 per dose. The huge discrepancy in pricing between both countries raises some serious questions about the American healthcare system and the financial burden placed on patients. This story highlights the greater issue of the excessive costs of medical care in the United States. Patients like Marcie are often left with crippling debts after seeking life-saving treatments or emergency care. Many find themselves in situations where they are forced to choose between financial ruin and their health, a choice no individual should ever have to make. The exorbitant cost of healthcare often leaves patients struggling to comprehend the discrepancy between the actual cost of medication and the amount they are charged. In Marcie's case, the striking difference between Anascorp's market price in Mexico and the United States exemplifies a broken system and prompts a deeper investigation into the reasons behind it. Various factors contribute to high medical costs in the United States. Some of these factors include lack of transparency in pricing, a complex system of negotiation between hospitals, insurance companies, and pharmaceutical manufacturers, and limited availability of certain medications due to a lack of competition among manufacturers. While there have been efforts by the government to introduce policies aimed at reducing healthcare costs, unfortunately, situations like Marcie's are far too common in the United States. The ongoing debate surrounding affordable healthcare continues to be a critical issue for Americans across the nation. Marcie Edmonds represents countless individuals that have fallen victim to the exorbitant costs of healthcare in America. The tale of her scorpion sting serves as a stark reminder of the inequalities embedded in the healthcare system. It is vital that the government, healthcare providers, insurers, and lawmakers work together to create a more transparent and equitable approach to healthcare, ensuring that no American's well-being is jeopardized by their financial situation. In conclusion, Marcie Edmonds highlights the need for a complete overhaul of the American healthcare system at multiple levels. What began as a simple act of opening a box in her garage led to a staggering medical bill and a clear understanding of the urgent need for healthcare reform. For the sake of Americans everywhere, change is crucial to ensure fair and accessible care."},{"instruction":"Q: \\"Johnny Cash released fewer than five albums while he was alive.\\" Is the above claim true?

She is now charged with attempted first-degree murder and vulnerable adult abuse, according to police and CNN affiliate KTVK. Her husband, whose name wasn't released by authorities, is expected to survive as he recovers in Chandler Regional Medical Center, said Sgt. Joe Favazzo. KTVK reported that Vogel is a registered nurse and was a hospital employee at one time, according to the probable cause statement written by police.

The hospital found a brown substance in the IV line and immediately removed it from his arm, police said. Vogel allegedly tried to drain the fluid from the line into a waste basket, but a nurse intervened, police said. A test revealed the fluid contained fecal matter, police said.

Context: Both gross and tragic. The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage.

Or maybe it did? The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked. Of course no one else was interested in spending an entire night shooting the film – but with them as stands in – just so I could complete my psychotic endeavour of...

Using his discoveries and knowledge of its size and shape, he began to sketch it. In the Library of Alexandria he had access to various travel books, which contained various items of information and representations of the world that needed to be pieced together in some organized format. In his three-volume work Geography (Greek: [Geographika] ), he described and mapped his entire known world, even dividing the Earth into five climate zones: two freezing zones around the poles, two temperate zones, and a zone encompassing the equator and the tropics. He had invented geography. He created terminology that is still used today. He placed grids of overlapping lines over the surface of the Earth. He used parallels and meridians to link together every place in the world. It was now possible to estimate one's distance from remote locations with this network over the surface of the Earth. In the Geography the names of over 400 cities and their locations were shown: this had never been achieved before. Unfortunately, his Geography has been lost to history, but fragments of the work can be pieced together from other great historians like Pliny, Polybius, Strabo, and Marcianus. The first book was something of an introduction and gave a review of his predecessors, recognizing their contributions that he compiled in the library. In this book Eratosthenes denounced Homer as not providing any insight into what he now described as geography. His disapproval of Homer's topography angered many who believed the world depicted in the Odyssey to be legitimate. He also commented on the ideas of the nature and origin of the Earth: he had thought of Earth as an immovable globe; while on its surface was a place that was changing. He had hypothesized that at one time the Mediterranean was a vast lake that covered the countries that surrounded it; and had only become connected to the ocean to the west when a passage had opened up sometime in its history. In the second book is his discovery about the circumference of the Earth. This is where, according to Pliny, \\"The world was grasped.\\" Eratosthenes described his famous story of the well in Syene, described above. This book would now be considered a text on mathematical geography. His third book of the Geography contained political geography. He cited countries and used parallel lines to divide the map into sections, to give accurate descriptions of the realms. This was a breakthrough, and can be considered the beginning of geography. Question: What was he sketching? Answer:","output":"Eratosthenes was sketching a map of the Earth. He used his knowledge about the Earth's size and shape to create this map. In his work called Geography, he described and mapped the entire known world at that time. He divided the Earth into five climate zones and used grids of overlapping lines, like parallels and meridians, to link every place in the world.

As it turned out, Greg would have had a hard time canceling the check, even if he'd changed his mind. Chloe's crew had already sprung into action as soon as they left the building. The company used a computer controlled switchboard to route phone calls and this immediately went down, same for their Internet access. Meanwhile, a crude but effective denial of service attack was launched against their company Web site. If Greg decided to use his cell phone there wasn't much they could do, but the hope was that he'd be so tied up with all this other crap that he wouldn't have time to think of that. Paul didn't think any of that was necessary. Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now. He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway. All he would have done is buy himself a little more time. Chloe and Paul would just march right back in and start all over again - probably after sending out pics of Evan in drag to all the employees. From his point of view, there was no reason for Greg to do that. Of course, it was still a huge risk for Chloe and Paul. If Greg just wanted a delay to get the lawyers involved, then they were in trouble. Chloe and he had broken a fist full of laws in the past twelve hours.

Thompson accomplished this remarkable feat on October 29, 2018, in a game against the Chicago Bulls. During that game, Thompson managed to sink 14 three-pointers, breaking the previous record of 13. Before Klay Thompson, the previous record was held by his teammate, Stephen Curry, who made a total of 13 three-pointers in a game against the New Orleans Pelicans on November 7, 2016. Thompson's record-setting performance came as the focal point of an incredible offensive display by the Warriors, which resulted in a lopsided 149-124 victory for them. In just under 27 minutes of playing time, Thompson scored a total of 52 points, with 42 of them coming from three-pointers alone. He converted 14 of his 24 attempted three-point field goals, achieving a remarkable 58.3% accuracy rate from beyond the arc during the game. Klay Thompson is well-known for his long-range shooting ability and is considered one of the best pure shooters in NBA history. Along with Stephen Curry, he forms the \\"Splash Brothers\\" duo, making the Golden State Warriors a team that is renowned for their exceptional three-point shooting prowess.

Jean Valjean, Javert, Fantine & Marius Pontmercy, The answer is:","output":"Title: \\"Les Misérables: The Four Pillars\\" Our story begins in 19th century France, a time of great upheaval, distress, and despair, with four major characters around which the plot revolves- Jean Valjean, Javert, Fantine, and Marius Pontmercy. Jean Valjean, an ex-convict condemned for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving family, occupies the narrative's heart. Following his release, Valjean fails to find work due to his criminal past, often met with contempt and societal disdain. However, a compassionate Bishop inspires him to commit to a path of righteousness, a catalyst that propels his transformation into a respected town Mayor under a pseudonym. Simultaneously, we encounter Javert, an unwavering lawman with a firm belief in a world governed entirely by absolute rules and uncompromising justice. Javert becomes Valjean's primary antagonist, narratively juxtaposed with our protagonist's journey. Despite his robust moral compass, Javert's unyielding quest to incarcerate Valjean, unaware of his transformed identity, leads him to question his lifelong beliefs as the plot underpins the very discussion about justice, mercy, and humanity. Fantine, a factory worker and an unwed mother becomes an embodiment of the societal oppression faced by women in that era, especially those pushed to the peripheries. Her tragic tale becomes intertwined with Valjean's when he feels compelled to care for Fantine's daughter, Cosette, in a promise he made at Fantine's deathbed. This act of kindness further bolsters Valjean's character development, underlining his transition from a petty thief to a man of great generosity and compassion. Marius Pontmercy, a young, passionate student revolutionary, is the bridge between Valjean's aging generation and the new era that yearns for justice and equality. His love story with Cosette introduces a touching romantic subplot. Marius’s character brings hope and courage, showcasing a young man's readiness to fight for a better tomorrow. The intertwining stories of these four characters create a rich, poignant narrative that mirrors their era's conflict and turmoil. Overarching themes of social injustice, love, redemption, and sacrifice carry through the plot. Layered on top is a delicate exploration of the challenges and implications of personal and social change. As the narrative arc progresses, each character undergoes significant transformations and finds themselves questioning their beliefs—ultimately leading to a heart-wrenching climax where Valjean reveals his identity to save an arrested Marius, disrupting his life of peace. Javert, faced with Valjean's unwavering commitment to saving others over himself, enters a profound existential crisis. The theme 'change of heart' becomes a key element in the storyline driving the character's actions and the plot's complexity. Our saga culminates in a hopeful note, with Marius and Cosette's union, sparking a flame of love and optimism amid the prevailing gloom and despair. The movie concludes with an emotionally charged scene, the death of Valjean, surrounded by his newfound family, having lived a life of redemption and self-sacrifice, bringing his narrative arc to a powerful, poignant end. \\"Les Miserables: The Four Pillars\\" therefore, would be a cinematic masterpiece, marrying complex characters with deeply embedded societal themes, stirring audiences through its characters' profound journeys and their quest for love, redemption, and justice."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer: is the following review positive or negative? BOMB! This place is my favorite Mexican fast food restaurant I have discovered in the Phoenix metro area in the past four years. I'm a first-generation Mexican American so I tend to be fairly picky about Mexican food. Salsita's meets and exceeds all my expectations. They have a wonderful selection of meats, and do not charge you extra to replace meats in the combination plates like other places. For example, if you order a combo that regularly includes a shredded beef burro and would like carne asada instead, you don't have to pay an extra 2-3 like you do at other Mexican places I've been to. They have quite a diverse menu, and serve many different dishes. They also have a salsa bar inside, which is huge indicator to me that a Mexican place is legitimate. The food is tasty, the salsa is spicy when it needs to be, and their guacamole is pretty dang good too. Be careful with other Salsita's locations though.

Answer:","output":"Based on the given information and considering the aspects mentioned in the title and review, it appears that the product review is mixed but leans more negative. Let's analyze the points mentioned in the review to understand the sentiment better. 1. Title: \\"Good at the start\\" - This part indicates that initially, the product met the expectations and had a positive impact on the customer. A good start is always a favorable aspect for a product review. 2. Title: \\"TV died after warranty ran out\\" - This statement demonstrates a significant negative aspect. The fact that the TV stopped working right after the warranty period implies poor durability or possible manufacturing defects. This could lead to dissatisfaction amongst customers as they would have to spend more on repairs or a new TV after investing in the product initially. 3. Review: \\"Bought the unit in October so that we wouldn't miss football action while cooking\\" - This part shows that the product fitted well into the buyer's lifestyle and utility, meeting their needs in an efficient way. It is a positive aspect of the review. 4. Review: \\"Started out great, good tv reception after attaching an outside antenna, good radio reception\\" - Here, the reviewer acknowledges the product's good performance in terms of TV and radio reception. It further reinforces the positive aspects of the product. 5. Review: \\"It's now February, and the TV keeps disappearing and going blank on us\\" - Unfortunately, this statement demonstrates that the product failed to meet the long-term expectations of the customer. The fact that the TV is now having issues within a relatively short period significantly reduces the overall positive impact of the review. In conclusion, though the product review started with positive aspects such as fulfilling the buyer's needs, having good TV and radio reception, and fitting well into their lifestyle, the fact that the TV stopped working shortly after the warranty period reveals the negative side of the review. The durability and reliability concerns expressed by the reviewer would likely deter potential customers. Therefore, while the review does have some positive elements, it leans more negative due to the significant issue of the product's lifespan and performance over time."},{"instruction":"Article: Bolivia is set to pass the world's first laws granting all nature equal rights to humans. The Law of Mother Earth, now agreed by politicians and grassroots social groups, redefines the country's rich mineral deposits as \\"blessings\\" and is expected to lead to radical new conservation and social measures to reduce pollution and control industry. The country, which has been pilloried by the US and Britain in the UN climate talks for demanding steep carbon emission cuts, will establish 11 new rights for nature. They include: the right to life and to exist; the right to continue vital cycles and processes free from human alteration; the right to pure water and clean air; the right to balance; the right not to be polluted; and the right to not have cellular structure modified or genetically altered. Controversially, it will also enshrine the right of nature \\"to not be affected by mega-infrastructure and development projects that affect the balance of ecosystems and the local inhabitant communities\\". \\"It makes world history. Earth is the mother of all\\", said Vice-President Alvaro García Linera. \\"It establishes a new relationship between man and nature, the harmony of which must be preserved as a guarantee of its regeneration.\\" The law, which is part of a complete restructuring of the Bolivian legal system following a change of constitution in 2009, has been heavily influenced by a resurgent indigenous Andean spiritual world view which places the environment and the earth deity known as the Pachamama at the centre of all life. Humans are considered equal to all other entities. But the abstract new laws are not expected to stop industry in its tracks. While it is not clear yet what actual protection the new rights will give in court to bugs, insects and ecosystems, the government is expected to establish a ministry of mother earth and to appoint an ombudsman. It is also committed to giving communities new legal powers to monitor and control polluting industries. Bolivia has long suffered from serious environmental problems from the mining of tin, silver, gold and other raw materials. \\"Existing laws are not strong enough,\\" said Undarico Pinto, leader of the 3.5m-strong Confederación Sindical Única de Trabajadores Campesinos de Bolivia, the biggest social movement, who helped draft the law. \\"It will make industry more transparent. It will allow people to regulate industry at national, regional and local levels.\\" Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca said Bolivia's traditional indigenous respect for the Pachamama was vital to prevent climate change. \\"Our grandparents taught us that we belong to a big family of plants and animals. We believe that everything in the planet forms part of a big family. We indigenous people can contribute to solving the energy, climate, food and financial crises with our values,\\" he said. Little opposition is expected to the law being passed because President Evo Morales's ruling party, the Movement Towards Socialism, enjoys a comfortable majority in both houses of parliament. However, the government must tread a fine line between increased regulation of companies and giving way to the powerful social movements who have pressed for the law. Bolivia earns 500m (£305m) a year from mining companies which provides nearly one third of the country's foreign currency. In the indigenous philosophy, the Pachamama is a living being. The draft of the new law states: \\"She is sacred, fertile and the source of life that feeds and cares for all living beings in her womb. She is in permanent balance, harmony and communication with the cosmos. She is comprised of all ecosystems and living beings, and their self-organisation.\\" Ecuador, which also has powerful indigenous groups, has changed its constitution to give nature \\"the right to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles, structure, functions and its processes in evolution\\". However, the abstract rights have not led to new laws or stopped oil companies from destroying some of the most biologically rich areas of the Amazon. Coping with climate change Bolivia is struggling to cope with rising temperatures, melting glaciers and more extreme weather events including more frequent floods, droughts, frosts and mudslides. Research by glaciologist Edson Ramirez of San Andres University in the capital city, La Paz, suggests temperatures have been rising steadily for 60 years and started to accelerate in 1979. They are now on course to rise a further 3.5-4C over the next 100 years. This would turn much of Bolivia into a desert. Most glaciers below 5,000m are expected to disappear completely within 20 years, leaving Bolivia with a much smaller ice cap. Scientists say this will lead to a crisis in farming and water shortages in cities such as La Paz and El Alto. Evo Morales, Latin America's first indigenous president, has become an outspoken critic in the UN of industrialised countries which are not prepared to hold temperatures to a 1C rise. ||||| Flickr/Phillie Casablanca Bolivia is to pass a law -- called la Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra (The Law of Mother Earth) -- which will grant nature equal rights to humans. The law -- the first of its kind -- aims to encourage a major shift in attitudes towards conservation and to reduce pollution and exploitation of natural resources. It sees a range of new rights established for nature including the right to life; the right to water and clean air; the right to repair livelihoods affected by human activities and the right to be free of pollution. Bolivia is one of South America's poorest countries and is seeing its rural communities suffer with failing crops due to climatic events such as floods and droughts. Temperatures are set to rise by up to four degrees celsius over the next 100 years, while most of its glaciers are likely to melt within 20 years. The Bolivian government -- under president Evo Morales -- will establish a ministry of mother earth and commit to give communities the authority to monitor and control the industries and businesses that are polluting the environment. The belief is that industrial entities can learn from the traditions of indigenous populations who have a deep-rooted respect for the environment. The notion of \\"Pachamama\\" or the spiritual entity similar to the idea mother earth, is increasingly being referred to in governmental discussions and documents. It is not clear at this stage how the somewhat abstract legislation would be implemented. The state will need to be careful to balance the rights of nature with the regulation of industries (such as mining) that contribute a significant chunk of the country's GDP. Bolivia has been extremely forthright in the global arena and has called for developed countries to contribute one percent of GDP to help poor and vulnerable nations. Bolivian Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca has been quoted saying that western development has created a \\"deathly wound to our Pachamama\\".

As the spiritual leaders of their respective Christian denominations, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Pope play crucial roles in fostering understanding and dialogue between their faith communities. Pope Francis arrived in the United Kingdom for a state visit full of carefully planned interfaith dialogues, discussions on shared concerns, and opportunities to celebrate the achievements of both churches in their collaborative works. Part of the Pope's mission during this visit was to engage with the Anglican Communion, which is the worldwide family of churches with the Archbishop of Canterbury as its figurehead, and to stress the importance of working together for the common good. From the moment Pope Francis arrived on British soil, he was greeted with enthusiasm from local communities, religious leaders, and representatives from all walks of life. Archbishop Welby warmly welcomed the Pope and expressed his appreciation for the significant efforts taken by the Holy See towards building bridges during these challenging times. Despite the ongoing theological differences and historical events that led to the schism between the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion, the Pope and the Archbishop engaged in a series of fruitful discussions addressing a range of issues, including the environment, social justice, and the urgent need to combat human trafficking. The visit encompassed numerous events highlighting the shared heritage and common goals between the two churches. One such event was a service of Vespers at Westminster Abbey, where both leaders, along with other dignitaries from the religious and political spheres, prayed side by side for Christian unity and global peace. This solemn event demonstrated the power of coming together despite differing perspectives and held a symbolic importance for both communities. Throughout the trip, both leaders acknowledged the significant historical challenges that have beset their respective churches. However, through open and frank dialogue, they found hope in a shared vision focused on addressing global crises and promoting unity among Christian communities. Archbishop Welby expressed an optimistic outlook, stating that while there may never be full communion between the two churches, there still remains a considerable scope for fruitful partnerships in addressing the world's most pressing problems. The Pope's visit also offered a platform for members of both the Anglican Communion and the Roman Catholic Church to engage in shared acts of charity and community outreach, further highlighting the value of interfaith work. Although differences and divisions still exist between these two global Christian communities, Archbishop Welby's characterization of the Pope's visit as a success marks a promising step forward in efforts to strengthen relationships, promote dialogue, and encourage collaboration on shared goals. The Pope and the Archbishop demonstrated humility and grace throughout their conversations, skillfully navigating the complicated history and present-day dynamics between their respective churches. In doing so, they have set an inspiring example of the potential for deepening spiritual bonds and creating a more united and compassionate world for all."},{"instruction":"The most obvious difference between the brains of mammals and other vertebrates is in terms of size. On average, a mammal has a brain roughly twice as large as that of a bird of the same body size, and ten times as large as that of a reptile of the same body size. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): The biggest difference between brains of mammals and other vertebrates is what?","output":"The biggest difference between the brains of mammals and other vertebrates lies in the structure, complexity, and function of their neural organization. This answer is multifaceted, as there are several key differences between mammalian brains and those of other vertebrates: 1. Neocortex: One of the most significant differences is the presence of the neocortex in mammals, which is absent or greatly reduced in other vertebrates. The neocortex is the outermost layer and largest part of the cerebral cortex, responsible for higher cognitive functions such as sensory perception, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. The neocortex has a more complex cellular organization in mammals, consisting of six layers as opposed to the three layers found in other vertebrates. This increased complexity leads to enhanced cognitive abilities and more sophisticated behaviors in mammals. 2. Corpus callosum: The corpus callosum, a large fiber bundle that connects the two hemispheres of the mammalian brain, is another distinguishing feature. This structure allows for the transfer of information between the left and right hemispheres, facilitating integration and coordination of various mental processes. In other vertebrates, the two hemispheres are connected by a smaller structure called the anterior commissure, which provides less efficient interhemispheric communication. 3. Size: As stated in the initial observation, the average mammalian brain is larger relative to body size compared to other vertebrates. This increased size allows for greater complexity, which enables advanced learning, cognition, and social interaction. 4. Cerebellum: The cerebellum, a region involved in coordinating movement and maintaining balance, is larger and more complex in mammals than in other vertebrates. In mammals, the cerebellum is divided into two hemispheres connected by a structure called the vermis. This division allows for more precise muscle coordination and the execution of complex motor tasks. 5. Limbic system: The limbic system, comprising various structures involved in emotions, learning, and memory, is more developed in mammals. This system enables mammals to have more complex emotional responses and facilitates social bonding and maternal behaviors, which are essential for their survival and reproduction. 6. Olfactory system: In general, mammals have a more advanced olfactory system than other vertebrates, allowing them to detect and differentiate a wider range of smells. This ability is crucial for locating food, identifying potential mates, and avoiding predators. To summarize, the largest difference between mammalian brains and those of other vertebrates is not limited to a single aspect, but rather a combination of structural, functional, and developmental features. These distinctive traits enable mammals to exhibit more advanced cognitive abilities, complex behaviors, and social interactions compared to other vertebrate species."},{"instruction":"Richard Alan Enberg (January 9, 1935 - December 21, 2017) was an American sportscaster. Over the course of an approximately 60-year career, he provided play-by-play for various sports on numerous radio and television networks, including NBC (1975-1999), CBS (2000-2014), and ESPN (2004-2011), as well for individual teams, such as UCLA Bruins basketball, Los Angeles Rams, California Angels and San Diego Padres. Enberg was well known for his signature on-air catchphrases \\"Touch 'em all\\" (for home runs) and \\"Oh, my!\\" (for particularly exciting and outstanding athletic plays). In the late 1960s, Enberg began a full-time sportscasting career in Los Angeles, working for KTLA television (anchoring a nightly sports report and calling UCLA Bruins basketball) and KMPC radio (calling Los Angeles Rams football and California Angels baseball). After every Angels victory, he would wrap up his broadcast with, \\"And the halo shines tonight,\\" in reference to the \\"Big A\\" scoreboard at Anaheim Stadium and the halo at the top, which would light up for everyone in the area to see, particularly from the adjacent freeway. Enberg was named California Sportscaster of the Year four times during this period. In the 1960s, Enberg announced boxing matches at L.A.'s Olympic Auditorium. In 1968, Enberg was recommended by UCLA athletic director J.D. Morgan to be the national broadcaster for the syndicated TVS Television Network to cover the \\"Game of the Century\\" between the Houston Cougars, led by Elvin Hayes and the UCLA Bruins, led by Lew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). The \\"Prime Time\\" nationally televised game demonstrated that college basketball had a national \\"Prime Time\\" audience and stands as a seminal contest in the evolution of nationally televised evening college basketball broadcasts. Enberg continued to call the occasional UCLA game for TVS through the early 1970s, usually teaming with Rod Hundley. In 1973, Enberg traveled to Beijing, China to host the groundbreaking TVS Television Network telecast of the USA vs. China basketball game. It was the first team sporting event ever played between China and the USA. In the 1970s, Enberg called the 1979 NCAA Championship game between Michigan State, led by Magic Johnson, and Indiana State, led by Larry Bird. He also hosted the syndicated television game show Sports Challenge, and co-produced the Emmy Award-winning sports-history series The Way It Was for PBS. In the 1970 opening conference game in Pauley Pavilion, Oregon went into a stall against the UCLA Bruins. Enberg had run out of statistics and began to fill his radio broadcast with small talk. The movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid had just been released, and Enberg was humming the tune to \\"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\\", but did not know the words. Two nights later, in a home game against Oregon State, many UCLA students brought the lyrics to the song. Enberg promised that he would sing the song if UCLA won the conference championship. He sang the song following the final game of the season. The event was recorded in the Los Angeles Times and was later recounted in the book Pauley Pavilion: College Basketball's Showplace by David Smale. During the 2006 NCAA Men's Basketball Championship broadcast, there was a short feature on the event.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What did he do while in Los Angeles?","output":"While in Los Angeles, Richard Alan Enberg \\"began a full-time sportscasting career, working for KTLA television (anchoring a nightly sports report and calling UCLA Bruins basketball) and KMPC radio (calling Los Angeles Rams football and California Angels baseball).\\""},{"instruction":"Q: If \\"A man carrying steel beams across a lumberyard.\\" does that mean that \\"A man building a skyscraper.\\"?

We examine the second statement: \\"A man building a skyscraper.\\" This statement describes a separate task, the construction of a skyscraper. 3. We need to determine if the first statement implies the second statement. To do this, we compare the tasks and locations involved in each statement. 4. In the first statement, we have a man carrying steel beams in a lumberyard. The materials and location do not immediately suggest a connection to skyscrapers, as lumberyards are typically associated with wood products, not large-scale construction projects involving steel. 5.

Self-compassion is crucial to your ability to love others and accept their love. According to researchers, self-compassion involves three elements: Self-kindness. We’re sometimes taught that being accepting and understanding toward ourselves is selfish or narcissistic, but think about it: if a friend made a mistake, would you constantly remind them of how horrible they are, or would you try to be understanding of their error? Extend yourself the same kindness you would to others. Common humanity. It can be easy to believe you’re the only one capable of imperfections and guilt, but making errors and experiencing pain are part of what makes us human. Understanding that you’re not the only person to make mistakes or feel hurt can help you feel more connected to those around you. Mindfulness. Mindfulness has a lot in common with meditation: it’s the idea of recognizing and accepting an experience, without judgment, as you experience it. For example, if you frequently have the thought, “I’m so unattractive, nobody will love me,” a mindfulness approach might be something like, “I’m experiencing the feeling that I’m unattractive. This is just one of many feelings that I will have today.” Recognizing when you are having negative thoughts will help you move your thoughts elsewhere. We are often taught that accepting ourselves is self-indulgent or egocentric, or -- worse yet -- lazy. Instead, we are told that perfectionism and self-criticism are healthy and productive. In fact, they’re not; they are usually based in fear. Self-pity is different from self-compassion. Self-pity is the feeling of “poor me” that you may experience when things don’t go your way; for example, “My colleague got more of the credit for our project than I did. Nothing ever works out for me.” Self-pity focuses only on your problems and often creates feelings of inadequacy. A self-compassionate thought might be, “My colleague and I worked hard on that project, and I feel that I did a good job. I can’t control how others respond to our work.” Self-compassion isn’t laziness. Accepting yourself doesn’t mean that you don’t want to improve yourself. It just means that you won’t be cruel to yourself when you make mistakes. Practicing expressing love for yourself also helps you express it to others. Beating yourself up is not the same as accepting responsibility for your mistakes. A self-compassionate person can still own up to mistakes they make without feeling that he or she is a terrible person. Research has shown that self-compassionate people are actually more likely to attempt self-improvement. While these two sound similar, they have some crucial differences. Self-esteem is what you think and how you feel about yourself, and it’s important to being a healthy, happy person. However, it tends to be motivated by external validation: for example, you may feel attractive because someone compliments your looks. Self-compassion is about accepting yourself, flaws and all, and treating yourself with kindness and understanding. Psychology research has shown that self-esteem is not a reliable indicator of success or even capability. Sometimes, it’s the most confident people who know the least about a situation. Shame is the source of a lot of pain, and we’re very good at producing it. Shame is the profound, enduring belief that somehow, we aren’t worthy: of love, of time, of attention. However, shame is often not related to anything that is actually wrong with ourselves or our actions; it’s an internal judgment. Try to be aware of your thoughts and feelings about yourself. Sometimes shame manifests itself as feeling that you don’t deserve love. Sometimes it presents itself as a fear that if we reveal our true selves, the other person will leave us. These feelings are common, but they are also very damaging. Try affirming to yourself that you do deserve love. This doesn’t come naturally to most people, because we’re often trained to see criticizing ourselves as something positive (for example, it drives one to work harder, improve oneself, etc.). However, there are steps you can take to work on improving your ability to accept yourself. Point out your strengths to yourself. We’re used to making lists of failures, and humans tend to remember negative events and emotions more clearly than positive ones. Take some time each day to write down something positive about yourself. It doesn’t matter so much if you believe it at first. Make a habit of thinking about yourself in positive terms, and you’ll probably become less resistant to believing them. Depersonalize your failures. It can be easy to think “I’m a failure” if you haven’t succeeded at something, but that kind of totalizing thinking devalues you and promotes feelings of shame. Instead, try thinking something like, “I didn’t succeed at _____, but I did the best I could.” Remind yourself that you’re human. Perfectionism can have devastating consequences on the way we view ourselves. Try looking at yourself in the mirror and telling yourself: “I am a human being. Human beings are not perfect, and neither am I. That is okay.” Sometimes, you will do something that you didn’t want to do. Perhaps you scored badly on a test, or hurt a friend’s feelings, or lost your temper with your boss. However, dwelling on those negative occurrences and shaming yourself about them keeps you from viewing them as learning experiences. Instead, accept that whatever happened happened, apologize for it if you can, and come up with a plan of what you will do differently in the future. Accepting your mistakes doesn’t mean pretending they didn’t happen. It doesn’t even mean not feeling bad that they happened. Taking responsibility for your actions acknowledges the mistakes, but focusing on what you can learn from them and how you can avoid them in the future transforms guilt into growth. Summary:","output":"Self-compassion is the act of extending acceptance and empathy towards oneself and is crucial for personal well-being and relationships. It consists of three elements: self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. By practicing self-compassion, you can differentiate between self-pity, which fixates on one's problems, and true compassion, which encourages growth and understanding. Self-compassion is not the same as self-esteem. While self-esteem relies on external validation, self-compassion involves accepting oneself with all imperfections. Practicing self-compassion aids in personal growth and reduces feelings of shame and unworthiness. To improve self-compassion, focus on acknowledging your strengths, depersonalizing failures, and reminding yourself of your humanity. Accept your mistakes, apologize for them if necessary, and learn from them to transform guilt into growth.

However, the Raiders offense struggled to score early, unable to score a touchdown on three offensive possessions in Charger territory in the first half and turning the ball over early. Derek Carr was picked on the fourth play from scrimmage, setting up the Chargers for a chance to take an early lead. However, the Raiders defense forced a fumble and prevented the Chargers from scoring. The Raiders offense could not take advantage, only managing three field goals in the first half by Sebastian Janikowski, however he missed a fourth attempt. Tyrell Williams scored for the Chargers on a 29-yard pass from Philip Rivers and the Chargers took a 10-9 lead into the half. In the second half, the Chargers took a 17-9 lead on Melvin Gordon reception from Rivers. The Raiders answered on a 64-yard pitch and catch from Carr to Amari Cooper, his first touchdown catch of the year. However, the Raiders defense continued its struggles, giving up another touchdown pass from Rivers to Hunter Henry as the Raiders fell behind 24-16. A 48-yard field goal by Janikowski brought the Raiders within five before the Raider defense garnered its third turnover of the game, forcing a Gordon fumble. The Raider offense struggled in response and were left with a fourth and two from the Charger 21-yard line. Continuing with the season's gutsy calls, head coach Jack Del Rio went for it and Carr found Michael Crabtree for a diving catch in the corner of the endzone to give the Raiders their first lead of the game. The Raiders added on from there, scoring a touchdown on a Jamize Olawale one-yard run seemingly salting the game away, 34-24. However, the Raider defense allowed the Chargers to move within three on a 76-yard drive capped by an Antonio Gates touchdown catch. Trailing 34-31, the Charges again moved into Raider territory in the waning seconds of the fourth quarter. Forced to attempt a game-tying field goal, the Chargers fumbled the snap and the Raiders were able to run out the clock. Moving to 4-1 on the season, the first time since 2002, the Raider defense still surrendered over 400 yards for the fourth time in five games this season.

Sony Music Entertainment, a global leader in the music industry, has a rich history that can be traced back to 1929. It was originally founded as the American Record Corporation (ARC) by the merger of several smaller record companies and eventually became Columbia Records in the 1930s. Notably, in 1966 Columbia Records became a part of CBS (Columbia Broadcasting System) and was known as CBS Records. It was not until 1988 when Sony Corporation, a Japanese multinational conglomerate, acquired CBS Records, marking the beginning of Sony Music Entertainment as we know it today. As one of the Big Three music companies, alongside Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group, SME boasts an impressive roster of internationally acclaimed artists and boasts a vast catalog of music recordings and songs. The company's extensive portfolio spans various genres and includes iconic artists such as Beyoncé, Bob Dylan, Michael Jackson, and Bruce Springsteen. The Sony Music Entertainment of today is the result of numerous acquisitions and restructuring efforts, with one of the most notable acquisitions being BMG Music Publishing which happened in 2007. The company was then renamed as Sony BMG Music Entertainment. However, following a corporate restructuring in 2008, it returned to its former name, Sony Music Entertainment. The primary reason for the restructuring was to focus more on the creative aspects of the business and simplify its joint venture-related organizational structure. Operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America (SCA), Sony Music Entertainment's headquarters are located in New York City. The company has a global presence with branches in various countries and regions, including Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. In order to ensure efficient operations, SME has divided itself into various subsidiary labels, such as Columbia Records, Epic Records, RCA Records, and Arista Records among others. Each of these labels is responsible for managing a certain niche or genres, catering to the diverse and expansive clientele that Sony Music Entertainment serves. Apart from its primary focus on music recording and publishing, SME has also diversified its business interests by venturing into areas like touring, merchandising, and artist management, as well as digital streaming. This not only fortifies its position in the music industry but also helps generate additional revenue streams. In recent years, SME has been embracing digital transformation to bring its global music collection to an ever-expanding digital audience. By partnering with leading music streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music, Sony Music Entertainment is able to maintain its competitive edge by keeping up with the trends towards digital consumption. To summarize, Sony Music Entertainment's long and storied history, noteworthy acquisitions, and strategic operational structure have solidified its position as a dominant player in the global music landscape. As the company continues to adapt to the ever-changing environment of the music industry, it remains committed to discovering, nurturing, and promoting exceptional talent and music from around the world."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Would a Bulgarian priest eat a four-course meal on Christmas Eve? If the answer is 'no'; explain the reasoning:","output":"The answer is likely 'no.' In Bulgaria, Christmas Eve, or \\"Badni Vecher,\\" is an important day celebrated with various traditions and customs. One of these customs is to have a traditional vegan meal, which consists of an odd number of meatless dishes, usually ranging between 5 and 13 courses. This is done to honor the fasting period that leads up to Christmas, known as the Nativity Fast, meant for spiritual preparation and purification. A Bulgarian Orthodox priest, who is expected to follow and uphold the customs and spiritual practices of the religion, would not eat a four-course meal on Christmas Eve. Instead, he would most likely join in the traditional meal with his family or congregation, consisting of an odd number of meatless dishes, as this is well-established in Bulgarian tradition and culture. So, the reasoning behind the answer 'no' is that eating a four-course meal on Christmas Eve would go against the Bulgarian Orthodox customs, which prescribe a specific number and type of dishes for the celebration in accordance with religious beliefs and practices."},{"instruction":"red white and blue flag with 1 white star??","output":"As an AI language model, I am unable to create physical objects or images. However, I can help guide you through the process of designing a flag with your specified elements. Here's a step-by-step process that you can use to create a flag with a red, white, and blue color scheme, and featuring one white star: Step 1: Choose the layout of the flag Decide on how you want to arrange the colors (red, white, and blue) on the flag. Some layout options include horizontal or vertical stripes, a tricolor design, or a solid color background with the star in a contrasting color. Step 2: Divide the flag into sections based on the layout If you have chosen stripes, you can create a 1:1 ratio by dividing the flag into equal parts, either horizontally or vertically. If you opted for a tricolor design, you can arrange colors in either the top-left or top-right corner and on the opposite corner diagonally. Step 3: Assign colors to each section Since you want a red, white, and blue flag, you can assign each section with one of these colors. For instance, if you opted for horizontal stripes, you could have the top stripe as red, the middle stripe as white, and the bottom stripe as blue. Step 4: Add the white star When placing the star on the flag, consider its visibility and prominence. You can place the white star in the center of the flag or within a specific section, depending on the flag design and your preference. If you've gone with a tricolor design, it may look nice to put the star in the center of the flag. Step 5: Determine the size and orientation of the star Adjust the size of the star to ensure that it is proportionate to the size of the flag. You may want to make it prominent and large enough so that it is easily visible. The star's orientation can be with one point up, or you can align the top point with the top edge of the flag. Step 6: Finalize the design Review your flag design to ensure that it aligns with your vision. Make any necessary adjustments to color, spacing, or star size to perfect your design. Now you have a complete design for your red, white, and blue flag with one white star. You can use a graphic design software or work with a professional designer to create a digital or physical version of your flag."},{"instruction":"Write a question you would see in a school textbook.","output":"Why do birds fly in a V shape when they travel long distances?"},{"instruction":"What is the solution to this math problem?

First, let's add the candies with the same colors (the q's): -768*q and 772*q are like two different bags of candies.

A: Answer:","output":"The name for the process where pollen is transferred to the ovules of a seed plant is called pollination. Pollination is a crucial phase in the reproductive cycle of seed-producing plants. It occurs when the male reproductive cell, or pollen grain, from a plant's anther (the part of the stamen that bears the pollen) comes into contact with the female reproductive cell (gamete) or ovule, which resides within the pistil (the female reproductive organ) of another plant or within the same plant in self-pollinated species. There are two primary types of pollination - self-pollination and cross-pollination. 1. Self-pollination: This occurs when pollen from a plant's anther is transferred to the stigma (the receptive surface of the pistil) of the same plant or genetically identical individual. Self-pollination can happen through different mechanisms, such as the bending of the flower parts or the anther release of pollen later in the flowering stage after the ovule has matured. 2. Cross-pollination: In this type of pollination, pollen from an individual plant is transferred to the stigma of another genetically different plant. Cross-pollination encourages genetic diversity, which can lead to plants that are more resilient, adaptable, and likely to survive in various environmental conditions. Cross-pollination can be facilitated by various agents, including wind, water, insects, and animals such as birds and bats. Some common ways in which cross-pollination is facilitated include: 1. Wind pollination: Many seed plants, including grasses, conifers, and some deciduous trees, rely on wind to disperse their pollen. These plants produce vast amounts of lightweight pollen, which becomes airborne and travels distances, increasing the chances of reaching the stigma of another plant. 2. Animal pollination: Some plants have evolved specialized mechanisms to attract pollinators, such as insects, birds, bats, or rodents. Brightly colored flowers, pleasing scents, and nectar rewards encourage animals to visit these plants. As the animals move from flower to flower to collect nectar or pollen, they inadvertently transfer pollen from one plant to another, facilitating pollination. 3. Water pollination: Relatively rare and confined to some aquatic plants, this pollination type occurs when pollen is released underwater or onto the water surface, drifting to other plants via water currents. Pollination is a vital process in the lifecycle of seed-producing plants, allowing them to sexually reproduce and create the next generation of their species. This process results in the formation of seeds, enabling the plant to propagate and spread into new environments, ensuring the survival and evolution of diverse plant life across the planet."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film opens with a montage showing a group of young, bald boys receiving tattoos of bar codes and being instructed how to utilize firearms & hand-to-hand-combat by other men observing, directing and co-ordinating the training so that these boys can grow up to become professional, international hitmen-for-hire trained and raised by the very same organization that employs them.Interpol agent Mike Whittier discovers Agent 47 in his study, where the two talk briefly.

He plans his escape and buys a ticket out of town to go to a special school in England, which he's been saving up for by writing papers for students in the school. His best friend is getting picked on by the school bully, Annelie (Tuva Novotny), a rather violent young girl who is often neglected. She gets caught stealing and comes to believe that Niklas snitched on her. Her gang beats up Niklas' friend until he lies and says that it was Niklas that told everyone, thinking that Niklas has already gone to England. The gang tracks down Niklas and nearly beats him to death. The next morning Niklas walks out of the forest without a scratch on his body and seems a little unnerved. When he gets to school, everyone is ignoring him and he can't figure out why. He realizes that he is invisible after he throws a book at the wall, and the book stays in its original spot. He can touch and move things, but the second he looks back, the object is back in place. The twist occurs when a bird dies by flying into a window, and Niklas recognizes that he is still alive, but dying in the woods. Annelie finds out that it was actually her boyfriend who snitched on her because she didn't want to give him his part of the stolen things. Niklas is left helpless as he watches his mother and the police hunt for his body. His friend commits suicide over the event and leaves a letter for his parents and the police, who eventually find Niklas' body, which by this stage is lifeless and on the very edge of death. The film ends with Annelie admitting to the crime, turning herself over to the police and turning off Niklas' life support so that both are free.

Question: suppose hurting mitosis to proceed normally happens, how will it affect a SMALLER greenhouse effect. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","output":"C: no effect To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between mitosis, greenhouse effect, and global warming. Mitosis is the process of cell division, during which a parent cell duplicates its genetic material and divides into two identical daughter cells. This process is essential for growth, development, and tissue repair in living organisms. It plays no direct role in the greenhouse effect or global warming. The greenhouse effect, on the other hand, refers to the natural process that takes place in Earth's atmosphere where particular gases, known as greenhouse gases (GHGs), trap heat radiated from the Earth's surface. Some of this heat is re-radiated back towards the Earth, maintaining the planet's overall temperature. In general, the greenhouse effect is vital for life on Earth, as it keeps the planet's temperature within a suitable range for living organisms. Global warming occurs when this natural process is amplified due to an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, resulting in GHG emissions, cause a rise in global temperatures which leads to a range of environmental and climatic consequences. Now, supposing we hurt mitosis, causing it to not proceed normally, the effect on the greenhouse effect would essentially be negligible. This is because the greenhouse effect is governed by physical and chemical processes in the atmosphere, such as the absorption, reflection, and emission of radiation, rather than biological processes like mitosis. Additionally, a smaller greenhouse effect cannot be directly affected by changes in mitotic processes. Any changes in mitosis would impact the growth and development of organisms and might, in certain cases, indirectly affect the global ecosystem. However, this would not specifically influence the behavior of greenhouse gases and Earth's radiation balance. In conclusion, hurting mitosis to prevent it from proceeding normally would not have a direct effect on the greenhouse effect, either making it larger or smaller. So, the answer is C: no effect. The two phenomena are related to the biological process of life and the atmospheric process of heat retention, respectively. They operate in different domains and are not interconnected in a way that would cause changes in mitosis to influence the greenhouse effect."},{"instruction":"Read this and answer the question The Russian SFSR was controlled by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, until the abortive 1991 August coup, which prompted President Yeltsin to suspend the recently created Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

Answer: A tonsillectomy is a surgical procedure that removes the tonsils, which are glands found in the back of the throat. Its primary purpose is to address issues related to the tonsils, such as infections or sleep apnea. Hepatitis, on the other hand, is a disease that targets the liver and is typically caused by viral infections, toxins, or autoimmune diseases. Since a tonsillectomy focuses on the tonsils and not the liver, it is unlikely to have a direct impact on hepatitis or liver health. However, any surgical procedure can carry risks, so it is important to discuss your specific situation with a healthcare professional if you have concerns about potential interactions between the tonsillectomy and existing health conditions like hepatitis."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: On the Berlin subway, university student Cheryl gets off at her stop in the deserted subway station and is pursued by a mysterious, masked man.

One of the prostitutes, Rosemary, scratches her face with a bizarre display mask before they go in to watch the film. The film is a violent, disturbing horror movie which features a look-alike of the mask from the lobby. It is about four teenagers who discover an old tomb and dig up the grave of a sixteenth-century fortune teller called Nostradamus. When the teenagers dig up Nostradamus's coffin they find no body, just an old book and a mask identical to the strange mask in the foyer.

She made a desperate plea for a bone marrow donor. And we're happy to report that she found a perfect match! We interviewed 36-year-old Susie Rabaca last week. Her twins are due next week and she has three other children. She was diagnosed with an aggressive form of leukemia just a few months into carrying her twins and needs a bone marrow transplant to survive. None of her family members are matches and no matches were found on the worldwide registry. But once people saw Susie's story yhey registered with the bone marrow registry and wanted to help. 40,000 people registered and one of them was a perfect match! Susie plans to do the procedure after her twins are born in about a week. EARLIER: A Carson mother of three who is set to give birth to twins in two weeks is begging the public for help in saving her life after she was recently diagnosed with the most aggressive form of Leukemia. Susie Rabaca was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in September, and doctors tell her she will need a bone marrow transplant to save her life. “So a couple months ago I found out I had leukemia, so I’m looking for a match, a bone marrow transplant match,” Rabaca told FOX 11. “There’s 30 million people registered on BeTheMatch.org and none of them are my match, so what I need people to do is join and they send you a kit, a little swab for your mouth, send it back, and if you’re my match it’s as simple as a blood draw, and that can possibly save my life.” Rabaca says her children and her family have been her support system through the emotional process, but said they are all scared for her. “My 4-year-old, she just holds my hand, grabs my bald head, she just yeah, she’s my Little Rock,” she said. Because Rabaca’s DNA profile is a mix of Caucasian and Latina, it’s more complicated to find her a bone marrow match. Unfortunately, only her sister came remotely close with five out of ten necessary traits matching. She needs somebody to match all ten, and she is begging people to register on Join.bethematch.org/Susie to potentially save her life. “Finding my match is everything to me, so I can be here for the three children I have, and the two that I have on the way, it’s everything,” she said. “It’s so easy, there’s no painful procedure, there’s no surgery it’s just swab your mouth and it’s as simple as a blood draw, and you can save somebody’s life, if not mine, somebody elses.” ||||| EMBED More News Videos Susie Rabaca, who has leukemia, is expecting twins and needs a bone-marrow transplant to save her life.

But for the process to work, the donor needs to be a close match. There are some 30 million people on the worldwide registry, but a match has not yet been found for Rabaca.Rabaca is already a mother of three. Her sister is a 50 percent match, but doctors say it's not good enough to treat her aggressive acute myeloid leukemia.She needs a 100 percent match, but Rabaca's mixed heritage - Latino and Caucasian - has made finding a donor difficult.Rabaca and her family have been on a mission to sign up as many potential donors as possible.The registry is particularly in need of people with mixed ethnic heritage - not just to help Rabaca, but for many other potential recipients without a match.Registry officials say the donations that came in over the weekend were more ethnically diverse than average, another good sign for Rabaca.Once someone has signed up on the registry they will receive a testing kit in the mail. After obtaining a cheek swab sample and sending it in, lab processing can take up to two months.Doctors hope they can find a match and give Rabaca a transplant as quickly as possible after she gives birth.Rabaca has one hope this holiday season: \\"To find my perfect match.

Sometimes, though, AML can start in other types of blood-forming cells. Although there’s no cure, there are treatments that can make a big difference. What Happens Acute myeloid leukemia starts in the bone marrow. This is the soft inner parts of bones. With acute types of leukemia such as AML, bone marrow cells don't mature the way they're supposed to. These immature cells, often called blast cells, keep building up. You may hear other names for acute myeloid leukemia. Doctors may call it: Acute myelocytic leukemia Acute myelogenous leukemia Acute granulocytic leukemia Acute non-lymphocytic leukemia Without treatment, AML can quickly be life-threatening. Because it's \\"acute,\\" this type of leukemia can spread quickly to the blood and to other parts of the body, such as the: Lymph nodes Liver Spleen Brain and spinal cord Testicles Each person is different, and how acute myeloid leukemia affects them depends on certain things, including how well the cancer responds to treatment. Your outlook is better if: You are younger than 60. You have a lower white blood cell count when you're diagnosed. You do not have a history of blood disorders or cancers. You do not have certain gene mutations or chromosome changes. Causes and Risk Factors Doctors often don’t know why someone gets AML. But they do know about some of the “risk factors” for the condition. Those are things that make you more likely get it. Acute myeloid leukemia risk factors include: Smoking Exposure to certain chemicals such as benzene (a solvent used in oil refineries and other industries and present in cigarette smoke), certain cleaning products, detergents, and paint strippers Some chemotherapy drugs used to treat other cancers, such as mechlorethamine, procarbazine, and chlorambucil -- especially when combined with radiation therapy Exposure to high doses of radiation Certain blood disorders such as myeloproliferative disorders (for example, chronic myelogenous leukemia) Some birth defects and disorders, such as Down syndrome Being male Although there is no way to completely prevent AML, you may lower your risk by not smoking and avoiding exposure to chemicals. ||||| A woman from Southern California who is expecting twins in two weeks desperately needs a bone marrow donor to help her beat the cancer she was diagnosed with earlier in her pregnancy. Just a few months into carrying her two babies, Susie Rabaca, 36, began to feel ill, she told ABC 7. Already a mother of three children, Rabaca’s twins are due Dec. 6. Get push notifications with news, features and more. After a trip to the doctor, Rabaca discovered the unimaginable: she had developed an aggressive form of acute myeloid leukemia — a cancer that starts in the bone marrow and often moves to the blood, reports the American Cancer Society. To save her life, doctors told the San Pedro native she would need the “perfect” bone-marrow transplant match. Her sister instantly offered to undergo the procedure but was disappointed to learn she was only a 50 percent match, which doctors explained wasn’t good enough, according to ABC. Because of the severity of the cancer, Rabaca, who is half-Latino and half-Caucasian, needs someone with a 100 percent match. Finding that person, however, has proven to be incredibly difficult.

Article: The Lunar New Year, which starts in late January this year, is the most important festival for Chinese people as most of them drop any business at hand to go back to their hometown to see their families. It is a tradition that has been cherished since ancient times, but as social mobility increases in modern times, the road to family reunions has become very uneasy. It is not the higher travel costs, nor the expected big spending on gifts and other festival items, but the train ticket that has driven many travelers mad. I've heard some colleagues complain that they have tried every means to secure a train ticket, only to find it a mission impossible. Some of them have turned to the latest software to aid online booking; others have sought help from friends to increase the possibility of successful booking. No doubt chunyun, the Spring Festival travel season, is the largest-scale annual human migration in the world. Last year, 220 million passengers traveled by train during the Spring Festival season, which usually lasts 40 days. It is a huge jump from 10 years ago, when the number was 128 million. With the big sudden increase in demand, the railway company has increased investment in railway construction; still, it cannot bridge the supply gap, leading to fierce public complaints and criticism. Admittedly, it is almost impossible for the railway company to suddenly improve its capacity to meet the explosive demand during the Spring Festival holiday. Moreover, any temporary increase in capacity would become unnecessary after the holiday and mean great commercial losses during the off season. What the company can reasonably do is gradually improve its capacity while focusing on better distribution of its existing resources during the special peak season. At any rate, however, the problem cannot be solved overnight. Question: Which word can be used to best describe the way to solve the problem only by increasing capacity? Options: A: Expensive B: Effective C: Hopeful D: Impractical Answer:","output":"D: Impractical"},{"instruction":"Translate to Finnish: Now, it is pending a decision on signature from the Council.

Translate each element separately: - \\"Now\\" = \\"Nyt\\" - \\"pending\\" = \\"odotetaan\\" - \\"a decision on signature\\" = \\"päätöstä allekirjoituksesta\\" - \\"from the Council\\" = \\"neuvostolta\\" 3. Combine the translated elements following Finnish grammar rules and sentence structure: - \\"Nyt odotetaan päätöstä allekirjoituksesta neuvostolta.\\" Justification for the translation: In Finnish, the verb is typically placed in the second position in a sentence. Thus, \\"odotetaan\\" (pending) is placed after \\"Nyt\\" to maintain the standard sentence structure. The phrase \\"päätöstä allekirjoituksesta\\" (a decision on signature) is translated as a noun phrase and placed after the verb to make it the object. Lastly, \\"neuvostolta\\" (from the Council) is added at the end of the sentence in the ablative case, which shows the source or origin of the action."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return. Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies. Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Alexis (Manny PÃ©rez), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison.

They both tell the reader that Peraza was crowned Miss Venezuela in the year 1976, but she had to resign her title on May 24, 1976, due to getting married just two days after her crowning or coronation. The differences between the two sentences mainly lie in their structure and choice of words. In the first sentence, \\"In 1976, Peraza was Miss Venezuela\\" is used to present the information about the year she held the title. In the second sentence, the year is integrated into the title itself, stating that \\"Peraza was Miss Venezuela 1976\\". Another difference is the choice of words used to describe the event when she became Miss Venezuela. The first sentence uses the word \\"crowning,\\" while the second sentence uses \\"coronation.\\" While both words refer to the same event - the moment she officially became Miss Venezuela - they have slightly different nuances. \\"Crowning\\" emphasizes the act of placing the crown on her head, while \\"coronation\\" refers to the entire ceremony of becoming Miss Venezuela. However, these nuances do not alter the overall meaning of each sentence. In summary, although there are some differences in wording and structure between the two sentences, they both convey the same essential information about Peraza being Miss Venezuela 1976 and her eventual resignation due to marriage.

So, it is quite possible that Cameron will be invited to perform at another event or may even choose to organize their own show. Audiences, promoters, and other comedians tend to appreciate a great performance, which can lead to further opportunities, collaborations, or networking within the comedy scene. In addition to performing at another comedy show, there are several potential paths for Cameron to explore as a result of their successful performance: 1. Joining a comedy troupe or group: This can help Cameron refine and expand their skills by working with a team of other comedians, improving their stage presence and understanding of comedic timing. 2. Exploring different comedy genres: Cameron may choose to delve deeper into various comedy styles, such as stand-up, sketch comedy, or improvisational comedy, allowing them to grow and diversify as a performer. 3. Participating in comedy festivals or competitions: These events often provide comedians more exposure to both audiences and industry professionals, as well as networking opportunities with fellow performers. 4. Developing a regular gig or residency at a local venue: This can help Cameron build a dedicated following and allow them to experiment with different material over time. 5. Creating online content: In the digital age, many comedians have found success through online platforms such as YouTube, podcasts, and social media. Cameron could explore these avenues to reach a broader audience and potentially attract more opportunities and invitations to perform. In conclusion, while it is not guaranteed that Cameron will have another comedy show due to various factors such as personal choice and external circumstances, given the information that they were funny and successful in their performance, it is a valid assumption to consider \\"have another show\\" as one possible outcome.

The caps are too high Given those answer options, answer the question: U.S. President Donald Trump is sending a 4.4 trillion budget request to Congress that includes money for a southern border wall and building up the military, but is projected to increase the federal deficit by more than 1 trillion. White House officials all but acknowledged the proposal unveiled Monday has little chance of becoming law — Congress alone controls federal government spending. But the White House insisted the budget proposal still sends an important message about Trump's priorities. \\"This is a messaging document,\\" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters at a briefing Monday. The Trump budget calls for major cuts to domestic programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps. But the plan would still not balance the federal budget, in part because of reduced federal revenue due to tax cuts passed last year. Democrats widely rejected the plan. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the proposal a \\"brutal collection of broken promises and staggering cuts.\\" The proposal's failure to eliminate debt is also likely to upset some Republicans, who have traditionally opposed budget deficits. \\"It's simply adjusting to the Washington, D.C., we live in,\\" Mulvaney said, stressing that the new budget plan would help \\"turn the tide\\" on national debt. The White House proposal builds on the massive, two-year spending bill passed last week by Congress and signed by the president. That bill includes a major boost for the military, as well as domestic programs. Mulvaney, a former lawmaker and long-time opponent of federal debt, has acknowledged he likely would not have supported the bill were he still in Congress. But he said the new White House proposal does not mean that all of the money approved by Congress must be spent. \\"These are spending caps, these are not spending floors,\\" he said. Under the two-year budget deal reached last week by Congress, the Pentagon will get a record-high 700 billion for 2018 — fulfilling a Trump campaign pledge. \\"We took care of the military like it's never...

Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. An MTV-style film crew consisting of American T.V. programme producer Zack Zardine (Matt Borlenghi) his camerawoman, the Australian Cecily (Kate Fisher) and two surfer 'dudes' named Bog Hall (Dax Miller) and Jeremy (Joel West) arrive on some nice looking island somewhere, it's not actually revealed where. The crew plan to shoot an expose on 'bloodsurfing' which is apparently the latest craze in extreme sports. Surfers throw bait into the sea and cut themselves to attract sharks, just to see if they can out-surf them without being eaten. Once there they are greeted by Sonny Lofranco (Cris Vertido) and his wife Melba (Susan Africa). Their search for the perfect location leads them to the shark infested waters of Lilo-Cay. Sonny, Melba and their daughter Lemmya (Maureen Larrazabal) take them in their boat. Soon after arriving and having already shot some 'bloodsurfing' footage Sonny, Melba and Lemmya are all killed by a 30 foot saltwater crocodile that some say 'owns' the island. The boat is sunk. Zack, Cecily, Bog and Jeremy appear stuck on the island until such time a rescue party arrives. However, after a run in with some, erm well I don't really know what they are. Pirates? Drug smugglers? Revolutionairies? Fat ugly people who just don't like being with other people? Who knows? And more importantly who cares? Not me that's for sure. Anyway, after escaping from these guys who look like pirates, they are picked up just off the coast of the island by Captain John Dirks (Duncan Regehr) and his girl Arty (Taryn Reif as Tara Reif). The film crew believe they have been saved. Little do they know that the crocodile and Captain Dirks go way back and he has a score to settle and four members of a film crew aren't going to stop him. Captain Dirks heads back to Lilo-Cay for a final showdown with the giant man-eating crocodile.Directed by James D.R. Hickox this is one awful film, but it's still not as bad as Tobe Hoopers Crocodile (2000). Everything about this film sucks. The script by Sam Bernard and Robert L.Levy is terrible, extremely slow as the crocodile isn't even seen or mentioned before the 30 minute mark and by that time I was seriously bored and annoyed with the hideously unlikeable characters thought up by Bernard and Levy. The whole film is also frustratingly predictable as well, within the first 10 minutes anyone familiar with horror film stereotypes and stock characters will be able to guess who dies and who will survive. The crocodile effects are awful and seem to be repeated over and over, there is a small puppet head that obviously has someones arm stuck inside it controlling it's movements as the water splashes become huge! The CGI shots of the crocodile are just plain embarrassing to watch. There is no gore apart from when a character is bitten in half which is achieved using CGI to digitally remove the actors legs, again it looks terrible. There is also a brief scene when someone is impaled on wooden spikes when they set a trap off. There is a reasonable amount of nudity and sex, plus the female actresses are nice and easy on the eye. There are basic continuity and logical errors in the film too, in one sequence Cecily is filming Bog and Jeremy 'bloodsurfing' but from the angle and distance she is at it would be physically impossible to obtain footage of both the sharks and surfers at the same time, and surely that is the whole point of her shot? When Dirks manages to harpoon the crocodile the angle of the wire changes dramatically between shots, in one shot the angle of the line looks like it's coming from the sky, in the shot straight after the angle is completely different and it seems as if the line is coming from below the surface of the water when in actual fact the harpoon is attached to the back of the boat and the line should be almost level with the surface. I could carry on, like why does the crocodile jump off the edge of a cliff if it's so smart as this film tries to make out? But I would probably exceed the 1000 word limit if I listed everything that was wrong with this film, so I won't. I hated this film, but rather scarily it's still not as bad as Tobe Hoopers effort at a giant crocodile film. Definitely one to avoid.

It was released in 1959 and features an ensemble cast, showcasing brilliant performances by John Wayne, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, Angie Dickinson, Walter Brennan, and Ward Bond. Howard Hawks, born on May 30, 1896, in Goshen, Indiana, was one of Hollywood's most influential and celebrated directors. With a career spanning over five decades, he directed various films across different genres, making a mark with his unique directorial style that seamlessly blended action, drama, and humor. Throughout his illustrious career, Hawks has been credited with discovering several talented actors and shaping their careers, effectively leaving an indelible mark on the history of cinema. Rio Bravo is an exceptional portrayal of the classic Western genre, depicting the story of a showdown between a small town sheriff and a group of outlaws. John Wayne stars as the stoic, no-nonsense Sheriff John T. Chance, with Dean Martin playing his sympathetic sidekick, the alcoholic gunslinger Dude. Together, with the help of their allies, they strive to protect the town from the villainous Burdette brothers (played by Claude Akins and John Russell), who are determined to free their youngest brother from jail. Both John Wayne and Dean Martin deliver captivating performances in Rio Bravo. Wayne's portrayal of the rugged, strong-willed sheriff showcased his legendary on-screen presence and masculinity, while Martin showcased his impressive acting range, transitioning from his typical musical and comedic roles to a more dramatic and complex character. Their chemistry in the film was a testament to their acting skills and contributed significantly to the film's success. The film is also notable for its thrilling action sequences, a strong sense of camaraderie among the lead characters, and a well-written screenplay by Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett. Moreover, it features an original score composed by Dimitri Tiomkin, which adds to the excitement and tension throughout the story. Rio Bravo was a box office success and received positive reviews from critics, further cementing Howard Hawks' reputation as a visionary filmmaker. To this day, it is considered a classic Western and one of the finest films in both Hawks' and Wayne's careers. The film has been preserved in the United States National Film Registry for its cultural, historical, and aesthetic significance and serves as an excellent example of the Western genre in American cinema."},{"instruction":"Here is some data: American Civil War, commander, Robert E.

In both contexts, 'pop' is informal, but the meaning varies. The first instance, \\"Pop the pizza into the microwave oven,\\" uses \\"pop\\" as a verb synonymous with \\"put\\" or \\"place.\\" This casual use of \\"pop\\" gives the impression of a quick and easy action, perhaps underlining the convenience of heating food in a microwave.

Make this lower case.","output":"There are several issues that can contribute to the corruption of WinRAR archives. These issues can include virus infection, errors in the file system, application crashes, and software conflicts. In order to better understand these issues and their potential impact on WinRAR archives, it's essential to examine each one in more detail. 1. Virus Infection: Viruses are malicious software programs that are capable of infecting computers and causing a variety of problems. One of the possible effects of a virus infection is the corruption of files, including WinRAR archives. When this occurs, the archive may become inaccessible, partially damaged, or entirely overwritten, rendering it unusable for its intended purpose. 2. Error in the File System: The file system is the method that your computer uses to organize and manage files on the storage device. If an error occurs within the file system, it can lead to file corruption, including corruption of WinRAR archives. Common file system errors can include bad sectors on a hard drive, improper shutdowns of the computer, and power surges. 3. Application Crash: When an application crashes, it suddenly stops working and may cause the data being accessed or processed at the time of the crash to become corrupted. If a crash occurs while working with a WinRAR archive, this may lead to corruption of the archive itself, making it inaccessible or unusable. 4. Software Conflicts: In some cases, conflicts between different software programs installed on a computer can cause issues, including corruption of files. This can happen if two programs try to access or modify the same WinRAR archive simultaneously or if an application has a bug that impacts the proper functioning of other software. To minimize the risk of WinRAR archive corruption, it's crucial to practice good computer maintenance habits, such as keeping antivirus software up-to-date, regularly scanning for malware, ensuring that your file system is free of errors, and being cautious when installing new software or updating existing programs. Should you encounter a corrupted WinRAR archive, there are several steps you may take to attempt to recover or repair the data: 1. Use the \\"Repair\\" feature in WinRAR: This built-in tool can sometimes fix minor corruption issues within an archive, making it accessible again. 2. Restore from a backup: If possible, restore a previous version of the WinRAR archive from a backup source. 3. Use a third-party file recovery tool: If the corruption is more severe, you may need to employ a specialized file recovery tool to help recover and repair the data contained within the corrupted WinRAR archive. 4. Seek professional assistance: In cases of extreme corruption where the aforementioned methods have not been successful, it may be necessary to seek the help of a data recovery expert to salvage the contents of the damaged archive."},{"instruction":"You are given a new situation: Bob is a biologist.

To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy.

Soured by the turn of events, Grodman sets out to make Buckley look too inept to perform his new job. He enlists the aid of his macabre artist friend, Victor Emmric, and when a mysterious murder occurs, they realize their chance to ruin Buckley may have arrived. Answer:","output":"The question you could ask about the movie plot is: \\"In the story where George Edward Grodman seeks to expose John Buckley's incompetence after being wrongly dismissed from his position as a superintendent at Scotland Yard, how do Grodman and his artist friend Victor Emmric use the mysterious murder to ultimately ruin Buckley's career?\\" The story is set in 1890 at Scotland Yard, where George Edward Grodman has been respected as a skilled superintendent. However, a mistake made during an investigation leads to the wrongful execution of an innocent person. Shouldering the blame for this tragic turn of events, Grodman is dismissed from his position and is replaced by the insufferable John Buckley. Grodman's frustration with these circumstances motivates him to seek revenge against his replacement and demonstrate that Buckley is not fit for the position. Grodman teams up with his friend Victor Emmric, a macabre artist, to work out a plan to discredit and embarrass Buckley. Their opportunity arises when a mysterious murder takes place. Knowing that the entire city would be highly interested in the resolution of this case, they see it as the perfect chance to undermine Buckley's reputation and publicly display his inability to perform his job properly. As Grodman and Emmric devise their plan, they carefully study the details of the murder and collect any relevant evidence. They may decide to tamper with or conceal key evidence that would have made solving the case easier for Buckley. Alternatively, they could plant false clues to send Buckley and his team in the wrong direction. Regardless of their chosen tactic, their ultimate goal is to make it impossible for Buckley to solve the case. At the same time, they carefully monitor Buckley and his team throughout the investigation, ready to exploit any signs of incompetence. They may even use their inside knowledge of Scotland Yard procedures to interfere with or sabotage Buckley's progress. If possible, they could put themselves in a position to feed misleading information directly to the investigators, or even to the public, casting even more doubt on Buckley's abilities. As the investigation progresses, Buckley's inability to solve the murder becomes increasingly evident. His seeming incompetence attracts public scrutiny, and he becomes the subject of ridicule in newspapers and among the broader London population. As the case remains unsolved, the consequences for Buckley intensify, eventually putting his career and perhaps his life at risk. In conclusion, as tensions rise, the question concerning how George Edward Grodman and Victor Emmric capitalize on the mysterious murder to expose John Buckley's incompetence generates a captivating storyline filled with deception, intrigue, and consequences at every turn."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

We have the equation: 59*t + 59*t = -118 Now, first, we need to add the same things together. We have two 59 multiplied by 't', so we can add them together: (59*t) + (59*t) = 2*(59*t) So now our equation looks like this: 2*(59*t) = -118 Next, to find 't', we need to get it alone. To do this, we start by dividing both sides of the equation by 2: (2*(59*t)) / 2 = -118 / 2 This simplifies to: 59*t = -59 Now, we need to divide both sides by 59 so we can find what 't' is by itself: (59*t) / 59 = -59 / 59 This gives us: t = -1 So the solution is t = -1.

A study by Hong Kong University found that brightness levels in the southern Chinese city's popular shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui were 1,200 times greater than the international dark sky standard. The crowded city of 7 million residents , full or residential high-rises, towering office blocks and neon advertisements, has no laws to control outdoor lightning. The result is that light pollution is thought to be much worse than in other large cities, including London, Sydney, Tokyo and Shanghai. \\"In Hong Kong , you can't go anywhere outdoor in the evening without your eyes being blinded by this really disturbing outdoor lightning,\\" the light pollution survey's head Jason Pum told AFP. \\"The fact that we have all this light in the sky means energy is wasted,\\" he said, adding that too much artificial lightning also affects nightly wildlife. Research has suggested that light pollution can cause a number of harmful health effects in humans, including sleeplessness and headaches and can also interrupt body clocks and hormones . The university survey, the result of five million measurements taken from points across the city, was released just days before the start of the annual Earth Hour event, organized by the World Wildlife Fund. People around the world will be encouraged to turn off the lights for an hour on Saturday night to raise awareness of climate change. Last year, a number of Hong Kong's major buildings along Victoria Harbour went dark to mark Earth Hour. \\"Anyway, we should do our best to reduce the amount of lightning and adjust it for the benefit of the environment.\\" A:","output":"Which of the following statements is true about Hong Kong's light pollution according to the article?

See options at the end Elena wanted so badly to be a member of Emily 's clique, and Available choices: [A]. Elena certainly showed her enthusiasm to join. [B]. Emily certainly showed her enthusiasm to join.","output":"Elena wanted so badly to be a member of Emily's clique, and Elena certainly showed her enthusiasm to join. This desire stemmed from her admiration for Emily and her friends, who were seen as the epitome of cool and fashionable in their social circle. However, Elena's journey to becoming a member of Emily's clique was not an easy one, as it involved her having to navigate the complex dynamics of teenage friendships, adapt her own interests, and demonstrate her compatibility with the group's values and ideals in order to secure her place among them. Ultimately, Elena's perseverance paid off, showing that her passion for being part of this group was stronger than any potential obstacles. From the moment Elena set her sights on becoming a part of Emily's clique, she embarked on a carefully thought-out plan to catch Emily's attention and the attention of her friends. Knowing that her own interests and hobbies were different from that of the clique, Elena began to explore and participate in the activities her potential new friends enjoyed. By doing so, she was able to find common ground with Emily and the other members, and provide ample opportunities for conversation and bonding. Elena could often be found attending the same parties and events where Emily and her friends were present, eagerly trying to make her presence known without coming across as overly eager. Elena opted for a subtle yet effective approach in which she would casually converse with Emily whenever they crossed paths, gradually fostering their friendship. In these interactions, Elena took the time to listen to what interested Emily and her friends, and to share her own stories and inside jokes in order to create a sense of camaraderie. As time went on, Elena's persistence began to pay off, with Emily and her friends slowly becoming more receptive to her presence and attempts to forge connections. To further integrate herself within the clique, Elena began to closely follow the fashion trends and styles that her potential new friends favored, ensuring that her image fit the mold of their group. This also extended to her social media presence, where she posted photos and content that were in line with the interests of Emily's clique, demonstrating how much she desired to fit in. However, Elena also understood the importance of maintaining her individuality and making her own unique contributions, all while ensuring that she did not clash with the clique's established traditions and practices. She brought her own talents and ideas to the table, which helped to enrich and deepen the clique's existing bonds and activities. For example, Elena had a talent for photography and suggested they collaborate on a photo shoot, which was a big hit and ultimately became a regular outing for the group. Through her determination, intelligence, and genuine enthusiasm to join Emily's clique, Elena eventually succeeded in becoming a valued member of the group. While at times the journey was demanding, she managed to navigate the treacherous waters of teenage friendships and remain true to herself in the process. Elena's story serves as a testament to the power of perseverance and a reminder that the pursuit of one's goals, even in the realm of social circles, can lead to success if approached with skill, dedication, and the unwavering enthusiasm that Elena showcased."},{"instruction":"Information: - Out of the Past (billed in the United Kingdom as Build My Gallows High) is a 1947 film noir directed by Jacques Tourneur and starring Robert Mitchum, Jane Greer, and Kirk Douglas.

Which is the best summary of this article?","output":"A suicide bomber triggered a massive explosion in a Shia mosque in Pakistan during prayer time, resulting in the tragic death of at least 16 individuals and causing injuries to many others. The devastating event took a heavy toll on the lives within the congregation, causing not just immediate harm but having a potential long-term emotional and psychological impact on the survivors, their families, and the broader community. The perpetrator of this heinous crime deployed a powerful device, presumably intended to cause maximum carnity and chaos. This extremist act, much like similar instances of terrorism worldwide, was probably motivated by religious and sectarian animosities. Pakistan, being a predominantly Muslim country with a significant Shia minority, has long been grappling with sectarian violence. This catastrophic incident reiterates the plight and imminent danger faced by places of worship during prayer times. These spots are often targeted as they offer maximum crowd gathering, making them a vulnerable spot for potential terror attacks. The tragedy brings to light the need for rigorous security measures and law enforcement vigilance to prevent such horrifying incidents from recurring. The death toll and number of injuries indicate the severity of the blast, suggesting the use of a high-grade explosive designed to inflict widespread destruction. The physical damage to the mosque is likely extensive, further disrupting the local community's spiritual activities. Additionally, the event is destined to leave emotional scars on the victims and the Pakistani Shia community, possibly exacerbating fears and tensions in an already volatile environment. This deadly attack underscores the broader issue of religious violence and radical extremism, both in Pakistan and globally. It invites worldwide condemnation and calls for firm action from local and international authorities against those responsible and their supporters. Furthermore, it underlines the importance of promoting interfaith dialogue, religious tolerance, and mutual understanding to ensure a safer world for all faiths. In summary, the terrible suicide bomb attack on a Shia mosque in Pakistan highlights the ongoing threat of sectarian violence and the urgent need for focused efforts to prevent such tragedies. It also exemplifies the terrible human cost of extremism and violence, pressing the need for international cooperation and robust security measures to protect innocent lives. Finally, it underscores the importance of fostering a culture of tolerance and peaceful coexistence among different religious communities."},{"instruction":"Information: - Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada.

But in Y.S. 375 of the First Age Morgoth sent out an Orc - raid against them . The Men were caught off - guard , and a great part of their people was wiped out . The remnant was gathered under one Haldad and his twin children , daughter Haleth and son Haldar ; and they held out for days in a stockade until the Noldor rescued them , by which time both Haldad and Haldar were slain . Caranthir offered to Men his lands to live in protected , but Haleth refused , for now she was chosen a Chieftain , being of great heart and no less in valour than her kinsmen . Next year she led her people to Estolad ; and after a time again urged them to move further westward . They passed through the horrors of Nan Dungortheb only by the strength of Haleth 's will , and at last came to the woods of Talath Dirnen . Later many removed the forest of Brethil , which was a part of Doriath outside the Girdle of Melian , but now was granted to them by Thingol . Haleth ruled the Folk of Brethil until she died . She was buried in a green mound in the heights of the Forest , which was called therefore the Ladybarrow ( Haudh - en - Arwen in Sindarin and Tûr Haretha in their own tongue ) . The next Chieftain of Brethil was her nephew Haldan . - Norse mythology is the body of mythology of the North Germanic people stemming from Norse paganism and continuing after the Christianization of Scandinavia and into the Scandinavian folklore of the modern period. The northernmost extension of Germanic mythology, Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities, beings, and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period, including medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition. - Middle-earth is the setting of much of J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. The term is equivalent to the term \\"Midgard\\" of Norse mythology, describing the human-inhabited world, i.e. the central continent of the Earth in Tolkien's imagined mythological past. Tolkien's most widely read works, \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", take place entirely in Middle-earth, and \\"Middle-earth\\" has also become a short-hand to refer to the legendarium or its \\"fictional universe\\". - In the fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien, the First Age, or First Age of the Children of Ilúvatar is the heroic period in which most of Tolkien's early legends are set. Versions of these stories were later published in \\"The Silmarillion\\", and tales from this period lend a deep sense of time and history to the later period in which the action of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" takes place. - The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel written by English author J. R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel \\"The Hobbit\\", but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold. - Midgard (an anglicised form of Old Norse ; Old English , Swedish/Danish \\"Midgård\\", Old Saxon , Old High German , Gothic \\"Midjun-gards\\"; literally \\"middle yard\\") is the name for Earth (in the sense of oikoumene) inhabited by and known to humans in early Germanic cosmology, and specifically one of the Nine Worlds in Norse mythology. - John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, (3 January 1892 2 September 1973), known by his pen name J. R. R. Tolkien, was an English writer, poet, philologist, and university professor who is best known as the author of the classic high-fantasy works \\"The Hobbit\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and \\"The Silmarillion\\".

Vaudreuil wrote back that there was no need to send another general, as Vaudreuil disliked the tactics of most \\"municipal\\" French generals. When Montcalm arrived despite Vaudreuil's protest, the two men developed a dislike for each other. Lévis diplomatically cultivated good relations with both men, and managed to avoid getting dragged into the feuds between the two. Lévis led the vanguard of the French expedition to Fort William Henry in 1757, and laid siege to it until Montcalm's arrival. During French planning for the 1758 campaign in the French and Indian War the disputes between Vaudreuil and Montcalm continued. Vaudreuil prevailed, and Montcalm was sent to Fort Carillon to defend it against an expected British attack. Lévis was initially slated to lead an expedition to the western forts, leading about 500 French metropolitan troops and a large seasoned French-Canadian militia. Vaudreuil, however, had second thoughts, and dispatched Lévis and his metropolitan troops to support Montcalm at Carillon. Lévis arrived at Carillon on the evening of July 7, as a British army was arriving before the fort. The next day, in a stroke of good fortune for the defenders, the 16,000 strong British army under the command of General James Abercrombie decided to frontally attack the French defenses manned by about 4,000 men, without the benefit of artillery support. In the Battle of Carillon, the British were decisively defeated, with Lévis leading the defense on the French right flank. Based on the above article, answer a question.

By the time we were about to reach our house, we spot two dogs, a German Shepherd and a Husky, both male, on the other side of the street sniffing around with no owner in sight. I was ready to hightail out of there with my dog, but I knew if I ran they would chase, so we formed a wall in front of her to hide her. Of course she decides to stick out her head and start barking. Those two dogs whipped their heads so fast and came running towards us to see her. Since she is a puppy she has zero impulse control and starts throwing herself at them, at their backs, face, plus the fact that she doesn’t like being sniffed at her rear (which they are trying very hard to get to). Here I am nervously sweet talking to them, my voice trembling saying good boys. My grandma is her despair grabs the GS’s neck, and his hair bristled and growled for a second before turning back to our pup. At this point my baby girl is sitting down with her tail tucked close, ears flattened, and head down. I thought “Dear Lord someone’s losing a limb today.” When suddenly this car comes pulling up and this man comes out with a leash, the owner. He practically had to wrestle the GS into the car. A woman in a pickup truck comes next trying to get the husky but he ran away again, but my mom didn’t care, she scooped up our pup and ran, the leash trailing behind her, and even my grandma who has troubles in her knees speed walked.

The sentence is put together correctly and makes sense."},{"instruction":"Give the rationale and then the answer. Is the following sentence factually correct? \\"Capitalism, along with socialism, is one of the most used economic systems in the world.\\" Options: - yes - no","output":"Rationale: The sentence is discussing two economic systems, capitalism and socialism, and making a claim about their prevalence in the world. To determine the factual correctness of this sentence, we need to understand the definitions and basic principles of capitalism and socialism and then examine the popularity or implementation of these economic systems across different countries. Capitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership of resources, production, and distribution, where the prices, production, and distribution of goods are determined by competition in a free market. The primary goal in capitalism is to generate profits, and it typically emphasizes individualism and limited government intervention in markets. Socialism, on the other hand, is an economic system in which the government or the community as a whole owns and controls the means of production, distribution, and exchange. This system aims to achieve equality and fair distribution of wealth and resources, with more government intervention and regulation to ensure that basic needs are met for all citizens. Answer: - Yes The sentence is factually correct because capitalism and socialism are indeed two of the most used economic systems in the world. Most countries implement a blend of both systems, with variations in the degree of government intervention and private ownership. For example, the United States largely follows a capitalist economic system, while many European countries, such as Sweden and Denmark, practice a mix of capitalism and socialism, commonly referred to as social democracy or democratic socialism. The diverse range of economic systems worldwide can be placed on a continuum between pure capitalism and pure socialism."},{"instruction":"Choose from: (1). The journalists. (2). Benedykt. (3).

In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition. The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A \\"Bingo Star\\".

It was a late autumn evening, and she had just moved into her quaint but charming old house on the outskirts of a picturesque little town. Exhausted from the day of unpacking and organizing, she had decided to treat herself to a quiet walk through the woods that outlined her property. There, amid the sounds of rustling leaves, her attention was captured by a pitiful meow, barely audible beneath the cacophony of the forest. Dutifully, she followed the faint sound, her maternal instincts kicking in, until she stumbled upon a tiny, shivering bundle of fur entangled in a thorny thicket. Her heart ached at the sight of the helpless creature, and with tender care, she carefully disentangled the poor kitten and swaddled it in the softness of her favorite scarf. They had been inseparable ever since that fateful day. Every now and then, the woman felt as though the cat knew she had saved its life and seemed to express its gratitude through small acts of affection, like curling up on her chest on a cold winter night or welcoming her home with a symphony of excited purrs. As the only living thing she shared her home with, the cat had become her constant companion and confidant, providing her with solace and stability in the midst of life's many trials. Together, they had experienced the gamut of human emotion – the joy of new beginnings, the heartache of loss, and the quiet triumph of enduring love.

He gladly paid out of pocket for ointments and creams for incidental cuts and bruises. But what he really needed was a biopsy, a 200 procedure that, given the location of the mass in his neck, could not be done safely in the back of a van. We could find no medical office willing to schedule an appointment for a man without identification. One private hospital sent us a typed note: “This unfortunate gentleman will not be eligible for services here.” We told Carlos to go to the emergency room of the public hospital, San Francisco General. He was not yet sick enough to be formally admitted, though, so he sat on a gurney for six hours and was charged 1,085 for a bag of intravenous salt water he didn’t really need. He was passed a note instructing him to “follow up with your primary care provider.” The hospital eventually gave him an appointment for a biopsy; it was scheduled in five months and three weeks. Carlos kept the yellow appointment slip in the front pocket of his overalls. He would bike with it; his sweat stained the paper until the edges wore thin. “I will not miss this,” he said whenever we reminded him of the date. As a temporizing show of support before his biopsy, we would see him every Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. He would roll in, wheezing, but would smile after a brief breathing treatment or 15 minutes with a heating pad on his shoulder. During those early weeks of September, the health care debates raged on television. We watched as President Obama told Congress that illegal immigrants would not get health care coverage. We heard someone yell, “You lie!” On any given day, the bodies of illegal immigrants lie in San Francisco’s coroner’s office, found by police or firefighters in alleys or on sidewalks, unclaimed and unnamed. Before they died, their medical costs may well have been passed on to taxpayers. But it’s also true that many were taxpayers themselves. From 2000 to 2005, illegal immigrant workers paid an estimated 6 billion to 7 billion in Social Security taxes and about 1.5 billion to Medicare, according to the Social Security Administration. And the president’s Council of Economic Advisers has estimated that illegal immigrants pay 80,000 more in taxes per person than they consume in government benefits over their lifetimes. The question of whether to insure Carlos and others like him is really a decision about whether to pay now or later — that is, to pay for preventive medical care now, or to pay in the future for hospital and emergency services, or for the internment of unclaimed bodies. Carlos stopped coming to his appointments. Our driver would wait an extra 30 minutes for him to reappear, brushing off demands from traffic cops to make way for the evening restaurant crowd. Weeks passed. Carlos’s friends from the docks approached the van, wondering if we had seen him. Early one morning, a clerk at the public hospital handed me a message. Carlos’s red bike had turned up at a police auction. Sold, for 32. I fear the growth in his throat may have been cancer, that it may have killed him. The coroner’s office cannot tell us, but it would not be that surprising, really. At the age of 50, Carlos already had surpassed by an entire year the average life expectancy of a migrant laborer in the United States.

Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe","output":"This news article from The New York Times narrates the case of Carlos, an undocumented worker, demonstrating the significant challenges he faced in accessing medical care in the United States. Carlos had a mass on his neck and needed a biopsy, a procedure he couldn’t obtain without identification or pay for out-of-pocket due to its 200 cost. When he visited a public hospital, he was not admitted due to his condition not being severe, incurring over 1000 for intravenous treatment. An appointment for the required biopsy was scheduled nearly six months away, despite the urgency of his condition. The piece concludes with Carlos failing to show up for further appointments and his whereabouts are unknown after his bicycle is found at a police auction. The fate of Carlos highlights the issue of undocumented immigrants' healthcare access, debating whether to cover preventive care costs now or deal with disastrous consequences, including emergency services and interments, later. The article also underscores the fact that many undocumented immigrants, despite their status, contribute billions of dollars in taxes while utilizing fewer government benefits.

How do you use little words like in, on, of and for? There are two answers to this. First, do some study with new words. Keep a list of verbs like look for, look after and so on. Second, read as much English as possible. There are many things that can't be learnt. You must see them in books many times. Then you'll be able to use them correctly yourself. So, in order to write well, you must first learn to read much. Question: Which of the following is right according to the passage? Answer: Select from: (a). It's better to listen to English for a long time every day. (b). At the beginning, you'd better choose the tapes on which the people speak quickly. (c).

(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo provided the perfect riposte to FIFA president Sepp Blatter after scoring a hat-trick as Real Madrid beat Sevilla 7-3 on a night when Gareth Bale grabbed his first goals at the Bernabeu. Days after Blatter had made a bizarre impersonation of the Portuguese while saying the star spent \\"a lot of money at the hairdressers\\", the 28-year-old scored his third career hat-trick against Sevilla to go top of the scoring charts in Spain with 11 goals. He celebrated his first goal from the penalty spot with a military salute in a mocking response to Blatter's description of him as a \\"commander\\" last week. The absorbing victory also allowed Real to put Saturday's defeat by Barcelona behind them, not just because of the three points but also because Bale, the most expensive footballer in history, began to repay some of his fee. Making his first start as a home player at the legendary Bernabeu, the Welshman scored twice, made another two and also managed to complete his first 90 minutes in his seventh appearance for Madrid. Despite Bale's largely anonymous display at Camp Nou, which was blamed on a lack of match practice, Real coach Carlo Ancelotti was wholly vindicated by his decision to keep faith in the 24-year-old, who curled home a fine opener before a free-kick was deflected in as he handed Real a 2-0 lead. On a satisfying night for the hosts, for whom substitute Xabi Alonso made his first appearance of the season after injury, Karim Benzema also grabbed a brace as Real moved up to third in the table, six points behind Barca. 1.

Suddenly, thousands of unidentified ships appear and open fire. The Earth fleet's (EDF) warships counterattack, but are quickly overwhelmed. Blue Noah is damaged critically. On one of the failing support ships, Captain Yuki Mori Kodai, wife of the protagonist Susumu Kodai, orders her ship to do an emergency warp, but for some reason, she vanishes mysteriously after the warp. Thirty-eight-year-old Susumu Kodai, having quit the EDF sometime after Final Yamato, becomes captain of the cargo vessel \\"Yuki\\". He picks up the distress signal from the crippled Blue Noah and quickly arrives at the wreck with a boarding party. Without warning, three ships of the enemy fleet arrive. With Kodai at the helm, Blue Noah has just enough power to cover a small distance and fire one shot. Kodai's precise timing and maneuvering destroys all three ships. Later, at the Headquarters of the EDF, Commander Sanada discusses with Kodai about the approaching black hole. Kodai also learns that his wife became lost in the battle. Sanada wants Kodai to lead the Third Emigration Fleet, saying he should follow his wife's example of volunteering.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the person's has diabetes happens, how will it affect owls have better eyesight. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests a change or disturbance in the circumstances that directly or indirectly affects the system. In this case, the hypothesis suggests that if a person has diabetes, it could potentially affect the owl's eyesight. However, it seems unlikely that such a connection exists, considering that a person's health condition is not generally associated with an owl's physical capabilities. To analyze the potential impact of this perturbation on the process, let's examine each step of the process involving an owl hunting for prey: 1. The owl leaves his nest: A person having diabetes would seemingly have no impact on the owl's decision to leave its nest. 2. The owl flies out into the night: The ability to fly at night is a part of an owl's natural adaptation. A person's diabetes would not have any direct or indirect influence on the owl's flying ability. 3. The owl looks down at the ground: An owl's ability to look down at the ground and search for its prey remains unaffected by a person's diabetes. 4. The owl's keen eyesight allows him to see in the dark: Owls have specialized eyesight, which enables them to see better in low light conditions. This trait is not influenced by the health condition of any human, including a person with diabetes. 5. The owl's sensitive hearing allows him to locate hidden prey: Owls have an excellent sense of hearing, which also helps them locate prey in the dark. A person's diabetes would not affect the owl's hearing ability. 6. The owl swoops down: The owl swoops down to catch its prey based on its natural instincts and abilities. These abilities are not affected by a person's diabetes. 7. The owl catches a mouse in his talons: This final step of the hunting process is also a part of the owl's natural behavior and is not influenced by a person's health condition, including diabetes. In summary, the supposed perturbation of a person having diabetes does not seem to have any direct or indirect effect on the process involving an owl hunting for prey. The owl's eyesight, hearing, and other abilities are intrinsic to the owl's physiology and are unrelated to human health conditions. Therefore, this particular perturbation hypothesis does not appear to hold any validity in terms of impacting the given process."},{"instruction":"Languages typically provide more than one grammatical construction to express certain types of messages.

Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings \\"Here Come the Tears\\" from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.Opeth's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth's \\"epic, progressive death metal style\\". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth's sound as incorporating \\"the likes of folk, funk, blues, '70s rock, goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style.\\" In his review of Opeth's 2001 album Blackwater Park, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, \\"Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.\\" Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music.

Given the context: What does Kai need to do before this? Possible answers: Dash away from them, Run away from them, Ask about Jan´s work new project","output":"Before going to Jan's house, Kai should have taken into consideration the sensitivity and confidentiality of the information related to Jan's new job project. Rather than directly trying to pry information from Jan, Kai could have taken a different approach. Here is an alternative course of action Kai could have taken: 1. Establish a good rapport with Jan: First and foremost, Kai should take the time to develop a solid foundation of trust and goodwill with Jan. By nurturing their friendship, Kai can ensure that any conversation they have is based on mutual understanding, respect, and support. 2. Show genuine interest in Jan's life: Before delving into sensitive topics, such as Jan's new job project, it is important to establish an atmosphere of genuine concern and care for the person's well-being. Kai should take some time to ask Jan about other aspects of his life, showing his interest in knowing more about who Jan is, what he likes, and what he values. 3. Respect boundaries: Recognize that there might be limits to what Jan is willing to share. If Jan is hesitant to divulge information about his new job project, it is crucial for Kai to understand and respect those boundaries. It is not appropriate to pressure someone into revealing confidential details. 4. Bring up the topic casually: After establishing a comfortable atmosphere, Kai could subtly broach the subject of Jan's new job project. By mentioning it in passing or asking general questions about his work, Kai could give Jan the opportunity to volunteer as much or as little information as he feels comfortable sharing. 5. Listen attentively: When Jan shares details about his life, including information about his new job project, Kai should demonstrate that he is genuinely interested in what Jan has to say. Active listening will show Jan that Kai respects his perspective and values his insights. 6. Offer help and support: Depending on the nature of Jan's new job project, Kai might be able to lend his expertise or provide valuable resources. By extending a helping hand, he can foster a sense of collaboration and camaraderie between them. 7. Maintain confidentiality and trust: If Jan does open up about his new job project, it is of utmost importance that Kai respects and honors the trust that has been placed in him. He must not disclose any sensitive information to others and must maintain the confidence that Jan has entrusted him with.

By Meghan Keneally PUBLISHED: 21:02 EST, 18 July 2013 | UPDATED: 02:53 EST, 19 July 2013 Trayvon Martins parents have opened up about their fears for their remaining son, saying that while they still have faith in the justice system, they are now more afraid about what they should tell Trayvon's older brother. 'I'm very afraid right now because i have no clue what to tell him. I have no clue if I should tell him to run or walk, I have no clue if I should tell him to defend himself or just lay there,' Sybrina Fulton said of her son Jahvaris. 'When I heard the verdict, I kind of understand the disconnect: they didn't see","output":"Trayvon Martin in their minds. They didn't see a teenager; they saw a young, black male, maybe someone who was threatening to them.' This heartbreaking revelation from Trayvon Martin's parents illustrates the deep-rooted racial issues and fears they, like many other black families in America, face daily. Their son Jahvaris is left with the challenge of navigating a society that, at times, appears to judge him based on the color of his skin rather than the content of his character. As the story continues to unfold, Trayvon's family becomes determined to fight for justice and turn their tragedy into an opportunity for societal change. They work closely with civil rights activists, attorneys, and other families who have lost loved ones to senseless acts of violence. Fueled by their grief and desire for justice, they establish The Trayvon Martin Foundation, whose mission is to raise awareness about racial profiling, advocate for policy changes, and provide support for families impacted by gun violence. Meanwhile, protests and public outrage increase across the country. The Zimmerman verdict ignites discussions about racial profiling, gun control, and the controversial 'Stand Your Ground' law. Eventually, these conversations promote a revision in certain policies and laws that, too often, disproportionally affect minority communities. As the story comes to a conclusion, Trayvon's older brother Jahvaris grows up witnessing the tireless efforts of his parents in fighting for justice, and he becomes an advocate for change himself. He pursues higher education, obtaining a degree in criminal justice or social work, and actively engages in community organizations that address racial disparities and promote equality and justice. Although Jahvaris remains ever-mindful of the racial realities and discrimination that he and other black men face, he carries his brother's legacy with pride and determination. Through heartfelt activism, he honors the beautiful, multifaceted, and full life that Trayvon was not able to live. Jahvaris stands as a beacon of hope, a loving testament to his brother's memory, and a shining example of how resilience and perseverance can transform pain into progress. As he navigates his own journey, he becomes part of a larger societal change, where, little by little, the fears that his parents held for their sons' futures begin to fade, and a fairer and more inclusive society emerges."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Shopping for clothes is not the same experience for a man as it is for a woman.

For a chance to win an Un Amore custom-designed KitchenAid Stand Mixer from PartSelect, I have been thinking about the top three “would likes” for our new kitchen and decided to check out what KitchenAid has to offer!

Big Brother has always been a good eater, open to trying just about anything we put in front of him. However, discovering that he actually does have some control over what he does, he’s lately turned up his nose on occasion. Little Brother is exactly like me when I was young. He turns his nose up at just about anything. Although he did just spend a week with his grandparents and decided he would eat and make up for lost meals…and make me out to be a liar! Anyway, I keep reminding myself as I find myself challenged at mealtimes, that soon enough, they’ll be eating us out of house and home.

A:","output":"Theodor Schwann, a prominent German physiologist and one of the key founding figures of the cell theory, was born in the country of Germany. He was born on December 7, 1810, in the city of Neuss, which is located in the present-day state of North Rhine-Westphalia. During Schwann's time, Germany was not yet unified as a single nation; it was a conglomeration of independent German-speaking states, territories, and cities, collectively called the German Confederation. The region where Schwann was born was actually part of the Kingdom of Prussia, which would later play a significant role in the unification of Germany in 1871. Theodor Schwann is best known for his groundbreaking work in cell biology, particularly for his establishment of the \\"cell theory\\" in 1839, alongside fellow scientist Matthias Schleiden. As part of this theory, Schwann posited that all living organisms, whether plant or animal, are made up of cells as the fundamental structural and functional units. Schwann's education and research took place in some of the renowned German academic institutions of his time. After completing his primary and secondary education in his hometown, he began studying medicine at the University of Bonn. He later continued his studies at the Humboldt University of Berlin and ultimately completed his medical degree in 1834 at the University of Würzburg. Throughout his scientific career, Schwann remained active in Germany's academic community, teaching and contributing to the domain of anatomy, physiology, and histology. In addition to his work on cell theory, he made significant advancements in our understanding of the digestive system, notably by discovering the enzyme pepsin in the stomach and outlining its role in digestion. To summarize, Theodor Schwann was born in Neuss, then part of the Kingdom of Prussia, within the German Confederation, which is now modern-day Germany. His contributions to cell biology and the establishment of cell theory have left a lasting impact on science, shaping our understanding of the fundamental nature of living organisms."},{"instruction":"Write an article using the following points: Former servicemen went to fight after seeing Alan Henning murder by ISIS.

Among those deeply affected were two former British servicemen, who decided they could not stand idly by as innocent people were killed. Compelled by their conscience and sense of duty, these ex-soldiers embarked on a mission to fight against ISIS alongside fighters from the US, Europe, and Kurdish forces. Taking a Stand: The graphic video of Alan Henning's murder left many feeling helpless and horrified. However, for these former servicemen, it was a call to action. \\"We could not stand by and watch innocent people being killed,\\" one of them said. The pair, aged 24 and 26, traveled to the Middle East and joined the fight against ISIS, determined to make a difference. International Coalition: The two ex-soldiers found themselves in the company of fighters from various countries, including the US and Europe, who were all united in their determination to stand up against the extremist organization. Together with the Kurds, the newly-formed cohort engaged in multiple battles against ISIS forces. Echoes of the Past: As they fought alongside their international compatriots, the ex-servicemen found themselves reminded of World War I. The term 'no man's land,' often used to describe the uninhabited strip of land between two enemy positions, frequently came up. The pair couldn't help but draw parallels between the two wars, a century apart, but sharing similar themes of camaraderie and sacrifice. A Harrowing Homecoming: Upon attempting to return home for Christmas, the former servicemen were questioned extensively at the border. The pair recounted their reasons for traveling to the Middle East to join the fight against ISIS, explaining that they were driven by their convictions and the desire to protect innocent lives. Facing New Fears: Now back in the UK, the two ex-soldiers find themselves grappling with a new set of concerns. They fear reprisals from radical elements within their own country, who might target them for having fought against ISIS. Despite these fears, the pair remains steadfast in their beliefs and their commitment to taking a stand against the extremist group. Conclusion: The enormity of ISIS' atrocities, such as Alan Henning's murder, has resonated deeply with people from all walks of life. For these two former servicemen, it proved to be a turning point – a moment that inspired them to actively join the fight against extremism. While they now face new challenges and fears, their actions serve as a testament to the power of conviction and the unwavering determination to stand up against terror, even in the face of personal risk."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Adam Disney, 28, and his unknown partner also pulled down window drapes in the bedroom during the tryst following a night out in Liverpool. A court heard that instead of going to one of their houses, they were unable to contain their passions and let themselves into a bedsit that Disney used to rent. Unfortunately for Disney, he was spotted hanging out of the property’s window enjoying a post-passion cigarette. Passion: The building (centre) containing the flat where Adam Disney brought down drapes and made the bed collapse. He admitted criminal damage. The betting shop was not thought to be involved. Amorous: Adam Disney's bed collapsed when he sneaked into his old flat in Wavertree High Street, Liverpool (pictured). A court heard it was the best he and his partner could do without offending public decency. Police visited the flat in Wavertree High Street after neighbours heard 'noises', Liverpool magistrates heard. They found Disney in the empty flat - his companion had already left - and first charged him with burglary until he admitted the full story. Dan Lupton, defending, blamed 'sexual antics' and said: 'This is a curious case of the morning after the night before. 'They had been drinking and the couple were passionate in their interest to have sexual relations. 'On this occasion they were seeking to avail themselves rather quickly.

Disney, of Widney Lane, Solihull, admitted criminal damage to the double bed and curtain rail, but denied breaking the windowsill when he leaned on it. Chairman of the bench Stan Golding ordered him to pay £355, split into a £100 fine, £85 costs, £150 compensation to the owner and a £20 victim surcharge. The flat's owner had asked for £500 and claimed the lock was damaged, but Mr Lupton described the premises as a 'shabby bedsit'. He said: 'The windowsill was loose and they hadn’t done a good job of securing the curtain rail.

The Michigan city that sits roughly 60 miles north of Detroit is currently under a state of emergency after it was discovered that residents were exposed to unsafe levels of lead from the city's water system. And the fallout is starting to hurt its already-bruised real estate market. The 2008 housing crash that sent the nation's economy into a tailspin hit Flint particularly hard. \\"They lost about 75% of real estate [value] in the city of Flint,\\" said Rob Moen, an associate broker at Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices. \\"Homes today are selling for maybe 50% of what they were selling for in 2005.\\" Flint hasn't experienced a price rebound like other markets have in the past few years, and many residents remain underwater. \\"Anyone that bought their home in the early 2000s in Flint with a mortgage is still upside down on their house and they aren't able to move because they can't sell it,\\" said Moen. Related: How to help with the Flint water crisis In the past couple of years, Flint's housing market was just starting to get back on its feet, but the water crisis has been a \\"momentum killer,\\" said Chris Theodoroff, a real estate agent and president of the East Central Association of Realtors. The median home price in Flint is 14,000, according to the ECAR. And it's clear that the water problems have become a concern since well water is now on many buyers' wish lists, Moen said. \\"All of a sudden, we started getting people asking for houses with well water, they didn't want city water.\\" Real estate agent Jonathan Schlinker said Fannie Mae recently rejected an all-cash offer from his client on a foreclosure the agency owned because of the water crisis. (Fannie Mae has temporarily taken homes it owns in Flint off the market to conduct water tests.) \\"My buyer is aware of the water issue, and is still willing to purchase with cash,\\" said Schlinker. \\"Now it's sitting there empty and can't be sold at all.\\" Theodoroff recently had a buyer walk away after making an offer, citing the water crisis, though he suspects the real culprit was the amount of renovation needed. Another problem is that many lenders now require tests that prove a property's water is safe before issuing a loan. But sales in Flint haven't stopped completely. In the first two months of this year, 116 homes were sold in the city. The cheapest sold at 1, while the most expensive came in at 249,000. Moen listed a home this week for 12,500 and has already received two all-cash offers above the asking price. The offers came from a single mom with kids and a city employee looking for a shorter commute. And while Moen said the home's water tested fine, the owner told him she wasn't using it and that it gave her rashes. \\"She has about 40 cases of water stacked up.\\" Related: Flint crisis creating bull market for water stocks Buyers in Flint right now tend to be young couples, investors and renters looking to take advantage of depressed prices and low interest rates. Rent in the city for a single-family home is about 400-500 a month, according to local real estate agent Bonnie Kehoe. \\"It's a good time to buy,\\" she said. \\"You can buy a house and the payment is less than if you were to rent a house.\\" But renters are also more likely to leave the city since they aren't tied to mortgage. Flint has the highest vacancy rate in the country, with 1 in 14 homes vacant. The problem is even worse in some areas in the city's center where 1 in 5 homes sit empty. But despite the high number of vacant properties, the supply of homes on the market is still very limited. \\"There are a lot of abandoned homes,\\" said Kehoe. \\"They haven't been taken care and no one is ever going to buy them.\\" ||||| Flint, Mich. isn’t only troubled by bad water. A new study shows it also has one of the nation's most depressed housing markets. An estimated 11,605 homes in Flint are vacant, according RealtyTrac’s report on nationwide housing vacancies for the first quarter of 2016. That’s 7.5 percent of the city’s total housing market, a vacancy rate nearly five times higher than the national average of 1.6 percent. Flint leads the list for the most housing vacancies ahead of Detroit (5.3 percent); Youngstown, Ohio (4.4 percent); Beaumont, Texas (3.8 percent); and Atlantic City, N.J. (3.7 percent). The data shows that the number of vacancies rises closest to Flint’s city center, where one in five houses are empty. THe problem extends to rental properties, 23 percent of which are standing vacant, compared to the national rate of 4.3 percent. \\"It's a downward spiral as vacancy rates rise,\\" RealtyTrac vice president Daren Blomquist told CNN. \\"A homeowner who is trying to sell their house might have to end up walking away, and that adds to the problem.\\" Vacancies were determined both from RealtyTrac’s own publicly recorded real estate data, which includes foreclosure and owner-occupancy status, and data from the US Postal Service that indicates whether or not a postal carrier has flagged a property as vacant. Metropolitan areas with at least 100,000 residential properties were included in the report. Flint has had a difficult housing market for years. A 2000 Census brief on housing costs, released in 2003, noted that Flint had the lowest median housing value among large cities in the United States. In 2015, things weren't much better. A 2WalletHub report done last year placed Flint dead last in an overall ranking of cities for the health of their real estate markets. WalletHub also ranked Flint as one of the cities with the highest number of homes with negative equity, and with the lowest median home-price appreciation. Its housing market ranked last compared to other cities of its size, such as Dayton, Ohio and Fall River, Mass. While Flint’s housing market has had longstanding challenges, there is no denying that the water crisis is a recent contributing factor to its decline. In 2014, before the amount of lead in Flint’s water became a statewide nightmare, housing prices in Genesee County even appeared to be rising. But that same year, Flint switched its water supply from Detroit to the Flint River, whose water supply was later found to be much more corrosive than the Detroit supply. In August 2015, a group of Virginia Tech researchers investigated complaints by testing the water from homes in Flint. They determined that not only did water from the Flint River contain unsafe amounts of lead, but it would also cost the city millions of dollars to repair corroded and broken pipes. A public outcry followed the findings, and Flint residents later filed a lawsuit against the city of Flint and the state of Michigan, as well as other defendants.

It’s projected that the ongoing water crisis will push prices even lower. \\"I would suspect there is not a lot of demand in buying or renting in the city at this point,\\" Mr. Blomquist told CNN. |||||","output":"Flint, a city near Detroit, Michigan, is experiencing a housing crisis alongside its ongoing water crisis. Currently, 7.5% of the city's homes are vacant, and the housing market is considered one of the most depressed in the United States. The 2008 housing crash hit Flint particularly hard, with around 75% of the city's real estate value being lost. The water crisis has been a \\"momentum killer\\" for the housing market that was starting to recover, according to a local real estate agent. The median home price in Flint now stands at 14,000. Flint's vacancy rates are almost five times higher than the national average of 1.6%, making it difficult to attract investment."},{"instruction":"Here is a premise: Its collections are principally of the Venetian school, notably Mantegna's Holy Family, a Giovanni Bellini Madonna, and Lorenzo Lotto's Portrait of a Man, attributed by some to Titian.

Architectural \\"style\\" developed in the form of the Classical orders. What ideals were Greek and Roman Classical architecture not based on?","output":"Greek and Roman Classical architecture were not based on religious or empirical ideals. Instead, their architectural principles largely stemmed from civic ideals that emphasized the collective and social aspects of society, promoting unity, harmony, and a sense of pride among citizens. This focus on civic ideals gave rise to new building types and contributed to the development of distinct architectural styles, particularly the Classical orders. Religious ideals, although important in both Greek and Roman cultures, were not the primary foundation for their architectural designs. While temples and sanctuaries were indeed constructed in both civilizations, they were often integrated within the urban fabric alongside civic buildings such as marketplaces, theaters, and assembly halls. Rather than adopting a solely religious focus, their architecture aimed to create well-rounded public spaces that catered to a variety of social needs and activities. In addition, empirical ideals, which emphasize the role of observation and experimentation in the development of knowledge, were not central to the Greek or Roman approach to architecture. While both civilizations had their fair share of engineers, mathematicians, and other scholars who contributed to the advancement of architectural techniques and knowledge, their designs were driven more by their civic aspirations than by scientific or practical concerns. Greek and Roman Classical architecture were characterized by the use of certain distinctive architectural elements that conveyed a sense of harmony, proportion, and beauty. In the Greek tradition, the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders served as the main design templates for columns, capitals, and entablatures, while the Romans adopted these styles and added the Tuscan and Composite orders. These orders served as a framework for creating structures that exuded balance, symmetry, and elegance, values that resonated with the broader civic ideals of both civilizations. In summary, Greek and Roman Classical architecture were not based on religious or empirical ideals. Instead, their architectural achievements were primarily grounded in civic ideals that aimed to foster community engagement, promote social cohesion, and celebrate collective identity. Through their emphasis on harmonious proportions, symmetry, and aesthetic refinement, the Greeks and Romans established their own unique forms of architectural expression that would leave a lasting impact on the built environment throughout the ages."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given a statement written in Kannada.

Food leaves the esophagus and enters the stomach: In this step, the food bolus travels down the esophagus through peristaltic movements and enters the stomach through the gastroesophageal sphincter. 2. The stomach churns the food: Once inside the stomach, the muscles of the stomach wall contract and relax, mechanically breaking down the food and mixing it with gastric juices. 3. With the aid of stomach acids: Gastric juices, which mainly consist of hydrochloric acid, pepsinogen, and intrinsic factor, help break down food further. The hydrochloric acid in the stomach creates an acidic environment that aids in the activation of pepsinogen to pepsin, which then helps to break down proteins. 4. The food becomes a thick liquid: After the mechanical and chemical processes in the stomach, the partially digested food is turned into a thick, semi-liquid substance called chyme.

This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. and the situation: David was conducting experiments on chemical equilibrium in the chemistry lab. First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T.

Where might he go? Possible A: national park, temperate zone, the forest, countryside, amazon basin Why is \\"national park\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"National park\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for various reasons. Firstly, national parks are designated areas specifically set aside and protected by governments to conserve natural resources, biodiversity, and scenic and cultural heritage. Oftentimes, these protected areas include vast expanses of forests, attracting visitors from around the country and the world. Secondly, national parks are well managed and maintained, offering a safe and accessible environment for people who wish to explore and experience nature. They usually provide well-defined trails, visitor centers, and educational programs that help individuals understand and appreciate the natural ecosystem better. For Billy, who wants to see a forest, a national park can provide a myriad of opportunities to observe plant and animal life, participate in guided walks, learn about forest conservation, and enjoy outdoor recreational activities such as camping, hiking, and birdwatching. Thirdly, national parks are located all over the world, and many countries have implemented systems to designate and manage such areas. This means that regardless of where Billy lives or travels, he is likely to find a national park featuring a forest reasonably close by or in other countries of interest. Additionally, national parks are intentionally preserved in their natural state, meaning that the forests within them are minimally affected by human development. This allows Billy to observe and explore a forest in its most authentic setting, providing an invaluable opportunity to connect with nature and witness the ecological balance that exists within a well-protected environment. In summary, \\"national park\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense due to the purpose of national parks, the accessibility and opportunities they offer, their widespread presence across the globe, and their commitment to preserving natural environments, such as forests. This makes national parks an ideal choice for individuals like Billy who wish to explore and experience forest ecosystems."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

Here is a detailed breakdown. Sentence (a): \\"Guy Stern (born January 14, 1922 in Hildesheim) is a German and comparative literature scholar, primarily German-Jewish.\\" In this sentence, Guy Stern is identified as being born in Hildesheim. It might be presumed by the readers that Hildesheim is in Germany, however the country itself is not specified in the sentence. His profession is described as a scholar of German and comparative literature. The term \\"primarily German-Jewish\\" seems to modify the whole phrase, potentially meaning that his German and comparative literature scholarship focuses primarily on German-Jewish works. Sentence (b): \\"Guy Stern (born January 14, 1922 in Hildesheim, Germany) is a German-Jewish scholar of literature, primarily German and comparative.\\" In this sentence, the details about Guy Stern's birth are identical, but it goes a step further to clarify that Hildesheim is located in Germany. Here, Guy Stern is described as being a 'German-Jewish scholar of literature', implying that his understanding and interpretation of literature is from the perspective of a German-Jewish person or that his studies are primarily in German-Jewish literature. The \\"primarily German and comparative\\" part can mean that his major focus or specialty is on the German literature and comparative literature studies. So, essentially, both sentences confirm that Guy Stern is a scholar who focuses on German and comparative literature and that his focus is principally on German-Jewish literature. The representation of the same information is just structured differently in each sentence, with slight variances in what each phrase modifies or emphasizes specifically. Although each sentence might imply a subtly different emphasis or interpretation depending upon a reader's understanding, the primary information conveyed is essentially the same."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question. If the length of two sides of a right angled triangle measured in inches are prime numbers, and it has two adjacent sides of 12 and 13 inches long, how long must the third side be?","output":"Let's use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem step-by-step. 1. The Pythagorean theorem states that the sum of the squares on the two legs (adjacent sides) of a right-angled triangle is equal to the square on the hypotenuse (longest side). Formula: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are the adjacent sides and c is the hypotenuse. 2. We are given that two sides of the triangle have lengths 12 and 13. One of these must be the hypotenuse since they are both adjacent sides. 3. 12 is not a prime number (divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12), so it must be one of the legs (adjacent sides). So, 'a' = 12. 4. Now, we're left to determine whether 13 can be the hypotenuse or if it's the other leg. Since 13 is a prime number, it could potentially be one of the legs. 5. If 13 is the other leg 'b', we'll use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for 'c' (the hypotenuse): 12^2 + 13^2 = c^2 144 + 169 = 313 c^2 = 313 6. The square root of 313 is approximately 17.69, which is not a whole number. Since the side of a triangle has to be a whole number, then 17.69 cannot be the hypotenuse. 7. Given the contradictory result with 13 being an adjacent side, this means that the initial condition (prime adjacent sides) cannot be fulfilled. Therefore, we must assume that 13 is the hypotenuse in this right-angled triangle. 8. Now, we know that a = 12 and c = 13. We use the Pythagorean theorem again to solve for 'b': 12^2 + b^2 = 13^2 144 + b^2 = 169 9. Subtract 144 from both sides of the equation: b^2 = 25 10. Take the square root of both sides of the equation: b = 5 So, the third side of the right-angled triangle must be 5 inches long."},{"instruction":"Porky is looking all over the big city for a hotel room , but due to a convention there are no vacancies .

It appears that Marcus has entered a refectory, and Culann wants to set a trap using the monks and their staffs. Additionally, Fergus has a glowing stick. Step 2: Identify the Goal The main goal seems to be tripping any warriors who emerge from the refectory in order to prevent them from causing harm or possibly capturing them. Step 3: Prepare the Trap Since the monks have been ordered to kneel on either side of the door with their staffs shin-high, I will make sure that they are properly positioned and understand the plan. I will check that each monk has their staff at the correct height and angle. Step 4: Ensure the Safety of the Team Culann has warned the monks not to trip any of their own people. To minimize this risk, I will recommend setting a specific trigger or signal for the monks to activate the trap. This could be a visual or auditory cue, such as a distinct whistle or hand motion. I will also remind the monks to be aware of their surroundings and to recognize friendly faces. Step 5: Execute the Plan With Fergus and Culann entering the refectory, I will keep an eye on the doorway and watch for any warriors emerging. If I see any, I will either give the prepared signal to the monks or alert Fergus and Culann, depending on the agreed-upon plan. Step 6: Distribute the Glowing Stick As Fergus hands the glowing stick to the nearest monk, I will ensure that the stick is passed along until it is in the proper hands or position as dictated by the plan. This may involve using the stick as part of the trap, providing light for those inside the refectory, or having it serve another purpose. Step 7: Evaluate and Adjust Once the plan is in motion, I will continuously assess the situation and make any necessary adjustments to the plan. If a warrior is tripped by the trap and successfully immobilized, I will help to secure their capture. If the plan doesn't work, I will quickly develop alternative strategies to stop the warriors. Step 8: Maintain Flexibility and Professionalism Throughout this entire process, it is important for me to remain adaptable and focused on the task at hand.

They count down the days they can finally take their braces off. However, trendy teenagers in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand can't wait to get them on, even if they don't need them. Braces are the latest teenage fashion trend in Southeast Asia. Having a mouthful of metal has become so popular with Asian teens that there have been reports of many teens wearing fake braces. Many Asian beauty shops are now offering to put in cheap fake braces. There are even cheaper do-it-yourself braces such as \\" Hello Kitty,\\" Mickey Mouse\\" or others for a price of around 100. Braces are considered a sign of wealth in Southeast Asia. A real set of braces in Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand, for example, will cost around 1,200, which is a large amount for the country with a GDP of 345 billion ( a billion is 1,000 million), compared to the US which had a GDP of 1,506 Trillion ( a Trillion is 1,000 billion) last year. While Asian teens may think that their colorful fake braces are cool, experts say that these trendy fashion braces can cause illness and can even lead to death. According to the New York Daily News, fake fashion braces have already been linked to the deaths of two teens in Thailand.A 17-year-old in the northeast city of Khon Kaen died from heart failure caused by a thyroid infection from a pair of fake fashion braces. Police also linked the death of another 14-year-old girl in Chonburi to a pair of fashion braces she had brought from an illegal shop.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Police Find Remains of 11 Women in Ohio, Investigating Possible Connections to Other Crimes Once upon a time in a place called Ohio, there lived a man named Sowell. Because he did not follow the rules and did some very bad things, he had to stay in a place called prison for 15 years. In 1989, long before some of you were born, Sowell tried to hurt a person in a terrible way, which is called \\"attempted rape.\\" Because of his bad actions, he became known as a \\"registered sex offender,\\" which means people need to be careful around him and the police always watch him closely. One day, a brave woman told the police that Sowell hurt her, too. She said it happened at his house, and that it felt like an \\"assault.\\" When the police searched Sowell's house to see if they could find clues or anything that would help them find the truth, they found something very scary and sad. They discovered the remains of 11 women hidden away. This means that Sowell had tried to keep these people a secret, after doing terrible things to them. The police were very worried about this discovery, and they knew they had to find out if Sowell had done anything else wrong in Ohio or even far away in a place called California. Since what Sowell did was very, very bad, he was given 11 charges of \\"aggravated murder,\\" which is a serious crime. They also added something called \\"mass murder specification,\\" which means he hurt many people at once. The police are working very hard to investigate and find out if Sowell is connected to other bad things or if he has hurt more people throughout the country. They want to make sure no one else gets hurt and that Sowell is held responsible for his actions. The story is still ongoing, and we hope that the police will be able to protect and help everyone who has been affected by Sowell's actions. It is important to remember that there are rules we must follow and that hurting others is never okay."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer.

In 1966, the nation adopted the UN General Assembly of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This act legally limited the minimum age for when children could start work at the age of 14. But 23 years later in 1989 the Convention on the Rights of Children was adopted and helped to reduce the exploitation of children and demanded safe working environments. They all worked towards the goal of ending the most problematic forms of child labour. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did it help do to?","output":"The adoption of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 1966, and later the Convention on the Rights of Children in 1989, helped to achieve several critical objectives in curbing child labor and protecting the rights of children. Some of the significant impacts of these legislations and what they helped do are: 1. Setting legal standards: The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights established a minimum age for employment, restricting children under 14 years of age from legally working. This provided a clear legal benchmark for employers, helping to curb child labor at the most fundamental level. 2. Expanding child rights: The Convention on the Rights of the Child expanded on this by addressing the broader rights of children, such as the right to education, the right to rest and play, and the right to protection from economic exploitation. This helped create a more comprehensive framework for protecting children from hazardous and exploitative work environments. 3. Raising awareness: Both of these legal instruments made the issue of child labor and exploitation a mainstream concern at the global level. This increased awareness and advocacy efforts by various governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the general public. This international attention has led to increased pressure on governments and industries to end harmful child labor practices. 4. Encouraging international cooperation: By setting internationally agreed-upon standards and guidelines, these legal steps facilitated cooperation between countries, allowing them to work together toward the shared goal of ending abusive child labor practices. This collaboration has resulted in the sharing of resources, knowledge, and skills to create more effective strategies and programs to combat child labor. 5. Implementing monitoring and enforcement mechanisms: Under the framework of these legal steps, countries have implemented monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that child labor legislation is complied with. Home inspections, labor inspections, and complaint-based procedures have been put into place to enforce child labor laws and penalize non-compliant employers. 6. Strengthening national legislation: These international legal steps have prompted many countries to review their existing child labor laws, amend them, or create new ones, in line with the global standards set out in the Convention on the Rights of Children and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 7. Promoting education and social protections: To address the root causes of child labor, these legal frameworks have inspired policy initiatives aimed at improving access to quality education, social protection measures and income-generating schemes for families, as alternatives to child labor. In summary, the legal steps taken to end child labor have helped create a robust international framework for the protection of children's rights, increased awareness, and resulted in concrete actions to tackle child labor and exploitation, bringing about substantial progress towards eventually eradicating this global problem."},{"instruction":"Q: This task is reading a paragraph and determining if it has proper nouns in it or not.

NEW DELHIRobin Hood or brutal brigand, the legend of Indias most wanted man, will no doubt live on. Koose Muniswamy Veerappan and three accomplices fell Monday","output":"This article is about the famous Indian bandit and smuggler Koose Muniswamy Veerappan and the events leading up to his death in 2004. Often referred to as \\"India's most wanted man,\\" Veerappan was a controversial figure in the country, seen as both a Robin Hood-esque hero to some, and a brutal criminal to others. His life, crimes, and eventual death have garnered significant attention, and his legacy has continued to be a topic of interest for many years after his passing. Born in 1952, Koose Muniswamy Veerappan was a notorious bandit and smuggler who operated in the dense forests of southern India for over three decades. He was infamous for his illegal activities, which included smuggling ivory and sandalwood, poaching elephants, and abducting high-profile individuals for ransom. Throughout his criminal career, Veerappan was responsible for the killing of over 120 people, including several police officers and forest department officials. Veerappan's criminal activities were concentrated in the remote and thickly forested areas of the states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala, which made it challenging for police forces to apprehend him. He had an extensive network of supporters and informants who helped him evade capture by the authorities, which further contributed to his notoriety. In addition, his knowledge of the forests and his impressive survival skills allowed him to live off the land and avoid detection for years. On the one hand, Veerappan was seen as a brutal criminal who instilled fear in the hearts of local communities, especially those within his sphere of influence. His proclivity for violence, destruction, and disregard for law and order led many to view him as a menace to society. This perspective is supported by the various heinous acts he committed, such as poaching endangered animals, engaging in illegal sandalwood trade, and kidnapping high-profile individuals for ransom. On the other hand, some people in the areas where Veerappan operated saw him as a Robin Hood figure, as he reportedly shared his ill-gotten gains with the poor and less privileged. To these individuals, Veerappan was an anti-establishment hero who challenged the inequities and corruption present in the political and bureaucratic systems of the time. The search for Veerappan took up considerable time and resources, and he was finally cornered and killed by a special police task force in October 2004. The operation, led by officer K. Vijay Kumar, resulted in a deadly gunfight in which Veerappan, along with three of his accomplices, was killed. The success of this mission marked the end of one of the most protracted manhunts in Indian history and brought closure to the people who had been directly impacted by Veerappan's crimes. In conclusion, the story of Koose Muniswamy Veerappan serves as a complex and multifaceted narrative, revealing the diverse opinions and perspectives surrounding this enigmatic figure. It highlights the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in their relentless pursuit to bring him to justice, and offers insights into the social and environmental factors that contributed to his rise as a criminal. Ultimately, the legend of \\"India's most wanted man\\" remains deeply ingrained in the public consciousness and continues to captivate the imagination of people to this day."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: They jump into a pool of water. for the following movie plot: Following the outbreak of the T-virus in Raccoon City and its subsequent destruction by nuclear bomb, the Umbrella Corporation goes under and is bought by WilPharma, a pharmaceutical company.

He sent them to the doctor's for a routine check up. Dan, his dad, had very high cholesterol, while Mary, his mom , had normal levels in her blood. Which parent had fewer plaques that could potentially block blood flow? Hint: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Mary, Bob's mom, likely had fewer plaques that could potentially block blood flow, as she had normal cholesterol levels in her blood. Cholesterol has a crucial role to play in the development of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol and other substances on the walls of the arteries. This accumulation results in the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block blood flow through the affected blood vessels. Dan, on the other hand, had very high cholesterol levels, putting him at an increased risk of forming plaques in his arteries and thus, potentially obstructing blood flow. High cholesterol levels are a significant risk factor for heart disease and can lead to elevated blood pressure and a reduced supply of oxygen to the heart muscle. In cases of complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart, a heart attack can occur. This event can cause substantial damage to the heart due to oxygen deprivation and may even lead to death in severe cases. Understanding the role of cholesterol in the development of atherosclerosis helps to explain why individuals with high cholesterol are at an increased risk of heart disease. In Bob's parents' case, Mary is relatively safer, given her normal cholesterol levels. Nonetheless, it is essential for both individuals to maintain a healthy lifestyle, routinely monitor their health, and follow any preventive measures or treatments recommended by their healthcare providers to minimize the risk of developing heart-related issues."},{"instruction":"Complete the following sentence.

After pretending that he doesn't work there and saying that he works at Goldman Sachs in an effort to impress her, Tori invites Matt to a Labor Day party, hosted by Matt's twin sister Wendy's boyfriend, Kyle Masterson, at his hillside home. Later that night, Matt, Wendy, and Matt's best friend, Barry Nathan, head to the party. On the drive over, Barry steals a brand new Mercedes-Benz convertible from the car dealership he got fired from earlier that day, justifying his actions by saying that Matt needs the convertible if he really wants to impress Tori.

Barry snorts some cocaine he found in the glove box of the stolen convertible and gets involved in a dance-off, and Wendy's boyfriend proposes to her in front of everyone at the party.

Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins.

Known for its rich history, diverse culture, and vibrant economy, this growth is driven by several factors such as immigration, urbanization, employment opportunities, and regenerative projects. One of the essential demographics tools for understanding population changes over time is the comparison of population figures released at different time intervals. In this article, we will be analyzing the population change of Leicester between the 2001 Census and the mid-year estimates for 2006. 2001 Census Population Count The United Kingdom conducts a full population census every ten years, with the most recent one held in 2001. This census provides an accurate snapshot of the population along with important details on socioeconomic and demographic factors. The 2001 Census reported a total population of 279,921 people living in Leicester. This figure was instrumental for local and national decision-makers in planning services and allocating resources for various sectors including healthcare, education, and social care. Mid-Year Estimates for 2006 In between decennial censuses, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) releases mid-year population estimates to provide vital information on trends and changes in population. These estimates are typically derived from a combination of data sources such as General Practitioner registration data, vital statistics on births and deaths, and migration data. The mid-year population estimate for Leicester in 2006 was 285,100. It is important to note that these estimates have been designed to reflect the annual change from the previous census, providing essential data for policymakers, researchers, and businesses to track population growth. Comparison and Analysis To answer the initial question, let's examine the population difference between the 2001 Census and the 2006 mid-year estimates. By subtracting the total population in 2001 (279,921) from the 2006 mid-year estimate (285,100), we find that the population count of Leicester increased by 5,179 people during this time period. This considerable growth is attributed to numerous contributing factors. Immigration, both from international locations and the rest of the UK, has been pivotal in boosting Leicester's population. The city is renowned for its multicultural identity, with sizable communities from Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Caribbean. Additionally, Leicester serves as a regional economic hub, attracting job seekers not only for its robust manufacturing and engineering sectors, but also retail, financial services, and creative industries. The influx of students to the city's two universities, i.e., the University of Leicester and De Montfort University, has also contributed to the growing population. Conclusion The population count of Leicester increased by 5,179 people between the 2001 Census and the mid-year estimates for 2006. This growth can be attributed to various factors, such as immigration, job opportunities, university expansions, and urban regeneration projects. Understanding these changes is necessary to inform decision-making in the allocation and distribution of resources, as well as to prepare for future challenges accompanying a larger population. The next milestone in Leicester's population landscape will be its data from the 2021 Census, which will provide invaluable insights into the most recent changes and trends."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

For now, she seems to want the best of all worlds: She teases a presidential run while still maintaining her millions of dollars in income from her paid speeches, books, reality TV shows and Fox News. She no doubt also loves all the attention. In her latest speech before the Tea Party Express in New Hampshire, she certainly hit all the major points the tea party movement wants to hear: smaller government, lower taxes, reduced federal regulations. But she spoke only in generalities without getting into any specifics as to how she would achieve those objectives. I heard a lot of politically popular clichés. She blasted President Obama for giving good speeches but never backing them up with substance. But at least on this day, she did exactly that herself – she gave a good speech but didn’t back it up with substance. She said the private sector always does everything better than the government can, and she was applauded. But I suspect those same people who clapped in approval don’t want the private sector to take over their Social Security and Medicare benefits. I also suspect they don’t want to privatize the United States military. Those are all government-run operations. Palin also avoided discussing certain sensitive subjects in her New Hampshire address. There was no mention of the social issues, including abortion rights for women or gay rights. Except for praising the men and women in the armed forces, there was no discussion of national security, including the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was a speech designed to deliver some red meat to the tea party movement, which is fine if you’re running for the presidential nomination and seeking votes. But as you can tell, I was hoping for more than simply railing against “the permanent political class” and “crony capitalism.” But I will say this: To her credit, she can deliver a good stump speech. And she doesn’t need a teleprompter. By the way, I have no idea whether she will run. I suppose this guessing game will continue for a few more weeks.

The police suspect it to be the work of a serial killer who is picking up homosexual men at West Village bars like the Eagle's Nest, the Ramrod, and the Cock Pit, then taking them to cheap rooming houses or motels, tying them up and stabbing them to death. Officer Steve Burns (Al Pacino), who resembles the victims, is sent deep undercover by Captain Edelson (Paul Sorvino) into the urban world of gay S&amp;M and leather bars in the Meatpacking District in order to track down the killer. He rents an apartment in the area and befriends a neighbor, Ted Bailey (Don Scardino), a struggling young gay playwright. Burns's undercover work takes a toll on his relationship with his girlfriend Nancy (Karen Allen), due to both his refusal to tell her the details of his current assignment and Burns building a close friendship with Ted, who himself is having relationship problems with his jealous and overbearing dancer boyfriend Gregory (James Remar). Burns mistakenly compels the police to interrogate a waiter, Skip Lee (Jay Acovone), who is intimidated and beaten to coerce a confession before police discover Skip's fingerprints don't match the killer's. Burns is disturbed by this police brutality, and tells Captain Edelson he didn't sign on for this so that they can arrest anyone just because he's gay. Exhausted by his undercover assignment, Burns is close to quitting, but is convinced by Edelson to continue with the investigation. Following a new lead, Burns investigates Columbia University students who studied with one of the previous victims, a college professor. At the film's conclusion, Burns thinks that he has found the serial killer, Stuart Richards (Richard Cox), a gay music graduate student with schizophrenic disorder who attacks him with a knife in Morningside Park. Burns brings the man into custody, but shortly afterward Ted's mutilated body is found. The police dismiss the murder as a lover's quarrel turned...

There are a couple of different ways to adjust the length of your jump rope. The easiest way to adjust your jump rope’s size is by tying a knot or a couple of knots in the rope. Tie the knot as close to the handle as you can without letting the knot actually touch the handle. If you need more than one knot to adjust the size, tie one knot (or two) on each side of the rope. This method is best for beaded and cloth ropes. Make sure that you have enough space to jump rope and that you can see the topmost part of your jump rope as it swings over your head. If you can jump rope in front of a large mirror, that is ideal. If not, ask a friend to watch you. As you jump rope, notice the distance between the top of your head and the middle of your rope. For beginner jumpers, this distance should be about 16-30 inches. For fitness jumpers, this distance should be about 6-10 inches. For speed jumpers, this distance should be about 2-6 inches. Speed and control If your jump rope seems too long or too short, you can always readjust it by adding or taking out one of the knots that you made.","output":"In summary, adjusting the length of your jump rope is an essential step to ensure optimal performance and prevent injuries during your workout. There are multiple ways to make this adjustment, with the most straightforward method being tying knots in the rope close to the handle. This technique works best for beaded and cloth ropes. It is crucial to have adequate space while jumping rope and ideally perform in front of a mirror or have a friend observe your form. Focus on the distance between the top of your head and the middle of the rope as you jump. For beginners, this distance should be around 16-30 inches; for fitness jumpers, it should be approximately 6-10 inches, and for speed jumpers, it should be within 2-6 inches. Always remember to maintain speed and control during your jump rope workout. If the rope feels too long or too short at any point, don't hesitate to readjust its length by adding or removing knots.

The series was organized by the United States Auto Club as a fully professional alternative to the Sports Car Club of America's SCCA National Sports Car Championship. Hypothesis: The USAC Road Racing Championship is only popular in the US","output":"After reading the given paragraph, the information provided points towards the USAC Road Racing Championship being a sports car racing series in the United States from 1958 to 1962, organized by the United States Auto Club. However, it does not provide enough information to conclude if the USAC Road Racing Championship was or is only popular in the United States. One could argue that since it was a sports car racing series held in the United States and organized by a national entity (the United States Auto Club), it might have garnered most of its popularity in the US. However, this argument does not provide definitive proof of the hypothesis being true. The popularity of an event or a series might not necessarily be restricted to its geographical location or the place of origin. In the world of sports, often times events that take place in one country are enjoyed by fans and enthusiasts of that sport in other parts of the world as well. For instance, Formula 1 races held in various countries are followed by fans from all around the globe. To determine the truth of this hypothesis, one would need to evaluate factors such as viewership statistics, attendance records, media coverage, and participants' countries of origin during the period of the championship. Moreover, assessing the historical context of the USAC Road Racing Championship and comparing it with other sports car racing events of that era in terms of popularity would provide clearer evidence in support or against the hypothesis. In conclusion, based solely on the paragraph provided, it is not possible to determine if the hypothesis stating that the USAC Road Racing Championship is only popular in the United States is true. Further research and analysis would be required to make a definitive statement on this matter."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"This feature gives you and your customers the option to have the user interface as well as the reports in your own language.\\" to Spanish.","output":"To translate the given sentence to Spanish, I will follow these steps: 1.

What is her net profit? Let's answer step by step:","output":"Step 1: Calculate the total cost of ingredients for all 20 bags of granola. Elizabeth uses 3.00 worth of ingredients to make one bag of granola. To find the total cost for all 20 bags, we multiply the cost per bag by the total number of bags: 3.00 x 20 = 60.00. Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling 15 bags at 6.00 each. Elizabeth sells 15 bags at 6.00 each. To find the total revenue from these sales, we multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag: 15 x 6.00 = 90.00. Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining 5 bags at the discounted price of 4.00 each. Elizabeth sells the remaining 5 bags at a discounted price of 4.00 each.

Let's break down the components of the sentence to better understand its overall tone. 1. \\"surprisingly\\" - This adverb suggests that the reviewer had a different expectation, which was not met in the way they had anticipated. It could imply a positive or negative connotation, depending on the context, but generally, it signifies that something was unexpected. 2. \\"juvenile\\" - The adjective \\"juvenile\\" has a negative connotation, as it denotes immaturity or a lack of sophistication. In the context of a movie review, this could mean that the film's humor, plot, or characters are childish or poorly developed. 3. \\"lark\\" - A \\"lark\\" is usually a term used to describe playful or lighthearted behavior or an amusing situation. In the context of a movie review, it typically refers to a film that is entertaining, fun, and not meant to be taken very seriously. Taking the entire phrase into account, it appears that the reviewer found the movie to be unexpectedly immature or unsophisticated in its content, yet still amusing and enjoyable on some level. This mix of immaturity and fun suggests that the review is not entirely negative nor entirely positive; it includes aspects of both positive and negative sentiment. In conclusion, it is essential to consider the context in which the words \\"surprisingly,\\" \\"juvenile,\\" and \\"lark\\" are used. Depending on the reviewer's overall opinion, these words may be used with varying degrees of positivity and negativity. Nonetheless, the given movie review sentence reflects a mixed sentiment that incorporates elements of both dissatisfaction (due to unexpected immaturity) and enjoyment (due to the lighthearted and amusing nature of the film)."},{"instruction":"Question: Given the following passage \\"A diverse range of indigenous cultures exist in Myanmar, the majority culture is primarily Buddhist and Bamar.

They do not have the same meaning, as the first question is about children not realizing things about their parents, while the second question is about parents not realizing things about their children. Let's examine the questions further for better understanding. 1. What are some things that Indian children don't realize about their parents? This question seeks to understand the potential gaps in the perception of Indian children about their parents. It looks at the aspects of their parents' lives, struggles, thoughts, and emotions that children might not be fully aware of or appreciate. The reasons for this could include the generational gap and differences in upbringing. Some examples of things that Indian children might not realize about their parents are: - The sacrifices and struggles that parents - particularly older generations - have gone through to provide their children with better opportunities and a higher quality of life. - The emotional, financial, and social pressures that parents face in Indian society to fulfill expectations in their roles as providers and caretakers. - The cultural values and traditions that parents hold dear, and their desire to pass these on to their children in a rapidly globalizing world. - The experiences of parenting that Indian parents might have gone through without access to modern parenting resources, like the internet and self-help books. 2.

The reasons for these gaps could include the generational divide, new societal norms, or changing aspirations. Some examples of things that Indian parents might not realize about their children are: - The pressures and mental health challenges that children face in a highly competitive academic and professional environment in India. - The desire of children to explore unconventional career options or hobbies that may not align with their parents' expectations. - The importance of open communication and emotional support for children as they navigate their teenage years and young adulthood. - The influence of the internet and social media on the lives of younger generations and the ways children interact, learn, and grow in their social circles.

El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school.

Despite its being a timed racing event, it is often considered part of freestyle skiing because it incorporates terrain features traditionally found in freestyle. Ski cross courses have both naturally occurring terrain and artificial features including big-air jumps and high-banked turns. What sets ski cross apart from other alpine skiing disciplines is that there's more than one skier racing down the course.[1] Any intentional contact with other competitors leads to disqualification.

However, there will still be opportunities for interactions between Trump and his Latin and North American counterparts at the two-day summit that begins April 13 in Lima, Peru. The gathering takes place as Trump finalizes plans to send the military to the U.S. border with Mexico and threatens to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. In addition, Trump's recently imposed steel and aluminum tariffs have sparked criticism from many of the attendees at the summit, though some countries have received temporary exemptions.

The official would not say whether Trump will continue to \\"speak his mind\\" during the summit on sensitive issues such as immigration. Trump has repeatedly portrayed immigration from South and Central America as both a national security and economic threat. During his presidential campaign, Trump accused Mexico of sending rapists, drug dealers and criminals across the border. Trump has also clashed with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto over the funding of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. The president has long insisted that Mexico will pay for the wall.

Princes of the German states gathered there to proclaim Wilhelm I of Prussia as German Emperor after the French capitulation in the Franco-Prussian War. Unofficially, the \\"de facto\\" transition of most of the German-speaking populations into a federated organization of states had been developing for some time through alliances formal and informal between princely rulersbut in fits and starts; self-interests of the various parties hampered the process over nearly a century of autocratic experimentation, beginning in the era of the Napoleonic Wars, which saw the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire (1806), and the subsequent rise of German nationalism. - The German Empire (officially ') was the historical German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II in November 1918, when Germany became a federal republic (the Weimar Republic). - Civil registration is the system by which a government records the vital events (births, marriages, and deaths) of its citizens and residents. The resulting repository or database has different names in different countries and even in different US states. It can be called a civil registry , civil register (but this is also an official term for an individual file of a vital event), vital records, and other terms, and the office responsible for receiving the registrations can be called a bureau of vital statistics, registry of vital records and statistics, registrar, registry, register, registry office (officially register office ), or population registry. The primary purpose of civil registration is to create a legal document that can be used to establish and protect the rights of individuals. A secondary purpose is to create a data source for the compilation of vital statistics. In most countries, there is a legal requirement to notify the relevant authority of certain life events, such as births, marriages and death. The first country to establish a nationwide population register was Sweden in 1631, which was organized by the Church of Sweden on the demand of the Swedish king. - The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare. - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names. - The Province of Posen was a province of Prussia from 1848 and as such part of the German Empire from 1871 until 1918. The area, roughly corresponding to the historic region of Greater Poland annexed during the 18th century Polish partitions, was about . For more than a century, it was part of the Prussian Partition, with a brief exception during the Napoleonic Wars. - Weimar Republic is an unofficial, historical designation for the German state between 1919 and 1933. The name derives from the city of Weimar, where its constitutional assembly first took place. The official name of the state was still \\"Deutsches Reich\\"; it had remained unchanged since 1871. In English the country was usually known simply as Germany. A national assembly was convened in Weimar, where a new constitution for the \\"Deutsches Reich\\" was written, and adopted on 11 August 1919. In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation, political extremism (with paramilitaries both left- and right-wing); and contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War. The people of Germany blamed the Weimar Republic rather than their wartime leaders for the country's defeat and for the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Versailles. However, the Weimar Republic government successfully reformed the currency, unified tax policies, and organized the railway system. Weimar Germany eliminated most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles; it never completely met its disarmament requirements, and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations (by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan). Under the Locarno Treaties, Germany accepted the western borders of the republic, but continued to dispute the Eastern border. - A Standesamt (German, plural \\"Standesämter\\") is a German civil registration office, which is responsible for recording births, marriages, and deaths. - The Prussian Partition (sometimes called the Prussian Poland) refers to the former territories of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth acquired during the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century by the Kingdom of Prussia. The Prussian acquisition amounted to 141,400 km (54,600 sq mi) of land constituting formerly western territory of the Commonwealth. The first partitioning led by imperial Russia with Prussian participation took place in 1772; the next one in 1793, and the final one in 1795, resulting in Poland's elimination for the next 123 years. - Standesamt Margonin was a civil registration district ( Standesamt ) located in Kreis Kolmar , province of Posen of the German Empire ( 1871 -- 1918 ) and administered the communities of : Bud = Budsin ; Kol = Kolmar ; Mar = Margonin ; Wil = Wilhelmstreu Margonin was on the north end of a finger lake , where a mill stream slowly emptied the lake into the Netze ( Polish : Notec ) River . The Margonin lake dominated the southern portion of the Standesamt 's area , blocking any east / west traffic . From Margonin , one could go north through Samotschin 's area and on to the river , where a bridge provided access to southern Kreis Wirsitz . West of Margonin , the road and railroad diverge on their way to the Kreis seat of Kolmar ( Chodziesen ; Polish : Chodzie ) .

This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague.

The swamp's intricate ecosystem provided a haven for the small amphibian to thrive, taking advantage of the natural protective elements existing within it. Swamps are known for their dense, muddy waters and tall vegetation, such as water lilies, cattails, and various types of grasses. This dense vegetation creates an excellent hiding place for the frog and offers protection from potential predators like birds, fish, and other reptiles. Additionally, the swamp's murkiness allows the frog to camouflage itself even further, as predators have a harder time distinguishing it from its surroundings. Furthermore, swamps are rich in biodiversity, providing a plethora of food sources for the frog. Insects like mosquitoes, flies, and dragonflies are plentiful in this environment. A diverse diet can enhance the frog's health and immunity, allowing it to avoid or combat diseases and parasites more effectively. In contrast, the pad, while initially providing some support to the frog due to its buoyancy, lacked the safety and resources that the swamp could offer. The pad's isolated nature and limited space made the frog more vulnerable to predators, as it could not rely on the swamp's natural defense mechanisms. Moreover, the pad lacked a diverse range of food sources, which made sustaining the frog's life more difficult. Not only does the swamp provide safety and sustenance, but it also serves as a breeding ground for frogs. As part of their reproductive process, frogs often return to the same swamps in which they were born to mate and lay their eggs, ensuring that their offspring will have a similarly safe and resourceful environment in which to grow and develop. It's worth noting that swamps play a crucial role in maintaining the overall health of the planet. They act as natural filters, removing pollutants and excess nutrients from water, and serve as vital carbon sinks that help combat climate change. By choosing to dwell in the swamp, the frog is not only selecting a secure and nurturing habitat for itself but also contributing to the overall health of the larger ecosystem. In summary, the frog hopped off the pad and into the swamp because the swamp provided a safer and more resourceful environment. By doing so, the frog amplified its chances of survival, reproduction, and overall well-being. Also, it's important to recognize the significant role that swamps play in supporting both individual species and the broader ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Active since 1948, in seventy years of his artistic career Jodorowsky has experienced it in almost all creative forms: writer (in his five facets: novelist, storyteller, poet, playwright and essayist), film director and producer, actor of cinema and theatre, playwright, theatre director, screenwriter, film editor, comics writer, musician, soundtrack composer, philosopher, puppeteer, mime, psychologist and psychoanalyst, draughtsman, painter, eventually sculptor and spiritual guru. Best known for his avant-garde films, he has been \\"venerated by cult cinema enthusiasts\\" for his work which \\"is filled with violently surreal images and a hybrid blend of mysticism and religious provocation\\". Born to Jewish-Ukrainian parents in Chile, Jodorowsky experienced an unhappy and alienated childhood, and so immersed himself in reading and writing poetry. In 1982 Jodorowsky divorced his wife. In 1989, Jodorowsky completed the Mexican-Italian production Santa Sangre (Holy Blood). The film received limited theatrical distribution, putting Jodorowsky back on the cultural map despite its mixed critical reviews. Santa Sangre was a surrealistic slasher film with a plot like a mix of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho with Robert Wiene's \\"The Hands of Orlac\\". It featured a protagonist who, as a child, saw his mother lose both her arms, and as an adult let his own arms act as hers, and so was forced to commit murders at her whim. Several of Jodorowsky's sons were recruited as actors. He followed in 1990 with a very different film, The Rainbow Thief. Though it gave Jodorowsky a chance to work with the \\"movie stars\\" Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif, the executive producer, Alexander Salkind, effectively curtailed most of Jodorowsky's artistic inclinations, threatening to fire him on the spot if anything in the script was changed (Salkind's wife, Berta Dominguez D., wrote the screenplay). That same year (1990), Jodorowsky and his family returned to live in France. In 1995, Alejandro's son, Teo, died in an accident while his father was busy preparing for a trip to Mexico City to promote his new book. Upon arriving in Mexico City, he gave a lecture at the Julio Castillo Theatre where once again he met Ejo Takata, who at this time had moved into a poor suburb of the city where he had continued to teach meditation and Zen. Takata would die two years later, and Jodorowsky would never get to see his old friend again. did either film receive any awards?","output":"To find out if either film received any awards, let's look at both films separately. For Santa Sangre (1989): Santa Sangre received several awards and nominations. Some highlights include winning the Silver Raven award at the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film, the Special Jury Prize at the Catalonian International Film Festival, and the Best International Fantasy Film Award at Fantasporto. It was also nominated for the Grand Prize at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival. For The Rainbow Thief (1990): There is no significant information regarding major awards or nominations for The Rainbow Thief. It appears that this film did not receive notable awards attention.

It was released in 1968 and became one of her most well-known songs worldwide. The melody of the song itself is actually based on a pre-existing Russian folk song called \\"Dorogoi dlinnoyu,\\" which can be translated to \\"By the Long Road.\\" The English lyrics were written by Gene Raskin, an American musician, and writer. Mary Hopkin, a Welsh singer, was discovered on a British television talent show called \\"Opportunity Knocks.\\" After she won the show, she was signed to Apple Records, the label owned by The Beatles. Paul McCartney, who was a member of The Beatles, took on the role of her producer for the song \\"Those Were the Days.\\" McCartney also played acoustic guitar and sang backing vocals on the recording, making it a significant collaboration between the two musicians. The song became an enormous global hit, reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart, number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States and achieving top positions in numerous other countries. With its nostalgic lyrics and sing-along chorus, \\"Those Were the Days\\" resonated with many listeners and became an anthem of sorts for people reflecting on the past. The song has since been covered by various artists and has entered multiple languages' popular culture. Mary Hopkin's music career continued with several hit songs in the late 1960s and early 1970s, including \\"Goodbye,\\" which was also produced by McCartney. Although her later career remained active with occasional album releases, she never quite achieved the same level of success as she did with \\"Those Were the Days.\\" In summary, Mary Hopkin sang \\"Those Were the Days,\\" a song written by Gene Raskin and based on a Russian folk tune.

By Eleanor Harding UPDATED: 15:58 EST, 22 July 2011 IT has often been voted the nation’s favourite dish. But it seems our taste for chicken tikka masala may be cooling. Research shows the orange-tinged curry has been usurped by a lesser-known pretender, the jalfrezi. A far hotter dish, cooked using green chillis, it is now the most popular dish in Britain’s 10,000 Indian restaurants, the survey found. Currying favour: The jalfrezi has been confirmed as Britain's new favourite curry It is thought Britons are becoming more adventurous in their tastes, with restaurant diners developing a much higher tolerance to hot foods. The poll found six million","output":"people now choose jalfrezi as their go-to curry, compared to the five million die-hard fans of chicken tikka masala. This sudden rise in popularity has not only captured the hearts of adventurous diners seeking spicy sensations, but also those looking for a more authentic Indian culinary experience. In fact, it is believed that the jalfrezi's popularity spike is due to a combination of factors, including a growing desire among the British public for more robust and spicy flavors, coupled with an increasing awareness of regional Indian dishes and the vast diversity within Indian cuisine. Moreover, the widespread exposure to different taste profiles from various ethnic backgrounds and the rise of global cuisine in the UK may have also played a significant role in the shift in preferences among curry lovers. Social media and the internet have enabled UK residents to explore the vast array of available dishes, discover new ingredients and techniques, and push the boundaries of their palates. In light of this trend, many Indian restaurants across the UK are evolving their menus to feature a wider range of regional and distinctive dishes, with traditional favorites being given a modern twist or elevated to new heights through innovative cooking techniques. Diners are now more open to experimentation and prepared to embrace dishes that are less mainstream than the classic chicken tikka masala. It is worth noting, however, that while the jalfrezi has emerged as a new favorite among many Britons, the chicken tikka masala still holds a special place in the hearts of millions and remains a popular choice. Often seen as a gateway dish for those unfamiliar with Indian cuisine, the creamy tomato-based curry continues to appeal to those who prefer milder flavors or are new to the vast world of Indian food. The growth in popularity of dishes like the jalfrezi, however, is undoubtedly indicative of the broader progression of British culinary tastes. As the nation continues to embrace the exciting, vibrant flavors that are inherent to Indian cuisine, UK residents are becoming increasingly adventurous and discerning in their choice of dishes. While the overall popularity of curries is unquestionable, the preference towards more diverse and complex dishes is a fascinating and somewhat unexpected reflection of the evolving tastes of a nation. In summary, the jalfrezi's usurpation of the chicken tikka masala as Britain's favorite curry is a testament to the changing preferences and tastes among the UK public. Driven by an increased exposure to regional Indian dishes, a growing appreciation for spice, and the desire to uncover authentic culinary experiences, citizens across the UK have come to recognize the jalfrezi's unique qualities, leading to its newfound status as the most popular dish in Indian restaurants."},{"instruction":"Math problem: Solve -47*q + 27*q = 40 for q.

Because libraries are open to the public, many people have access to the phone book in a library, whether it's for personal use or to find information. Since libraries are designed as resource centers, it's a place where a shared telephone book makes sense: it is accessible and available to a large number of people. Comparing this to the other options you provided: a desk, a house, a hotel, or a bedroom are generally private, individual, or familial spaces. In these cases, the telephone book would typically only be used by a single person or those few who have access to these locations. So, according to common human understanding, a library best answers the question as a public space with a single phone book that many people can use."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Russian: Chuseok","output":"Chuseok (추석) is a traditional Korean celebration, also known as Korean Thanksgiving.

Let me provide you with a more detailed description of the holiday in Russian: Чусок (Чусок), также известный как корейский День Благодарения, является одним из самых значимых и крупнейших праздников в Корее. Чусок отмечается в 15-й день 8-го лунного месяца (обычно в сентябре или октябре), и это время, когда семьи собираются вместе, чтобы помочь в урожае, чтить предков и наслаждаться моментами отдыха и праздника. Традиционно Чусок включает множество обычаев, таких как приготовление еды из свежих урожая и производство сонгпён (сонгпён; корейские традиционные соломенные куклы), которые люди обмениваются в качестве подарков. Корейцы также посещают родственников и знакомых, чтобы отдать им должное уважение и одновременно обменяться новостями. Часто семьи отправляются на захоронения своих предков, чтобы провести ритуал чжарё (чжарё; преданием памяти усопшим) в знак признания и благодарности. В Чусок принято готовить особые блюда, такие как сонпхён (сонпхён; корейские треугольные пирожки с начинкой из риса, лука и грибов) и хангва (хангва; корейские сладости). Готовка этих блюд становится особым временем для взаимодействия между членами семьи и создания драгоценных воспоминаний. Чусок - это особый момент для корейского народа, когда они объединяются, чтобы поддерживать свои традиции и одновременно наслаждаться разнообразными аспектами их жизни."},{"instruction":"Why would you eat fruit? Options: - monkey - go off - keep fresh - market - taste sweet Hmmm, let me think.","output":"You would eat fruit primarily because of the following reasons: 1.

I lack confidence to do basic things in life. How do I build confidence? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"Building confidence can be a gradual and rewarding process that involves self-awareness, goal-setting, and practice. The two questions you've asked are similar, but they have some differences. The first question is seeking the process or steps involved in building confidence, while the second question emphasizes the personal aspect of lacking confidence and asks for help in improving that aspect of life. Although the core issue is the same, the focus differs slightly. To build more confidence, try these steps: 1. Reflect on your strengths and weaknesses: Take some time to identify your skills, abilities, and areas where you excel. Having a clear understanding of your strengths will help you feel more confident in those areas. Similarly, recognizing your weaknesses allows you to work on improving them and, ultimately, growing your self-confidence. 2. Set achievable goals: Create realistic, attainable goals for yourself that focus on areas where you want to grow and improve. Break these goals into smaller, manageable tasks that provide a sense of accomplishment and progress. 3. Develop a positive self-image: Maintain an optimistic outlook on life and foster a positive inner dialogue. Surround yourself with people who uplift and encourage you while minimizing contact with negative influences. 4. Learn from failure: Embrace failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. Understand that it's a part of life and that each failure brings you one step closer to success. Develop resilience by bouncing back from setbacks and disappointments. 5. Practice self-compassion: Be kind to yourself and recognize that everyone has imperfections. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would show a friend or family member. 6. Take risks and face your fears: Step out of your comfort zone and take on new challenges, even if they scare you. Overcoming fears and trying new things can help build your confidence by proving to yourself that you're capable of more than you initially thought. 7. Develop assertiveness: Learn how to communicate your thoughts, feelings, and needs effectively and respectfully without being aggressive or passive-aggressive. Develop the ability to stand up for yourself and set healthy boundaries. 8. Embrace self-improvement: Commit to continuously learning and growing. Develop new skills, attend workshops, or seek out mentors who can help you expand your knowledge and abilities. 9. Exercise and maintain a healthy lifestyle: Physical well-being plays a significant role in confidence. Maintain a regular exercise routine, eat a balanced diet, and get enough sleep to improve your energy levels and overall sense of well-being. 10. Practice, practice, practice: Building confidence takes time and effort. Continually work on applying these steps in your daily life and strive for progress rather than perfection. Remember, confidence comes from experience and learning. By following these steps and remaining committed to self-improvement, you will gradually build confidence and overcome challenges that once seemed insurmountable."},{"instruction":"Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I have not tried inscribing the discs, but the price is excellent and Verbatim are always reliable.

Which language is this?","output":"The text you provided is written in Romanian. Romanian is a Romance language just like Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. It's mainly spoken in Romania and Moldova. Historically, the language's roots can be traced back to the Roman occupation of Dacia, which was situated in the region now known as Romania. The occupation goes back as far as around the year 106 AD. The Romanian language evolved from Vulgar Latin spoken by the Romans and Dacians. With about 24 million speakers worldwide, Romanian is the official language of both Romania and Moldova. Moldova officially calls its language Moldovan due to political reasons. The language also enjoys a minority status in Ukraine, Serbia, and Hungary. In other countries and regions, we also see several Romanian communities where the language is still being spoken at home. Romanian has its unique linguistic characteristics that make it stand out among the Romance languages. It maintained a lot of the grammatical complexity from Latin, which has been lost in some other Romance languages. The language is also known for retaining a significant number of features of old Latin and also, uniquely, from old Dacian and other Balkan-area languages. It uses a Latin alphabet with five additional letters: Ă, Â, Î, Ș, and Ț. It was originally written in the Cyrillic alphabet until the 19th century. Afterward, the transition happened due to the growing cultural influence of France and the Western world. Romanian has several dialects, but the most widespread is the Wallachian dialect, due largely to the cultural and political influence of Bucharest (Romania's capital), which is located in Wallachia. Reading, writing, and speaking Romanian can be challenging for English speakers because of its complex grammar and unique sounds. However, knowing other Romance languages can significantly facilitate the learning process given the shared Latin roots."},{"instruction":"Read this fact: \\"a moth undergoes metamorphosis\\" Now answer this question: \\"A moth can adjust its\\"","output":"Based on the fact that \\"a moth undergoes metamorphosis,\\" we can infer that a moth can adjust its body structure and form during its life cycle. A metamorphosis consists of four primary stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. In the larval stage, it is commonly known as a caterpillar, which primarily focuses on eating and growing. Once it has reached the appropriate size and stage of development, it enters the pupal stage, where it will transform within a protective case, such as a cocoon or chrysalis. Finally, it emerges as an adult moth, which includes the development of wings, antenna, and a new body structure designed for mating and dispersal. So, to answer the question, a moth can adjust its body structure and form during its metamorphosis throughout its life cycle."},{"instruction":"Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: Analysisofprintedcurcuitboardsandshortcircuits","output":"Through the analysis of printed circuit boards, engineers can effectively identify and rectify short circuits, which are crucial in maintaining the overall functionality and performance of electronic devices."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the below context: A prologue explains the role of the bounty hunter.

While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work.

I picked this album out the other day and once again was laughing with tears in my eyes. Her comedy is vulgar, it is offensive and it is hilarious.

Here's my reasoning: 1. The review starts off positively. The customer was highly entertained by the product (in this case a comedy album) and found it hilarious. This creates an initial positive impression. 2. However, the reviewer goes on to comment that the CD was edited from the DVD release and not all content was included. This is a clear disadvantage, especially for someone who looks for complete, unedited content. 3. The reviewer explicitly states that the CD sounds like highlights from the video rather than the full content, which may disappoint customers seeking a full comedy experience. 4. The problem of incomplete content is significant and likely overrides the positive opinion of the product itself. This would lead a potential buyer, like me, to be more hesitant in the purchasing decision to avoid potential disappointment.

He was the adopted son of Gerald and Arlene Breitbart, a restaurant owner and banker respectively, and grew up in the affluent neighborhood of Brentwood, Los Angeles. He was adopted at three weeks old and raised Jewish. His biological parents had been Irish American. Context: Breitbart launched his first website as a news site; it is often linked to by the Drudge Report and other websites. It has wire stories from the Associated Press, Reuters, Agence France-Presse, Fox News, PR Newswire, and U.S. Newswire, as well as direct links to a number of major international newspapers. Its political viewpoint as well as its audience runs to the right within the U.S. political spectrum. In 2007, Breitbart launched a video blog, Breitbart.tv. During a stay in Israel, Breitbart and Larry Solov conceived of the idea of founding Breitbart News Network, with \\"the aim of starting a site that would be unapologetically pro-freedom and pro-Israel. We were sick of the anti-Israel bias of the mainstream media and J-Street.\\" Solov has written: One night in Jerusalem, when we were getting ready for dinner, Andrew turned to me and asked if I would de-partner from the 800-person law firm where I was practicing and become business partners with him. He said he needed my help to create a media company. He needed my help to \\"change the world.\\" ... We were blown away by the spirit, tenacity, and resourcefulness of the Israeli people on that trip. Andrew could be quite convincing, not to mention inspiring, and I decided right there and then to \\"throw away\\" (my Mom's phrase) a perfectly good, successful and safe career in order to start a \\"new media\\" company with Andrew Breitbart. In 2011, Breitbart and one of his editors Larry O'Connor were sued for defamation by Shirley Sherrod, who had been fired after Breitbart posted a video of a speech given by Sherrod. The video had been selectively edited to suggest that she had purposely discriminated against a white farmer, while in reality the unedited video told the story of how she had helped that farmer. In July 2015, it was reported that Sherrod and Breitbart's estate had reached a tentative settlement. It was reported October 1, 2016, that the lawsuit was settled.

She prefers to cook with a pan with a plastic handle instead of a metal handle because the metal handle is more heat-conducting. When preparing her favorite meals, she learned from experience that metal handles can get quite hot, potentially causing burns if she wasn't too careful. In comparison, plastic handles remained cooler to the touch, allowing her to confidently and comfortably grip the pan without the need for hot pads or oven mitts. One day, when she was attempting a new recipe, her husband accidentally bought a pan with a metal handle. Noticing her hesitation, he reassured her that using the metal-handled pan wouldn't be too different. She skeptically agreed to give it a try. As the dish cooked and the pan heated up, she tentatively reached out to grab the handle. The heat was more intense than she anticipated, and she quickly pulled her hand back, narrowly avoiding a burn. She grabbed an oven mitt and continued cooking, making a mental note to always check the type of handle on a pan in the future. Despite the minor incident, the meal turned out delicious, and they enjoyed a cozy dinner together, recounting the day's events and laughing about the pan mishap.

An undercover reporter from the Financial Times attended the event and reported that female hostesses were subjected to repeated sexual harassment, including groping. Several key British figures, such as billionaire Sir Philip Green and Education Minister Nadhim Zahawi, attended the event, leading to political backlash. Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesperson stated that she was \\"appalled\\" by the findings, while Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn condemned the event as \\"a gross example of sexual harassment.\\" Numerous organizations have severed ties with the Presidents Club or refused to accept donations linked to the controversial dinner.

The Charity Commission, a government body that regulates charities, is currently investigating the Presidents Club. The closure of the charity is a significant move that underscores the fallout resulting from the scandal, as it shines a light on sexual harassment in the workplace and has prompted a strong response from companies and political figures. Notably, the British House of Commons has been openly critical of the scandal, as it raises serious concerns about the perpetuation of sexist behavior and the objectification of women in these types of events. The men-only nature of the event, the explicit auction lots, and the treatment of female staff have reinforced the need for continuous efforts to promote gender equality and fight against sexual harassment. The closure of the Presidents Club demonstrates the impact of increased public scrutiny on organizations that perpetuate inappropriate behavior. The case also highlights the importance of undercover journalism to expose such practices, as the detailed reports and findings from the Financial Times have played a crucial role in triggering the necessary actions and responses. In light of the Presidents Club scandal, businesses and charities will likely need to reassess their internal policies and processes to ensure that they are providing a safe and respectful environment for all staff and stakeholders alike."},{"instruction":"I would like to conclude by saying that this report is in agreement with the reports produced by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.

This decline has raised concerns among scientists, environmentalists, and the general public due to the important role these pollinators play in maintaining the balance of ecosystems, agriculture, and food production. Pollinators are responsible for fertilizing about 75% of the world's flowering plants and more than two-thirds of global food crops. Therefore, their decline could result in devastating consequences for both biodiversity and crop yields. Several factors have contributed to this decline, such as habitat loss, exposure to pesticides, climate change, and the spread of invasive species and diseases. Various measures are being discussed and implemented to mitigate the impact of these factors and to promote pollinator conservation. Hypothesis: The restoration of natural habitats and reduction of pesticide use can lead to the recovery and growth of the pollinator population Given the importance of pollinators and the various factors contributing to their decline, it is hypothesized that the strategic restoration of natural habitats, combined with reduced pesticide use, would likely contribute to the recovery and growth of the pollinator population. This hypothesis is based on the assumption that these efforts would create a more conducive environment for pollinators to thrive and reproduce. For the restoration of natural habitats, multiple initiatives could be implemented. These may include: 1. Reforestation and afforestation projects, planting native vegetation to provide sufficient resources (e.g., nectar and pollen) for pollinators. 2. Establishing buffer zones between agricultural lands and natural habitats, aiming to minimize habitat fragmentation and reduce the impact of pesticides on pollinators. 3. Implementing conservation projects to protect and restore endangered or vulnerable pollinator species, subsequently increasing their population. 4. Encouraging homeowners, urban planners, and local authorities to incorporate pollinator-friendly plants and natural features in urban landscaping and public spaces. Regarding the reduction of pesticide use, various strategies can be adopted: 1. Encouraging integrated pest management (IPM) among farmers, which includes using biological and cultural pest control methods instead of relying solely on chemical pesticides. 2. Promoting organic agriculture, which abstains from synthetic chemical inputs, to create healthier ecosystems for pollinators. 3. Implementing regulations to limit or ban the use of neonicotinoids and other harmful pesticides that have been linked to pollinator decline. 4. Developing and adopting new, less harmful pesticides that are specifically targeted and can effectively control pests without causing significant harm to pollinators. By implementing these changes, it is hypothesized that the global pollinator population will recover and grow in the long term. This recovery would contribute to maintaining biodiversity and improve crop yields, ultimately benefiting global ecosystems, agriculture, and food production."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the below conversation.

Answer the above question based on the context below: White Deer Hole Creek is in a sandstone, limestone, and shale mountain region, entirely in the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. South and North White Deer Ridge and Bald Eagle Mountain are composed of sedimentary Ordovician rock, while the valley rock is Silurian, with a small Devonian region closer to the river, in the north. The watershed has no deposits of coal, nor natural gas or oil fields. The creek is in a narrow mountain valley with steep slopes in its upper reaches. In its middle and lower reaches it has steep mountain slopes to the south, and a wide valley with rolling hills and gentle slopes to the north. The channel pattern is transitional, with a trellised drainage pattern.From 1961 to 1995, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) operated one stream gauge on White Deer Hole Creek at the Gap Road bridge (upstream of Elimsport), for the uppermost 18.2 square miles (47 km2) of the watershed. The highest yearly peak discharge measured at this site was 4,200 cubic feet (120 m3) per second and the highest yearly peak gauge height was 11.83 feet (3.61 m), both on June 22, 1972, during Hurricane Agnes. The lowest yearly peak discharge in this time period was 135 cubic feet (3.8 m3) per second and the lowest yearly peak gauge height was 4.29 feet (1.31 m), both on November 26, 1986. The USGS also measured discharge at Allenwood, very near the creek's mouth, as part of water quality measurements on seven occasions between 1970 and 1975. The average discharge was 70.4 cubic feet (1.99 m3) per second, and ranged from a high of 111 cubic feet (3.1 m3) per second to a low of 33 cubic feet (0.93 m3) per second.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose having more animals near the water happens, how will it affect there are more cans to be shredded. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis, which involves having more animals near the water potentially leading to more aluminum cans needing to be shredded, can have indirect effects on the recycling process. First, let's analyse the recycling process outlined in the original statement: 1. Aluminum cans are placed into a recycle bin. 2. They are then transported to a recycling facility. 3. At the facility, the cans are shredded by a machine. 4. The shredded cans are heated to 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit to melt them. 5. The molten aluminum is poured into molds. 6. Finally, the cooled aluminum is flattened and rolled into sheets that can be repurposed. Now, let's examine the perturbation hypothesis and its potential effects on this process. Having more animals near the water may lead to an increased presence of aluminum cans in the environment, either due to animals dragging or pushing cans towards the water or due to humans leaving more cans behind as they interact with the animals. Additionally, this increased interaction could lead to water pollution if not properly managed. As a result of this perturbation, there may be a chain of consequences that could indirectly impact the recycling process: 1. The increased presence of aluminum cans in the environment may lead to an increased awareness for recycling and, therefore, higher participation of individuals in recycling activities. People may begin to collect cans either as a means to minimize pollution or because they view the process as beneficial for the environment. 2. The higher recycle rate of aluminum cans can potentially lead to an increased demand for recycling services. Recycling facilities may become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of cans that they need to process, which would require a more efficient recycling process, an expansion of facilities, or both. 3. As more facilities are needed, or as the process is optimized, the aluminum recycling industry may experience growth and job creation. This economic impact can encourage other industries to adopt more sustainable practices as they realize the potential benefits they might receive from implementing eco-friendly measures. 4. Though indirect, this increased awareness and concern for the environment stemming from the perturbation hypothesis may lead to better waste management practices among the population. This could possibly reduce the number of aluminum cans that end up in landfills or nature. In conclusion, while the perturbation hypothesis does not directly affect the aluminum can recycling process as described, it can lead to a chain of consequences that affect recycling participation and awareness, ultimately impacting the supply and demand of aluminum recycling services. This indirect impact can then influence the overall recycling industry as well as the behavior of the population toward waste management and sustainability."},{"instruction":"For thousands of years, people have found fossils.

In particular, industries involved in the manufacture of essential goods and raw materials such as cotton and iron witnessed substantial disruptions as the pre-war period unfolded. To comprehend the differential impacts on these two industries, a comparison of the percentage decline in production of cotton and iron in the pre-level war will be conducted in this article. Cotton Industry The cotton industry invariably serves as a central pillar of the global textile sector. Cotton is a primary raw material in the textile industry, which further plays a vital role in the economic growth of numerous countries, both exporters and importers. As the war approached, the demand for cotton began to fluctuate, primarily due to the unpredictable nature of conflicts, changes in trade policies, and shifting global markets. One of the earliest examples is the American Civil War in the 19th century. Notably, the pre-war period between 1859 and 1861 saw a significant decline in cotton production in the United States, reaching a reduction of approximately 48.3%. This decline resulted from several factors, including trade embargos, labor shortages, and supply chain disruptions caused by the political turmoil leading up to the war. Iron Industry The iron industry, a cornerstone of the global economy, lays the foundation for essential products and development projects in various regions and nations. Ranging from small household items to massive infrastructure projects, iron production plays a crucial role in economic growth. The pre-war period evidently triggered volatility in the iron industry, leading to a notable reduction in production levels. For example, during the pre-level war period of World War II between 1939 and 1941, iron production plummeted in numerous European countries. One of the most significant declines was observed in France, where iron production dropped by an impressive 44.1%. This significant reduction was attributed to several factors such as geopolitical tensions, labor disruptions, and limitations on raw materials supply. Comparative Analysis To determine the percentage difference in the decline of cotton and iron production during the pre-level war periods, the variables in each situation must be considered from a historical context. As mentioned earlier, the pre-level war periods for cotton and iron differ in timing and region, making it essential to acknowledge these disparities. To quantify the difference between the two industries in terms of percentage decline, the following calculation can be applied: Percentage difference = ((Decline of cotton production - Decline of iron production) / Decline of iron production) * 100 Using the numbers mentioned earlier (48.3% for cotton and 44.1% for iron), the calculation is as follows: Percentage difference = ((48.3 - 44.1) / 44.1) * 100 ≈ 9.52% Conclusion In conclusion, studies reveal that the decline in cotton production during the pre-level war period was approximately 9.52% higher than that of iron production, based on the given examples. This comparative analysis demonstrates the vulnerability of both industries to geopolitics, trade disruptions, and socio-economic complex situations as powerful contributing factors to fluctuations in production levels. Furthermore, such comparisons allow for the development of mitigating strategies and policies to prepare and protect industries during times of crisis and conflict, ensuring resilience and stability for future growth and development."},{"instruction":"What is the name of the person who headed to his getaway vehicle after exiting and locking the truck? Answer the above question based on the context below: McVeigh's original plan had been to detonate the bomb at 11:00 am, but at dawn on April 19, 1995, he decided instead to destroy the building at 9:00 am. As he drove toward the Murrah Federal Building in the Ryder truck, McVeigh carried with him an envelope containing pages from The Turner Diaries – a fictional account of white supremacists who ignite a revolution by blowing up the FBI headquarters at 9:15 one morning using a truck bomb. McVeigh wore a printed T-shirt with the motto of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Sic semper tyrannis (\\"Thus always to tyrants\\", according to legend what Brutus said as he assassinated Julius Caesar, also shouted by John Wilkes Booth immediately after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln) and \\"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants\\" (from Thomas Jefferson). He also carried an envelope full of revolutionary materials that included a bumper sticker with the Thomas Jefferson slogan, \\"When the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.\\" Underneath, McVeigh had written, \\"Maybe now, there will be liberty!\\" with a hand-copied quote by John Locke asserting that a man has a right to kill someone who takes away his liberty.McVeigh entered Oklahoma City at 8:50 am. At 8:57 am, the Regency Towers Apartments' lobby security camera that had recorded Nichols's pickup truck three days earlier recorded the Ryder truck heading towards the Murrah Federal Building. At the same moment, McVeigh lit the five-minute fuse. Three minutes later, still a block away, he lit the two-minute fuse. He parked the Ryder truck in a drop-off zone situated under the building's day-care center, exited and locked the truck, and as he headed to his getaway vehicle, dropped the keys to the truck a few blocks away. Answer:","output":"The name of the person who headed to his getaway vehicle after exiting and locking the truck is Timothy McVeigh. He was responsible for the bombing of the Alfred P.

Possible A: dribbling, full of air, bouncing around court, punctured, round Why is \\"round\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Round\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it relates to the actual shape of the basketball and the rim. The round shape of the ball makes its bouncing pattern less predictable after hitting the rim, as it can bounce in various directions. The other answer options mostly do not relate to the ball and rim's characteristics impacting the difficulty of predicting a rebound or are not applicable in the context of basketball. Here's a step-by-step explanation: 1. \\"Dribbling\\" is an action performed by players when moving with the ball; it does not relate to the difficulty of predicting a rebound. 2. \\"Full of air\\" refers to basketballs being inflated, but this alone does not explain why rebounds are hard to predict. 3. \\"Bouncing around court\\" is a general description of a basketball's movement; however, it doesn't directly relate to the difficulty of predicting a rebound off the rim. 4. \\"Punctured\\" is irrelevant to the question, as a punctured basketball would not be in play during a game. 5. \\"Round\\" refers to the shape of the basketball and the rim, which contributes to the difficulty of predicting a rebound.

This involves several carefully thought-out steps and processes that entail a good deal of meticulous planning, information gathering, and analysis. Here is a detailed overview of what Kai would have needed to do. 1. Determine the Need and Desire: First of all, Kai should introspect their personal motivation and need to buy a house. There can be myriad reasons including family expansion, desire for larger space, investment opportunity, and so on. Also, they must contemplate the readiness, both financially and mentally, to take such a big step. 2. Financial Readiness: It is important for Kai to evaluate their current financial standing before deciding to purchase a home. They should consider their income, savings, credit score, and other financial obligations. They may need to check their eligibility for loans and also calculate the potential mortgage payments to assess if it can fit into their budget without straining it. 3. Market Research: Once the financial readiness is established, Kai should engage in a comprehensive market research. They must understand the current real estate market trends as prices, interest rates, and inventory fluctuate over time. They can investigate the best time to buy a house and also the ideal locations according to their preferences and budget. 4. Property Research: Kai would be required to deep-dive into potential properties. This includes researching about different types of homes, old vs new, type of locality, nearby facilities, resale value, etc. They can use online portals and also consult real estate agents or experts for the same. 5. Legalities and Paperwork: Buying a house involves a lot of documentation and legalities. Kai should learn about it in advance to ensure a smooth process. This could include understanding land rights, title deeds, inspection reports, agreement of sale, etc. 6. Assemble a Real Estate Team: It's important for Kai to assemble a team consisting of a real estate agent, mortgage lender, and potentially a lawyer.

About to nervously jump off a bridge, scrawny Harry Berlin is a barely functional human being. Just as he attempts to leap off the bridge, he is distracted by Milt Manville, an old friend from fifteen years ago. Harry doesn't really recognize him at first but there appears to be a contrast between the two of them with Milt boasting of how well he is doing in life while Harry tries to listen. Milt takes Harry to his house to meet Ellen Manville (Elaine May), Milt's long-suffering wife. She is complaining that their sex life is non-existent but Milt has a secret lover in the form of beautiful blonde Linda. Milt convinces a barely-there Harry to make a go of things with Ellen so that she is not left lonely when he will divorce her for Linda. It takes a while but Harry and Ellen eventually fall in love. They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart. In one example, Harry unexpectedly stomps on Ellen's toe in order to test her love for him. As she hobbles in pain, she asks, \\"What did you do that for?,\\" and in response, he asks her if she still loves him, and she says she does. As Milt and Linda start to settle down as a couple, she quickly realizes that he has an addiction to selling household items and junk for a quick buck, something that she is strongly against. She immediately dumps him, which leads to Milt to want Ellen back when he realizes how much he loves her for real. She admits that she doesn't really love Harry as much as she thought, as his bizarre day-to-day activities get to her. Milt and Ellen plot to get back together and convince Harry to divorce her but he loves her and sets out to prove it by getting a job as an elevator operator in a shopping mall.

The campaign asks students to run every school day. Te campaign has started since October last year and will last until April this year. Kids at primary schools have to run 1km per day. It's 1.5kms for middle school students and 2 kms for high school and university students. And records will be set for every student. By the end of April 2009, a primary school student has to run 120kms in total/ A middle school students have to run 240kms by that time. Since the campaign started, people have had different ideas about it. Some people think it is good for students. They think the campaign can make students healthier. Some students have little exercise and the campaign can make them run. But some people don't think so. They think some schools don't have enough place for students to do running. If students have to run on the road, maybe it is not safe. They also think there are many ways to become healthier; running is not the only way. So they think the campaign is not a right decision. Why don't some people think the campaign is good? A) Because they don't think it's safe enough for a student to run such a long way every day. B) Because they don't think it's safe to make so many students run together every day. C) Because they think students are busy with their school work and have no time to run.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Choices: - no - yes","output":"It is not entirely normal to be driven primarily by hatred; however, it is a common emotion that every person experiences at some point in their lives. It is essential to recognize that hatred is an intense emotion that can lead to negative consequences if not appropriately managed or understood. There are several reasons why an individual might feel hatred towards others. Some of the most common reasons are: 1. Psychological Factors: A person might develop a deep sense of hatred when they feel mistreated, betrayed, or undervalued. Past experiences, such as childhood trauma or abuse, can also contribute to feelings of hatred if unresolved mental and emotional issues are not adequately addressed. 2. Socio-Cultural Factors: The values and norms of a person's culture or social environment can play a significant role in shaping their perception of others. Prejudices, stereotypes, and discriminatory beliefs present in one's environment can contribute to hatred towards others based on aspects such as race, religion, or nationality. 3. Personal Experiences: Negative experiences with individuals or specific groups can lead to the development of hatred. For instance, if a person is wronged by someone belonging to a particular group, they may foster hatred towards the entire group, leading to generalizing and unfair treatment of others. 4. Cognitive Factors: Thoughts and beliefs about oneself and others can contribute to feelings of hatred. Cognitive distortions, such as all-or-nothing thinking or overgeneralization, can lead to an overly negative view of others, resulting in irrational hatred. 5. Biological Factors: The neurochemistry of an individual's brain can also influence their emotions, including hatred. For instance, an imbalance in brain chemicals, such as serotonin and dopamine, can impact mood and emotional regulation. As for whether the questions are the same, the most appropriate answer would be \\"no.\\" The first question revolves around the normalcy of being driven by hatred, while the second question delves into the reasons behind hating people. While both questions pertain to the emotion of hatred, the two questions have different focuses and require separate analyses. In conclusion, it is not completely normal to be driven mainly by hatred, but it is an emotion that people experience due to various factors. Understanding and addressing the root causes of this hatred can aid in better emotional regulation and promote a more positive outlook on life. It is crucial to confront these feelings and work on managing them through self-reflection, therapy, or engaging in activities that foster positive relationships with others."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output. In this task, you are given a abstract of article and corresponding title of an article. Your task is to generate label \\"yes\\" if title is right for article, otherwise generate \\"no\\". Abstract: CONTEXT Diagnostic lumbar punctures (LPs), commonly used to rule out meningitis, are associated with adverse events. OBJECTIVE To systematically review the evidence about diagnostic LP techniques that may decrease the risk of adverse events and the evidence about test accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis in adult patients with suspected bacterial meningitis. DATA SOURCES We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (using Ovid and PubMed) from 1966 to January 2006 and EMBASE from 1980 to January 2006 without language restrictions to identify relevant studies and identified others from the bibliographies of retrieved articles. STUDY SELECTION We included randomized trials of patients aged 18 years or older undergoing interventions to facilitate a successful diagnostic LP or to potentially reduce adverse events. Studies assessing the accuracy of biochemical analysis of the CSF for possible bacterial meningitis were also identified. DATA EXTRACTION Two investigators independently appraised study quality and extracted relevant data. For studies of the LP technique, data on the intervention and the outcome were extracted. For studies of the laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, data on the reference standard and test accuracy were extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS We found 15 randomized trials. A random-effects model was used for quantitative synthesis. Five studies of 587 patients compared atraumatic needles with standard needles and found a nonsignificant decrease in the odds of headache with an atraumatic needle (absolute risk reduction [ARR], 12.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.72% to 26.2%). Reinsertion of the stylet before needle removal decreased the risk of headache (ARR, 11.3%; 95% CI, 6.50%-16.2%). The combined results from 4 studies of 717 patients showed a nonsignificant decrease in headache in patients who were mobilized after LP (ARR, 2.9%; 95% CI, -3.4 to 9.3%). Four studies on the accuracy of biochemical analysis of CSF in patients with suspected meningitis met inclusion criteria. A CSF-blood glucose ratio of 0.4 or less (likelihood ratio [LR], 18; 95% CI, 12-27]), CSF white blood cell count of 500/muL or higher (LR, 15; 95% CI, 10-22), and CSF lactate level of 31.53 mg/dL or more (> or =3.5 mmol/L; LR, 21; 95% CI, 14-32) accurately diagnosed bacterial meningitis. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that small-gauge, atraumatic needles may decrease the risk of headache after diagnostic LP. Reinsertion of the stylet before needle removal should occur and patients do not require bed rest after the procedure. Future research should focus on evaluating interventions to optimize the success of a diagnostic LP and to enhance training in procedural skills..

He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter (Richard Thomas), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana. Grady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on.

Control is the third studio album by American recording artist Janet Jackson, released on February 4, 1986, by A&M Records. Her collaborations with the songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis resulted in an unconventional sound: a fusion of rhythm and blues, rap vocals, funk, disco and synthesized percussion that established Jackson, Jam and Lewis as the leading innovators of contemporary R&B. The album became Jackson's commercial breakthrough and enabled her to transition into the popular music market, with Control becoming one of the foremost albums of the 1980s and contemporary music. The album is also notable for being what originated the style and genre that came to be known as new jack swing.Containing autobiographical themes, a majority of the album's lyrics came as the result of a series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring the A&M executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self-actualization. It has also been regarded as a template upon which numerous female artists have modeled their careers, particularly black women. Following its release, Control became Jackson's first album to top the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States and five of its commercial singles—\\"What Have You Done for Me Lately\\", \\"Nasty\\", \\"Control\\", \\"When I Think of You\\", and \\"Let's Wait Awhile\\"—peaked within the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.

It contains no violence or sex or drugs or special effects, and doesn't need them one bit, holding my attention the entire time with the visuals, story, and interspersed words of wisdom. However: [1] some of the foreign language accents made the dialog difficult to hear & understand; [2] there is unnecessary overuse of swearing (especially the F-word, which is the only reason this movie was rated R). [3] The movie is balanced with humor and emotion, but most of the emotion that holds you throughout the film, except the final resolution last minutes, is unpleasant due to the exaggerated long-lasting dysfunctional reaction of some of the characters to loss, living in the depths of bitterness and depression for too long. [4] I will not recommend this movie because of 5-seconds of background narration, which did not add one bit to the side-character it applied to, or the film -- it only turned me off to the movie and stuck in my brain through the whole movie and afterward: the main character's mother of German ancestry, when watching old WWII movies, \\"secretly roots for the Germans.\\" There would be no \\"local color\\" or art if the Nazi's won the war.

Which language is this?","output":"The language of the text \\"Státy ESVO musí být zahrnuty v registru Unie a v protokolu transakcí Evropské unie (EUTL)\\" is Czech. Step-by-step justification: 1. Firstly, I identified that the text is written using the Latin alphabet and contains diacritical marks (accented letters) that are commonly found in Central European languages such as Czech, Slovak, or Hungarian. 2. I observed the specific accents used, like the háček (ˇ) on the \\"š\\" and \\"č\\", and the acute accent (´) on \\"á\\" and \\"ý\\", which indicate that this text is more likely from a Slavic language rather than Hungarian. 3. Next, I looked at the vocabulary in the text, such as \\"Státy,\\" \\"registru,\\" \\"Unie,\\" and \\"Evropské,\\" which are Czech words. Similar words exist in Slovak, but the specific phrasing and word choices in this text better align with Czech than Slovak.

There have also been instances where a film actor has acquired a signature song by giving a popular vocal performance in a feature. Signature songs can be the result of spontaneous public identification, or a marketing tool developed by the music industry to promote artists, sell their recordings, and develop a fan base. - Sterno (\\"canned heat\\") is a fuel made from denatured and jellied alcohol. It is designed to be burned directly from its can. Its primary uses are in the food service industry for buffet heating and in the home for fondue and as a chafing fuel for heating chafing dishes. Other uses are for camp stoves and as an emergency heat source. It is also a popular fuel for use with toy and model steam and other external combustion engines.

Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. - The Woodstock Music & Art Fairinformally, the Woodstock Festival or simply Woodstockwas a music festival attracting an audience of over 400,000 people, scheduled over three days on a dairy farm in New York state from August 15 to 17, 1969, but ultimately ran four days long, ending August 18, 1969. - Mississippi is a state in the southern region of the United States, with part of its southern border formed by the Gulf of Mexico.

As he gets settled in he reflects on the turn of events in a flashback of his time working at Saint Benedict's Academy, a prestigious preparatory school. Twenty-eight years earlier, a younger Mr. Hundert is enthusiastic about the start of the school year. His class turns out to be a strict yet inspiring lesson for the freshmen. They include laid-back Louis Masoudi, introverted Martin Blythe, and studious Deepak Mehta. Hundert inspires his students to study hard in order to become one of the three contestants for The Emperor's Club and be crowned \\"Mr. Julius Caesar\\", an academic competition between top three students of his class regarding the Classics. When the headmaster explains the contest to the students, he mentions that Blythe's father was once a \\"Mr. Julius Caesar\\". Hundert's orderly world is shaken when a new student, Sedgewick Bell, walks into his classroom late. Bell is the cocky son of a senior U.S. senator who possesses none of Hundert's principles. After Sedgewick plays the class clown, Hundert asks him to name a single Roman Emperor. When Bell cannot, Hundert has the other students perfectly recite the line of succession of the Roman Empire. Hundert also makes a trip to Washington, D.C. to meet with Senator Bell. Bell's father is uninterested in his son's character development, telling Hundert just to teach Bell so he can graduate. In a phone call, Senator Bell chastises Sedgewick for wasting his fatherâs time and money. After seeing him chastened, Hundert tries to become a mentor to Bell in order to make him a better man.

Once wasn't enough. I did it again. Then I cut open my womb' Ines emerges from her house, one of three small dwellings built of roughly made bricks that stand in a clearing of tierra colorada, the red earth common in the region, surrounded by a pine forest. A slim but sturdy woman about five feet tall, she is wearing a bright red dress and a green apron. Three young children are in attendance. Ines, 43, had her first child when she was 15. Her house has bare walls and no furniture, though there is a black-and-white television in one corner. Electricity has recently arrived in her village of Rio Talea, but water has to be brought from a well. A fat pig forages among piles of chopped wood around the outdoor stove. Inside, Ramirez pounds maize on a slab of volcanic rock to make the tortillas that form the basis of the family's diet, enlivened by salsas of tomato, chilli and onion. In this remote district, meat is a rarity. Today, as on the night Ines gave birth, there is no sign of a man around the house. \\"En el campo [in the countryside],\\" she shrugs. Gently pressed to elaborate, she replies again: \\"En el campo,\\" suggesting that the children's father is an itinerant labourer, or perhaps a wood cutter who illegally fells trees at night. Haltingly at first, Ines tells the remarkable story of how she gave birth. \\"I had seven children before Orlando,\\" she says. \\"There was no problem with the births. But the eighth baby died. My waters broke and the midwife said I needed a caesarean but I couldn't get to the hospital in time. I felt the baby struggling but then it stopped moving. \\"When I was seven months pregnant with Orlando, one night the pain began. It was terrible. I couldn't bear it. I started to panic. I knew I had to do something or this baby would die too. I knew I had to get it out somehow.\\" Her son Benito, who was then eight years old, was sent up the hill to a little shop half a mile away to buy a kitchen knife. \\"We had a knife but it wasn't that sharp.\\" In her desperation not to lose another child, Ines cut into her womb as if cutting a tortilla. \\"Blood came out of me like a fountain.\\" Pushing aside her internal organs, she rummaged around inside and pulled out her son. To her great joy, the baby cried, and appeared healthy, but Ines's ordeal was only just beginning. As mother and baby lay on the floor, Ines cut the umbilical cord before putting her organs back in place as best as she could. \\"It was all a mess,\\" she remembers. Her son, Benito, was sent off once again - this time to find a man with first-aid training. He arrived with a sewing needle and thread and attempted to stitch the wound. \\"Then he piled me into a pasajero [a rural mini-bus] and drove me to the clinic.\\" The clinic was an hour's drive away along bumpy winding roads, in the village of San Lorenzo Texmelucan. \\"A lady doctor saw me,\\" Ines continued. \\"She took one look and said, 'You've got to go to San Pedro'. They put me and the baby in the back of a pick-up truck.\\" The state hospital at San Pedro was another two-hour drive away down unpaved roads, on the main highway that links Oaxaca City to Puerto Escondido, a holiday resort on the Mexican coast. By this stage, her pain numbed only by the alcohol, Ines was near to collapse. \\"The lady doctor had phoned San Pedro and they'd sent an ambulance,\\" she says. \\"I can hardly remember the rest.\\" Four years later - Orlando is now a healthy little boy who attends nursery school every day - Dr Onorio Galvan, head of the obstetrics department in the state hospital in San Pedro, remains astonished. \\"She was my star patient,\\" he says. Switching on his computer, he plays a little clip of a small woman in a white hospital smock, carrying a baby in her arms. It is his reminder of the week - remarkably, she stayed no longer - that Ines spent in his hospital. \\"I couldn't believe it,\\" says Dr Galvan. \\"There was no sepsis in the wound, no internal bleeding. She was back on her feet in a couple of days.\\" Five days later, she was on her way back home - by bus. Today, her younger children are charging around the house. Orlando, a bright-eyed boy, breaks into a run to catch up with his brother and sister, aged 12 and 13 respectively. He falls over, gets up, dusts himself down and carries on. As for his mother, she still remembers how she brought Orlando home from hospital on that long bus journey. The bus followed a circuitous route through the hills to Ines's village. It was a 12-hour journey, so Ines didn't stay on board to its final destination. Reaching the mountains where she lives, she got off. With Orlando strapped to her back in a shawl, she walked for one and a half hours along footpaths to reach her home. \\"It was a short-cut,\\" she explains. What was this article about?","output":"This article narrates the remarkable story of Ines Ramirez, a woman who performed a cesarean section on herself while she was seven months pregnant. Living in a remote village in Mexico called Rio Talea, Ines faced terrible pain and the threat of losing her child. Fearful that her baby would die, just like her eighth child, she took matters into her own hands and decided to cut open her womb with a kitchen knife to save her baby. Her son Benito bought the knife, and Ines successfully performed the procedure, managing to put her organs back in place and cutting the umbilical cord herself. A man with first-aid training tried to stitch the wound before Ines was taken to different hospitals to seek proper treatment. Despite the risks involved with such a self-performed surgery, Ines experienced no sepsis in the wound or internal bleeding. Dr. Onorio Galvan, head of the obstetrics department in the state hospital in San Pedro, treated Ines and was amazed at her recovery. She spent only a week in the hospital and was later discharged. The baby, Orlando, grew up to be a healthy little boy. The story highlights Ines's incredible determination and resourcefulness in ensuring the survival of her child in a dire situation with no immediate access to proper healthcare."},{"instruction":"Today is day one of the week long grand opening for Pizza Rock! So excited to hear another new establishment has moved downtown! What's even better was I heard they were showcasing their menu for the public and fine tune the overall experience for the actual opening on Saturday. Originally, we heard you needed reservations to eat there for free this week, however, a coworker mentioned to us that folks working downtown will be able to roll in without reservations and be seated for dinner. This was a perfect opportunity for a couple of us to have a nice dinner after a hard day's work! The restaurant is on the corner of Ogden and 3rd St, attached to the Mob Bar and Triple George saloon. Right away, you notice the huge \\"Pizza Rock\\" sign from the outside, bordered by flame artwork. When you enter, there's a nice seating area with a very friendly hostess station. Everyone was super excited to greet you and take your name. Because of the grand opening, we were able to walk around the restaurant and take a look at the decor. To the right of the hostess stand was the Pizza Takeout window with a viewable kitchen. Pretty cool. After the seating area, the main focal point of the restaurant is the life sized semi truck in the middle of the dining area. Super cool! It serves as a multi purpose art. Aside from the obvious attention grabber, it's the new DJ station AND serves to break up the bar area and dining area. WOW! The bar is huge and gorgeous! Lots of metal art accents around it. Lots of exposed brick around the restaurant. They even have little private coves for seating in the dining area if you want to entertain that romantic date or have an intimate family dinner. Lots going on and it all seems to work. When we were greeted by our server, Shirley, we were informed of a couple of things: They didn't have pasta, they didn't have bread, they didn't have sausage and they didn't have steak. Kind of bummed about it but everything else was free so I couldn't really complain. Shirley was a bit flustered as I expected on day one. She quoted the wrong price for wine, ordered our food at different times which resulted in a lot of waiting and found herself making multiple trips to the table, because of the lack of efficiency. I completely understand. First day jitters are a given. She had a GREAT personality and that ended up going a long way in my book. For dinner, here's what we got: Classic Caesar, normally for 10.00: Hearts of Romaine, Homemade Caesar dressing, House Croutons and shaved pieces of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Definitely a shareable dish. I think this could comfortable feed 3 people as their first course. Lots of fresh ingredients, but I didn't have a few issues with this salad. The croutons were way too toasted and very crunchy. The dressing, as being the star of the dish was way too tangy. They made it with A LOT of anchovies. Now I'm a HUGE fan of homemade Caesar dressing but this was way too overpowered with anchovies. Margherita Pizza, normally for 15.00: This pizza was a 2007 World Pizza Cup Winner in Italy! Hand mixed dough using imported flour and proofed in wood boxed imported from Italy. WOW. San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, extra virgin olive oil and sea salt. The dough from the crust was amazing but the crust turned out a little burnt and had a slightly bitter taste. The sauce was one of the stars of the show, nice and creamy. Mozzarella was flavorful and there were a lot for a Margherita, which was awesome. The only critique was the basil. Not enough to taste that element which makes a great pie. Downtown Pizza, normally for 19.00: WOW, lots going on! Mozzarella, pepperoni, salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, read onions, bell peppers, olives, Italian sausage and cherry tomatoes. Think of it as an upgraded supreme. With all these ingredients, there was no lack of flavor! WOW loved the flavor punch. My only feedback was the crust was too thin for this pizza. It couldn't support the amount of toppings. It became soggy real fast and we ended up losing a lot of the toppings on the table. Manhattan Calzone, normally for 12.00: Stuffed with meatballs, mozzarella, ricotta and garlic. As my friend put it, you would pay 12 bucks for cheese and bread. LOTS of CHEESE. Omg, it was everywhere. I personally don't think Ricotta is needed. Maybe use a lot more meat to balance out the cheese. Holy cheese! During this week, all menu food items are free. Our entire bill was comped which was the best part of the evening. Please remember to tip your servers great! This review, I've created, is to give the best and most valuable feedback, so this place thrives downtown. Just the ambiance alone will take them far. I will certainly be back to try other items of the menu. Next time, I'm hitting the steak and pasta hard! How would this review be described in terms of sentiment? pick from the following. 1). negative 2). positive","output":"2). positive This review is more positive than negative as the reviewer seems to be excited about the new establishment and enjoyed the overall experience. Although there were some issues with the food and service, the reviewer acknowledges that it was the first day and is understanding about it.

Billy Bones is an important character during the first few chapters of the book as he significantly impacts the life of the protagonist, Jim, and sets the stage for the unfolding pirate adventure. Billy Bones is described as a tall, strong, and gruff-looking man with a scar across his face, whose intimidating presence left everyone but a few brave souls fearful of approaching him. The Spyglass Inn is a seaside tavern located in a small English village. Billy Bones arrives at the inn one day and takes up residence for a period of time. He pays Jim's father, who is the innkeeper, and asks Jim to keep an eye out for a one-legged man, ominously hinting at the dangers associated with such an individual. Billy Bones possesses a mysterious sea chest and is frequently visited by other scary-looking seafarers. These men are after the treasure map that he keeps inside the chest. The appearance of these pirate characters at the inn eventually leads to the death of Billy Bones--a result of a stroke caused by the stress of their confrontation. Just before his death, Billy Bones reveals to Jim that he used to be a part of the infamous Captain Flint's pirate crew. In fact, he was Flint's first mate. The treasure map in question leads to Treasure Island, which contains the buried riches of Captain Flint. Following the death of Billy Bones, Jim, along with his friends, Doctor Livesey, a wealthy squire named Trelawney, and a motley crew of seafarers, set sail on a dangerous adventure to find the hidden treasures. In conclusion, at the beginning of 'Treasure Island,' Billy Bones is the landlord of The Spyglass Inn. He is an enigmatic character whose past as a pirate plays an essential role in building the intrigue and suspense of the novel. His introduction into Jim's life leads to a thrilling adventure that has resonated with many generations of readers since its publication."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be shown a Persian passage and question.

A number of sports are popular throughout the British Isles, the most prominent of which is association football. While this is organised separately in different national associations, leagues and national teams, even within the UK, it is a common passion in all parts of the islands. Rugby union is also widely enjoyed across the islands with four national teams from England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The British and Irish Lions is a team chosen from each national team and undertakes tours of the southern hemisphere rugby playing nations every four years. Ireland play as a united team, represented by players from both Northern Ireland and the Republic. These national rugby teams play each other each year for the Triple Crown as part of the Six Nations Championship. Also since 2001 the professional club teams of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Italy compete against each other in the RaboDirect Pro12. In which hemisphere do the rugby playing countries meet once every four years? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The rugby playing countries meet once every four years in the southern hemisphere. Like when you look at a globe, you can divide the earth into two halves, a top half and a bottom half. The top half is called the northern hemisphere, and the bottom half is called the southern hemisphere. So, the rugby teams go to countries in the bottom half, or the southern hemisphere, to play their matches every four years."},{"instruction":"SACRAMENTO, Calif., Nov. 16, 2004 (SmartPros) California Public Employees #39; Retirement System (CalPERS) has a new plan quot;to reign in abusive compensation practices in corporate America and hold directors and Q: Which is the best summary of this article?

Position the log horizontally in the carriage so that the blade can cut through its center. Slide the log down the carriage until one end is flush with the blade. Cut the log in half lengthwise, then turn the saw off. To maximize the amount of lumber you get from the log, you can now cut several wide boards from the bottom of one of the halves you just cut. Once you’ve cut the log in half, line one of the halves up along the blade. You will need to stand it up on its edge. Turn the saw back on and cut the half into 2 equal parts. Turn the saw off and remove these parts. If you haven’t cut boards from the other half already, place the remaining half log back in the saw carriage, turn the saw on, and cut this log into 2 equal parts. Always double-check that the saw is turned off when removing cut logs from the carriage to minimize your risk of injury. Place a quartered section on the saw carriage. Orient the saw blade near the open face so that you can cut a board off of it of a predetermined thickness. Turn the saw on and saw off a board. For example, if you want boards that are 1 in (2.5 cm) thick, align the blade 1 in (2.5 cm) away from one side of the log. Slide the quarter back under the blade so that the blade is positioned to cut a board of the same thickness as the first, and then saw off another board. Repeat this last step until you have cut the log into as many boards as possible. Remember to turn the log 90° before sawing off each board. Use your quarter-sawn boards to build beautiful wood products! For example, you might build a cabinet or table, use long boards for flooring, or create small objects like boxes or cutting boards. Place 2 quarters next to each other. Then slide each quarter under the blade and cut the 2 quarters at the same time. Remove the 2 resulting boards. Pull the 2 quarters apart and rotate each quarter 90°. Place the quarters back under the blade, then cut another 2 boards. Repeat this process until you have cut all of the boards you can from the quarters. Freshly sawn wood typically has quite a bit of moisture in it, so your boards will need to be dried before you can use them. Find a storage spot outdoors where you can stack your boards away from trees (which can drop leaf litter and twigs) or soggy soil. To create the best air flow, elevate your boards on cinder blocks and line them up side by side. If you have a lot of boards, stack them in layers separated by thin wooden slats, then weigh the whole stack down with more cinder blocks. Look for a spot where prevailing winds will blow through the side of the stack of lumber. Use a moisture meter to check the moisture content of the wood periodically. The goal is to achieve a moisture level of around 15-20%. Depending on the weather conditions and the original moisture content of the boards, it may take several months for the lumber to dry.

It is set in 91 BCE, when Lucius Licinius Crassus dies, just before the Social War and the civil war between Marius and Sulla, during which Marcus Antonius Orator, the other great orator of this dialogue, dies. During this year, the author faces a difficult political situation: after his return from exile in Dyrrachium (modern Albania), his house was destroyed by the gangs of Clodius in a time when violence was common. This was intertwined with the street politics of Rome. - Lucius Licinius Crassus ( 140 BC -- 91 BC ) was a Roman consul . He was considered the greatest Roman orator of his day , by his pupil Cicero . He became consul in 95 BC. During his consulship a law was passed ( the lex Licinia Mucia ) requiring all but citizens to leave Rome , an edict which provoked the Social War . In 92 BC he was elected censor with Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus . Licinius Crassus was married to Mucia Tertia , younger daughter of the Consul Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur by his wife Laelia , daughter of Gaius Laelius Sapiens . They had two surviving children : Licinia Crassa Prima or Major married to the Praetor of 93 BC , Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica , the son of Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio and descendant of Scipio Africanus and Scipio Nasica , and by whom she had issue Licinia Crassa Secunda or Minor , who married Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius , eventually Pontifex Maximus who adopted Licinia Crassa Major 's son , who then became known as Metellus Scipio . According to both Plutarch and Cicero , a Licinia , daughter of this man , was married to Gaius Marius the Younger . The marriage may have taken place around 95 BC , though the date is pure supposition by scholars , based on the known political alliance between the two fathers ( Crassus and Gaius Marius ) , the fact that men could not marry before they turned 14 , but that leading families tended to marry early to cement alliances . Nothing is known of Licinia after Marius the Younger 's death in 82 BC , although in the time of Caesar Amatius , a Pseudo-Marius , appeared in Rome claiming to be their son - Cicero seems to have accepted the possibility that he might indeed be a Marius , though he tried not to involve himself in a politically difficult situation . He is also noted by Cicero in De Oratore that Licinius Crassus was a friend of Marcus Vigellius . - Marcus Tullius Cicero ( \\"Kikern\\"; 3 January 106 BC 7 December 43 BC) was a Roman philosopher, politician, lawyer, orator, political theorist, consul, and constitutionalist. He came from a wealthy municipal family of the Roman equestrian order, and is considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists. - Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix (c. 138 BC 78 BC), known commonly as Sulla, was a Roman general and statesman. He had the distinction of holding the office of consul twice, as well as reviving the dictatorship. Sulla was awarded a grass crown, the most prestigious Roman military honor, during the Social War. Sulla was a skillful general, achieving numerous successes in wars against different opponents, both foreign and Roman. His life was habitually included in the ancient biographical collections of leading generals and politicians, originating in the biographical compendium of famous Romans published by Marcus Terentius Varro. In Plutarch's \\"Parallel Lives\\" Sulla is paired with the Spartan general and strategist Lysander. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'date of death' with '91 bce'.

The early to mid-1960s are regarded as Toussaint's most creatively successful period. Notable examples of his work are Jessie Hill's \\"Ooh Poo Pah Doo\\" (written by Hill and arranged and produced by Toussaint), Ernie K-Doe's \\"Mother-in-Law\\", and Chris Kenner's \\"I Like It Like That\\". A two-sided 1962 hit by Benny Spellman comprised \\"Lipstick Traces (on a Cigarette)\\" (covered by the O'Jays, Ringo Starr, and Alex Chilton) and the simple but effective \\"Fortune Teller\\" (covered by various 1960s rock groups, including the Rolling Stones, the Nashville Teens, the Who, the Hollies, the Throb, and ex-Searchers founder Tony Jackson). \\"Ruler of My Heart\\", written under his pseudonym Naomi Neville, first recorded by Irma Thomas for the Minit label in 1963, was adapted by Otis Redding under the title \\"Pain in My Heart\\" later that year, prompting Toussaint to file a lawsuit against Redding and his record company, Stax (the claim was settled out of court, with Stax agreeing to credit Naomi Neville as the songwriter). Redding's version of the song was also recorded by the Rolling Stones on their second album. In 1964, \\"A Certain Girl\\" (originally by Ernie K-Doe) was the B-side of the first single release by the Yardbirds.

Question: Where is a snake likely to reside? Options: A. tropics B. nightmare C. wyoming D. bushes E. feild A:","output":"A snake is likely to reside in a variety of places depending on its species, habitat preferences, and geographical distribution. However, based on the options provided and using common sense, the most appropriate answers would be a combination of options A, D, and E. A. Tropics - Many snake species can be found in tropical regions, where the climate is warm and humid. These conditions are conducive to snake habitat as they can maintain the necessary body temperature and find plenty of food sources such as small mammals, birds, and amphibians. Some common tropical snakes include the boa constrictor, green tree python, and various species of venomous pit vipers. D. Bushes - Snakes can often be found in bushes and other low-lying vegetation, where they can hide from predators and ambush their prey. Bushes also provide a cool and shaded environment for snakes to avoid extreme temperatures, especially during hot summer days. Some common snakes found in bushes include garter snakes, copperheads, and corn snakes. E. Field - Fields, especially grassy and open areas, can also be home to various snake species. In fields, snakes can find a suitable habitat with plenty of food sources such as rodents, birds, and insects. Fields provide snakes with ample space to move around, hunt for food, and bask in the sun for thermoregulation. Some common snakes found in fields include rat snakes, king snakes, and hognose snakes. While option C (Wyoming) is a specific geographical location and does have some native snake species, it is not a general answer that applies to snake habitats globally. Option B (nightmare) is not a valid answer as it refers to a distressing or unpleasant dream and not a physical location where snakes would reside."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: where did the dust bowl occur in the 1930's?","output":"The Dust Bowl, also known as the Dirty Thirties, was a period of severe dust storms that occurred in the 1930s. It significantly affected the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies and caused immense economic hardships for the regions. The primary focus of the Dust Bowl phenomena was in the Great Plains region. This area spans over a vast expanse of land, covering portions of multiple states in the United States and some parts of Canada. The Dust Bowl primarily occurred in the following states: 1. Texas: In the panhandle and rolling plains regions found in the north and northwest part of the state. 2. Oklahoma: Particularly in the western half and the Oklahoma Panhandle. 3. Kansas: Primarily in the western third of the state, including areas like Garden City, Liberal, and Hutchinson. 4. Colorado: The southeastern corner of Colorado, including towns such as Lamar, Springfield, and Holly. 5. New Mexico: The northeastern part of the state, specifically in the area known as the High Plains. 6. Nebraska: The southern portion, which included towns such as McCook and Imperial. Additional areas affected to a lesser extent are parts of South Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana in the United States, as well as the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Several factors contributed to the Dust Bowl, including a decade-long drought, poor agricultural practices, and economic depression during the 1930s. Following the expansion of agriculture in the Great Plains region during the early 20th century, farmers inadvertently eliminated much of the natural grasses that anchored the soil and protected it against wind erosion. In combination with a significant drop in rainfall, this led to severe dust storms that caused devastating damage to farmland, human health, and the economy. The impact of the Dust Bowl was felt on an extensive scale, prompting hundreds of thousands of individuals and families to abandon their homes and farms in search of better prospects elsewhere. This mass exodus, known as the Dust Bowl migration, led many to California and other western states, fundamentally altering the demographics and culture of those regions."},{"instruction":"Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: The salesperson was like a shark pacing around for his prey, and the what was his sea?

So, when we see the equation 2091*s - 2072*s, it means you have to take away 2072 candies from 2091 candies. Now, let's solve the equation: 2091*s - 2072*s = 0 To do this, we find the difference between the two numbers of candies. 2091 - 2072 = 19 Now, we have 19 candies left. So, the equation becomes: 19*s = 0 To make it easier to understand, think of this as having 19 candy bags, and you want to know how many candies are in each bag (s). But in total, there are no candies (0). That can only mean that there are no candies in any of the bags. So, the value of s is: s = 0 And that's the solution!

Context: I think that one of the people who caused me the most misery for the longest was someone that I’ll call “Luna”. So, most people have probably met that person that acts all suicidal and then uses that against you. For example, you’re talking to someone like that and you’re having some sort of argument and the moment they realize they aren’t winning they send you pictures of their bloodied wrists and say “This is your fault”. Well, that person was my friend for a long time. Every time I would try to leave her to go to sleep she would threaten to do “something bad” and I knew what she meant, and me, first meeting her when I was around 9 or 10, and I was still extremely naive. So most of the time, I ended up staying awake til 3 AM on school nights and I would get only a few hours of sleep, and she’d be happy because her life wasn’t worsened at all. But I think the thing that made me the most miserable, was the fact that it never got better. No matter how much I talked to her, or how sympathetic I tried to be, or how much I tried to convince her to be happier, it never got better. She still acted super depressed, but like it was a joke. All of these things combined to make me completely miserable because it seemed like it was all for nothing. But I just let it happen, because she was the only person I had and she was really my only “friend” at that point, and all the way up to seventh grade.

The two year guarantee will cover exhaust and emissions control parts. The European Commission has been putting pressure on VW to compensate customers over its emissions scandal, but the company has refused. And European class action lawsuits are picking up steam. Analysis: BBC business correspondent Theo Leggett Volkswagen's \\"fix\\" was meant to solve one big problem - but has it created others? There are plenty of owners who think it has. There have been widespread reports of expensive mechanical failures, of cars losing performance, becoming less economical and - somewhat ironically - producing excessive exhaust fumes. Volkswagen itself argues that 99% of owners haven't complained. That may be true, but given the huge numbers involved, that still leaves thousands of unhappy customers. The company is under intense political pressure in Europe to do more for customers affected by the scandal. In the US, it is being forced to pay out billions of dollars to buy back affected vehicles and provide compensation. But owners in Europe haven't received a penny, because the company believes that the value of their cars hasn't been affected. Under those circumstances, it could ill-afford another public-relations disaster. There's no question that the chorus of complaints has been growing in recent weeks - and attracting media attention. Its new \\"trust building measure\\" may help to mollify some of those angry owners and limit negative press coverage. But pressure from consumer bodies for a more generous response is unlikely to ease. The guarantee has conditions attached. It will only cover certain car parts in vehicles that have been driven for under 250,000km (about 155,000 miles), and will depend on the service history of the car and the age of the affected parts. VW admitted to US regulators in September 2015 that it had cheated on emissions tests there using software installed in as many as 11 million diesel vehicles sold worldwide - the majority of them in Europe. In the aftermath of the diesel emissions scandal, Volkswagen agreed to modify millions of vehicles in Europe which were equipped with the software capable of undermining the emissions testing process. In the US the company agreed to pay substantial compensation and buy back cars. However, emissions controls are not as tight in Europe, and the firm has resisted paying compensation, despite pressure from the European Commission. But on Tuesday UK law firm Harcus Sinclair and Dutch Foundation \\"Stichting Volkswagen Car Claim\\", a US-style class action on behalf of an estimated 180,000 Dutch VW car owners, teamed up in a move for coordinated litigation. A summary of the above article is?","output":"UK consumers have reported that Volkswagen's modifications to vehicles affected by the emissions scandal have negatively impacted performance and reliability.

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center.

Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules.

For every five years, eight village youths are stolen from their families to the capital of the Minos Empire and placed in the underground labyrinth to be a sacrifice to the Minotaur, the Minoan god. Theo, haunted by the loss of his love, Fion, in an earlier sacrifice, is convinced that the beast is not a deity and that his love still lives within the labyrinth. His father Cyrnan, the village leader, tries to reason with Theo not to go but Theo is driven by blind rage and made his way in with seven other youths to be sacrifical lambs. However, Theo intends to kill the Minotaur. Along with his fellow captives, Tyro, Danu, Vena, Morna, Didi, Ziko and Cyrnan, they are placed in the labyrinth by King Deucalion, with the youths slaugthered one by one by the Minotaur. However, Theo is aided by Deucalion's sister, Queen Raphaella, who reveals that her mother gave herself to the most disturbing actions to create a living god, the Minotaur. As the Minotaur grows, so does its appetite when it murdered Deucalion's brother, resulting with the human sacrifices to appense the Minotaur while ensuring Minos's surival.Theo along the way discovers the labyrinth is connected to an underground vent and Tyro tempts the Minotaur to crash into one of the vents but is unsuccessful as the Minotaur eats him alive. Theo then tempts the Minotaur and in the process, the Minotaur breaks his left horn, but continues to charge after Theo. As Theo ran back towards the enlarged vent, he scratches the walls and generates a spark that ignites the whole labyrinth, and dives into a pond of water where Raphaella was waiting for him. They emerge from the water as the flames die out, but the beast is still alive and attempts to charge at them again.

The increased temperature imparts more kinetic energy to the molecules, leading to a higher frequency and intensity of molecular collisions. Consequently, the interaction between the solute particles and the solvent molecules is enhanced, which in turn, leads to more effective dissolution of the solute within the liquid medium. The solubility of a substance is governed by a variety of factors, including temperature, pressure, and the nature of the solvent and solute. The dependency on temperature stems from the specific heat properties and the intermolecular forces within the solute-solvent system. As reiterated, raising the temperature increases molecular motions, causing the solute and solvent particles to intermingle more effectively. Consequently, a greater number of solute particles are surrounded by solvent particles, eventually disseminating uniformly throughout the liquid. In addition to a heightened level of solubility, hotter temperatures induce the following changes in a liquid: 1. Decreased viscosity: As the temperature increases, the liquid becomes less viscous, allowing particles to move more freely, thereby accelerating the dissolution process. 2. Variation in saturation point: The saturation point refers to the maximum amount of solute that can be dissolved in a fixed amount of solvent at a certain temperature. With a rise in temperature, the saturation point is augmented, allowing for the dissolution of more solute particles. 3. Expanded volume: Higher temperatures result in the dilation of the liquid, which creates more space for the solute particles to disperse within the solvent. 4. Henry's law: The solubility of gases in liquids diminishes as temperature increases. This is an exception to the general rule that solubility of solids increases at higher temperatures. The reason for this exception is that gases exhibit reduced solubility at elevated temperatures due to the increased kinetic energy of gas molecules, which allows them to escape from the liquid more easily. It is important to recognize that the relationship between temperature and solubility is not universally linear. Certain solid solutes demonstrate little to no change in solubility, even as the temperature fluctuates, while others may exhibit a decrease in solubility at higher temperatures, although this is an uncommon scenario. The exact rate at which solubility shifts with temperature varies among substances and is typically represented graphically by solubility curves. In conclusion, as a liquid's temperature gets hotter, the capacity of that liquid to dissolve solid solutes typically increases due to enhanced molecular interactions and kinetic energy. This effect is especially significant in solutions containing solid solutes, leading to an overall increase in solubility. Nonetheless, it is crucial to consider the particular solute-solvent system and the specific nature of temperature dependency, as individual substances may exhibit deviations from this general rule."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

The context does, however, raise concerns about the current strain on the National Guard and Reserve forces. Many of these forces are being held beyond their enlistment period, leading some to claim that there is a \\"back-door draft\\" in place. This could indicate that the Senator, while not in opposition to President Bush's stance against a draft, might be concerned about the consequences of maintaining the current status quo. The Senator might feel that the current situation is unfair or unsustainable for servicemen and women who have already fulfilled their contracts. In this situation, the Senator's views might be interpreted as mixed, rather than in direct disagreement with President Bush. The Senator agrees that an official draft is not a favorable option, but may see the need to address and resolve the issues affecting National Guard and Reserve forces.

Option A - Put the car in the garage, does not present a viable solution to Kendall's problem, as it does not help them gain access to a vehicle. Thus, it can be eliminated from consideration. Now, let's analyze the remaining options in detail: Option B - Ask another friend to let them borrow the car: Kendall might consider approaching another friend for assistance. This choice would involve contacting someone from their social circle who owns a car and is likely to be reliable and hospitable. In order to achieve this, Kendall would need to evaluate their relationships and determine which friend would be the most suitable candidate for borrowing a car. If Kendall decides to pursue this option, they would need to: 1. Identify the friend who is most likely to lend their car. 2. Contact the friend to explain their situation and request assistance. 3. Make arrangements to collect the borrowed car and clarify any terms and conditions involved, such as duration, fuel, and any financial compensation. 4.

Return the borrowed car to the friend upon completing their use of the vehicle and express gratitude for the help provided. Option C - Rent a new car: In this option, Kendall is considering renting a car to meet their transportation needs. Renting a car would provide Kendall with a more convenient and secure method of obtaining a vehicle that suits their situation and requirements.

When composing sentences, English grammar serves as a guide for properly arranging words and phrases to communicate clear and coherent ideas. Grammatical errors can lead to confusion and difficulty in understanding the intended message. Here is an example of a grammatically unacceptable sentence, followed by an analysis of its errors: \\"Chair he the sit.\\" A grammatically unacceptable sentence breaks syntax, word order, agreement, parts of speech coordination, or punctuation rules, among other potential issues. In the provided example, there are several grammatical errors: 1. Incorrect word order: English follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in a simple sentence. In this case, \\"he\\" is the subject, \\"sit\\" is the verb, and \\"chair\\" is the object. The correct word order should be \\"He sits the chair.\\" 2. Agreement: Verbs must match their subjects in number and person (first, second, or third person). In this case, the verb \\"sit\\" should be in the third person singular form, \\"sits.\\" This would result in the correct sentence, \\"He sits on the chair.\\" 3. Prepositions and syntax: While connecting two nouns, prepositions should be used effectively to indicate their relationship. In this case, \\"he\\" and \\"chair\\" are connected by the action \\"sits,\\" which requires a preposition to show their correct relationship. The proper preposition here would be \\"on,\\" as in \\"He sits on the chair.\\" Ultimately, the grammatically correct sentence should be structured as follows: \\"He sits on the chair.\\" This sentence obeys standard English syntax rules, verb-subject agreement, and properly employs prepositions to clearly communicate the intended meaning."},{"instruction":"What are the minimum marks required in NEET 2016 to get admission in BDS govt or pvt dental colleges by state(M.P.) quota seats for general category?

Give me reasons, before answering the question","output":"To determine how much each of them will earn, we first need to calculate the total earnings from selling the shoes and shirts. Shoe earnings: There were 6 pairs of shoes sold at 3 per pair, so: 6 pairs * 3 per pair = 18 Shirt earnings: There were 18 shirts sold at 2 per shirt, so: 18 shirts * 2 per shirt = 36 Total earnings from both shoes and shirts: 18 (shoe earnings) + 36 (shirt earnings) = 54 Now, we need to divide the total earnings between Sab and Dane equally. Total earnings / 2 people = 54 / 2 = 27 So, Sab and Dane will each earn 27. Reasoning: The question asks how much each of them will earn if they divide their total earnings equally.

The two premises, while sharing similarities, cannot be definitively linked without further context or information. The first premise, \\"Two men in hard hats and work coveralls look at the docked ship one of them points at,\\" provides a clear visual image of two men dressed in construction attire observing a docked ship. However, it does not reveal the reasons or thoughts behind their actions. The primary focus of this premise is the physical event taking place. On the other hand, the second premise, \\"Two construction workers consider a career change as sailors after the one points out a docked ship,\\" provides insight into the thoughts and motivations of the two construction workers. It suggests that they are pondering a shift in occupation from construction to sailing, instigated by one of them pointing at a docked ship. This premise focuses more on the characters' emotional and mental states. The two premises exhibit common elements such as the presence of two construction workers, a docked ship, and one worker pointing at the ship. However, the first premise does not provide sufficient information to determine whether the two men are contemplating a career change or not.

Her mother met her father, who was twenty years her senior, at age eighteen, and Carlisle was born nine months later. She was named after her mother's favorite film, Johnny Belinda (1948). Carlisle was the first of seven siblings, with three brothers and three sisters. Carlisle's first venture into music was in 1977 as drummer for the punk rock band the Germs, under the name Dottie Danger. She was recruited into the band by Lorna Doom, whom she had met in an art class while a student at Thousand Oaks High School. However, her time in the band was short due to her contracting mononucleosis, and she never recorded or performed live with the Germs. According to Pat Smear, upon quitting, she introduced her friend, Donna Rhia, who became her replacement. Carlisle does appear on one recording introducing the band at a 1977 performance at the Whisky a Go Go, heard on the live album Germicide (1977). Around this time Carlisle did some back-up singing for Black Randy and the Metrosquad. Soon after leaving the Germs, she co-founded The Go-Go's (originally named the Misfits), with friends and fellow musicians Margot Olavarria, Elissa Bello, and Jane Wiedlin. Olavarria and Bello were soon out of the group and the new line-up included bassist-turned-guitarist Charlotte Caffey, guitarist-turned-bassist Kathy Valentine, and drummer Gina Schock. All five women were largely untrained musicians, and Carlisle recalls having to use tape as fret markers during their initial songwriting: \\"[Charlotte] had to show us how to plug in our amps,\\" she said. The Go-Go's would go on to become one of the most successful American bands of the 1980s, helping usher new wave music into popular American radio, and becoming the first all-female band who wrote their own music and played their own instruments to ever achieve a No. 1 album, Beauty and the Beat, which featured the hits \\"We Got the Beat\\" and \\"Our Lips Are Sealed\\". The Go-Go's recorded two more studio albums on I.R.S. Records, including 1982's Vacation, which went gold. \\"Head over Heels\\", from their 1984 album Talk Show, made it to No. 11. In 1984, Carlisle made a foray into acting in the movie Swing Shift, starring alongside Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell.

In Turkish, the verb usually comes at the end of the clause. 2. \\"that Maliqi's decision is legal and in accordance with procedures\\" becomes \\"Maliqi'nin kararının yasal ve prosedürlere uygun olduğunu\\". In Turkish, this subordinate clause is expressed as a nominal sentence whose subject is Maliqi's decision (\\"Maliqi'nin kararı\\"). 3. \\"adding that the Kosovo police are ready 'for actions in all situations, in which police actions will be co-ordinated with the EULEX and KFOR police branch'.\\" is translated as \\"Kosova polisinin 'polis eylemlerinin EULEX ve KFOR polis şubesiyle koordineli olacağı tüm durumlar için' eyleme geçmeye hazır olduğunu ekledi\\". Again, due to the verb-final nature of Turkish language, \\"are ready\\" is translated as \\"hazır olduğunu\\" and placed toward the end of the sentence. The phrase within the quotes is translated almost verbatim, but again with the verb \\"will be co-ordinated\\" translated as \\"koordineli olacağı\\" and placed before the noun it modifies, in accordance with Turkish syntax."},{"instruction":"there is something magical about that place so every time she visits her, she feels like she is in a fairy tale.

He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders. - Historical regions (or historical countries) are delimitations of geographic areas for studying and analysing social development of period-specific cultures without any reference to contemporary political, economic or social organisations. The fundamental principle underlying this view is that older political and mental structures exist which exercise greater influence on the spatial-social identity of individuals than is understood by the contemporary world, bound to and often blinded by its own worldview - e.g. the focus on the nation-state. Definitions of regions vary, and regions can include macroregions such as Europe, territories of traditional states, or smaller microregional areas. A geographic proximity is the often required precondition for emergence of a regional identity. In Europe the regional identities are often derived from the Migration Period, but for the contemporary perspective are related to the 1918-1920 time of territorial transformation, and another in the post-Cold War period. - Basileus is a Greek term and title that has signified various types of monarchs in history. In the English-speaking world it is perhaps most widely understood to mean \\"king\\" or \\"emperor\\". The best known use of the title is by the Byzantine emperors, but the title also has a longer history of use by sovereigns and other persons of authority in ancient Greece, as well as for the kings of modern Greece. - The Arabian Sea is a region of the northern Indian Ocean bounded on the north by Pakistan and Iran, on the west by northeastern Somalia and the Arabian Peninsula, and on the east by India.

The area which is named Gedrosia , in books about Alexander the Great and his successors , runs from the Indus River to the southern edge of the Strait of Hormuz . It is directly to the south of the countries of Bactria , Arachosia and Drangiana , to the east of the country of Carmania and due west of the Indus River which formed a natural boundary between it and Western India . The native name of Gedrosia might have been Gwadar as there are two towns by that name and a bay ( Gwadar Bay ) in central Makran . The Gedrosians are known to have successfully defeated the Indian Mauryans capturing the western-most parts of their state . Following his army 's refusal to continue marching east at the Hyphasis River in 326 BC , Alexander the Great crossed the area after sailing south to the coast of the Indian Ocean on his way back to Babylon . Upon reaching the Ocean , Alexander the Great divided his forces in half , sending half back by sea to Susa under the command of Nearchus . The other half of his army was to accompany him on a march through the Gedrosian desert , inland from the ocean . Throughout the 60 day march through the desert , Alexander lost at least 12,000 soldiers , in addition to countless livestock , camp followers , and most of his baggage train . Some historians say he lost three - quarters of his army to the harsh desert conditions along the way . However , this figure was likely based on exaggerated numbers in his forces prior to the march , which were likely in the range of no fewer than 30,000 soldiers . There are two competing theories for the purpose of Alexander the Great 's decision to march through the desert rather than along the more hospitable coast . The first argues that this was an attempt to punish his men for their refusal to continue eastward at the Hyphasis River . The other argues that Alexander was attempting to imitate and succeed in the... - Ariana, the Latinized form of the Ancient Greek \\"Ar(e)ian\\" (inhabitants: \\"\\"; \\"Ar(e)ianoi\\"), was a general geographical term used by some Greek and Roman authors of the ancient period for a district of wide extent between Central Asia and the Indus River, comprehending the eastern provinces of the Achaemenid Empire that covered the whole country of modern day Afghanistan, and a few parts of Pakistan, Tajikistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. - Gwadar Bay is located in the Gulf of Oman on the maritime border of Pakistan and Iran.

It rises in the Hazarajat country north-west of Ghazni, and flows south-west falls into the Helmand below Girishk. In its lower course it is much used for irrigation, under the control of the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority, and the valley is cultivated and populous; yet the water is said to be somewhat brackish. It is doubtful whether the ancient Arachotus is to be identified with the Arghandab or with its chief confluent the Tarnak, which joins it on the left out SW of Kandahar. The Tarnak, which flows south of Kandahar, is much shorter (length about 320 km or 200 miles) and less copious. The ruins at Ulan Robat, supposed to represent the city Arachosia, are in its basin; and the lake known as Ab-i-Istada, the most probable representative of Lake Arachotus, is near the head of the Tarnak, though not communicating with it. The Tarnak is dammed for irrigation at intervals, and in the hot season almost dries up. - The Indus River, also called Darya-e-Sindh or Sindh River or Absn, is a major south-flowing river in South Asia.

Therefore, when I heard multiple recommendations about this particular spot, The Sunset Lounge, I naturally felt compelled to check it out. Allow me to paint the precise picture of how my overall experience at the Sunset Lounge turned out to be an unfortunate and regrettable adventure. Upon arriving at the entrance, I was greeted with a rather unappealing front facade that lacked the vivacity that their promotional materials generously boasted of. In spite of this, I attempted to keep an open mind. However, that willingness to see the brighter side rapidly crumbled. The moment I stepped into the place, I was assaulted by a pungent, unexpected odor that permeated the entire venue. It was quite unsettling, given that this was supposed to be a renowned establishment in the area. Coupled with this was the unsightly interior decor – tacky furniture that had seen better days and mismatched color schemes that assaulted the senses just as much as the smell that persistently lingered. The service was no more impressive than the presentation. Waitstaff appeared disorganized, overwhelmed, and seemingly disinterested in attending to customers' needs. After what seemed like an eternity before being seated, I found myself watching what could only be described as organized chaos around me. Patrons' requests fell upon deaf ears, and the few orders that were attended to were either delayed or brought to the tables with mistakes. Now, if there were some redemption to be found in the food and drink offerings, perhaps I would still have some semblance of sympathy for the establishment. Alas, what should have been a gastronomic delight on par with their overhyped reputation turned out to be yet another disappointment. The menu was limited and unimpressive, and the dishes themselves were shockingly subpar. My appetizer, a supposedly refreshing shrimp ceviche, arrived as a congealed mess with a distinct flavor of staleness. The main course, a grilled steak, was overcooked to the point of toughness and served with a visibly congealed sauce. To make matters worse, the beverages on offer were hardly any better. I had ordered a highly recommended house cocktail that, as it turns out, was nothing more than a lackluster combination of barely muddled mint, overpowering simple syrup, and questionable sources of fruit juices. As the evening rolled on, my patience wore thin, and the number of positives to draw from The Sunset Lounge rapidly dwindled to none. The noise level soared to deafening heights, making conversation increasingly difficult. The restroom facilities looked like they hadn't been cleaned in ages, and the air conditioning system seemed to have a mind of its own – oscillating between icy chills and sweltering heat with no discernible pattern. In conclusion, my experience at The Sunset Lounge was profoundly disappointing, and I would not recommend this place to friends or acquaintances. The establishment's countless shortcomings – odor, disorganization, and subpar cuisine, to name a few – made for an unpleasant experience that left me not only dissatisfied but also feeling deceived by the misleading praises. There are countless other establishments waiting to be discovered and enjoyed – The Sunset Lounge, unfortunately, doesn't make the cut."},{"instruction":"Pick from: (I) walk Lee's girlfriend inside (II) liked her (III) seduce Lee's girlfriend Q: Jesse gave Lee's girlfriend a ride home from the party because he wanted to hit on her. Given the context: Why did Jesse do this? A:","output":"Jesse's decision to give Lee's girlfriend a ride home from the party was motivated by his desire to hit on her, which could be interpreted as an attempt to seduce or flirt with her, as indicated by (III) seduce Lee's girlfriend. There are several reasons that might have led Jesse to engage in this behavior, and it is important to understand both the social context and possible psychological motivations to fully comprehend his actions. Firstly, it's possible that Jesse was attracted to Lee's girlfriend and, perhaps, did not care about the consequences that his actions could have on his relationship with Lee or the potential harm it could cause to their relationship. In this situation, Jesse could be more focused on fulfilling his own desires and needs, rather than considering the feelings and boundaries of those around him. Secondly, Jesse could be driven by a sense of competition with Lee. Social dynamics are often complex, and people may try to assert dominance, make a statement, or seek validation by pursuing someone who is already in a committed relationship. In this context, Jesse might believe that winning over, or at least flirting with, Lee's girlfriend would prove his charm and attractiveness, boosting his ego and social standing. Additionally, Jesse might be seeking excitement or thrill, as attempting to seduce someone who is in a relationship comes with its risks and challenges. This might provide an adrenaline rush or a sense of accomplishment if he is successful in his efforts. Flirting with someone \\"off-limits\\" could serve as an ego boost and increase his perceived desirability in the eyes of others. It is also important to consider the influence of alcohol or other substances that might be present at the party. These substances can influence judgment and decision-making, as well as lower inhibitions. Jesse might not have intended to engage in this behavior initially, but as the night progressed and he consumed more substances, his inhibitions could have diminished, leading him to act on his impulses. Lastly, the extent to which Jesse went to hit on Lee's girlfriend - in this case, offering her a ride home - suggests a level of premeditation. It's possible that he had been observing her at the party and planned his actions accordingly. By isolating her from the social environment, he could create a more intimate setting that would allow him to get closer to her and make advances that may not have been appropriate in a public setting. In summary, Jesse's decision to give Lee's girlfriend a ride home from the party with the intention of hitting on her was likely a result of several factors, including personal attraction, competition, thrill-seeking, substance influence, and premeditated actions. It's essential to recognize the complexity of social interactions and the multiple motives that might have driven Jesse's behavior in this particular situation."},{"instruction":"listening to musics.

His brother Shehbaz Sharif is the incumbent Chief Minister of Punjab province, while his nephew Hamza Shahbaz Sharif is a member of the National Assembly. His daughter Maryam Nawaz is currently the chairperson for the prime minister's youth initiative. Maryam is married to politician Muhammad Safdar Awan. His other daughter, Asma Nawaz, is married to Ali Dar, son of Ishaq Dar, the current finance minister of Pakistan. The personal residence of the Sharif family, Raiwind Palace, is located in Jati Umra, Raiwind, on the outskirts of Lahore. He also has a residence in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, known as the Sharif Villa, where he lived during his years in exile. His elder son, Hussain Nawaz, is a businessman based in Saudi Arabia and currently resides in the Jeddah house. His younger son, Hassan Nawaz, is also a businessman and lives in London. He went to Saint Anthony High School. He graduated from the Government College University (GCU) with an art and business degree and then received a law degree from the Law College of Punjab University in Lahore. Sharif underwent heart surgery in May 2016 in London. It was his second open-heart operation. His deteriorating health forced him to undergo an open heart surgery only three days before the presentation of the country's annual budget. Many opposition leaders and the legal fraternity, including former Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, raised questions about a possible constitutional crisis in Pakistan. Chaudhry called for electing a new interim Prime Minister to avoid the crisis. Sharif started his political career during the period of nationalization policies introduced by former Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The Sharif family were financially devastated after the family steel business was nationalised, and Sharif jumped into national politics soon afterwards. In 1976 Sharif joined the Pakistan Muslim League, a conservative front rooted in the Punjab province. He initially focused on regaining control of his steel plants from the government. In May 1980 Ghulam Jilani Khan, the recently appointed Governor of the Punjab Province and a former Director-General of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), initiated a search for new urban leaders; Sharif was one of the men he found and promoted, quickly making him Finance Minister of the Punjab. In 1981, Sharif joined the Punjab Advisory Board under General Zia-ul-Haq and principally rose to public and political prominence as a staunch proponent of the military government of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq during the 1980s. He maintained close relations with Zia-ul-Haq, who soon agreed to return the steel mill which had been lost to nationalisation by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Sharif maintained an alliance with General Rahimuddin Khan, who was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. During his political career, Sharif also had close ties with the Director-General of ISI, Lieutenant-General (retired) Hamid Gul, who played a substantial role in the formation of the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI) - a conservative political alliance that supported Sharif. Sharif invested in Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Arab countries in the Middle East to rebuild his steel empire. According to personal accounts and his time spent with Sharif, American historian Stephen Philips Cohen states in his book Idea of Pakistan: \\"Nawaz Sharif never forgave Bhutto after his steel empire was lost into the hands of Bhutto; and even after [Bhutto's] terrible end, Sharif publicly refused to forgive the soul of Bhutto or the Pakistan Peoples Party.\\" After coming to national power in 1990, Sharif attempted to reverse Bhutto's nationalisation policies, introducing an economy based on privatisation and economic liberalisation. Following the imposition and passing of the Resolution 660, Resolution 661, and the Resolution 665, Sharif sided with the United Nations on Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. A major international incident took place in the Middle East with Iraq invading the Kuwait which dismayed the world. Sharif's government criticised Iraq for invading the fellow Muslim country, which strained Pakistan's relationships with Iraq. The relationships continued to be strained as Pakistan seek to tighten its relations with Iran, and his foreign policy continued by Benazir Bhutto, Pervez Musharraf until the removal of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Sharif contended with former Chief of Army Staff General Mirza Aslam Beg over the 1991 Gulf War (See Operation Desert Storm). Under the direction of General Beg, Pakistan Armed Forces actively participated in the conflict and the Army Special Service Group and the Naval Special Service Group were rushed to Saudi Arabia to provide intense security to Saudi royal family. Sharif also contended the upcoming Chief of Army Staff General Asif Nawaz over the paramilitary operation in Sindh Province (See Operation Clean-Up). Sharif, during his first term, found it difficult working with the PPP and the Mutahidda Qaumi Movement (MQM), a potent force in Karachi. The MQM and PPP opposed Sharif widely due to his focus on beautifying Punjab and Kashmir while neglecting Sindh. The MQM, a liberal force, also opposed Sharif's conservatism. The clash between liberalism and conservatism soon erupted forces in 1992 when political tension began to arise in which both party renegading ideological war against each other. Despite MQM had formed government with Sharif, more and more problems were mounted between Sharif and the MQM in 1992. Sharif's government members passed the resolution in the Parliament, to launch the paramilitary operation to end the cold war between PML-N and MQM. During this time, the centre left Pakistan Peoples Party remained quiet and neutral while watching the impact of the cold war between liberal and conservative forces. Prime minister Sharif also contended this upcoming operation with Chief of Army Staff General Asif Navaz over the paramilitary operation in Sindh Province (See Operation Clean-Up). Launched in 1992, violence erupted in Karachi and brought an economic halt in the country that dismantled Sharif's industrialisation and investment that was being brought by Sharif. Benazir Bhutto, during the course of this episode, remained silent as she too had opposed the MQM. His operation continued by Benazir also, but due to amid pressure exerted by her brother Murtaza Bhutto, the operation came to halt. The period of 1992-1994 is considered the bloodiest years in the history of the city, with many went missing. During his second term, Altaf Hussain decided to join with Sharif and tried to reach a compromise. Soon after the 1997 parliamentary elections, MQM joined with Sharif but this alliance fall apart following the assassination of Hakim Said. Therefore, the Prime minister kicked the MQM out of the government on immediate effect and assumed the control of Karachi. MQM was forced to continued its political activities underground. This action led Sharif to claim the exclusive mandate of entire Pakistan, and for the first time in his political career, Sharif and his party had the control of Sindh, Balochistan, Northwest Frontier, Kashmir and the Punjab Provinces.

It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources.

In the second act of Tosca, according to Newman, Puccini rises to his greatest height as a master of the musical macabre. The act begins quietly, with Scarpia musing on the forthcoming downfall of Angelotti and Cavaradossi, while in the background a gavotte is played in a distant quarter of the Farnese Palace. For this music Puccini adapted a fifteen-year-old student exercise by his late brother, Michele, stating that in this way his brother could live again through him. In the dialogue with Spoletta, the \\"torture\\" motif—an \\"ideogram of suffering\\", according to Budden—is heard for the first time as a foretaste of what is to come. As Cavaradossi is brought in for interrogation, Tosca's voice is heard with the offstage chorus singing a cantata, \\"[its] suave strains contrast[ing] dramatically with the increasing tension and ever-darkening colour of the stage action\\". The cantata is most likely the Cantata a Giove, in the literature referred to as a lost work of Puccini's from 1897.Osborne describes the scenes that follow—Cavaradossi's interrogation, his torture, Scarpia's sadistic tormenting of Tosca—as Puccini's musical equivalent of grand guignol to which Cavaradossi's brief \\"Vittoria! Vittoria!\\" on the news of Napoleon's victory gives only partial relief. Scarpia's aria \\"Già, mi dicon venal\\" (\\"Yes, they say I am venal\\") is closely followed by Tosca's \\"Vissi d'arte\\". A lyrical andante based on Tosca's act 1 motif, this is perhaps the opera's best-known aria, yet was regarded by Puccini as a mistake; he considered eliminating it since it held up the action. Fisher calls it \\"a Job-like prayer questioning God for punishing a woman who has lived unselfishly and righteously\\". In the act's finale, Newman likens the orchestral turmoil which follows Tosca's stabbing of Scarpia to the sudden outburst after the slow movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. After Tosca's contemptuous \\"E avanti a lui tremava tutta Roma!\\" (\\"All Rome trembled before him\\"), sung on a middle C♯ monotone (sometimes spoken), the music gradually...

Nachum Dov Brayer was crowned Boyaner Rebbe on the holiday commemorating the rededication of what edifice in Jerusalem? Answer:","output":"Nachum Dov Brayer was crowned Boyaner Rebbe on the holiday commemorating the rededication of the Second Holy Temple in Jerusalem. This significant event is celebrated during the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, also known as the Festival of Lights, which takes place for eight days usually in the month of December. The historic event of the rededication of the Temple came after the Maccabees, a small group of Jewish rebels led by Judah Maccabee, managed to rise against the oppressive rule of the Seleucid Empire. According to the Talmud, when the Maccabees reclaimed the Holy Temple, they found only one container of pure olive oil for the menorah (candelabrum), which was expected to last just one day. However, miraculously, the oil lasted for eight days, giving the people enough time to replenish the supply of oil and reconnect with their faith. Hanukkah is commemorated by performing a variety of rituals and traditions such as lighting the menorah, reciting special prayers and blessings, spinning the dreidel, preparing and consuming foods fried in oil – most notably latkes (potato pancakes) and sufganiyot (jelly-filled doughnuts), and spending time with family and friends. Nachum Dov Brayer is a Hasidic rabbi who became the Boyaner Rebbe in 1984. As the leader of the Boyaner Hasidic dynasty, he is responsible for providing spiritual and communal guidance to his followers. The Boyaner Hasidic dynasty originates from the town of Boiany in Ukraine and was established by Rabbi Yitzchok Friedman in the mid-19th century, son of the first Ruzhiner Rebbe, Rabbi Yisrael Friedman. Boyaner Hasidim are known for their unique customs, emotional intensity in prayers, and strong emphasis on education and communal support. The crowning of Nachum Dov Brayer as Boyaner Rebbe on the commemorative holiday of Hanukkah highlights the significance of spiritual leaders who uphold Jewish values, maintain religious traditions, and pass them on to the next generations. Additionally, it accentuates the importance of unity, faith, and resilience in the face of adversity – key themes central to the story of the Maccabees and the rededication of the Second Holy Temple in Jerusalem."},{"instruction":"Instructions: Two analogies that relate items to whether they are trash or treasure is given in the form \\"A : B.

Our waiter was friendly enough, kind of a low talker, but otherwise the service was fine. We had the buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes for an appetizer. It was good, though I would have real issues with a restaurant that could mess THAT up. For lunch, I ordered the Ravioli special, my husband had a chicken parmesan sub and my mom-in-law had a salad with salmon and their house dressing. My meal bordered on gross. It looked like they had taken all of the different ravioli left over from dinner the night before, put them on a plate, then smothered them in a creamy basil sauce with way too many olives and roasted red peppers, so that they were unrecognizable. There was way too much going on on that plate. I like all of the things separately, but together, none of the flavors were distinguishable when it was all together. There were heart-shaped mushroom ravioli, huge round meat-pie ravioli, smaller round cheese ravioli, and square sausage ravioli.

Although Joel, who works as a mechanic in the family garage, is wary of Lauryn's decision to enroll, he eventually gives her his blessing. When Lauryn enters the stage, however, her dance (mostly a hip hop routine) was halted by the judge, who hostilely rejects her, saying that they need to see something more \\"sensual and feminine\\". Dejected, Lauryn goes to a diner to down her sorrows, but soon finds her car towed off. Upon seeing her misfortunes, Dana (Tessa Thompson), a friendly waitress from the diner invites Lauryn to her apartment and out of the pouring rain. Dana subsequently offers Lauryn a place to stay, considering Lauryn could not go back home and face her brother. The next day, Dana brings Lauryn to a club called Ruby's (whose dances are rooted in burlesque), where she meets with Russ (Riley Smith), the slick-talking disc jockey, and Brenda (Karen LeBlanc), the club owner. Brenda hires Lauryn as a bookkeeper, in light of her skills with numbers. Lauryn watches as a dancer, Carmen (Julissa Bermudez) performs impressively on the stage.

The film's intriguing premise, backed by a phenomenal ensemble cast and Nolan's unparalleled ability to create stunning visuals, is a captivating journey into the world of shared dreams that keeps viewers absorbed from beginning to end. At the core of the film is an intriguing concept: Dom Cobb's (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) unique profession of entering and manipulating people's dreams to extract valuable information. DiCaprio delivers a powerhouse performance as Cobb, a skilled dream infiltrator whose past memories haunt him, and whose quest for redemption drives him further into the business of corporate espionage. As Cobb assembles a team featuring Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Ariadne (Ellen Page), Eames (Tom Hardy), and Saito (Ken Watanabe) to carry out the impossible task of inception - planting an idea into someone's subconscious - the lines between dreams and reality blur, and the stakes become personal. Nolan excels at creating a complex, layered narrative that forces viewers to question their perceptions and unravel the intricacies of the story as it progresses. The film's unique structure, in which dreams are embedded within dreams, each operating on its distinct timeline and level of consciousness, requires attention and engagement, but provides rewarding pay-offs. Masterfully, the film examines themes of grief, guilt, and the human subconscious, making thought-provoking observations about the fragile nature of reality and the human tendency to manipulate it. Visually, \\"Inception\\" is a feast for the eyes. From the mind-bending cityscapes folding over themselves to the explosive zero-gravity combat scenes, each special effect is executed with precision and imagination. The film's brilliant visual language keeps viewers enthralled, while Hans Zimmer's haunting score provides the perfect backdrop to the unfolding events. Each of the supporting cast members delivers striking performances that bring life to their roles - from Page's inquisitive Ariadne, who becomes the emotional anchor for Cobb, to Hardy's scene-stealing Eames, whose wit and humor provide levity in an otherwise intense film. Watanabe, Murphy, Cotillard, and Caine all provide depth and complexity to the film, elevating the story beyond a simple thriller. If there is any criticism to be made about \\"Inception,\\" it could be that Nolan's ambition sometimes overwhelms the viewers with its complexity, making it difficult for some to follow and digest the layered plot. Yet, the film's challenging nature is also what sets it apart from the typical Hollywood fare. It not only entertains but invites viewers to think and question the very foundations of their own perceptions. In conclusion, \\"Inception\\" is a cinematic masterpiece, boasting an intriguing premise, strong ensemble cast, and enthralling visuals. It is a testament to Nolan's creative genius as a filmmaker and an extraordinary experience that should be enjoyed, discussed, and pondered upon for years to come."},{"instruction":"How does the sentence end? Jessica is able to get a lot more things done in the day than Christine because","output":"Jessica is able to get a lot more things done in the day than Christine because she effectively manages her time, prioritizes her tasks, and maintains a well-balanced work-life equilibrium. Through rigorous planning and goal setting, she can efficiently coordinate her activities and stay organized, while Christine struggles to maintain the same level of productivity. To begin with, Jessica takes advantage of various time management techniques and tools to enhance her efficiency. For instance, she uses a weekly planner to map out her tasks and set deadlines. This way, she knows what she needs to accomplish each day and can hold herself accountable for meeting these objectives. Furthermore, by adopting the Pomodoro Technique, she breaks her work into short, manageable intervals of focused effort followed by brief breaks. This approach prevents her from becoming mentally exhausted, allowing her to maintain concentration and motivation throughout the day. In addition to her time management strategies, Jessica also prioritizes her responsibilities according to their importance and urgency. She abides by the Eisenhower Matrix, which divides tasks into four categories: urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and neither urgent nor important. By sorting her tasks in this manner, she can tackle them effectively, ensuring that nothing critical falls by the wayside. This in turn enables her to achieve more within the same timeframe as Christine. Moreover, Jessica remains disciplined and avoids distractions. In the age of social media and endless notifications, it is easy for people to become sidetracked and lose valuable time, but Jessica takes preventive measures. By silencing her devices, creating a dedicated workspace, and allocating specific time periods for leisure and socializing, she ensures that she remains focused on the task at hand. Another factor that contributes to Jessica's superior productivity is her ability to delegate tasks. Recognizing that she cannot handle everything on her own, she effectively communicates with her colleagues and distributes responsibilities according to individual strengths. This strategy not only lightens her workload but also promotes teamwork and a sense of camaraderie within her circle. Finally, Jessica places strong emphasis on work-life balance. She understands the importance of nurturing her physical, emotional, and mental well-being. By giving equal importance to her personal life, she functions optimally in her work life. This includes following a regular exercise routine, cultivating hobbies, spending quality time with loved ones, and getting adequate rest. Maintaining such balance keeps her refreshed, motivated, and less prone to burnout, allowing her to tackle each day with renewed energy and enthusiasm. In conclusion, Jessica is able to achieve more than Christine in a day due to her effective time management skills, astute task prioritization, disciplined work habits, ability to delegate, and a healthy work-life balance. By consistently adhering to these principles, she avoids overextension and burnout, allowing her to accomplish much more than her counterpart within the same 24-hour timeframe."},{"instruction":"News article: Stolen cell phone racks up 500,000 bill in 24-hours updated 1:52 PM EDT, Wed September 17, 2014 A stolen phone was used to rack up more than 500,000 charges with calls to Somalia. (CNN) -- Think your vacation cell phone bill is high? Then spare a thought for the Australian hit with more than 500,000 in charges for calls made when his device was stolen in Europe. The whopping figure came to light in a recent report by Australia's telecoms ombudsman, who received a complaint about the bill after the customer's phone provider insisted he pay it -- even though he'd reported the theft. Astonishingly, the calls -- including several to Somalia -- were made within a single 24-hour period, a fact that'll do little to reduce concerns about the high cost of roaming charges both in Australia and the rest of the world. The complaint about the bill was made by a man identified as \\"David\\" whose son had his phone stolen during a trip to Europe. \\"He reported the theft to local police and to his provider in Australia, but because of the time difference between the continents, the provider recorded the theft as having happened a day later than it occurred,\\" the ombudsman said in a report. \\"Back in Australia, his son's bill came to more than AUS570,000 (517,000) and listed calls to Somalia.\\" MORE: Do we need phones on planes? The story has a relatively happy ending: after the ombudsman stepped in, the phone provider eventually agreed to waive its demands. For many of us though, roaming costs remain a major pitfall of travel in an age when we're all carrying data-enabled device that, unless disabled, will rack up huge charges for overseas internet and email access. A 2011 report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) identified Australia as one of the most expensive countries for data roaming charges. Of the 34 nations surveyed, Australia was the seventh most costly country of origin for average roaming charges, behind Poland, Japan, Israel, Chile, Mexico, the United States and Canada. Greece and Iceland were the cheapest. Mounting anger over the high cost of phone use abroad has led to efforts to rein in phone companies. In Europe, the European Union has placed a cap on roaming charges for customers traveling within the trading bloc. The European Parliament this year voted to scrap them altogether, pending approval from individual EU governments. ETNO, the European telecoms industry body, has complained it needs roaming revenues to maintain investment in mobile networks. Either way, it's clearly a talking point -- just as long as you're not talking on a long-distance line.

Possible answers: So people would know about the event, So people would go to the flyers, make new ones","output":"Based on the context, Remy posted flyers to advertise the event they were going to put on, primarily to inform people about the event and generate interest. There are several reasons why Remy might have chosen to do this, which are outlined below. 1. Raise Awareness: By posting flyers in various strategic locations, Remy aimed to capture the attention of their target audience and spread the word about their upcoming event. The more people who are aware of the event, the more attendees it is likely to attract. This tactic is particularly beneficial for a new event, which may not have a strong online presence or a recognizable brand. 2. Offer Accessible Information: With a flyer, potential attendees can easily find all the essential information about the event in one place, such as the date, time, venue, admission price, and any special attractions or performances. A well-designed flyer will not only be visually appealing but also provide a clear and concise overview of the event. 3. Generate Excitement: A well-executed flyer can help create a buzz around an event, particularly when appealing graphics and catchy slogans are employed. This excitement can be contagious, encouraging people to spread the word and convince others to attend too. In this way, the humble flyer can have a viral effect on potential attendees. 4. Increase Attendance: By distributing flyers throughout the local area, Remy hoped to reach a wide audience and entice them to attend the event. With a higher turnout, the event is more likely to be memorable and engaging for everyone involved. 5. Showcase Creativity: The process of designing, printing, and distributing flyers allows event organizers like Remy to express their creativity and set the tone for the upcoming event. A visually appealing flyer can help build anticipation for the event and create an image in people's minds of what they can expect on the day. 6. Create a Tangible Reminder: Unlike digital advertisements, which can be easily scrolled past and forgotten, physical flyers can be picked up and taken home by potential attendees. This means that the flyer will serve as a tangible reminder for the individual about the event, making it more likely that they will attend. To summarize, Remy posted flyers for their event to raise awareness, provide accessible information, generate excitement, increase attendance, showcase their creativity, and create a tangible reminder for their potential attendees. While digital marketing methods are becoming more popular, the traditional flyer remains a powerful tool for promoting events and attracting a large audience of engaged attendees."},{"instruction":"Choose the next sentence.Los Angeles (CNN) -- A homeless man included in a mock video produced by a friend of Justin Timberlake's for the actor-singer's wedding celebration wants Timberlake to visit him on Skid Row.

Social networking websites have been awash with comments praising one-eyed Cregan since his arrest – as well as messages attacking the two murdered policewomen. Trolls on Facebook called him ‘Sir Dale’. Last night, the website’s administrators were criticised for failing to remove the offensive content fast enough. A webpage describing murder suspect Dale Cregan as 'the greatest legend since Raoul Moat' has been put up on Facebook. Several ‘tribute’ sites were deleted. on Tuesday night but were created again yesterday morning and were live. for more than five hours. Numerous people said they had reported. the content to both Facebook and Greater Manchester Police. Julie Reid,. councillor for Gorton South in Manchester, wrote on Twitter:. ‘Absolutely disgusting Facebook page Dale Cregan Legend needs to be. taken down. Some appalling comments’. On the page entitled ‘Dale Cregan Legend’, someone wrote that Cregan was ‘the greatest legend’. The pages appeared to be set up anonymously, although some of those commenting appeared to be using their own names. Victims: PC Nicola Hughes, 23, (left) and PC Fiona Bone, 32, (right) were killed after being attacked by gunfire and a grenade while. attending a report of a burglary in the Hattersley area of Greater Manchester. On a page entitled ‘Sir Dale Cregan Is A Hero and a Legend’, Lee McDonald wrote: ‘Haha beauty. And he only had the one eye.’ The trolls also took to Twitter, with a. man named Ricky from Dublin writing: ‘Dale Cregan Wat A Hero. #F**kThePolice’. Tony Snow from Nottingham also tweeted ‘Dale Cregan u. legend’. The abuse started on Tuesday when. messages on Facebook referred to Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes as. ‘scumbags’. The creator of one of the pages wrote ‘So a pair of coppers. got killed who gives a ****?’ The flurry of abusive messages is called ‘trolling’, where internet users aim vile abuse at certain targets, often celebrities.

So, the equation becomes: -39m - 429 = 0 Step 2: Add 429 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with m: -39m = 429 Step 3: Now, divide both sides of the equation by -39 to solve for m: m = 429 / -39 Step 4: Divide 429 by -39: m = -11 So, the solution for the given equation 97m - 136m - 429 = 0 is m = -11."},{"instruction":"Premise: I will only write another novel if I have another novel to write.

Peterson has been mostly out of sight since a Montgomery County, Texas, grand jury indicted him in September on a single felony charge of injury to a child. He entered the no contest plea to a misdemeanor count of recklessly injuring his 4-year-old son last May while the Minnesota boy was visiting him at his home in a northern Houston suburb. The 29-year-old running back smiled briefly as he stepped onto the courthouse steps after his plea in front of Judge Kelly Case, then turned somber. At the media microphones, he said, “I love my son more than any of you can imagine.” His plea didn’t instantaneously resolve his status with the NFL and the Vikings. Through spokesman Brian McCarthy, the league issued a statement saying it is reviewing the court record, but had no timetable for determining Peterson’s playing future. Vikings General Manager Rick Spielman said he would talk about Peterson when “it’s appropriate to speak.” Neither Peterson nor his attorney Rusty Hardin answered questions, but Peterson signed a few autographs for well-wishers as he made his way through the throng to a black Cadillac Escalade awaiting him and his small entourage of family members. Peterson has maintained that he was disciplining his son in the same physical manner he was raised, not criminally harming the child. As a condition of his plea, Peterson will pay a 4,000 fine. He must perform 80 hours of community service, half of which will be in the form of a public service announcement. He is expected to take parenting classes. He also remains under court supervision for two years, meaning he has to meet monthly with a probation officer and face random drug tests. Before an earlier drug test, Peterson admitted to having smoked a little marijuana. District Attorney Brett Ligon said that issue “goes away” with Peterson’s plea. The running back also is free to travel to Minnesota. If, however, Peterson is arrested in the coming two years, Ligon said the plea deal will be revoked and he will be prosecuted on the felony charge. Peterson “has a long way to go,” Ligon said. Hardin: ‘A very good man’ The plea went down calmly and quietly in front of Case, taking less than 10 minutes. Spectators jammed into the back of the long courtroom couldn’t hear most of what was said up at the bench by the lawyers, the judge and Peterson. The running back spoke softly, his arms at his sides. In his remarks afterward on the courthouse steps, Ligon brought up the mother of Peterson’s child, saying she is “doing an excellent job” of raising the boy as a single parent, that she approves of the plea deal and that she wants her son to resume contact with his father. For Ligon, the case wasn’t about sending Peterson to jail, but making him a better parent. Ligon said he hopes Peterson will do better, that he “never ducked what the incident was” and had taken responsibility. Hardin called his client a “very good man” and a “very good father” who “wants to prove it” to society. “Adrian wants to get on with his life and his relationship with his son,” Hardin said. A tough case for fans, too The ugly charge against Peterson proved a difficult one to confront for Minnesota fans accustomed to the running back’s spectacular talent on the field and fan-friendly, upbeat public persona off it. His comeback a couple of years ago from major knee surgery enhanced his stratospheric reputation for physical ability and resilience. ||||| CONROE, Texas (AP) — Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson avoided jail time on Tuesday in a plea agreement reached with prosecutors to resolve his child abuse case.

A judge presiding over Adrian... (Associated Press) Peterson was indicted in September on a felony charge of injury to a child for using a wooden switch to discipline his 4-year-old son earlier this year in suburban Houston. The All-Pro running back says he never intended to harm his son and was disciplining him in the same way he had been as a child growing up in East Texas. The boy suffered cuts, marks and bruising to his thighs, back and on one of his testicles, according to court records. The case revived a debate about corporal punishment, which is on the decline in the U.S. but still widely practiced in homes and schools. Under the agreement approved by Montgomery County state District Judge Kelly Case and announced during a scheduled court hearing, Peterson pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of reckless assault. If convicted of felony child abuse, he could have faced up to two years in prison and a 10,000 fine. A tentative trial date of Dec. 1 had been set in Peterson's case. Peterson has been on paid leave from the Vikings under a special exemption from the NFL commissioner to take care of his legal problems. It was not immediately clear how the plea deal would affect his playing status. Last month, a visiting judge denied a request by prosecutors to remove Case as judge in the case. Prosecutors had accused Case of being biased against them and wanted a new judge appointed. The plea deal made moot a pending motion by prosecutors to revoke Peterson's 15,000 bond for alleged marijuana use. Corporal punishment is legal in every state. The Texas Attorney General's Office notes that belts and brushes \\"are accepted by many as legitimate disciplinary 'tools,'\\" but \\"electrical or phone cords, boards, yardsticks, ropes, shoes, and wires are likely to be considered instruments of abuse.\\" Texas law says the use of non-deadly force against someone younger than 18 is justified if a parent or guardian \\"reasonably believes the force is necessary to discipline the child or to safeguard or promote his welfare.\\" ___ Follow Juan A.

Hirsi Ali arrived in the Netherlands in 1992. That year she had travelled from Kenya to visit her family in Dusseldorf and Bonn, Germany and gone to the Netherlands to escape an alleged arranged marriage. Once there, she requested political asylum and obtained a residence permit. She used her paternal grandfather's early surname on her application and has since been known in the West as Ayaan Hirsi Ali. She received a residence permit within three or four weeks of arriving in the Netherlands. At first she held various short-term jobs, ranging from cleaning to sorting post. She worked as a translator at a Rotterdam refugee center which, according to a friend interviewed in 2006 by The Observer newspaper, marked her deeply. As an avid reader, in the Netherlands she found new books and ways of thought that both stretched her imagination and frightened her. Sigmund Freud's work introduced her to an alternative moral system that was not based on religion. During this time she took courses in Dutch and a one-year introductory course in social work at the De Horst Institute for Social Work in Driebergen. She has said that she was impressed with how well Dutch society seemed to function. To better understand its development, she studied at Leiden University, obtaining an MSc degree in political science in 2000. Between 1995 and 2001, Hirsi Ali also worked as an independent Somali-Dutch interpreter and translator, frequently working with Somali women in asylum centers, hostels for abused women, and at the Dutch immigration and naturalization service (IND, Immigratie en Naturalisatiedienst). While working for the IND, she became critical of the way it handled asylum seekers.

For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\" Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.

The Canadian team went north of the Polar Circle, close to the North Pole to do the same thing. They spent several months there. The Canadian team didn't find any ozone holes at the North Pole. But I can use this background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. What is an answer for this question: Which team was more exposed to skin cancers? The answer is:","output":"The Russian research team was more exposed to skin cancers, as they spent most of their time in Antarctica studying the loss of ozone in the atmosphere. The presence of the ozone hole over Antarctica, as mentioned in the background, has led to increased levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the Earth's surface in that region. This elevated UV radiation is known to be a major cause of skin cancers. The Canadian team, while also studying ozone depletion, did not find any ozone holes at the North Pole. This suggests that the ozone layer in the Arctic region was relatively more intact as compared to the ozone layer over Antarctica. Consequently, the Canadian team was exposed to lower levels of UV radiation, and thus, they were at a reduced risk of developing skin cancers as compared to the Russian research team. It is important to note that both teams were working in extreme polar environments, with prolonged exposure to harsh conditions, putting them at risk for other health issues. However, when specifically considering the risk of skin cancers due to ozone depletion, the Russian research team in Antarctica faced a higher threat due to the presence of the ozone hole in that region. Governments and international organizations have been implementing policies and regulations to reduce the emission of substances, such as chlorine and bromine, known to deplete the ozone layer. Although the rate of loss has slowed with these restrictions, the ozone layer remains at risk, highlighting the need for continued efforts to protect it in order to reduce the potential health hazards, such as skin cancers, for individuals in affected regions like Antarctica."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

English phrase: To raise the flukes of an anchor upon the gunwale. Xhosa translation: Ukuphakamisa izinqola zomronco obhekeni. Translation justification: - \\"To raise\\" = \\"Ukuphakamisa\\": This is a direct translation as \\"Ukuphakamisa\\" in Xhosa means to \\"raise\\" or \\"lift\\" something. - \\"the flukes of an anchor\\": In English, \\"flukes\\" refer to the triangular-shaped ends of an anchor. The direct translation for \\"anchor\\" in Xhosa is \\"umronco.\\" Therefore, \\"izinqola zomronco\\" refers to \\"the flukes of an anchor.\\" - \\"upon the gunwale\\" = \\"obhekeni\\": In Xhosa, \\"obhekeni\\" refers to the top edge of a boat, which is equivalent to \\"gunwale\\" in English. 2.

Specter was long a voice of Republican moderation, but he handed Democrats a supermajority in the Senate by switching parties in 2009. He lost the Democratic primary the next year in an anti-incumbency movement that swept many veteran politicians from office. He had also exposed himself to charges of political opportunism by changing his party allegiance. As a young Philadelphia prosecutor, he first gained national attention as assistant counsel to the Warren Commission, which investigated the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He was the chief architect of the commission’s controversial “single-bullet theory,” which held that the same bullet that killed Kennedy also wounded then-Texas Gov. John Connally. Sen. Specter parlayed the exposure he received on the commission into a political career, first as a combative and outspoken Philadelphia district attorney and then as a five-term U.S. senator. “Arlen Specter was always a fighter,” President Obama said in a statement Sunday. “From his days stamping out corruption as a prosecutor in Philadelphia to his three decades of service in the Senate, Arlen was fiercely independent — never putting party or ideology ahead of the people he was chosen to serve.” Arriving on Capitol Hill in 1981, Sen. Specter became a dominant force during the Judiciary Committee’s rancorous Supreme Court nomination battles. More than anyone else, he helped defeat conservative nominee Robert Bork in 1987, and his aggressive questioning of law professor Anita Hill four years later — he accused her of “flat-out perjury” — helped secure Clarence Thomas’s confirmation. Sen. Specter was respected for his well-prepared and persuasive arguments that were rooted in the law rather than in political expediency. He sided with liberals on some divisive issues and with conservatives on others, leaving him with little support on either end of the spectrum. He consistently drew challenges from the left and the right in his centrist state, and his career was marked by narrow victories. “I had a rocky road getting here,” he once said, “and I’m going to do my damnedest to stay here.” In 2009, Sen. Specter was one of three Republicans who negotiated with Senate Democrats over President Obama’s economic stimulus bill, but his vote for the 787 billion measure left him politically vulnerable among Pennsylvania’s unpredictable electorate. “I believe that my duty is to follow my conscience and vote what I think is in the best interest of the country, and the political risks will have to abide,” Sen. Specter said at the time. Acknowledging that he could not win his 2010 reelection battle against Republican primary challenger Patrick J. Toomey, the former head of the conservative Club for Growth, Sen. Specter switched parties. He became the 60th Democratic senator, giving Obama’s party a filibuster-proof majority. But he immediately drew a primary challenge from Rep. Joe Sestak, whose run from the left forced Sen. Specter to assert liberal positions on issues such as health-care reform. Summary:","output":"Arlen Specter, Pennsylvania's longest-serving senator, has passed away. Known for his role as assistant counsel to the Warren Commission investigating President John F. Kennedy's assassination, Specter was a key proponent of the \\"single-bullet theory.\\" Throughout his political career, he was recognized for his independent views, often siding with both liberals and conservatives on various issues. However, he drew criticism after switching parties in 2009 and handing Democrats a supermajority in the Senate.

If a new BabyCenter poll is any guide, _ .A surprisingly large number of parents still insist that their children practice such old-fashioned manners as putting pen-to-paper to say thank you,treating adults with respect and addressing adults as \\"Mr., Mrs.or Miss.\\"A majority of the 1,000 parents surveyed also said they insist at dinner that children keep napkins in their laps,ask to be excused from the table and refrain from talking with a full mouth. Among the reasons cited most often by parents,BabyCenter says,is that \\"the world is a more free-wheeling place,and they want to give their kids a stronger moral compass to guide them.\\"This thinking was affirmed by 64%of those surveyed.And 58%say they see so many badly behaved kids around them that they're determined to raise their children differently. This poses a particular challenge for parents who work outside the home and must find a sitter, nanny or other child-care provider who will insist on the manners they consider most important. Pediatrician Perri Klass wrote recently in the New York Times about her annoyance at a rude,demanding child who was among her longtime patients.Although she veiled her injunctions to the mother in euphemisms ,talking to her about \\"setting limits,\\"Dr.Klass wrote,\\"I do pass judgment on kids with bad manners and so does every pediatrician I know.\\"Rude kids make her wonder whether there is something wrong with the family,among other things,she says.\\"The whole 'manners' concept might seem a bit odd,\\"she says,\\"until you recast it as 'social skills' a hot-button child-development issue,as I wrote in a recent column.\\" Readers,what manners do you insist upon for your children? Has other kids' bad behavior led you to toughen your standards? Do the... Question: are the right persons to attend to the children while the parents work outside. Yes or no, is the answer \\"Those who focus on virtue\\"? A:","output":"In the contemporary world, there is an ongoing debate about the importance of instilling good manners and virtues, such as writing hand-written thank-you notes, in children. While some believe that these practices are old-fashioned and out of touch with the current times, others argue that they cultivate essential social skills needed for successful interpersonal interactions. According to a BabyCenter poll, a considerable number of parents are determined to enforce such manners in their children, aiming to provide them with a strong moral compass to navigate the increasingly free-wheeling world we live in. When it comes to ensuring that children are exposed to the right values while their parents work outside the home, the individuals responsible for their care, such as babysitters, nannies, or other childcare providers, need to have a clear understanding of and commitment to the morals parents deem essential. In this context, the answer to the question, \\"are the right persons to attend to the children while the parents work outside [those who focus on virtue]?\\" lies in the alignment of the caregivers' values with those of the parents. The importance of manners, or social skills, cannot be underestimated, as demonstrated in the anecdote shared by pediatrician Dr. Perri Klass. She points out that children with bad manners often receive judgment from professionals, and their behavior can even be seen as a reflection of issues within the family. By framing manners as social skills, the debate transcends old-fashioned concepts into a more relevant and pressing child-development concern. Maintaining high standards for children's behavior in response to their exposure to peers with ill-manners could contribute to a generation that values respect, empathy, and responsibility. For parents who seek to inculcate these values in their children while they work outside, the selection of caregivers that uphold them becomes crucial in reinforcing the desired virtues. To sum up, whether or not the right individuals to care for children while parents work outside are those who focus on virtue depends on the extent to which those caregivers prioritize and practice the same morals that parents consider essential. If there is alignment between the values, goals, and practices of both parents and caregivers, then the answer is \\"Yes.\\" However, it is critical to remember that open communication and a shared understanding between the parties involved leads to an environment conducive to the proper development of the child's moral compass and the desired cultivation of manners and social skills."},{"instruction":"Q:Tracy heard the dog behind Kendall and screamed very loudly too. Given the context: What will Kendall want to do next?

However, based on the information provided, we can consider several possibilities that prioritize human safety and the importance of addressing Tracy's reaction. 1. Get away from the dog: Kendall, aware of Tracy's scream, might instinctively move away from the dog, assuming that the dog poses a threat. Kendall may quickly assess the situation and decide that the best course of action is to maintain a safe distance from the dog to ensure personal safety and to alleviate Tracy's fear. Before making any further decisions, Kendall might also try to reassure Tracy and find out more about her reaction. 2. Start running: Kendall might choose to run away from the dog, especially if the dog looks or behaves in an aggressive manner. This reaction could be due to a fear of dogs or a general concern for personal safety. Furthermore, Kendall might decide to run, keeping in mind that Tracy has also screamed, indicating her distress. Running away together could help to keep both Kendall and Tracy safe from potential harm. 3. Approach the dog cautiously and assess the situation: Kendall might also opt to calmly approach the dog and assess its temperament before taking any drastic actions. This approach would require Kendall to be knowledgeable about dog behavior and feel confident in handling the situation. If the dog appears to be friendly and well-mannered, Kendall might decide to check for any form of identification, such as a collar or tag, and attempt to locate its owner. In the meantime, Kendall could reassure Tracy and alleviate her fears once they confirm that the dog poses no immediate threat. 4. Call for help or notify authorities: If Kendall feels that the situation is beyond their control or expertise, they might decide to call for help. This could involve contacting a local animal rescue organization, the dog's owner (if identifiable), or even the police. This course of action ensures that a knowledgeable and experienced party is involved to handle the situation effectively, providing safety to both Kendall and Tracy. In conclusion, Kendall's most likely next steps would be to either move away from the dog or calmly assess the situation, depending on their level of comfort and experience with dogs. The priority would be ensuring personal safety and addressing Tracy's concerns. Directly attacking the dog is not mentioned as a preferred option, as it could pose a risk to personal safety and may not be the most appropriate or effective way to handle the situation."},{"instruction":"Christian Darcy Bisson (born August 14, 1989) is a Canadian professional baseball second baseman in minor league baseball organization of the San Diego Padres of Major League Baseball.

No The provided paragraph does not give any information about the size of Target Field in comparison to other baseball parks in the U.S. While it does mention that Target Field is the home ballpark for the Minnesota Twins, hosts occasional Minnesota Golden Gophers baseball games, and other baseball events, this information is not enough to conclude that it is the largest baseball park in the country. Moreover, Target Field is not the largest baseball park in the U.S. To give some context, it is important to compare its capacity with those of other major league ballparks in the country. The seating capacity of Target Field is 38,544, while the largest MLB ballpark in the U.S. is Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California, with a seating capacity of 56,000. Other stadiums, such as Yankee Stadium in New York City (52,325), Coors Field in Denver, Colorado (50,144), and AT&T Park in San Francisco, California (41,915), also have a larger seating capacity compared to Target Field.

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: How long is the play in Edinburgh? === The answer to the above question is The answer is:","output":"The play's length in Edinburgh cannot be determined directly from the information provided. However, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival typically showcases a wide range of plays with varying durations. A commonly accepted performance length for Fringe shows is about an hour, as it allows for efficient scheduling and offers audience members the opportunity to see multiple shows in a day. It is beneficial for productions to adapt their shows to fit within this timeframe to maximize audience and venue capacity. In your case, while it is not explicitly mentioned, it is likely that the play at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival was around an hour long, to align with the general practice of the festival. It is important to note that the same play may have a different duration when it is staged in other locations, such as New York, depending on the theatre's size, resources, and audience expectations. Therefore, the play's length in Edinburgh might have differed from the time it took at other venues in New York or in the larger theatre with a different producer and casting director."},{"instruction":"Generate a negative review for a place.","output":"Title: A Disappointing Experience to Forget Date of visit: August 21, 2021 Review: I had high expectations based on the reputation and glowing reviews of The Grand Nirvana, but sadly, my experience was nothing short of disastrous. Upon arrival, the chaos was evident, as the parking lot was packed, and finding a spot took longer than desired. The exterior of the building seemed run-down, with peeling paint and dirty windows - certainly not reflective of the so-called 'grand' experience I was anticipating. Entering the building only worsened the situation, as we were met with an unpleasant odor that followed us throughout our visit. The lobby was cluttered with people waiting to be seated, creating an overwhelming atmosphere. Despite having a reservation, we still had to wait for over 30 minutes to be seated, with no apologies or compensation from the management. Once we were finally seated, the noise level in the dining area was unbearably high. Trying to have a conversation with my partner was nearly impossible, and the tables were placed so close together that I felt uncomfortable and claustrophobic. The dim lighting only added to the dreary ambiance and made it difficult to read the menu. Speaking of the menu, while it was presented with a diverse range of dishes, it was evident that the restaurant was trying to cater to every possible taste, sacrificing quality for variety. We decided upon a shrimp appetizer, a tomato basil soup, and their \\"famous\\" steak and lobster entree. The appetizers were a major disappointment; the shrimp were overcooked, and the tomato basil soup was bland and watery. Already disheartened, we remained optimistic that the entree would make up for the initial letdown. Unfortunately, our hopes were dashed when the steak and lobster arrived. The steak was cooked unevenly, with some parts tough and chewy, while others were nearly raw. The lobster was dry and rubbery - far from the succulent seafood dish I was dreaming of. It was also served with lukewarm vegetables and cold, flavorless mashed potatoes. Our waiter, who seemed just as disorganized as the establishment itself, made repeated errors throughout the night: forgotten utensils, mixed-up orders, and slow service. We had to request for water refills on multiple occasions. To make matters worse, at one point during our meal, a large bug was spotted crawling on the table next to us, prompting visible disgust from our fellow diners. Despite the unsatisfactory experience, the bill remained exorbitantly high, without any acknowledgment of the subpar food and service we received. It truly felt like a slap in the face, as we had anticipated a luxurious, fine-dining experience, but left feeling disappointed and deflated. In conclusion, The Grand Nirvana failed to meet even the most basic expectations for an enjoyable dining experience. The combination of poor service, lackluster food, and an uncomfortable atmosphere left a lasting negative impression that I won't soon forget. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this establishment to others. There are far better options in town that offer genuine hospitality and quality cuisine, without the crushing disappointment that we experienced at this overrated venue."},{"instruction":"I believe that the Commission is to give Azerbaijan the technical assistance and all kinds of help needed to accomplish this accession.

It listed not only Roof's name, but his South Carolina address, his email, and his phone. The website appears to have launched in February but surfaced on Twitter and other social media Saturday. Near the end of the 2,000-word screed, under a section titled \\"An Explanation,\\" the writer hints at why Charleston was targeted. \\"I have no choice. I am not in the position to, alone, go into the ghetto and fight. I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country. We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.\\" Investigators are poring over his communications and Internet sites Roof visited, a law enforcement official said. Roof spent a lot of time online reading racist material but nothing has emerged indicating the attack was directed by a white supremacist group, the official said. In the text, the writer described the Martin shooting as a turning point. \\"It was obvious that Zimmerman was in the right,\\" the text says, adding that the writer was transformed by the \\"pages upon pages of ... brutal black on White murders\\" chronicled online. \\"I have never been the same since that day,\\" the writer said. \\"I was in disbelief. At this moment I realized that something was very wrong. How could the news be blowing up the Trayvon Martin case while hundreds of these black on White murders got ignored?\\" In a statement, Benjamin Crump, lead attorney for Martin's family, said \\"it is not uncommon for those who commit unspeakable acts of violence to blame their heinous behavior on the actions of others.\\" \\"Regardless of how this demented, racist individual attempts to shift the focus of his murderous actions, we will remain steadfast in our defense of the voiceless around this country,\\" the statement said. \\"They need it now more than ever.\\" The website is called \\"The Last Rhodesian.\\" In an image tweeted by South Carolina authorities this week, Roof is seen wearing a jacket with the flags of apartheid-era South Africa and nearby Rhodesia, a former British colony that a white minority ruled until it became independent in 1980 and its name was changed to Zimbabwe. Images on the website include a .45-caliber Glock pistol; Roof takes aim with the gun; he poses in front of a sign that says, \\"Sacred burial site. Our African ancestors\\" as well as outside South Carolina's Museum and Library of Confederate History; he stands on and burns an American flag. A section titled \\"Patriotism\\" referred to the term itself as \\"an absolute joke\\" because there can be no patriotism \\"while White people are being murdered daily in the streets.\\" In racist rants, Hispanics are referred to as enemies, \\"Negroes\\" as violent and \\"very slick,\\" and Jews as an \\"enigma.\\" \\"Living in the South, almost every White person has a small amount of racial awareness, simply beause (sic) of the numbers of negroes in this part of the country,\\" the text says. \\"But it is a superficial awareness. Growing up, in school, the White and black kids would make racial jokes toward each other, but all they were were jokes.\\" It continues, \\"Me and White friends would sometimes ... watch things that would make us think that 'blacks were the real racists' and other elementary thoughts like this, but there was no real understanding behind it.\\" On Saturday, Roof sat in his jail cell under suicide watch after hearing words of forgiveness from some of his victims' loved ones the day before. Wearing a striped inmate jumpsuit, the 21-year-old appeared Friday afternoon by video feed at a bond hearing in Charleston, South Carolina. He stood motionless, a blank expression on his face, as he listened to the anguished words of relatives of the nine people he gunned down Wednesday night at a Bible study class at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. \\"I will never be able to hold her again, but I forgive you,\\" a daughter of victim Ethel Lance said. \\"And have mercy on your soul. You hurt me. You hurt a lot of people but God forgives you, and I forgive you.\\" Felecia Sanders -- mother of victim Tywanza Sanders and a survivor of the church shooting -- said that \\"every fiber in my body hurts, and I will never be the same.\\" \\"As we said in the Bible study, we enjoyed you,\\" she said of Roof. \\"But may God have mercy on you.\\" The families' words prompted a reaction from President Barack Obama. \\"In the midst of darkest tragedy, the decency and goodness of the American people shines through in these families,\\" Obama said on Twitter. On Saturday, Sylvia Johnson, a cousin of Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who was killed in the church, said Pinckney's wife, Jennifer, told her that she left the Bible study meeting minutes before shots rang out. Jennifer Pinckney said she hid with her young daughter under a desk in an office and called 911, according to Johnson. While the nation rallies behind Charleston, an insight into Roof's state of mind came Saturday from Charleston County Sheriff's Office spokesman Maj. Eric Watson. Roof, he said, \\"is in protective custody. He is currently sitting on his bed being monitored by two detention officers. He is on suicide watch.\\" The Emanuel AME Church is no longer a crime scene, according to Charleston Police Lt. Peter Farrell. Services will resume Sunday, according to Joe Campbell, a member of the church council. Roof's relatives spoke out for the first time in a statement Friday, extending their \\"deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims.\\" \\"Words cannot express our shock, grief and disbelief as to what happened that night. We are devastated and saddened by what occurred. We offer our prayers sympathy for all of those impacted by these events,\\" the statement says. It asks for privacy for the Roof family. Roof barely spoke at the hearing, answering the judge's questions about his unemployment with a \\"yes, sir\\" and \\"no, sir.\\" In the video feed, Roof could hear, but not see, people in the courtroom. People in the courtroom could see and hear Roof. Inside the massacre: A mom 'laid in her son's blood' Magistrate James B. Gosnell Jr. set bail at 1 million on a weapons possession charge. A circuit judge will hold a bond hearing later on the nine murder charges, but it's unlikely Roof will be allowed to leave jail. The suspect is being held in the North Charleston jail. Authorities didn't want him to appear at the bond hearing in person for security reasons. Roof may be prosecuted by federal authorities if it's determined he committed a hate crime. The Justice Department said \\"it is looking at this crime from all angles, including as a hate crime and as an act of domestic terrorism.\\" Roof admits he shot and killed the people he'd sat with for Bible study at the historically black church, two law enforcement officials said. He told investigators he did it to start a race war, according to one of the officials. A friend recalled a drunken Roof ranting one night about his unspecified six-month plan \\"to do something crazy\\" in order \\"to start a race war.\\" And the Berkeley County, South Carolina, government tweeted a picture of Roof in a jacket with flags from apartheid-era South Africa and nearby Rhodesia, a former British colony that was ruled by a white minority until it became independent in 1980 and is now known as Zimbabwe. By telling authorities his aim, Roof admitted he attacked unarmed civilians for political purposes in an act of terror. He faces a long legal road ahead, one that could end in his execution if prosecutors seek a death sentence, according to South Carolina law. Gov. Nikki Haley has indicated that's what she wants. Sadness, shock, rage and resilience CNN's Andy Rose, Ed Payne, Brian Todd, Betsy Klein, Carma Hassan, Dugald McConnell, and Paul Murphy contributed to this report.

Active listening is a style of listening in which the listener demonstrates their attentiveness to the speaker. There are many ways you can show attentiveness without speaking. Maintaining eye contact is a common way of showing that you are listening. Nodding, smiling, and exhibiting a relaxed posture also suggest that you are listening attentively. Active listeners often use short phrases to show that they understand and are paying attention. Even if you aren't actually interested in the topic, these cues show you are listening politely. Common phrases of encouragement include \\"Mmm hmm,\\" \\"I see,\\" \\"Right,\\" and \\"Uh-huh.\\" You can show someone you understand and are listening by repeating back to him or her what's been said, or paraphrasing what he or she has just told you. If you don't actually understand what you've just been told, you can also ask for clarification. This also sends the message that you are listening. When the opportunity presents itself, you will probably wish to either end the conversation or change the subject if you aren't actually interested in the topic. Offer a reason for ending the conversation, such as a task you need to resume or a person you need to find If this is your first time talking to someone, you can also end a conversation with \\"It was nice meeting you.\\" You can also tell the person that you really want to hear more about the topic of conversation and you'll call them tomorrow.
