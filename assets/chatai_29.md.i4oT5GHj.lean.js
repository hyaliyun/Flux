Given the question: Question: What does an animal do when it becomes old? Options: - live long - leave home - feel pain - eating - sense fear in human  Explain why a human would choose \\"feel pain\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","output":"A human might choose \\"feel pain\\" as the answer to the question of what an animal does when it becomes old due to several reasons: Step 1: Analyzing the question First, the human would understand the context of the question, which is focusing on the behavior or condition of animals as they age. Step 2: Evaluating the alternatives The human would then examine the given options: - Live long: This option doesn't accurately describe the condition or behavior of an old animal, since living long is relative and might not be applicable to all animals. - Leave home: This choice does not accurately represent a general behavior for all animals when they grow old. - Feel pain: This option refers to the potential physical discomfort or health issues that animals might experience as they age. - Eating: This alternative doesn't describe a specific behavior that only applies to old animals, as animals need to eat throughout their entire lives. - Sense fear in human: This choice is not related to animals becoming old and is not a characteristic of animals aging. Step 3: Choosing the most appropriate option The human would most likely select \\"feel pain\\" as the best answer to the question because it addresses a common aspect of the aging process for both animals and humans. As animals grow older, their bodies may undergo wear and tear, leading to health issues and physical discomfort. This choice captures the reality that aging often brings about some level of pain or discomfort, making it a reasonable assumption that this is what animals experience when they become old."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: HANGZHOU, China -- Millions of Chinese basketball fans who were upset about the retirement of Yao Ming, are excited to see another even more shining star, Jeremy Lin, rising from the N.B.A and becoming a household name all across China. \\"We are amazed by Lin Shuhao's magic performance and should cheer him on,\\" one Internet user wrote. \\"His sport shirts have sold out, even including the counterfeit  ones,\\" said Zheng Xiaojun, a 24-year-old clerk.  Lin's amazing success over the last month has caught the imagination of the Chinese. He has been particularly popular here in northern Zhejiang province, from which his grandmother went to Taiwan in the late 1940s.  Cai Qi, a well-known micro blogger, posted a message on micro blog over the weekend stating that Lin's hometown is Jiaxing, a city near Hangzhou where Lin's grandmother grew up.  Cai Qi's nephew Yu Guohua, a 56-year-old factory worker, is Lin's closest   still living in northern Zhejiang. He said in a telephone interview that Lin had come to play basketball with the Jiaxing High School team last May and had been surrounded by admirers.  Yu said he did not have a chance to meet Lin in the crowd, but managed to speak with his family. \\"His father was very supportive of Lin's playing basketball, but his grandmother was not, for fear he would be injured,\\" Yu said.  Lin may owe his height, 6 feet 3 inches, to his grandmother's family, Yu said. Chen Weiji, the father of Lin's grandmother, was well over 6 feet and all of Chen's children were tall as well, he said.  The N.B.A. believes that 300 million people in China play basketball. The retirement last year of Yao Ming took its main Asian draw away from the N.B.A. But Lin's appearance has helped the league remain a hot topic of Chinese online chatter.

A survey shows that the tigers are in more danger of dying out than China's most famous animal,the giant panda.Forty years ago,about 4,000 South China tigers lived in the wild.Today there are only about 30.An additional 64 live in 19 zoos in China,,which are all descendants of six wild animals seized in 1956. The cubs were born in zoos in China and removed from their mothers when they were three months old.Their first home in South Africa was a one-acre camp where they stayed for a month.Their next home was a ten acre area,where they lived for three months to help them gradually get used to life outside a cage. When the cubs first arrived in South Africa,they didn't even want to leave their cages.It took weeks to get them to eat chicken,used as they were to being fed beef at the Zoo in China where they were born.It took months of practice to hunt a live animal and then make the link between the kill and food.Now just a few months on,and living in a 150-acre camp,they have become remarkably skilled hunters. All four animals will finally return to Zoos in China while the pioneering pairs' cubs will grow up completely wild.The aim is for _ to go to reserves developed in China by 2008,when the Olympic Games will be held in Beijing.

Which language is this?","output":"This sentence is in Czech, a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic. Czech is closely related to other Slavic languages, particularly Slovak and somewhat to Polish. The sentence \\"Dělali jste si s ním, co jste chtěli\\" can be translated to \\"You did with him whatever you wanted\\" in English. The Czech language uses the Roman alphabet and features diacritical marks, such as the háček and the acute, which help indicate pronunciation and distinguish between different sounds. The language's grammar is highly inflected, employing a case system which marks nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and numerals. This system helps convey meaning based on the word's form rather than its position in a sentence, making word order in Czech more flexible than in English. Czech is mutually intelligible with the Slovak language, and speakers of both languages can often understand each other without many difficulties. Czech and Slovak diverged primarily because of political history and geographic separation. While both languages share many similarities, they exhibit differences in phonetics, morphology, and vocabulary. Czech has a long literary tradition, dating back to the early Middle Ages. Some significant Czech literary figures include Jan Hus, an early church reformer and precursor to Martin Luther; Božena Němcová, a 19th-century writer celebrated for her collections of fairy tales and novels; and Jaroslav Seifert, a 20th-century poet and the first Czech to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Czech literature has played a vital role in the development of the Czech national identity and the preservation of the Czech language throughout various historical periods, including times of foreign rule and political unrest. Today, the Czech language continues to thrive and holds great importance in education, media, and official communication in the Czech Republic. Learning Czech as a foreign language can be challenging due to its complex grammar and pronunciation rules, but it can provide access to the rich cultural heritage of the Czech nation and allow for more meaningful ties with the Czech people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve 0 = 2*t - 6 + 14 for t.","output":"To solve the equation 0 = 2*t - 6 + 14 for t, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the constants. The equation is currently 0 = 2*t - 6 + 14. We can simplify it by adding the constants (-6 and +14) together. -6 + 14 = 8 Step 2: Rewrite the equation with the simplified constants. Now that we've simplified the constants, we can rewrite the equation: 0 = 2*t + 8 Step 3: Isolate the variable. To isolate t, we need to get it alone on one side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 8 = 2*t + 8 - 8 -8 = 2*t Step 4: Solve for the variable. Now that we have isolated t, we can solve for its value. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 2: -8 / 2 = 2*t / 2 -4 = t Step 5: Write the final answer.

Article: How to deal successfully with a child who shows outstanding musical ability?It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage his gift.Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their children's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative  behaviour.And while most schools are equipped to deal with children who are specially able in academic subjects,the musically gifted require special understanding which may not always be available in an ordinary school--especially one where music is regarded as a secondary activity.Such children may well benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. The five music schools in Britain are a relatively recent introduction.They aim to provide an environment in which gifted children aged between seven and eighteen can develop their skills to the full under the guidance of professional musicians. Children at specialist music schools spend between one third and one half of an average day on musical activities,for example,individual lessons,orchestras,chamber  groups,voice training,conducting and theory.They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms,sometimes with a teacher.The rest of their time is taken up with the subjects:English,maths,basic sciences and languages.All five British specialist schools are independent,classes are small by normal school standards,with a high teacher/pupil ratio .Most children attending specialist schools tend to be boarders,leaving home to live,eat and sleep fulltime at school. What are the disadvantages?An obvious problem is the cost;the fees are high(PS12,000PS17,000 a year for boarders).However,each school will make every effort with scholarships and other forms of financial assistance,to help parents of outstandingly gifted children to find the necessary fees.Secondly,not all parents want to send their children to boarding school,especially at a very early age.Almost all the directors of the specialist schools express doubts about the wisdom of admitting...

Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I replaced a Monster cable power surge protector with this Tripp Lite unit. It has a higher joule rating capacity and plenty of indicator lights so you really know what's going on with the power and watt usage. Best of all it is much cheaper than Monster. I use Tripp Lite surge protectors exclusively - I live in an area of frequent power surges and lightning strikes. I have had Tripp Lite protectors burn out, but never had any equipment fried. For example, the last surge that came through the neighborhood was caused by a telephone pole being hit by a truck. When that happened, a 19,200 volt line hit the 2400 volt line that supplies our homes. I lost six surge protectors but no equipment. And best of all, Tripp Lite is excellent on replacing their units promptly, they all are lifetime guaranteed. Buy their products with confidence. Answer: Options are: A). No B).

First, let's understand what that math problem is asking. It wants us to find out what number we can put in place of the ‘v’ to make it true. Now let’s solve it step-by-step.  The equation is 0 = -47*v + 30*v + 136.  Let's first add the terms that involve 'v'. That’s -47*v and 30*v. When we add -47 and 30, we get -17. So, our expression becomes 0 = -17*v + 136.  Now we want to get 'v' on one side of the equation by itself. So let's subtract 136 from both sides. This gives us -136 = -17*v. Finally, we want to get 'v' all by itself, and we do that by dividing everything by -17. So, divide -136 by -17, and we get 8. So, the answer is v = 8. That means that if we put 8 in place of ‘v’ in our original problem, both sides of the '=' sign will have the same value."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Norman Clifford Louis O'Neill OAM (19 February 1937 - 3 March 2008) was a cricketer who played for New South Wales and Australia. A right-handed batsman known for his back foot strokeplay, O'Neill made his state debut aged 18, before progressing to Test selection aged 21 in late 1958. Early in his career, O'Neill was one of the foremost batsmen in the Australian team, scoring three Test centuries and topping the run scoring aggregates on a 1959-60 tour of the Indian subcontinent which helped Australia win its last Test and series on Pakistani soil for 39 years, as well as another series in India. His career peaked in 1960-61 when he scored 181 in the Tied Test against the West Indies, and at the end of the series, had a career average of 58.25. Standing six feet tall, O'Neill was compared to Don Bradman upon his entry into Test cricket. At his best, he was a dynamic stroke maker who was a crowd favourite because of his ability to score at a high pace, in particular with his power off the back foot. He was noted for his nimble footwork, which he used to negate spin bowling; however this slowed in his later career as he put on weight. O'Neill particularly liked to sweep the slower bowlers. He often put too much emphasis on his right hand, allowing a large space between his hands on the bat handle, and then turning his right shoulder too square towards the bowler. The renowned English batsman and captain Wally Hammond said that O'Neill was the best all-round batsman he had seen since World War II. O'Neill's tall build, strength and good looks also drew comparison to his boyhood idol Keith Miller. Despite the comparisons to Bradman, O'Neill was much taller and broader, and was often impetuous whereas Bradman was known for his patience and lack of rashness. O'Neill was also criticised for hitting across the line early in his innings.  O'Neill was highly regarded for his style and entertainment values. Teammate Alan Davidson said \\"once set he was the most exhilarating player you'd ever want to see--he was dynamite. He'd play attacking shots off balls other people would only think of defending. He had wonderful skill and technique. His shots off the back foot down the ground off fast bowlers--you can't really describe how good they were.\\" His captain for Australia and New South Wales, Richie Benaud said that he was \\"one of the greatest entertainers we've had in Australian cricket\\". O'Neill's style led the British writer EW Swanton to say \\"the art of batting, he reminded us, was not dead, merely inexplicably dormant\\" Wisden opined that \\"A high innings by O'Neill is a thing of masterful beauty. His stroking is delectable, immense in its power.\\"  Later in his career, O'Neill became a nervous and superstitious batsman, particular at the start of an innings. He wrote \\"batting is a lonely business\\" in his 1964 autobiography Ins and Outs, opining that he sometimes found first-class cricket to be \\"depressing and lonely\\".  He was regarded as an excellent fieldsman at cover, with a powerful and accurate throw, described by Wisden as a \\"dream throw\\" honed from a junior career as a baseballer. He was named as utility player in the 1957 All Australian baseball team, and his ability was such that he was approached by Major League Baseball scouts. Before the retirement of Neil Harvey, he and O'Neill fielded in tandem in the covers and the pair were regarded as the finest fielding combination of the time. Did any of his teammates comment about his play style?","output":"Yes, Norman O'Neill's teammates did comment about his play style. One of his teammates, Alan Davidson, said: \\"Once set, he was the most exhilarating player you'd ever want to see - he was dynamite.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - The Iron Cross (abbreviated EK) was a military decoration in the Kingdom of Prussia, and later in the German Empire (18711918) and Nazi Germany (19331945). It was established by King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia in March 1813 backdated to the birthday of his late wife Queen Louise on 10 March 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars (EK 1813). Louise was the first person to receive this decoration (posthumous). The recommissioned Iron Cross was also awarded during the Franco-Prussian War (EK 1870), World War I (EK 1914), and World War II (EK 1939, re-introduced with a swastika added in the center). The Iron Cross was normally a military decoration only, though there were instances of it being awarded to civilians for performing military functions. Two examples of this were civilian test pilots Hanna Reitsch who was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class and 1st Class and Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, who was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class, for their actions as pilots during World War II.  - Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, born Melitta Schiller (9 January 1903  8 April 1945), was a German Aviator who served as a test pilot in the Luftwaffe before and during World War II.  - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\").

Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River.  - Vlaamse Vervoersmaatschappij De Lijn ( English : Flemish transport company De Lijn ) , usually known as De Lijn ( \`\` The Line '' ) , is a company run by the Flemish government in Belgium to provide public transportation with about 3650 buses and 359 trams . De Lijn was founded in 1991 after the public transportation companies of Antwerp and Ghent fused with the Flemish part of the NMVB ( Nationale Maatschappij van Buurtspoorwegen , or the \`\` National Company of Neighborhood Railways '' ) . Socialist politician Steve Stevaert of Hasselt implemented a policy allowing registered residents in Flanders aged 65 + to ride anywhere in Flanders free . Other incentives exist for people under age 25 . De Lijn is being viewed as an integral part to reduce heavily congested traffic , together with the NMBS ( Belgium 's national rail operator ) . In 2008 , it transported more than 508 million passengers in an area with a population of approximately 6.5 million . De Lijn operates : Antwerp Tramway , with both street running and underground light rail ( Antwerp Pre-metro ) . Ghent Tramway , mostly street running with some reserved track . Belgian coast tram , interurban line along the whole Belgian coast , between De Panne and Knokke . All urban , suburban and intercity buses in Flanders . Because of the dense rail network , intercity buses serve as local transport between big cities and smaller communities . Time to travel from one city to another by bus is most often longer than for the same journey on the train because bus lines are less straight , as they pass through many small towns that are not served by railway . The buses are more city - style ( no coach buses are used ) . In the Limburg province with few railways buses are the main mode of intercity travel . There are also express intercity buses there . Demand responsive bus ( belbus , \`\` bus on call '' ) in regions with low population density . The fares are the same on all modes .  - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century.

He stumbles onto the set of a World War I movie and isn't sure if he has accidentally caused the death of one of the film's stunt men. The eccentric and autocratic director, Eli Cross (Peter O'Toole), agrees to hide Cameron from the police if he will take the dead man's place. Cameron soon begins to suspect that Cross is putting him in excessive danger. At a bar one night, another member of the production gets drunk and tells Cameron that Eli almost killed the helicopter pilot during the fatal accident Cameron caused, because he insisted he keep flying in order to get the shot. Cameron falls in love with Nina Franklin (Barbara Hershey), the film's star, and is devastated to find out that she and Eli slept together before he met her. The boundaries between reality and fiction become increasingly blurred as Cross exercises godlike control over the production. During a screening of some footage for Nina's parents who are visiting the production, a nude sex scene with Nina is shown. Eli appears to be mortified, but allows the footage to play anyway. He waits until Nina is just about to shoot a traumatic scene the next day to tell her that her parents have seen the footage of her naked. It causes her to cry with humiliation, which seems to be the exact emotion Eli needs from her in the scene. The final day of filming involves a complicated stunt where Cameron has to drive a vintage Duesenberg off a bridge. Nina has two other scenes to shoot as well, but Cameron is convinced Eli will rig the stunt so he will die. He persuades Nina to run away with him, but they are unable to leave the set, which is kept sealed from the neighboring town by the police on Eli's orders. Nina hides in the trunk of the Duesenberg, promising to slip away with Cameron during the stunt. Before the scene is shot, Eli points to the Duesenberg and explains it is the only copy of the vintage car that the production has. He therefore orders that no one interrupt the filming of...

Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Maybe you are an average   student. You probably think you will never be a top student. This is not necessarily so. Anyone can become a good student if he or she wants to. Here's how you can be a good student. Plan your time carefully. When planning your week, you should make a list of things that you have to do. After making this list, you should make a plan of your time. First, your time for eating, sleeping, dressing... Then decide a good, regular   time for studying. Don't forget to set enough time for entertainment. A weekly plan may not work out all your problems, but it will push you to realize what is happening to your time. Find a good place to study. Look around the house for a good study place. Keep this space which may be a desk or simply a corner of your room, free of everything but study materials. No game, radio, or TV! When you sit down to study, concentrate on   your subjects. Make good use of your time. Listen to everything the teacher says. Listening carefully in class means less work later. Taking notes will help you remember what the teacher says. Study regularly. When you get home from school, go over your notes. Review the important points that your teacher has mentioned in class. If you know what your teacher is going to discuss the next day, read that material. This will help you understand the next class. If you do these things regularly, the material will become more meaningful, and you will remember it longer. Develop a good attitude to tests. The purpose of a test is to show what you have learned about a subject. It helps you remember your new knowledge. The world won't end if you don't pass a test, so don't be worried. There are other ideas that might help you with your study. You will probably find many others after you have tried these. Question: Which following statement is NOT TRUE according to the passage? - We should set enough time for entertainment when we plan our week. - We don't have to find a good place to study. - It's helpful to take notes in class because it makes us remember what the teacher says. - We never give up our study although we don't pass a test.

The customer also took note of the cashier’s accuracy in predicting the waiting time. Overall, these aspects of the review indicate a level of satisfaction with the service provided at the establishment. However, on the negative side, the customer expresses dissatisfaction with the price of the items ordered. The phrase \\"I though it was pricy\\" suggests that they found the cost to be higher than what they expected or considered reasonable. The customer lists the items and their collective cost (28.65) to emphasize their point about the perceived high pricing. This negative sentiment is also reflected in the rating, as the customer explicitly states that the price factor is \\"the only reason why not five stars.\\" In summary, the sentiment of this review is a combination of positive and negative emotions.

Summarize the following: If you need to remove oxidization from wires, a rosin-based solder is your best bet. As most electronics use more fragile, thinner wires, anything too corrosive may risk damaging them and shorting your circuit. Find a rosin-based solder at your local hardware store when working with electronics. If you're working with something bigger than electrical wiring, such as copper piping, you'll need something more corrosive. Acid flux or tinning flux will remove larger areas of oxidization and give you a much stronger soldering job. Tinning flux has small amounts of a powdered metal alloy mixed into the paste. The powder will melt with the flux and help fill the inside of the pipe you are soldering, making it more waterproof and longer-lasting. Leaded solder will melt at a lower temperature than other types, which makes it better for delicate electrical wiring. Ask at your local hardware or electronics store for leaded or electrical solder and you should have a small variety of types to choose from. Here are a few key differences in types of solder that may come up:  Lead-free electrical solder will also work for small wiring projects. It is more environmentally-friendly as it doesn't contain lead, but also will not hold quite as strong.  Some leaded solders will come with a rosin core. This means that they are slightly hollow and will have a thin line of rosin flux running through the middle. It will only be a small amount, so it shouldn't replace other flux, but it will increase the flux coating of your wires.  Leaded solders that are solid all the way through and don't have a rosin core are also a solid choice. These may oxidize slightly more, but as long as you are using soldering flux they should still hold strongly for a long time. If you are using leaded solder, make sure to wash your hands once you have finished working with it as the lead is toxic. Silver has a much higher melting point than lead, so it works much better for larger soldering projects. Ask for pipe or silvered solder at your local hardware store when working with pipes.  You should never use lead-based solder when working with piping that will carry water, as the lead is toxic and will make the water unsafe to drink. While lead-free solder may work when soldering pipes, it won't be as strong or as durable as silvered solder. Plug in or turn on your soldering iron to start heating it up. Once it is hot, use a damp sponge to clean away any solder left on the tip of the iron, making sure to never touch the hot end of the iron while it is on.  Always keep your soldering iron in a stand while it is on. The tip will get very hot, so it shouldn't be allowed to rest on any surfaces as this may start a fire. Don't leave your soldering iron unattended while you are using it. Apply a small amount of solder to the end of your soldering iron once it has heated up and been cleaned. Once the tip is covered and has a shiny appearance, you can wipe away any excess on the same damp sponge. This is called \\"tinning\\" your iron and will stop it from oxidizing as you work with it. As pipes are much bigger and more solid than intricate wiring, a soldering iron may take a long time to heat a pipe up to the right temperature. Use a propane torch or something similar when soldering with pipes. For the best results, adjust the torch until you have a blue flame around 2 inches (5.1 cm) long, and hold the tip of the flame to the pipes.  Make sure you always light your blowtorch away from yourself and use proper safety precautions when working with it. Wear protective, tinted glasses, fire-proof leather gloves and flame-retardant clothing for extra safety. Getting the perfect temperature with a blowtorch may take more practice than when working with a soldering iron. If the flux you are working with begins smoldering and turns black, it's a sign you are using too much heat. If the solder doesn't melt when touched to pipes, you might not be using enough. Keep practicing until you get a sense of the right way to work.","output":"To clean wires, use a rosin-based solder that you can find in a store. For bigger things like pipes, use stronger stuff like acid flux or tinning flux. There are different kinds of solder, like lead-free and leaded, and some with rosin inside. For pipes, use silver solder instead of lead solder, because lead is not safe for water. When using a soldering iron, be careful because it's hot. Clean and tin the iron to protect it. For pipes, use a propane torch instead of a soldering iron, and be very safe while using it. Practice to find the right temperature when soldering."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Michael and Robert are two patients at a cardiology clinic. Both just received their blood test results and were told that they need to improve their cholesterol levels. They were each recommended to make changes to their diets. Michael took this advice to heart, and reduced the levels of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol he consumed. Robert, on the other hand, continued to consume high levels of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Who will be at lower risk for atherosclerosis in the future?  Hint: Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol. A:","output":"Given the information provided in the paragraph, it can be concluded that Michael will be at a lower risk for atherosclerosis in the future.

It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"-  arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\"  pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands.  - The Korean War (in South Korean , \\"Korean War\\"; in North Korean , \\"Fatherland Liberation War\\"; 25 June 1950  27 July 1953) began when North Korea invaded South Korea. The United Nations, with the United States as the principal force, came to the aid of South Korea. China came to the aid of North Korea, and the Soviet Union gave some assistance.  - Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\") and South Korea (officially the \\"Republic of Korea\\").

It was the second of the Indochina Wars and was officially fought between North Vietnam and the government of South Vietnam. The North Vietnamese army was supported by the Soviet Union, China and other communist allies and the South Vietnamese army was supported by the United States, South Korea, Australia, Thailand and other anti-communist allies and the war is therefore considered a Cold War-era proxy war.  - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States.

The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - A magma chamber is a large underground pool of liquid rock found beneath the surface of the Earth. The molten rock in such a chamber is under great pressure, and given enough time, that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it creating outlets for the magma. If it finds a way to the surface, then the result will be a volcanic eruption; consequently many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers.  Magma chambers are hard to detect, and most of the known ones are therefore close to the surface of the Earth, commonly between 1 km and 10 km under the surface. In geological terms, this is extremely close to the surface, although in human terms, it is considerably deep underground.  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - It rises above east of the island and is clearly visible from the main island of Okinawa and in the East China Sea. The outline of Mount Gusuku can be clearly seen from the Motobu Peninsula on Okinawa Island and Sesoko Island. The mountain has historically served as a nautical landmark and appears in Japanese nautical charts from the medieval period.  - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from .   - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.  - The Iraq War was a protracted armed conflict that began in 2003 with the invasion of Iraq by a United States-led coalition that toppled the government of Saddam Hussein. The conflict continued for much of the next decade as an insurgency emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government. An estimated 151,000 to 600,000 or more Iraqis were killed in the first 34 years of conflict. The United States officially withdrew from the country in 2011 but left private security contractors in its place to continue the war. It again became re-involved in 2014 at the head of a new coalition; the insurgency and many dimensions of the civil armed conflict continue.  - A cay (or ), also spelled caye or key, is a small, low-elevation, sandy island on the surface of a coral reef. Cays occur in tropical environments throughout the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans (including in the Caribbean and on the Great Barrier Reef and Belize Barrier Reef).  - Okinawa has been a critical strategic location for the United States Armed Forces since the end of World War II. The island hosts around 26,000 US military personnel, about half of the total complement of the United States Forces Japan, spread among 32 bases and 48 training sites. US bases in Okinawa played critical roles in the Korean War, Vietnam War, War in Afghanistan and Iraq War. The presence of the US military in Okinawa has caused political controversy both on the island and elsewhere in Japan.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - The Sea of Okhotsk is a marginal sea of the western Pacific Ocean, lying between the Kamchatka Peninsula on the east, the Kuril Islands on the southeast, the island of Hokkaido to the south, the island of Sakhalin along the west, and a long stretch of eastern Siberian coast (the Shantar Sea) along the west and north. The northeast corner is the Shelikhov Gulf. The sea is named after Okhotsk, the first Russian settlement in the Far East.  - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.  - Lake Island is an island on the coast of the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is located between Mathieson Channel and Lady Trutch Passage, and is flanked by Dowager Island (to the northwest), Lady Douglas Island (to the west), and a long finger shaped peninsula of the Canadian mainland to the east. Ironically, Lake Island is not a lake island, as it is in an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, and lies only some 6 kilometres from the open sea.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.  - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south.  - Magma (from Ancient Greek  (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock.    What entity does 'iejima' has the relation 'located on terrain feature' with? Answer:","output":"Iejima has the relation \\"located on terrain feature\\" with the East China Sea, as it is an island lying a few kilometers off the Motobu Peninsula on Okinawa Island, which is part of Okinawa Prefecture in Japan.

Their story serves as a cautionary tale days... ||||| Story highlights About 17% of Gitmo detainees return to terrorist activities, report says      As of last month, the Guantanamo Bay detention facility had 154 detainees      Not everyone at Guantanamo Bay has been found guilty of terrorism      Guantanamo Bay detainees have long been considered America's most dangerous enemies.

MUST WATCH Video released of Bergdahl's transfer 04:12      The five detainees have been at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba for years, and out of commission for a long time. They probably don't have extensive networks to tap into, according to two senior U.S. officials.      Additionally, there will be fewer U.S. forces to target in Afghanistan since under a new agreement, most troops will be out of the nation next year.      Qatar has also reassured the United States that it will aggressively monitor the detainees, who will be under a travel ban for one year.      How many freed detainees have returned to terrorism?      At its peak, Guantanamo Bay had 770 men believed by the U.S. government to be involved in terrorist activity or military attacks.      That number has dwindled significantly. As of last month, the facility had 154 detainees.      A September 2013 report from the director of national intelligence reflected on what happened to the roughly 600 people who left Gitmo between its opening in 2002 and July 2013.      Of those, 100 -- or 16.6% of the released prisoners -- were \\"confirmed\\" to have returned \\"to terrorist activities.\\" Seventeen of those died, while 27 ended up in custody, according to the DNI report.      An additional 70 are \\"suspected of reengaging,\\" it said.      \\"Based on trends identified during the past 10 years, we assess that if additional detainees are transferred without conditions ... some will reengage in terrorist or insurgent activities,\\" the report said.      Does the U.S. keep an eye on freed detainees?      While the former prisoners are no longer under its control, Washington says it keeps track of them, which is the basis of the DNI report.      During President George W. Bush's administration, some were handed over to authorities in other countries.      Dozens more were released under Obama.      Are American interests more at risk when they get out?      There are a lot of variables, making this a debatable question.      Except for those accused or convicted of the most heinous crimes such as murder, most people are not detained indefinitely.      And studies show the recidivism rate for those in the U.S. legal system typically top 50% or even 60%, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics . Armed with that knowledge, the idea of a Gitmo detainee returning to his previous ways may not be surprising.      It also depends on where they go from there.      The DNI report notes the dangers of transferring prisoners to nations with conflicts, instability and active recruitment by terror groups.      In other words, a detainee who returns to a place beset by violence -- where terrorist groups and attacks are common -- is more likely to return to the fold.      Does this mean the U.S. got a raw deal in Bergdahl's release?      Depends on whom you ask.      Sen. John McCain , a former prisoner of war, is not popping the Champagne just yet.      He knows a thing or two about life in enemy hands after spending more than five years in captivity in North Vietnam. Since then, he has emerged as one of the nation's loudest, boldest voices on military matters.      And he feels strongly that the United States did not think this through.      \\"Don't trade one person for five (of) the hardest of the hard-core, murdering war criminals who will clearly re-enter the fight and send them to Qatar, of all places,\\" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday night.      But White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice defended the Obama administration's decision.      The \\"acute urgency\\" of Bergdahl's health condition justified the President not notifying Congress beforehand that he was being swapped for the five detainees, she said.      Why are terror suspects held at Guantanamo Bay?      The U.S. naval base there was transformed after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks . Existing migrant detention facilities were revamped to house detainees of the so-called war on terror.      JUST WATCHED What happened when Bergdahl disappeared? Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH 'It matters a lot if he was a deserter' 05:03      These were men, who though captured in the battlefield, didn't fit any detention category. U.S. authorities said they didn't have the same rights as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions. Nor did they have the same rights as those detained within the United States.      The Bush administration argued that since the detainees were not on U.S. soil, they were not covered by the U.S. Constitution. It used that rationale to justify the lack of legal protections for those detained.      That made the base sometimes referred to as Gitmo a sort of no man's land.      How much does it cost to keep it running?      Shortly after his inauguration in 2009, Obama signed an executive order to close the detention facility within one year. It has not happened.      Has everyone at Gitmo been found guilty of terrorism?      No.      Peter Bergen, a CNN national security analyst, and Bailey Cahall, a research associate at the New America Foundation, wrote in an op-ed last year that said dozens of detainees cleared for release years ago \\"remain in seemingly perpetual custody.\\"      \\"They have found to be guilty of nothing, yet they are being held indefinitely,\\" Bergen and Cahall wrote.      \\"Indefinite detention without charge is a policy that we usually associate with dictatorships, not democracies.\\"      Bergen also heads the New America Foundation's International Security Program.      Others, though, view the situation differently. They say terrorists don't play by any recognized rules of warfare or justice; their mission is to kill, with U.S. forces and citizens as their targets.      McCain says that the five men released as part of the Bergdahl deal could be among those attacking U.S. citizens both at home and overseas.      The five \\"were judged time after time as unworthy ... that needed to be kept in detention because they posed a risk and a threat to the United States of America,\\" the Arizona Republican said.      Who were the detainees swapped for Bergdahl?      Two senior Obama administration officials identified them as Khair Ulla Said Wali Khairkhwa, Mullah Mohammad Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori, Abdul Haq Wasiq and Mohammad Nabi Omari.      They were mostly mid- to high-level officials in the Taliban regime who were detained early in the war in Afghanistan because of their positions within the Taliban, not because of ties to al Qaeda. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Three Moroccan militants, previously released from Guantanamo by the U.S. and turned over to the Moroccan government, ended up leading one of the most violent Islamist groups in Syria's civil war. A report indicates that about 17% of Guantanamo detainees return to terrorist activities. As of last month, Guantanamo Bay housed 154 detainees. A concern is raised over how dangerous the latest swap of detainees might be. However, the Obama administration refutes these concerns as the detention facility has not been a recruiting ground for extended terror networks.  Nevertheless, an intelligence report from September 2013 shared that of about 600 detainees who left Guantanamo between 2002 and 2013, 100 were confirmed to have returned to terrorist activities. The report also forecasted a likelihood of some transferred detainees reengaging in terrorist activities. The U.S. maintains surveillance on freed detainees and many of them were handed over to foreign authorities or released under President Obama's administration.  The continuous release of detainees poses a debatable risk to American interests. The recidivism rate amidst former Guantanamo detainees could be influenced by the conflict level in the areas they returned to. Critics such as Sen. John McCain express concerns about these practices. McCain believes that swapping detainees like the notorious case of Bergdahl's release lacks thorough consideration for potential adversarial consequences.  Guantanamo Bay was repurposed after the 9/11 terrorist attacks to house terror suspects due to their undefined detention category under either the Geneva Conventions or the U.S. Constitution. The closure of the facility has been attempted but has not been achieved. Despite the notorious reputation of the Bay, not all detainees found there have been guilty of terrorism, with some being kept in seemingly perpetual time of custody. The terrorists there, according to critics, pose a threat to U.S citizens and U.S forces abroad."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Newcastle is the most populous city in the North East and forms the core of Tyneside conurbation, the eighth most populous urban area in the United Kingdom. Newcastle is a member of the English Core Cities Group and is a member of the Eurocities network of European cities. Newcastle was part of the county of Northumberland until 1400, when it became a county of itself, a status it retained until becoming part of Tyne and Wear in 1974.

Process:  - The consumer throws aluminum cans and foil into a recycle bin - The aluminum is collected - Taken to a treatment plant - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned ready for reprocessing - The aluminum is re-melted - Turned into molten aluminum - The aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots - The ingots are sent to mills to be rolled out - The rolled out product is made into new aluminum products.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose money is needed for other things happens, how will it affect MORE aluminum cans being recycled.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis states that if money is needed for other things, it may have an effect on the process of recycling aluminum cans. Let's analyze this step-by-step: 1. The consumer throws aluminum cans and foil into a recycle bin    - If money is needed for other things, this may lead to cutbacks in public services, potentially including recycling programs. This could make it more difficult for consumers to access recycling bins, potentially reducing the amount of aluminum recycled.     2. The aluminum is collected    - If budgets are tight, waste management companies may face financial constraints. This could lead to less frequent collection services, reducing the volume of aluminum recycled. 3. Taken to a treatment plant    - If money is needed elsewhere, treatment plants may face budget cuts or scaled-back operations, potentially limiting the amount of aluminum they can process. 4. The aluminum is sorted and cleaned, ready for reprocessing    - Reduced funding may lead to less efficient sorting and cleaning processes, potentially reducing the quality of the recycled aluminum or the overall volume. 5. The aluminum is re-melted and turned into molten aluminum    - On this step, the perturbation might not have a significant direct impact as the process is largely dependent on the proper functioning of the melting furnaces. 6. The aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots    - If resources are scarce, there may be fewer facilities available to process ingots or lower-capacity machinery, potentially slowing down the ingot production process. 7. The ingots are sent to mills to be rolled out    - Budget cuts might lead to delays in transportation or higher costs, which could affect how ingots are rolled out and converted into usable materials. 8. The rolled-out product is made into new aluminum products    - Limited funding could translate to reduced research or investments in new production technologies, potentially decreasing the efficiency of manufacturing new aluminum products. In conclusion, the perturbation that money is needed for other things could have both direct and indirect effects on the process of recycling aluminum cans. It may lead to reductions in waste management and recycling services, potential inefficiencies in the treatment and reprocessing facilities, and potential impacts on the production of new aluminum products. All these factors could potentially contribute to a decrease in the overall volume of aluminum cans being recycled."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring\\".  Guess a valid title for it!

(LSC), a quasi-governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor, would receive 329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001. Sent 2: If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy. Sent 3: Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take. Sent 4: (1996 Almanac, p. Sent 5: 5-36) Republicans cut the organization's budget deeply in 1996, but its funding has recovered slowly. Sent 6: Last month, in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003, the Senate added a onetime increase of 19 million, which, if approved in the final version, would bring the LSC budget to 348 million. Sent 7: The money would go to help states, such as Michigan and Ohio, that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households. Sent 8: If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president's desk, LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization's fiscal 2004 funding. Sent 9: The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 (PL 93-355). Sent 10: LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies, which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - 11,075 a year for an individual and 22,625 for a family of four. Sent 11: Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases, custody cases and other such matters, according to LSC. Sent 12: Since 1996, lawyers who receive money from Legal Services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying legislatures, filing class-action suits, participating in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, or defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs.

Plot title: Let's Go to Prison Movie plot: John Lyshitski (Dax Shepard) has spent most of his life being a slimeball, thanks to Judge Nelson Biederman III, who has been giving him hard sentences ever since he stole a car at the age of eight. Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers. At his sentencing he pleads guilty to the same judge Nelson IV had, and asks for the same sentence (3-5) at the same prison. After negotiating with the judge and bribing a few guards, he ends up as Nelsons cellmate, and here he pretends to be his friend, all in an attempt to give him the wrong advice on surviving life in prison.Somehow, Nelson gets himself out of a numerous array of jams, even discovering that he's gay and meeting the love of his life, gang leader Barry (Chi McBride), a hulking, burly gay caballero with the heart of a dashing romantic hero beating within his massive, hairy...

Such disparities in experience can have a rippling effect on their ability to navigate the challenges that they may face while working at the company. Given that Randy is a worker at the company, he is likely to have a deep understanding of the company's culture, its mission, and its values. He may have developed a strong relationship with other team members and gained invaluable insights into how the company operates. With this experience, Randy is better equipped to handle the complexities of the job and can adapt more easily to any new changes or unexpected situations.  On the other hand, Christopher, who is not a worker at the company, lacks these crucial experiences. He might find it challenging to navigate the company's hierarchy and may not understand the subtle nuances that come with the company culture. This can make it harder for him to know which steps to take when faced with a problem or even when making decisions that impact the company. Furthermore, he might find it difficult to connect and communicate with other employees, which can lead to miscommunication and misunderstandings. Additionally, Randy's tenure at the company also means that he has accumulated industry-specific knowledge and has developed his expertise in the company's field of operation. This accumulated knowledge and experience allow him to make informed decisions, providing a vital advantage over someone like Christopher, who has less knowledge about the company's operations and industry. It is essential for companies to recognize the value of experienced employees like Randy. Seasoned employees play a crucial role in training and mentoring less experienced staff like Christopher, who can eventually grow to become valuable team members. Strengthening the bond between experienced and inexperienced workers can help develop a deeper sense of job ownership, creating a more cohesive and successful team. In conclusion, it is clear that Christopher has a lot less experience in the situation than Randy because Randy is a worker at the company. Christopher may struggle to adapt to the company culture, understand the industry deeply, and communicate effectively with coworkers, which can negatively impact his performance. However, with the support and guidance from experienced workers like Randy, Christopher can learn and grow in his role, eventually gaining the necessary experience and expertise to contribute positively to the company."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Great Raid Movie plot: In 1944, American forces were closing in on the Japanese-occupied Philippines. The Japanese held around 500 American prisoners who had survived the Bataan Death March in a notorious POW camp at Cabanatuan and subjected them to brutal treatment and summary execution, as the Japanese view surrender as a disgrace. Many prisoners were also stricken with malaria. The film opens with the massacre of prisoners of war on Palawan by the Kempeitai, the Imperial Japanese military's secret police (though factually, it was committed by the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army). Meanwhile, at Lingayen Gulf, the 6th Ranger Battalion under Lt. Col Mucci is ordered by Lt. Gen. Walter Krueger to liberate all of the POWs at Cabanatuan prison camp before they are killed by the Japanese. The film chronicles the efforts of the Rangers, Alamo Scouts from the 6th Army and Filipino guerrillas as they undertake the Raid at Cabanatuan. Throughout the film, the viewpoint switches between the POWs at Cabanatuan, the Rangers, the Filipino resistance and the Japanese. In particular, the film covers the resistance work undertaken by nurse Margaret Utinsky, who smuggled medicine into the POW camps. The Kempeitai arrested her and sent her to Fort Santiago prison. She was eventually released, but spent six weeks recovering from gangrene as a result of injuries sustained from beatings. A:","output":"The movie \\"The Great Raid\\" portrays Margaret Utinsky as a courageous nurse who contributed significantly to the resistance efforts by smuggling medicine into the POW camps.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How secure and private is it to store all my photos in Google Drive? Is there any proof of Google looking at private documents stored in Google Drive? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"Storing your photos in Google Drive offers a certain level of security and privacy, but it is essential to understand the mechanisms in place and potential risks for a more comprehensive view. Let's break down the factors impacting the security and privacy of your photos on Google Drive: 1. Encryption & Data Protection: Google Drive uses encryption to secure your photos both at rest and in transit. It uses SSL/TLS encryption when your photos are uploaded and downloaded between your device and Google Drive. Additionally, once your photos are stored on the Google servers, they are encrypted using AES128 or AES256 algorithms. Encryption helps protect your data from unauthorized access. However, given the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, no encryption method can guarantee complete protection. 2. Access Control: You have control over how you share your Google Drive files, including your photos. By default, your files are private, and only you can access them. Sharing settings allow you to grant specific individuals access to your files by specifying their email addresses. Additionally, you can generate shareable links giving anyone with the link access to the file. It is crucial always to review these settings and understand them before sharing your photos. 3. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Google offers two-factor authentication, an added layer of security requiring users to provide two proofs of identity before accessing their accounts. This can significantly decrease the risk of unauthorized access to your photos if your password is compromised. It is highly recommended to enable this feature on your account. 4. Google Privacy Policy & Access to Data: Google's privacy policy states that they may \\"collect, store, and process information in the United States and any other country where Google or its service providers operate.\\" While Google maintains that their employees do not have direct access to your content, the policy also states that Google can access your information under specific situations such as complying with legal requirements, detecting and preventing fraud, addressing security issues, or technical issues. This means that in rare circumstances, Google might access your private photos as per their privacy policy. 5. Potential Threats: Storing photos on Google Drive, like any other online storage, exposes them to potential threats such as hackers and data breaches. Although Google has robust security measures in place, the risk of unauthorized access cannot be completely eliminated. Regarding the question of whether there is any proof of Google looking at private documents stored in Google Drive, Google itself claims that they do not access or scan your Google Drive files for advertising purposes. However, as mentioned earlier, they might access your files in specific situations, as dictated by their privacy policy. In conclusion, while the questions are related, they are not the same. The first question concerns the security and privacy of storing photos on Google Drive, which depends on various factors, including encryption, access control, and Google's privacy policy. The second question focuses on whether there is any evidence that Google actively looks at private documents stored on its platform. While Google Drive offers notable security measures, it is always crucial to stay vigilant and take additional precautions to protect your photos, such as enabling two-factor authentication, regularly reviewing sharing settings, and having a strong, unique password. Finally, diversifying your data storage and having local backups can also help prevent data loss and enhance your privacy."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Context_10 : Suraiya Jamaal Sheikh (15 June 1929 – 31 January 2004), popularly known as Suraiya, was an Indian Muslim Hindi/Hindustani film actress and playback singer in Bollywood from the 1940s to the early 1960s, who remained unmarried throughout her life, after her love affair with actor Dev Anand was aborted by her maternal grandmother. She was the most popular singing star of the Indian sub-continent of her generation. Until 1943, as a child singer, Suraiya did playback singing for one actress, namely Mehtab, in three films, and also in some of her own films for her roles as a child artiste. After this, she only sang for her own films as an actress, and acted as a heroine from 1946 until the end of her career in 1963. From 1948 to 1951, she became the singing superstar of Bollywood, earning more for her performances than all the performing actors of the times, male or female, including Dev Anand, Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar, Nargis and Madhubala. She received 1.5–2 lakhs rupees for her role per film, when top male actors were getting 50 thousand to 1 lakh rs. For a song, she commanded rs. 1000, while Lata Mangeshkar was getting rs. 100–200 per song. She was the only child of her parents. She had a natural talent for singing, acting and dancing from childhood. She received basic training in music when her mother used to take her to a Hindustani music teacher or 'masterji' for training. She first sang for a children's program for All India Radio in 1937. Later on Naushad gave her on the job 'training', while recording. She went on to become one of the most successful singing film stars of Bollywood. She had received training in dancing from Mumtaz Ali, dancer-actor and father of the famous comedian Mehmood. She was also known for her North Indian Muslim feudal style acting or 'adakari' in many of her films (\\"Mirza Ghalib (film)\\", \\"Phool\\", \\"Afsar\\", \\"Shayar\\", \\"Jeet (1949 film)\\", \\"Anmol Ghadi\\" and \\"Dastan\\"). This style 'endowed modernity with an aura of tradition' and brought nostalgic feudal tinge to the scenes. Her performance 'expertly integrated gestures, music and speech'. Suraiya in her heyday was known as 'Malika-e-Husn' (queen of beauty), 'Malika-e-Tarannum' (queen of melody) and 'Malika-e-Adakaari' (queen of acting), all rolled into one. In a career spanning from 1936 till 1963, Suraiya sang 338 songs in films (which were mostly her own films) and 2 in addition were non-film songs, namely, 'tum rahe kahan ko piya' and 'hum tum karenge pyar'. She acted in 67 movies, which do not include the incomplete films such as \\"Jaanwar\\" (with Dilip Kumar), \\"Paagal Khaana\\" with Bharat Bhushan and an Indo-British film on Wajid Ali Shah (1953) being directed by British director, Herbert Marshall, with Ashok Kumar in the role of Wajid Ali Shah. fact_1 :  Before going solo, she was half of a popular Indian duo with her younger brother Shaan with whom she released albums such as \\"Q-Funk\\", \\"Roop Inka Mastana\\" and \\"Naujawan\\". fact_2 : Shantanu Mukherjee (born 30 September 1972), known as Shaan, is an Indian playback singer active in Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Urdu, Telugu and Kannada films and a television host.

Please answer the following question: Dan found three rattle snakes: one only had one rattle, the second snake had 4 rattles and the third snake had seven rattles on its tail.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which snake had more segments, the first or the second snake Dan found?  Hint: At birth, a rattlesnake hatchling has only a small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached to the tip of the tail.[13] The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its skin for the first time.[14] A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.[15] Answer:","output":"The second snake Dan found had more segments. According to the information provided, a rattlesnake is born with a primordial rattle or a \\"button,\\" and it gains its first rattle segment when it sheds its skin for the first time. A new segment is added with every subsequent shedding. Although the rattle's length is not a reliable age indicator due to segments breaking off, we can still compare the rattles of the two snakes in question. The first snake had only one rattle, meaning it had shed its skin once after birth and gained its first segment. The second snake, on the other hand, had four rattles, which indicates it had shed its skin four times and gained four segments. Therefore, the second snake had more segments than the first snake Dan found."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Scott Freeman, meanwhile, is a New Mexican businessman flying his private Beechcraft Baron to an urgent sales meeting in Boise, Idaho. However, an occluded front has the entire West Coast socked in, with Los Angeles reporting zero visibility. Columbia 409 and Freeman's Beechcraft are both diverted to Salt Lake City International Airport. Salt Lake air traffic control assigns Columbia 409 to land ahead of Freeman's Beechcraft.

From 1879, Watch Tower supporters gathered as autonomous congregations to study the Bible topically. Thirty congregations were founded, and during 1879 and 1880, Russell visited each to provide the format he recommended for conducting meetings. As congregations continued to form during Russell's ministry, they each remained self-administrative, functioning under the congregationalist style of church governance. In 1881, Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society was presided over by William Henry Conley, and in 1884, Charles Taze Russell incorporated the society as a non-profit business to distribute tracts and Bibles. By about 1900, Russell had organized thousands of part- and full-time colporteurs, and was appointing foreign missionaries and establishing branch offices. By the 1910s, Russell's organization maintained nearly a hundred \\"pilgrims,\\" or traveling preachers.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? does hold up pretty well","output":"The sentiment of the movie review sentence, \\"does hold up pretty well,\\" is generally positive. To better understand and break down this sentiment, let's analyze the structure and the words used in the sentence. First, the verb \\"hold up\\" is an idiomatic expression used to describe how something bears up or maintains its value, quality, or effectiveness over time. In this context, it refers to how the movie continues to be enjoyable or praiseworthy. The fact that the reviewer chose this phrasing suggests that they believe the movie remains relevant and appealing, possibly defying expectations due to factors such as its age, time of release, or other factors. Second, the adverb \\"pretty\\" is employed as a modifier to the expression \\"hold up.\\" Used colloquially to mean \\"to a moderately high degree,\\" \\"pretty\\" serves to reinforce the notion that the movie not only holds up but does so to a significant extent. It underscores the reviewer's conviction that the movie remains more than just acceptable—it is relatively solid and respectable in quality. Third, the adverb \\"well\\" denotes the manner in which the movie holds up and provides an overall positive characterization. It implies that the movie's ability to endure is not only notable but also commendable. Combined with the other elements of the sentence, \\"well\\" contributes to the generally positive sentiment expressed by the reviewer. To sum up, the sentiment of the movie review sentence— \\"does hold up pretty well\\"— is mainly positive. The choice of language used by the reviewer conveys their assertion that the film retains its quality and appeal over time, succeeding in doing so to a noteworthy degree."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles.

More precisely, it is made of sterling silver, a silver alloy containing 92.5% by weight of silver and 7.5% by weight of other metals, usually copper. This silver alloy is renowned for its purity, durability, and appearance, making it an ideal choice for crafting prestigious awards and trophies. The trophy design features a large silver bowl on top, with the NHL logo and two crossed hockey sticks on the upper portion. The body of the trophy presents a map of North America, where all the cities with an NHL team are represented with a star.

John Anthony Gillis was born in Detroit, Michigan, the youngest of ten children--and the seventh son--of Teresa (nee Bandyk) and Gorman M. Gillis. His mother's family was Polish, while his father was Scottish-Canadian. He was raised a Catholic, and his father and mother both worked for the Archdiocese of Detroit as the Building Maintenance Superintendent and secretary in the Cardinal's office, respectively. Gillis became an altar boy, which landed him an uncredited role in the 1987 movie The Rosary Murders, filmed mainly at Holy Redeemer parish in southwest Detroit. On December 13, 2003, White was involved in an altercation with Jason Stollsteimer, lead singer of the Von Bondies, at the Magic Stick, a Detroit club. White was charged with misdemeanor aggravated assault. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of assault and battery, was fined 750 (including court costs), and was sentenced to take anger management classes.  White has repeatedly referenced conflicts that erupted between him and fellow artists in Detroit's underground music scene after The White Stripes gained international success. In a 2006 interview with the Associated Press, he said that he eventually left Detroit because, \\"he could not take the negativity anymore.\\" However, in an effort to clarify his feelings towards the city of Detroit itself, he wrote and released a poem called \\"Courageous Dream's Concern.\\" In it, he expresses his affection for his hometown.  During their 2013 divorce proceedings, Elson entered into evidence an e-mail White had sent her that included disparaging remarks about The Black Keys. When asked about the email in a 2014 Rolling Stone magazine interview, White stood by the remarks saying, \\"I'll hear TV commercials where the music's ripping off sounds of mine, to the point I think it's me. Half the time, it's the Black Keys.\\" He later apologized for the comments. However, in September 2015, Patrick Carney of the band posted a series of tweets alleging that White tried to fight him in a bar. White denied the claim in a statement to the online magazine Pitchfork, saying that Carney should talk to him directly, and not on the internet. The following day, Carney posted a tweet saying, \\"Talked to jack for an hour he's cool. All good.\\" White tweeted on the Third Man Twitter account, \\"From one musician to another, you have my respect Patrick Carney.\\"  On February 1, 2015, the University of Oklahoma's newspaper OU Daily ran a story regarding White's February 2 show at McCasland Field House that included the publication of White's tour rider. The rider, especially the guacamole recipe it included and White's ban of bananas backstage, received significant media coverage. It was later reported that in response to the rider's publication White's booking agency, William Morris Endeavor Entertainment, had banned its acts from playing shows at the University of Oklahoma. On February 15 White released an open letter addressed to \\"journalists and other people looking for drama or a diva\\" in which he referred to the guacamole recipe as his tour manager's \\"inside joke with local promoters\\" and \\"just something to break up the boredom\\" while criticizing journalists who wrote about the rider as \\"out of their element.\\" In the same letter he forgave OU Daily for publishing the story and reaffirmed his desire to perform in Oklahoma.  In October 2016--upon learning that Donald Trump had used the White Stripes' song \\"Seven Nation Army\\" in video campaign materials--White denounced the presidential candidate, and began selling shirts reading \\"Icky Trump\\" through the Third Man Records website.

The princess cut is a type of diamond cut that is particularly popular for engagement rings and other types of jewelry. Its square shape, with sharp corners and distinct faceting, sets it apart from other diamond cuts and makes it an ideal choice for those who prefer a more geometric appearance. Although the term \\"square diamonds\\" can potentially refer to any diamond cut that results in a square shape, the princess cut is one of the most commonly known square diamond cuts. Developed in the 1960s, the princess cut was created to maximize the brilliance and fire of a diamond, meaning that it reflects light more effectively than other square cuts, resulting in more sparkle. Other square cuts, such as the Asscher, cushion, or radiant, also exist.

Russia is like a sneaky kid who tried to secretly help one of the players in the game. People are not sure how much the sneaky kid's actions helped that player to win, but it's not very nice. The first question asks about how much the sneaky kid (Russia) affected the big game (US election). We don't know for sure if the sneaky kid's actions made a huge difference or not, but it's important to know if they did.  The second question asks what happens if we find out that the sneaky kid (Russia) really did help one of the players (Donald Trump) in the big game (2016 US election). It wonders if that player (Donald Trump) would still be allowed to be a team leader. It's a different question because it focuses on the possible actions people might take after finding out about the sneaky kid's behavior.

If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.

Step-by-step explanation and justification: 1. Start translating the sentence chunk by chunk.    I voted -> Am votat    Justification: I used the proper pronoun \\"Eu\\" (I) and the Romanian verb for \\"voted\\" (votat), making \\"Eu am votat\\". In Romanian, the pronoun can be omitted, so I shortened it to \\"Am votat\\". 2. Translate \\"to strengthen the OSCE\\" into Romanian.    to strengthen -> pentru consolidarea    the OSCE -> OSCE (no need to translate the acronym)    Justification: \\"to strengthen\\" is translated to \\"pentru consolidarea\\", and OSCE is a well-known international organization and its acronym remains the same in Romanian. 3. Translate \\"which must be based on harmony between\\" into Romanian.    which must be -> care trebuie să fie    based on -> bazat pe    harmony between -> armonia dintre    Justification: \\"which must be\\" as \\"care trebuie să fie\\" is a relative clause, \\"based on\\" is translated to \\"bazat pe\\", and \\"harmony between\\" to \\"armonia dintre\\". 4.

He composed using scales of unequal intervals in just intonation, and was one of the first 20th-century composers in the West to work systematically with microtonal scales. He built custom-made instruments in these tunings on which to play his compositions, and described his theory and practice in his book Genesis of a Music (1947). Partch composed with scales dividing the octave into 43 unequal tones derived from the natural harmonic series; these scales allowed for more tones of smaller intervals than in standard Western tuning, which uses twelve equal intervals to the octave. Supported by Guggenheim and university grants, Partch took up residence at the University of Wisconsin from 1944 until 1947. This was a productive period, in which he lectured, trained an ensemble, staged performances, released his first recordings, and completed his book, now called Genesis of a Music. Genesis was completed in 1947 and published in 1949 by the University of Wisconsin Press. He left the university, as it never accepted him as a member of the permanent staff, and there was little space for his growing stock of instruments.  In 1949, pianist Gunnar Johansen allowed Partch to convert a smithy on his ranch to a studio. Partch worked there with support from the Guggenheim Foundation, and did recordings, primarily of his Eleven Intrusions (1949-1950). He was assisted for six months by composer Ben Johnston, who performed on Partch's recordings. In spring 1951, Partch moved to Oakland for health reasons, and prepared for a production of King Oedipus at Mills College, with the support of designer Arch Lauterer. Performances of King Oedipus in March were extensively reviewed, but a planned recording was blocked by the Yeats estate, which refused to grant permission to use Yeats's translation.  In February 1953, Partch founded the studio Gate 5 in an abandoned shipyard in Sausalito, California, where he composed, built instruments and staged performances. Subscriptions to raise money for recordings were organized by the Harry Partch Trust Fund, an organization put together by friends and supporters. The recordings were sold via mail order, as were later releases on the Gate 5 Records label. The money raised from these recordings became his main source of income. Partch's three Plectra and Percussion Dances, Ring Around the Moon (1949-1950), Castor and Pollux, and Even Wild Horses, premiered on Berkeley's KPFA radio in November 1953.  After completing The Bewitched in January 1955, Partch tried to find the means to put on a production of it. Ben Johnston introduced Danlee Mitchell to Partch at the University of Illinois; Mitchell later became Partch's heir. In March 1957, with the help of Johnston and the Fromm Foundation, The Bewitched was performed at the University of Illinois, and later at Washington University in St. Louis, though Partch was displeased with choreographer Alwin Nikolais's interpretation. Later in 1957, Partch provided the music for Madeline Tourtelot's film Windsong, the first of six film collaborations between the two. From 1959 to 1962, Partch received further appointments from the University of Illinois, and staged productions of Revelation in the Courthouse Park in 1961 and Water! Water! in 1962. Though these two works were based, as King Oedipus had been, on Greek mythology, they modernized the settings and incorporated elements of popular music. Partch had support from several departments and organizations at the university, but continuing hostility from the music department convinced him to leave and return to California. Ask a question about this article.","output":"Harry Partch was an American composer who made unique music using special scales and custom-designed musical instruments. He liked to use many different tones instead of the usual 12 tones that most Western music uses. He taught people about his music and wrote a book called Genesis of a Music to explain it. Throughout his career, he faced challenges but still managed to create and perform his music in different places. His works were often inspired by Greek mythology.

Answer:","output":"The last step of the process, following the production of thousands or millions of new virus particles, is the release of these new virus particles and the subsequent infection of other healthy cells. This is achieved through a process called budding or, in some cases, cell lysis. In the budding process, the newly formed virus particles push against the host cell's membrane, causing the membrane to envelop them and form a protective layer around the virus. As the virus particles continue to push outwards, they eventually detach from the host cell in a viral envelope, leaving the cell membrane intact. The released virus particles, now enclosed in a viral envelope, can then go on to infect other healthy cells in the host organism. Alternatively, some viruses may cause cell lysis, which is the rupture and destruction of the host cell. In this process, the newly produced virus particles accumulate within the host cell, causing it to swell and eventually burst, releasing the virus particles into the surrounding environment. This not only spreads the virus to other cells but also damages and kills the host cell in the process. Overall, the last step in the process involves the release and dissemination of new virus particles, leading to further infection and spread of the flu virus within the host organism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Yes, the given statement \\"Most Roman towns and cities had a forum, temples, and the same type of buildings, on a smaller scale, as found in Rome\\" is a reasonable answer in reference to the existence of marketplaces in ancient cities. The forum, in particular, was a key component of marketplaces in ancient Roman culture. However, it is important to note that marketplaces in ancient societies were not limited to Roman culture. Several ancient cultures around the world developed marketplaces to facilitate trade and commerce. Here is a more comprehensive answer: Ancient marketplaces were central locations where goods were exchanged between producers, consumers, and traders. A diverse array of ancient cultures had marketplaces, such as: 1. Mesopotamians: One of the earliest known civilizations, the Mesopotamians, developed marketplaces to facilitate trade and commerce. The ancient Sumerian city of Ur, for instance, functioned as a significant trade hub, with people exchanging goods, services, and even cultural ideas. 2. Ancient Egyptians: The ancient Egyptians also had marketplaces where traders brought their products, such as pottery, textiles, and food items, for exchange or sale. Marketplaces were essential in Egyptian cities like Thebes and Memphis. Transactions were often made through bartering or using the Egyptian currency, deben. 3. Ancient Greeks: The Greeks had a marketplace called agora. The agora was typically a central spot located within city-states, surrounded by institutional buildings. Both local craftsmen and traders across the Mediterranean would gather in the agora to sell their goods, while people also met there to discuss politics, philosophy, and other aspects of daily life. 4. Romans: As mentioned in the initial statement, Roman towns and cities had the forum, which served as a centralized marketplace. The forum was not only a place for trade but also a venue for socializing, discussing politics, and attending public events. Traders and individuals would gather at this location to buy, sell, or barter a variety of goods like food, clothes, and utility items. 5. Mesoamerican civilizations: The ancient Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Maya, Zapotec, and Aztec also had marketplaces. One notable example is the ancient market in the city of Tlatelolco, which was a significant trading center within the Aztec Empire. This marketplace attracted traders from across the empire and beyond, where goods such as cloth, food, ceramics, and even people were traded. 6. Ancient China: The ancient Chinese had marketplaces known as \\"shi.\\" The marketplaces were essential for both rural and urban areas in supporting the economy. Goods like textiles, porcelain, and metalware, and various agricultural products were traded at these bustling marketplaces. The Silk Road, connecting China to the Mediterranean, was a major trade route that further facilitated cultural exchange and commerce. In conclusion, ancient cultures such as Mesopotamians, Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Mesoamerican civilizations, and Chinese all had marketplaces that served as centers of trade, commerce, and community interaction. These marketplaces were essential in sustaining the economy, distributing goods and services, and fostering cultural exchange in those societies."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- More than 65 people have been killed in two days of clashes between rebel groups and soldiers in Southern Sudan's Upper Nile state, an army spokesman said.  Philip Aguer, spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) told CNN.com that forces loyal to a militia leader named Oliny attacked the village of Uach west of Malakal in Upper Nile state.  \\"55 members of the militia and seven SPLA soldiers were killed, and we believe a number of civilians also died, but we are still getting information.\\"  Oliny, Aguer said, is a former member of Southern Sudanese politician Lam Akol's militia. \\"But we don't know if he is still associated with him.\\"  Aguer also said that he believes that Oliny was receiving military support from the government in northern Sudan.  \\"They have received new weapons. We suspect they all acted in coordination with Khartoum ... I think things are going to continue escalating,\\" he said.  However, Sudan's dominant National Congress Party (NCP) in the north denied having any involvement.  Rabie Abdelati, an NCP party official, said on Monday: \\"If we really wanted to go back to war, we would not have signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (the 2005 accord) or accepted the referendum.  \\"We are hoping for a strong south after secession.

Review: drama , conflict , tears and surprise  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive? Select from the following. [-] negative; [-] positive; The answer is:","output":"To determine whether the movie review sentence is negative or positive, let's analyze each element of the sentence. Step 1: Examine the words and their connotations - Drama: can have both positive and negative connotations, depending on how it is presented or received. - Conflict: tends to have a negative connotation, as it implies disagreement or discord. - Tears: can have a negative connotation, as they often represent sadness or pain, but can also indicate a strong emotional response, which can be positive. - Surprise: can have both positive and negative connotations but often is associated with an unexpected twist or turn in the movie. Step 2: Determine the overall tone Considering the mixture of potential positive and negative connotations in the sentence, it is difficult to definitively assign either a positive or negative label. However, because of the majority of the words having potentially negative connotations (conflict and tears), we can lean towards the movie review sentence being predominantly negative.

I parked my truck and decided to try and locate a telephone to see if the Florida Barber College had moved to a new location.     After walking about a block I saw an open shoe store. I walked inside and asked if I could use their telephone book. Unable to find a listing for the Barber College, I picked out the number of a local beauty salon, hoping they might tell me if the barber college was still in business. The number was busy, so I decided to wait and try again in a few minutes. As the salesman and I stood talking the front door opened and a young man about twenty came into the store pushing himself in a wheelchair. \\"I need a new pair of shoes,\\" said the customer. As he turned the corner, there was a blanket across his lap. I was shocked to see that the young man had no legs. \\"A gift for a friend?\\" I asked the boy. \\"No,\\" he replied. They are for me,\\" he continued, with a smile on his face. I just smiled back and watched to see what would happen next. \\"What type of shoe would you like?\\" asked the clerk. \\"How about a pair of cowboy boots?\\" The man pointed to the back wall where three or four pairs of boots were displayed. The salesman, sharply turning, headed off to the backroom.  \\"Isn't this fun?\\" the boy asked me. I moved my hand to let him know that I did not understand his question. \\"When I was a kid, my parents used to buy me a new pair of shoes every year. That was such a wonderful feeling.

Television moved out of my life in 1981, so I never followed the series or any part of it - which means that I'm immune to the nostalgic charm that Moonlighting appears to have for most reviewers.  (Possible spoiler warning)  The pilot of Moonlighting is your basic \\"caveman meets fluffball\\" yarn, where a \\"charming\\" red-blooded he-man manipulates a misguided woman into realizing what she really wants and needs. The premises that the script's \\"wit\\" is based on must have already felt stale around 1950. It also contains some frankly bad writing, as in the scene where Maddie demolishes the furnishings instead of shooting the villain, strictly in order to prove herself the inept female in need of masculine assistance.  I often feel that Susan Faludi overreacts in seeing male chauvinist conspiracy in simple entertainment, but in this particular case I'm all with her - Moonlighting has BACKLASH stamped all over it.  In one sense, however, this DVD is a must for all serious Bruce Willis fans: in addition to the pilot episode, it contains the screen test that landed Willis the job. Both features show to what amazing extent Willis' acting ability developed between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, In Country). Impressive!

The person who wrote the review is a big fan of an actor named Bruce Willis. They think it's really cool to see how much better he got at acting between the time he was in this episode and when he did some other big movies.

Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis.

Malaysian officials have created confusion by issuing contradictory statements on key aspects of the investigation. The majority of the people on board the plane were Chinese, and Beijing has increasingly voiced its displeasure with the search, especially after Malaysia announced over the weekend that evidence suggested the plane had been deliberately flown west into the Indian Ocean, away from its last confirmed location over the South China Sea. \\"The new information means the intensive search in the South China Sea for the whole past week was worthless and would never bear fruit,\\" said a commentary published by China's state-run news agency Xinhua. \\"Even worse, the golden time for saving possible survivors, if any, was generously wasted.\\"  Question: \\"What kind of grades has Malaysia received concerning its handling of the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\\" Answer: \\"Satisfactory\\" Is this answer to the question correct?

Please briefly summarize this news article: George Michael jailed for eight weeks Blood tests showed he had chemicals linked to cannabis in his system. The singer sighed heavily as District Judge Perkins said he would serve four weeks in prison and spend the remainder on licence. Michael was also banned from driving for five years and ordered to pay a £1,250 fine, £100 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. One fan sobbed in the public gallery as he was taken down from the dock by security guards. Michael's guilty plea and remorse allowed District Judge Perkins to reduce the sentence, he said, but not to offer the community sentence requested by the defence. Michael was arrested in Hampstead shortly before 4am on July 4 when two police officers found him apparently unconscious in his grey Range Rover in Rosslyn Hill. When told he had crashed into a shop, he added: \\"No I didn't. I didn't crash into anything.\\" At Hampstead police station he failed a test to find whether he was fit to drive. The musician admitted smoking a \\"small quantity\\" of cannabis about 10pm the previous evening and said he also took the anti-depressant Amitriptyline to help him sleep. He told police he decided to drive between his homes in Highgate and Hampstead to meet a friend and forgot he had taken the sedative. District Judge Perkins said: \\"You drove your motor vehicle about a mile while suffering from a severe impairment as a result of mixing not only a prescription treatment with which you were unfamiliar but also with cannabis. \\"That's a dangerous and unpredictable mix and something which for you is dangerous given your record. \\"It does not appear that you took proper steps to deal with what is clearly an addiction to cannabis. \\"That's a mistake which puts you and, on this occasion, the public at risk.\\" The district judge said he took into account that Michael had checked into a clinic after the crash to seek help for anxiety, depression and insomnia, which had led him to depend on prescription drugs and had noted he was dealing with bereavement issues. \\"I accept entirely that you have shown remorse for the offence, that you are ashamed of it, that you admitted it,\\" he said, but added that \\"with regret\\" a jail term was inevitable because of Michael's previous conviction. Michael's long-term partner Kenny Goss threw his head into his hands in despair at that point. Mukul Chawla QC, mitigating, said Michael personally repaid the cost of the damage to the shop owner and had asked that his \\"profound shame and horror of having repeated the conduct of 2006\\" was made clear to the court. \\"He acknowledges his actions of driving had the effect of causing other road users to be in danger and that stark fact is something about which he is greatly ashamed. \\"The prospect he could have put anyone else in danger is an appalling prospect to him.\\" He said Michael had tried to turn his life around. \\"For the first time in many years he has started writing again. His creativity, so long hampered by his drug dependence, is re-emerging.\\" Mr Chawla said Michael had tried to come off prescription drugs without professional help earlier this year but symptoms returned so he sought medical help and was given Amitriptyline. Michael remained an outpatient at the rehab clinic, he added. The singer, wearing a charcoal suit with a black tie, spoke only to confirm his name and address and to say he would prefer to be addressed by his stage name. The jail sentence is the culmination of a long line of clashes with the law for the singer, who has been open about his use of cannabis and claimed in the past that he was trying to cut down. Michael was banned from driving for two years and sentenced to 100 hours of community service after he was convicted of driving while unfit through drugs after he was found collapsed in his Mercedes in 2006. He was cautioned twice in 2006 for possession of cannabis and cautioned for possession for crack cocaine and cannabis two years later. He was fined for \\"engaging in a lewd act\\" in a California public toilet in 1998. Fans gathered outside the court to get a glimpse of the star, screaming his name and trying to break through a barrier of 12 police officers as he arrived at court this afternoon. One fan passed a good luck card for Michael to Mr Goss. Shelly Williams, 41, from east London, sobbed from the public gallery as Michael was sentenced. \\"I have been a fan for 26 years - that's longer than a marriage. \\"I hope he continues with the process of making himself better.\\" Summary:","output":"Singer George Michael has been jailed for eight weeks after being found unconscious in his car due to the influence of cannabis and a sedative. Blood tests showed chemicals linked to cannabis, and Michael admitted to using the drug as well as taking antidepressant Amitriptyline. The judge cited that mixing the two substances was dangerous and posed a risk to both Michael and the public. Michael was also banned from driving for five years, fined, and ordered to pay costs and a victim surcharge.

He confides to Blixx that he wishes to kill the last two unicorns so that darkness will fall upon the world, allowing him to emerge from his cave where he is shielded from the sunlight that is his enemy.He cannot approach the unicorns, he tells Blixx, because only the pure can find them. Only someone innocent and pure, such as the Princess Lily (Mia Sara), can attract the unicorns.

Porky takes the only available vacancy at one hotel , but will have to share with Daffy Duck , who is a very loud , obnoxious and annoying sort . Daffy introduces his invisible kangaroo friend \`\` Hymie '' , but Porky wo n't believe that . Daffy spends the rest of the night annoying Porky : pestering him with questions , shaking the bed , spilling water from a glass , hogging the blanket and finally literally sending the both of them flying off the bed when Daffy kicks , and startles , Porky with his literally frozen feet . Fed up with his antics , Porky stuffs Daffy in a pillow case and drops him out of the window . As Porky goes back to bed , Daffy returns bandaged , but shakes them off and prepares to get revenge .

Although Daffy is indeed obnoxious, makes messes, and sees things, these are quite vague descriptions that do not accurately describe the experiences Porky has. In specifics, Porky's problems while sharing a room with Daffy stem not just from Daffy's messy and annoying behavior but also his involvements in a number of antics. Daffy introduces his invisible kangaroo friend \\"Hymie\\" which contributes to his disturbance. Also, he pesters Porky with questions, shakes the bed, spills water from a glass, hogs the blanket, and ends up making both of them fly off the bed when he kicks Porky with his literally frozen feet. Moreover, Daffy, seeking revenge after Porky throws him out of the room, tricks a half-asleep Porky into stepping out of a window by making him believe it's a train. Then, when Porky is actually taken away by a train, Daffy acts even more absurdly, bouncing around the room and hoo-hoo-ing wildly.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: The last two stages of aerobic respiration require what?   A: Possible answers: -water. -carbon. -sulfur. -oxygen. Answer:","output":"The last two stages of aerobic respiration require oxygen. Aerobic respiration is a process in which cells produce energy through the oxidation of organic compounds, such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, in the presence of oxygen. This energy-generating process consists of four sequential stages: glycolysis, the preparatory phase, the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. Among these, the final two stages - the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain - specifically require oxygen for their proper functioning. 1. Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle): This is the third stage of aerobic respiration that occurs within the mitochondrial matrix in eukaryotic cells and in the cytoplasm in prokaryotic cells. The primary purpose of the citric acid cycle is to generate high-energy electron carriers, such as NADH (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FADH2 (Flavin adenine dinucleotide), and a small amount of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate). While oxygen is not directly involved in any reaction of the citric acid cycle, it plays a critical role in the continuous regeneration of the oxidized forms of the electron carriers (NAD+ and FAD), which are necessary to maintain the cycle's ongoing processes. In the absence of oxygen, these electron carriers cannot be regenerated, and the citric acid cycle ceases to function effectively. 2. Electron Transport Chain and Oxidative Phosphorylation: This is the final stage of aerobic respiration, which takes place within the inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes and the plasma membrane in prokaryotes. The electron transport chain is a series of complex protein structures responsible for transferring electrons from the high-energy electron carriers, NADH and FADH2, generated in the previous stages, to molecular oxygen. The energy released during this electron transfer process is utilized to pump protons (H+) across the membrane, establishing a proton gradient. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor in this process, and its role is essential for the completion of the electron transport chain. In the oxidative phosphorylation step, the ATP synthase enzyme uses the potential energy from the proton gradient to catalyze the synthesis of ATP from ADP (Adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate. Molecular oxygen is reduced to water during this process. In summary, the last two stages of aerobic respiration, the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain, require oxygen for the regeneration of electron carriers and as the essential final electron acceptor, respectively. Oxygen's critical role in these processes highlights the reason why it is called \\"aerobic respiration.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

On the left side, we can simplify by combining the constants -196 and +49. -196 + 49 = -147 So the simplified equation is: -124*t - 147 = -103*t Step 2: Isolate the variable t by getting all terms containing t on one side of the equation. To do this, we can add 103*t to both sides of the equation to move the -103*t term to the left side. -124*t - 147 + 103*t = -103*t + 103*t This simplifies to: -21*t - 147 = 0 Step 3: Now, isolate the t term further by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation. To do this, we can add 147 to both sides of the equation to move the -147 term to the right side. -21*t - 147 + 147 = 0 + 147 This simplifies to: -21*t = 147 Step 4: Solve for t by dividing both sides of the equation by -21. -21*t / -21 = 147 / -21 t = -7 So the solution to the equation is t = -7."},{"instruction":"Is this product review positive?

At a historic news conference, Mr Castro said if he was given a list of political prisoners, he would \\"release them tonight\\". The White House has said it has given Cuba lists of dissidents in the past. Mr Castro does not view the prisoners as dissidents, US officials said. That disagreement is central to the conflict between US and Cuban officials. More needs to be done to lift the US embargo on trade with Cuba, Mr Castro said, adding that the Guantanamo Bay detention camp must close. Mr Obama, the first serving US president to visit Cuba since 1959, said the trade embargo would be fully lifted. \\"Cuba's destiny will not be decided by the United States or any other nation... The future of Cuba will be decided by Cubans not by anybody else,\\" Mr Obama said. Mr Obama and first lady Michelle Obama were later welcomed at a state dinner, along with some members of US Congress and senior White House staff. The Failde Youth Band entertained the guests, who dined on shrimp mousse, cream soup flavoured with rum, and traditional pork with rice and plantain chips. Waiters passed round Cuban cigars after dinner. Earlier on Monday, Mr Castro defended Cuba's record on human rights and pointed to problems in the US. \\"We defend human rights, in our view civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights are indivisible, inter-dependent and universal,\\" Mr Castro said. Mr Castro is not usually subject to any aggressive questioning from reporters and called the prisoners question \\"not polite\\", later ending the news conference by saying \\"I think this is enough\\". \\"Actually we find it inconceivable that a government does not defend and ensure the right to healthcare, education, social security, food provision and development,\\" he said. Speaking to ABC News after the conference with Mr Castro, Mr Obama did not directly say he would be giving Mr Castro a list of political prisoners. \\"We have given them a lists in the past and they have responded intermittently to our engagement,\\" he said. \\"And this I think is an example of why it was my belief that this would be a more successful mechanism for us to advance the values that we care about than an embargo and silence and no communications.\\" President Obama and his aides hoped that the Cuban President, Raul Castro, would approach the news conference with an open mind. The White House officials also hoped that Mr Castro would be receptive to new ideas and to new ways of doing things. Specifically, the US officials hoped that he'd take questions from reporters. Surprisingly enough, he did, marking a departure from his past. The two men joked around during the question-and-answer period, and they worked out some of their differences. When one of Mr Castro's aides interrupted his boss during the conference, for example, Mr Obama looked annoyed. But he and Mr Castro moved on, talking about the future of Cuba. In a similar way, Mr Obama and his aides hope they can overcome other issues, including difficult ones such as human rights, as they forge a new relationship between the two countries. Mr Obama could not say exactly when the trade embargo would be lifted, but recognised it was necessary. \\"The reason is what we did for 50 years did not serve our interests or the interests of the Cuban people,\\" he said. His administration has done what it can on lifting trade restrictions, he said, but further action will require Congress which is \\"not as productive in an election year\\". He also said further easing of the trade embargo will depend on actions Cuba takes on human rights. Six sticking points to better relations - Guantanamo Bay, human rights and media freedoms are among the unresolved issues Cuba's DIY economy - A new generation of Cuban entrepreneurs are launching private businesses Internet access still restricted in Cuba - Only about 5% of Cubans have web access at home Mr Obama said it is not just Cuba that the US has \\"deep disagreements\\" about human rights with - it also has disagreements with China and Vietnam. \\"I believe if I engage frankly, clearly, stating our beliefs but I can't force change on any country -  it ultimately has to come from within - that is a more useful strategy,\\"  he said. \\"I have faith in people\\". Reporters described the press conference as \\"tense\\" and \\"remarkable\\". Karla Olivares, an independent journalist from Cuba, told the BBC that Mr Castro \\"talked more than usual\\" and the claim that Cuba does not have any political prisoners was \\"complicated\\".

Google hopes the centre will be part of a larger effort to improve Internet access in Cuba.

Though no agreed boundary exists, a common conception includes the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Broader conceptions reach north into Alaska and Yukon, south into far northern California and east to the Continental Divide, thus including Idaho, Western Montana, and western Wyoming. Narrower conceptions may be limited to the northwestern US or to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains. The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region's history, geography, society, and other factors.  - In geography, a confluence is the meeting of two or more bodies of water. Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River.  - Portland is a seaport and the largest city in the U.S. state of Oregon and the seat of Multnomah County.

Context: In 1867, the university opened the first private nonsectarian law school west of the Mississippi River. By 1882, Washington University had expanded to numerous departments, which were housed in various buildings across St. Louis. Medical classes were first held at Washington University in 1891 after the St. Louis Medical College decided to affiliate with the University, establishing the School of Medicine. During the 1890s, Robert Sommers Brookings, the president of the Board of Trustees, undertook the tasks of reorganizing the university's finances, putting them onto a sound foundation, and buying land for a new campus.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What song has mid-tempo riffing, followed by a bass solo at half-tempo?  \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" was inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos created by famed horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, with notable direct references to The Shadow Over Innsmouth and to Cthulhu himself, who is the subject matter of the song's chorus.  It is considered the heaviest track on the album, with the main riff emulating a beast dragging itself into the sea. The Black Sabbath-influenced guitars are downtuned, creating slow and moody ambiance. \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" was based on Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and conveys the thoughts of a patient unjustly caged in a mental institution. The song opens with a section of clean single strings and harmonics. The clean, arpeggiated main riff is played in alternating 44 and 64 time signatures. The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale. This structure follows a pattern of power ballads Metallica set with \\"Fade to Black\\" on Ride the Lightning and would revisit with \\"One\\" on ...And Justice for All.\\"Disposable Heroes\\" is an anti-war song about a young soldier whose fate is controlled by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, it is one of the most intense tracks on the record. The guitar passage at the end of each verse was Hammett's imitation of the sort of music he found in war films. The syncopated riffing of \\"Leper Messiah\\" challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told. The 136 beats per minute mid-tempo riffing of the verses culminates in a descending chromatic riff in the chorus; it increases to a galloping 184 beats per minute for the middle section that climaxes in a distorted scream of \\"Lie!\\". The title derives from the lyrics to the David Bowie song \\"Ziggy Stardust\\". \\"Orion\\" is a multipart instrumental highlighting Burton's bass playing. It opens with...

Q:The answer to the question: What is the name of the band that started a tour in West Germany? is inside the article: By 1966, the Beatles had grown weary of live performance. In John Lennon's opinion, they could \\"send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\\" In June that year, two days after finishing the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in West Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\\" The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary. The publication in the US of Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales, relative to the group's record attendances in 1965, and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup.

A 16-year-old North Carolina girl who disappeared while visiting family in Baltimore continues to be the object of an intense search by authorities, who now say they fear she was abducted or harmed. \\"We are enormously concerned,\\" Baltimore police spokesman Anthony J. Guglielmi said Friday. \\"Every day that passes we get more and more freaked out.\\" Phylicia Barnes, a Charlotte, North Carolina, resident who was in Baltimore to visit her college-age half-sister, was last seen December 28, after saying she was going out to get something to eat and maybe a haircut, Guglielmi said. As recently as Tuesday, police said they had no evidence that foul play was involved in her disappearance. But now they say she has not made contact with friends or family, and hasn't turned on her cell phone, used an ATM or updated her social media sites since she disappeared. The FBI did a profile on the girl and found no reason she would run away, Guglielmi said. She is a good student with no emotional disturbances in her life, he said. \\"The fact set of this case is different than anything else we've seen,\\" he said. More than 100 Baltimore police, Maryland State Police troopers and FBI agents have been working around the clock to find out what happened to Barnes, Guglielmi said. Police have questioned a dozen people believed to have had contact with her in the hours before she disappeared, and have searched the homes and cars of some of those people, he said. They also have collected 40 hours of video from surveillance cameras at nearby businesses and apartment buildings, but neither those videos nor searches conducted in two locations have helped give investigators any leads, Guglielmi said. On Thursday, they turned to posting billboards along I-95 in hope of gathering information about the girl's fate. \\"What's going to break this thing wide open is that somebody, whether it's (in) Kansas or Canada, is going to say, wait a minute, I just saw her in a diner,\\" Guglielmi said Friday. \\"That's in the best case.\\" Although Guglielmi said there was no evidence of illegal drug use at the apartment, the girl's mother, Janice Sallis, said she has been told the girl may have been allowed to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana at her half-sister's apartment, according to CNN and CNN affiliate WSOC. Sallis said she had been told up to 20 men had come and gone while her daughter was there. \\"I pray to God that my daughter is fine and she'll be found safe,\\" Barnes' father, Russell Barnes, told CNN affiliate WBAL. \\"I hope people keep praying as high as they can and understand that this shouldn't happen to any child anywhere in this country.\\" Anyone with information on Barnes' disappearance can call 855-223-0033.

The game was the eleventh consecutive primetime game between the two and the sixth in Green Bay, with the Bears winning two of the last three. Entering week seven, the Bears led the all-time series 93-91-6. In the teams' last meetings since the turn of the decade, the Bears had lost all but three games, including the most recent game in 2015, a 17-13 victory in Green Bay. The Bears were struggling to score in 2016, averaging a league-worst 16.8 points per game. As such, Jeff Joniak wrote the Bears needed to score touchdowns, especially considering their struggles in the red zone (on 19 trips to the region, the Bears scored only nine times). Outside of the red zone, the Bears scored only 10 points; in comparison, the NFL average was 37. Chicago's rushing attack faced a Green Bay defense that allowed only eight runs of at least ten yards and 3.4 yards on first down, the third-lowest in the league. On defense, the Bears faced Aaron Rodgers; while the Packers offense was only 26th in yardage and at -3 in turnover ratio, the unit led the league in third down completion percentage. Rodgers also excelled in the first quarter of games, where he had thrown four touchdown passes, good for second in the league, and a 106 passer rating. However, the Packers struggled on drives starting within their own 20-yard line, failing to score on 14 such drives, the only team unable to do so. Joniak also wrote the team needed a \\"spark\\"; defeating the Packers at Lambeau for the second straight season would \\"do wonders for a young team trying to find its way.\\" After the Bears punted on the opening drive, the Packers took the lead first with Mason Crosby's 32-yard field goal. The Bears were forced to punt again on their next series and the Packers reached as far as the Bears' one-yard line before they were stopped on fourth down. On Chicago's resulting drive, Brian Hoyer was hit by Clay Matthews and Julius Peppers while throwing a pass, breaking his left arm. With Jay Cutler also inactive, third-string quarterback Matt Barkley took over for the next possession. With Barkley, the Bears were able to score points via Connor Barth's 39-yard field goal, which the Packers responded with Crosby's 40-yard kick. On Green Bay's first drive of the second half, Leonard Floyd strip-sacked Rodgers, recovering the fumble in the endzone to give the Bears the 10-6 lead. The score marked the Bears' first defensive touchdown since 2014. Rodgers overcame the play by throwing a five-yard touchdown pass to Davante Adams, followed by two more touchdown passes to Adams and Randall Cobb of four and two yards, respectively (though Crosby missed an extra point). Down 26-10, the Bears' next two series ended with interceptions, Barkley being intercepted by Blake Martinez and Nick Perry. The 1-6 start marked the first start with such a record since 2000.

Movie plot title: The Black Scorpion Movie plot: An earthquake strikes Mexico, resulting in the overnight birth of a new volcano. Sent to study this phenomenon are geologists Dr. Hank Scott and Dr. Arturo Ramos. En route to the village of San Lorenzo, the two men witness a destroyed house and police car. They find a dead policeman nearby, as well as an abandoned infant. They take the infant to San Lorenzo and give it to friends of the child's now missing parents; they are welcomed by the village's priest, Father Delgado.

The villagers believe the culprit to be a demon bull and have been pestering Delgado for divine assistance. Undaunted, Hank and Arturo begin their geological survey as members of the Mexican army, led by Major Cosio, arrive in San Lorenzo to begin disaster relief efforts. Hank meets and falls in love with local rancher Teresa Alvarez and makes friends with a young boy named Juanito. The volcano erupts again and the true culprits behind the disappearances and deaths are revealed as giant prehistoric scorpions. After killing a staff of telephone repairmen, the scorpions turn their attention to San Lorenzo itself, with the guns of Major Cosio's troops having no effect on them. The next morning, the scorpions have returned to their underground lair (which, in addition to the scorpions, is home to giant worms and spiders), leaving the authorities to seek the help of renowned entomologist Dr. Velasco. It is up to him, Hank, and Arturo to figure out a way to either destroy the scorpions or seal off the entrance to their cavern home, before more innocent lives are lost. Despite collapsing the cave entrance, the giant scorpions make it to the surface and destroy a train, killing some passengers before fighting amongst themselves. In the end, one scorpion, the largest of the group and presumably the alpha scorpion, kills all of the smaller ones, making it the last scorpion alive,...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: How can you decorate a cupcake without frosting? How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"Decorating a cupcake without frosting can be a fun and creative experience. There are many alternative ways to make a cupcake look aesthetically pleasing and taste delicious without the traditional frosting. Here are ten ideas for how to accomplish this goal: 1. Powdered sugar: Sprinkle a light dusting of powdered sugar over the cupcake. You can use a small sieve or a powdered sugar shaker to achieve an even coating. To add a touch of elegance, place a stencil or paper cutout over the cupcake before sprinkling the powdered sugar, and then carefully remove it, leaving a beautiful design behind. 2. Glazes and drizzles: Replace frosting with a simple glaze or drizzle, such as a chocolate ganache, caramel, or a fruit-based glaze like strawberry or lemon. Pour or drizzle your choice of glaze over the cupcake for an attractive, glossy finish. 3. Nut or seed sprinkles: Finely chop nuts like almonds, pistachios, or pecans, and sprinkle them over your cupcake for a crunchy texture and added flavor. Alternatively, you can use seeds like chia, sunflower, or sesame seeds as a topping. 4. Edible flowers: Choose organic, pesticide-free edible flowers, like roses, violets, or pansies, and use them as a colorful and elegant decoration for your cupcake. Ensure to use only edible flowers and avoid any that may cause an allergic reaction. 5. Fruit toppings: Fresh fruit adds a burst of flavor and visual appeal. You can use a single fruit, like a raspberry, blueberry, or strawberry, or create a mixture of colorful fruit pieces like kiwi, orange, and mango. 6. Chocolate shavings or curls: Use a vegetable peeler to shave or curl chocolate from a chocolate bar or block, and then sprinkle them atop the cupcakes for a luxurious touch. Choose from dark, milk, or white chocolate to complement your cupcake flavor. 7. Cookie crumbs or crushed candies: Crush cookies like graham crackers, Oreo, Amaretti, or Biscoff and sprinkle them over your cupcake for an added texture. You can also crush candies such as peppermint, toffee, or chocolate-covered nuts for a fun and flavorful decoration. 8. Coconut flakes: Toasted or untoasted coconut flakes make for a beautiful and tasty topping. You can use shredded coconut or larger flaked coconut to add different textures, and you can even toss the coconut in food coloring for a pop of color. 9. Spices or zest: Add a dash of cinnamon, cocoa powder, or nutmeg to your cupcake for a simple and flavorful decoration. In addition, citrus zests like lemon, orange, or lime can lend a fresh, fragrant touch. 10. Miniature versions of your cupcake's main ingredient: If you have a standout ingredient in your cupcake, like chocolate chips, maraschino cherries, or raisins, place a miniature version on top as a finishing touch. These ideas will help you accomplish your goal of decorating your cupcake without using frosting. You can also mix and match multiple elements from the list for a unique and more intricate cupcake design. Furthermore, always consider the cupcake's flavor when selecting your decorations, as this will help ensure a cohesive and delicious final product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Graduel Christopher Darin Carter (born November 25, 1965) is a former American football player in the National Football League. He was a wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles (1987-89), the Minnesota Vikings (1990-2001) and the Miami Dolphins (2002). After starting for the Ohio State University Buckeyes, Carter was drafted by the Eagles in the fourth round of the 1987 NFL supplemental draft. While in Philadelphia, head coach Buddy Ryan helped to coin one of ESPN's Chris Berman's famous quotes about Carter: \\"All he does is catch touchdowns.\\" Context: Carter was heavily recruited out of high school for both basketball and football. He accepted the offer from Ohio State head coach Earle Bruce. Carter became a consensus All-America selection after his junior season, Ohio State's first All American at wide receiver.  Carter had intended to play both football and basketball at Ohio State, but decided to focus on football after making an immediate impact his freshman year. That year, he set a Rose Bowl record with nine receptions for 172 yards.  Carter was known for great hands, running precise routes, and for acrobatic leaps. He had remarkable body control and footwork when making catches near the sidelines. At the Citrus Bowl at the end of the 1985 season, Carter caught a ball that quarterback Jim Karsatos was intending to throw away. Karsatos has claimed that catch by Carter was the greatest in the history of college football: \\"When I finally saw it on film, he was tiptoeing the sidelines and he jumped up and caught the ball left-handed by the point of the football at least a yard out of bounds. Then he somehow levitated back in bounds to get both his feet in bounds. I swear to this day he actually levitated to get back in bounds. When I saw it on film, it just blew me away.\\"  Prior to Carter's senior season, he secretly signed with notorious sports agent Norby Walters. When the contract was discovered, Carter was ruled ineligible. The absence of Carter in the 1987 offense contributed to a disappointing 6-4-1 season and the firing of Coach Bruce. Missing this season also cost him a chance at evening his personal record against Michigan; Carter finished 1-2, his lone taste of victory in the series being his freshman year.  Despite losing his senior year, Carter left Ohio State holding the school record for receptions (168). In 2000, he was selected as a member of the Ohio State Football All-Century Team. In 2003, he was inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame. Question: Where did Carter attend college?. Whats the answer?","output":"Carter attended college at Ohio State University.

Information:  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - Antonio Vagnozzi is an amateur Italian astronomer . He is a prolific discoverer of asteroids .  - Asteroids are minor planets, especially those of the inner Solar System. The larger ones have also been called planetoids. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not show the disc of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active comet. As minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered and found to have volatile-based surfaces that resemble those of comets, they were often distinguished from asteroids of the asteroid belt. In this article, the term \\"asteroid\\" refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System including those co-orbital with Jupiter.  - A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to evolve gasses, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.  - An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects  either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole.  - Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better.

Macreedy (Spencer Tracy) gets off a passenger train at the isolated desert hamlet of Black Rock. It is the first time in four years that the train has stopped there. Macreedy is looking for a man named Komoko, but the few residents are inexplicably hostile. The young hotel desk clerk, Pete Wirth (John Ericson), claims he has no vacant rooms. Macreedy is threatened by Hector David (Lee Marvin). Later, Reno Smith (Robert Ryan) informs Macreedy that Komoko, a Japanese-American, was interned during World War II. Certain that something is wrong, Macreedy sees the local sheriff, Tim Horn (Dean Jagger), but the alcoholic lawman is clearly afraid of Smith and is impotent to help. The veterinarian and undertaker, Doc Velie (Walter Brennan), advises Macreedy to leave town immediately, but also lets slip that Komoko is dead. Pete's sister, Liz (Anne Francis), rents Macreedy a Jeep. He drives to nearby Adobe Flat, where he finds a homestead burned to the ground and wildflowers. On the way back, Coley Trimble (Ernest Borgnine) tries to run him off the road. When Smith asks, Macreedy reveals he lost his left arm fighting in Italy. Macreedy says the wildflowers at the Komoko place lead him to suspect that a body is buried there. Smith reveals that he is virulently anti-Japanese; he tried to enlist in the Marines the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, but failed the physical. Macreedy tries to telephone the state police, but Pete refuses to put the call through. Doc Velie admits that something terrible happened four years ago and that Smith has everyone too terrified to speak up. Velie offers Macreedy his hearse to leave town. Hector rips out the distributor cap and spark plug wires. Macreedy goes to Hastings' (Russell Collins) telegraph office and writes a telegram addressed to the state police. At the town diner, Trimble picks a fight with Macreedy, but Macreedy uses martial arts to beat him up. Macreedy tells Smith that he knows Smith killed Komoko and that he was too cowardly to do it...

Review title: Dumb CD Product review: This CD has NOTHING to do with communism. The music doesn't even sound very good. None of the lyrics even come close to having a communist message. I gave it 2 stars because some of the techno beats were relatively ok. In my opinion, techno/electronica/house is the perfect music for a communist society... it's modern, progressive, intense, and a lot of fun, but it's not subversive or nasty like heavy metal or rap. Music should fulfill people's 'fun' need without making them want to hurt someone.Mike (mlferrini@sbcglobal.net) Answer:","output":"The following review would most likely decrease the chances of me buying the product for several reasons.  1. The reviewer states that the CD has nothing to do with communism, which may indicate that the product description or marketing for the CD was misleading. If I were specifically looking for music related to or inspired by communism, this review would immediately make me question the product's relevance to my interests. 2. The music itself is described as not sounding very good, which may indicate that the quality of the musical compositions is poor. 3. Despite the reviewer giving the CD 2 stars because of some enjoyable techno beats, they also express dissatisfaction with the absence of a communist message in the lyrics. This implies that the reviewer expected such a theme and was disappointed by not finding it in the music. If I were specifically looking for music with a communist message, this review would significantly decrease my chances of buying the product. 4. It is worth noting that the reviewer provides their email address, giving an impression of authenticity. However, this review is subjective, and my own taste in music might differ from the reviewer's.

Please answer the following question: I have always been a “handyman” involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that.

They desire to see as much of Latin America as they can, more than 14,000 kilometres (8,700Â mi) in just four and a half months, while Granado's purpose is also to court as many women as will fall for his pick-up lines.

Their planned route is ambitious, bringing them north across the Andes, along the coast of Chile, through the Atacama Desert and into the Peruvian Amazon in order to reach Venezuela just in time for Granado's 30th birthday on 2 April. However, due to La Poderosa's breakdown, they are forced to travel at a much slower pace, and don't make it to Caracas until July.

No experience is ever wasted' If I were a Trekkie, as opposed to someone who enjoyed Star Trek but was never a true devotee, I would surely have died and gone to heaven early on in my lunch with Patrick Stewart. Or, as a Trekkie might put it, I would have beamed up to the pleasure planet Risa, 90 light years from the Sol system, where the weather is always perfect, the beaches always immaculate, and love forever free. Our lunch ascends to Star Trek nirvana when we are barely into the 15th minute of our almost two-hour conversation. We are musing about the surprising linguistic affinities between Treknobabble and Shakespearean iambic pentameter – both of which Stewart is fluent in, having spent sizeable chunks of his five decades in acting immersed in them. \\"There are lots of similarities,\\" he says. Then, with a mischievous glint in his eye, Stewart leans his famously bald pate towards me, over our dishes of Cobb salad, and says: \\"Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise, its continuing mission to seek out new life and new civilisations. To boldly go where no one has gone before.\\" \\"You see! It has a poetic flow!\\" he exclaims, before adding quickly: \\"I swear to you, I haven't said those words for years and years and years. I wasn't sure I'd remember them.\\" (I don't have the heart to tell him that he has actually got it slightly wrong and forgotten an important clause of Star Trek mission – \\"to explore strange new worlds\\".) How to explain Stewart's rare slip back into the voice of the Starfleet captain? Perhaps he's relaxed because he's on home turf. We meet in one of the nicer restaurants in Brooklyn, close to his New York home. When I turn up early I am ushered to \\"Mr Stewart's regular table\\", located discreetly at the back. Stewart sweeps in precisely at the allotted hour, dressed all in black and disguised only by a working man's flat cap. He shakes my hand firmly and looks me straight in the eye. Not for the only time in our encounter he makes me think of a military officer.The other possible explanation for Stewart's revival of Picard in front of an audience of one is that he seems to be in right royal good spirits. And why wouldn't he be? As he approaches his 74th birthday, he is firing on all cylinders. Far from showing any signs of engine fatigue, for the lad from Mirfield, West Yorkshire, life and work just seem to get better and better. In September he married his third wife, singer-songwriter Sunny Ozell, and they live in a converted carriage house in the heart of Park Slope, one of Brooklyn's most fashionable neighbourhoods. And he's just come off a critically acclaimed double run on Broadway of No Man's Land and Waiting for Godot with his bestie Ian McKellen, who officiated at their wedding. The two actors are reunited this month in the new X-Men movie, Days of Future Past; and Stewart also appears in an indie film called Match which premiered at the Tribeca film festival. If that's not enough, just as we're finishing up our salads, the news breaks that he is to star in a 20-episode series of half-hour TV comedies conceived by Family Guy's Seth MacFarlane. Did I omit to say that in the past 18 months he's erupted into a global Twitter phenomenon, with 1.2m followers? (A halloween Twitpic of him dressed as a red lobster lying in the bath was retweeted 40,000 times.) With all that to go at, it's hard to know where to begin. Might as well launch straight in with the unlikely parallels between Star Trek, the vehicle that propelled him to fame, and his ongoing love affair with Shakespeare. A few weeks into shooting Star Trek: Next Generation Stewart had a eureka moment. He was sitting in the captain's chair in the bridge of the starship Enterprise when he suddenly saw himself back in his old milieu: \\"I realised that the set actually represented very much an Elizabethan stage, with the main acting area in the centre front, a raised area at the back, two vomitoria entrances low down. It was classic.\\" At 47, Stewart already had an accomplished career behind him with the Royal Shakespeare Company, but was unknown in Hollywood when one of the Star Trek producers saw him at a Shakespeare workshop at UCLA. \\"I'd never seen myself especially as a film or television actor, let alone sci-fi,\\" says Stewart. \\"I went to LA to do it after I was assured the six-year contract I signed would never be called upon to be met; I was convinced we wouldn't even make it through the first season.\\" Seven seasons, 178 episodes, four feature films and plenty of Spandex later, Stewart emerged, to his own astonishment, as a Hollywood superstar. The exceptional quality about Stewart's work is that he has managed to keep his profile high in the film firmament while at the same time growing and deepening a distinguished theatrical career. Few other actors come to mind who have pulled off such a juggling act. Yes, the Ethan Hawkes and Denzel Washingtons may dabble with Broadway, but Patrick Stewart is one of a rare breed that can neither be called a film star or a stage actor – because he is both. I wonder aloud whether it's more than coincidental, that perhaps there's something to the classical British thespian training that he enjoyed that produces actors peculiarly equipped to excel across stage and screen. Stewart eagerly concurs. \\"I absolutely believe that's what it is. It's a feeling for language, a feeling for drama that is something a little more than totally naturalistic. I use this word a lot: 'heightened'.\\" He expresses his gratitude to the retired Old Vic actor who trained him between the ages of 12 and 17, and to Peter Hall, John Barton and Trevor Nunn at whose feet he sat when he joined the RSC, in awe at \\"their immense knowledge and experience of Shakespearean language. I never knew you could speak Shakespeare in a way that was totally spontaneous and poetic at the same time.\\" He likens himself to a Leeds United football player in Don Revie's day. \\"He had trained those buggers so intensely throughout the week that at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon those 11 players would run on to the pitch totally liberated, free to do what they wanted to do, having done the work.\\" As further evidence that none of this is coincidental, the other great straddler between theatre and franchise films is none other than Stewart's best friend, Ian McKellen. That the two knighted British actors have forged a deep friendship is abundantly clear from Stewart's effervescent Twitter feed. To mark their Broadway double-act last autumn they instigated the Twitter equivalent of a riot, taking selfies in iconic NYC places – the top of the Empire State Building, on the boardwalk in Coney Island – wearing Godot-esque bowler hats and looking more than a little deranged. What booms out of the photos is how much fun they are having in each other's company. The bromance returns with X-Men: Days of Future Past. This time, the two thespian lions are allies both on and off the camera. In previous X-Men films, Stewart's character, Professor Charles Xavier, has been at loggerheads with McKellen's Magneto. The two characters are both mutants, but they occupy opposing political extremes. Xavier is the moderate negotiator who prefers talk over battle; Magneto is a fighter and revolutionary. But in Days of Future Past the two are thrown on to the same side by the common threat of enemy machines. \\"When the film begins we are in a situation where Xavier has had to decide that force is the only way forward,\\" Stewart says. \\"He is pushed into Magneto's camp and they become collaborators. We are dealing with machines and not human beings, so argument, persuasion, is no longer an option.\\" We are at a disadvantage to dig much deeper with X-Men, given that the 11th-hour final production work on the film means neither of us has yet seen it. But we can stick with the theme of persuasion versus force as it also runs through Stewart's second new film this spring, Match – an intimate, touching portrait set in Manhattan of a gay, dope-smoking, knitting, TV soap-watching and rather lonely classical ballet teacher called Tobi, who has an encounter with a married couple, strangers who as the narrative unfolds require him to confront the choices of his past. Stewart is stupendous, displaying a breathtaking range of emotional shades and dramatic tones. He is funny one minute, enraged the next, then cathartic and profoundly moving. I ask him how he managed to capture so convincingly the historic conflicts Tobi wrestles with – such as the character's decision to devote his life to career and as a result forego having a child. \\"For many years I was making choices like that every day,\\" he says, referring to his relationship with his children, Daniel and Sophia, by his first wife Sheila Falconer. \\"As my responsibilities in the theatre grew, I was gone from nine in the morning until midnight. I was an absentee father, largely, and there was a price to be paid for that down the road.\\" He actively channelled such emotional conflicts into conjuring up Tobi. \\"Actors, we have this thing called a 'sense memory' which we draw on for particularly emotional moments. We have these things stored away in a vault and we can draw them out when we need to.\\" Like a filing cabinet of emotions, I suggest. \\"That's right. That was part of my training at Bristol Old Vic theatre school. We were taught how to store emotions. It means no experience is ever wasted.\\" If the regret of being an absentee dad has provided him with a valuable emotional file or two, then his relationship with his own father must have filled the sense memory equivalent of the NSA's mass surveillance database in Utah. Alfred Stewart, a regimental sergeant major in the British army, was a troubled soul who, after retiring from the armed forces, suffered post traumatic stress disorder. At weekends it came bursting out in drunken assaults on his wife, Gladys. The sense memory is all too viscerally visible here. At one of the pivotal moments in Match, Tobi places himself physically between the married strangers, played by Matthew Lillard and Carla Gugino, acting as a human shield. \\"Don't take another step! Not another step!\\" Tobi bellows at the husband, who is poised to strike his wife. It's an astonishing moment. Stewart unleashes himself with such explosive charge that the whole cinema feels as though it is quaking. I remind Stewart of that point in the film, and of the haunting piece he wrote for the Guardian in 2009 in which he describes his father's domestic violence through his then child's eyes. \\"I knew exactly when the shouting was done and a hand was about to be raised – I also knew exactly when to insert a small body between the fist and her face, a skill no child should ever learn.\\" It's the same incident, I remark. He pauses for a second, and then says only this: \\"You reach a choice moment where you say, 'That's enough. I'm not going to be a spectator in this any more.'\\" The paradox about Stewart's fraught relationship with his father, who used to mock his son's fondness for theatre remorselessly, is that he's come to appreciate over the years how much he is in his father's debt in terms of his acting career. Take Picard and Xavier. Both of them stand for non-violence and peace and, as such, are arguably polar opposites to Alfred. But both of them are leaders, commanders –very much in Alfred's military mould. \\"It's a source of sadness to me that my father never lived to see me do Star Trek,\\" he says. \\"Because he would have approved of what I was doing and how I used the role. I mean, books have been written about Picard's command style. It's taught in the military academy!\\" It sounds like there will be more than a sprinkling of Alfred Stewart in Patrick's new adventure, Blunt Talk – the upcoming Seth MacFarlane comedy series that will be broadcast on Starz next year. Stewart will play Walter Blunt, a working-class lad from the north of England with a military background and a career in TV news who gets shipped off to LA to front a cable news programme called Blunt Talk. \\"You are going to think right away about Piers Morgan, but you mustn't!\\" Stewart says emphatically. \\"When we meet Blunt his show is no longer doing well, the numbers are dreadful and his career is in crisis.\\" OK, now I am thinking Piers Morgan. Can't help it. \\"He just keeps falling into these tailspins. One after another. It's completely realistic and truthful. This is not a gag show, it's not one-liners. It's single camera on film – we'll be making a half-hour movie every six days.\\" With all that ahead, I say, he's not coming home to the UK any time soon. Stewart responds that he has a lovely house in Britain that he adores, and that he intends to spend as much time as possible in the mother country. But on this point he is resolute: \\"I am a resident of the United States.\\" He has even, he says, started for the first time thinking seriously about taking up American citizenship. It's partly the recent marriage to Ozell and how embraced he feels by her family. And it's partly a sense of political frustration at not having a vote in America. \\"It's long overdue,\\" he says. \\"There's only so much I can do, only so much I can comment on.\\" Before we polish off the salads, I ask Stewart whether he ever fears, in those dark hours, that all the cornucopia, the largesse, the riches of his life that seem to just keep on giving will one day dry up. \\"I don't have those kind of dark hours, except where health is concerned,\\" he says. \\"I've had two major scares in the past 10 years – one with heart, one with cancer – both of them taken care of.\\" We both, in unison, start knocking on wood. And then, as the waiter clears away our plates, Patrick Stewart launches into one final tale, this one about McKellen and how, as they waited for the curtain to go up for No Man's Land, they would moan and moan about their ailments. \\"Nobody would believe it. Here were Magneto and Charles Xavier, these power-houses, griping about their aches and pains.\\" He recalls one particular performance when Sir Ian and Sir Patrick, giants of the English stage, were sitting behind the curtain just before the start. \\"Ian was telling me about his experience with catheters. The call came: \\"We're going up!\\" The curtain rose, the lights went on, and we were both chuckling about catheters. That made for a slightly different show.\\" X-Men: Days of Future Past is released on 22 May What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article is an interview with actor Patrick Stewart, who discusses his acting career, experiences in roles such as Star Trek's Captain Picard, and his relationships with other actors like Ian McKellen.

(A). yes;  (B). no; Does \\"In 1807, Thomas Young was possibly the first to use the term \\"energy\\" instead of vis viva, in its modern sense.\\" correctly answer the question of When was the law of conservation of energy first postulated?","output":"No, the statement \\"In 1807, Thomas Young was possibly the first to use the term 'energy' instead of vis viva, in its modern sense\\" does not correctly answer the question of when the law of conservation of energy was first postulated. The statement only addresses the introduction of the term \\"energy\\" in its modern sense by Thomas Young. The law of conservation of energy, also known as the first law of thermodynamics, states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. To fully address this question, we need to discuss the various figures, concepts, and historical events that led to the development and understanding of the law of conservation of energy. The evolution of this law can be traced back to the works of several scientists and thinkers through history. 1. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716): Leibniz was a German mathematician and philosopher who introduced the concept of vis viva, or living force, arguing that the true measure of the mechanical force of a system is the product of its mass and the square of its velocity (mv^2). This concept laid the groundwork for the understanding of kinetic energy. 2. Émilie du Châtelet (1706-1749): A French mathematician and physicist, du Châtelet recognized that the concept of vis viva also applied to the conservation of energy in a mechanical system. She translated Newton's Principia Mathematica and expanded on Leibniz's work, further establishing the connection between vis viva and energy conservation. 3. Julius Robert von Mayer (1814-1878): A German physician and physicist, Mayer proposed the idea that heat and mechanical work are interconvertible forms of energy. In 1842, he published a paper stating that \\"Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, but merely changed from one form to another.\\" This statement can be considered the first clear articulation of the law of conservation of energy. 4. James Prescott Joule (1818-1889) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894): Joule, a British physicist, and Helmholtz, a German physicist, conducted independent experiments and developed mathematical descriptions of the energy conservation principle. Joule demonstrated the mechanical equivalent of heat through his famous \\"Joule's apparatus\\" experiment, while Helmholtz's work focused on the broader concept of energy conservation in various physical systems. 5. William Thomson (1824-1907), later known as Lord Kelvin: A British physicist who helped unify the different concepts of energy conservation into a coherent theory. Thomson contributed significantly to establishing thermodynamics and its laws, including his formulation of the second law of thermodynamics. Considering these historical milestones and contributions, the law of conservation of energy was developed and refined over several centuries through the work of many individuals. It does not have a specific date of postulation but evolved through continuous research and progress in the scientific community. However, if one needs to credit a specific scientist for stating the principle, Julius Robert von Mayer's work in 1842 stating that \\"Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, but merely changed from one form to another\\" could be considered the first clear articulation of the law of conservation of energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There are an average of 7,500 reported incidents a year, including 50 assaults involving weapons, a BBC Wales investigation shows. At the same time, prosecutions and other sanctions have reached their highest rate. There has been a Welsh Government drive to cut abuse, and it says the rise is due to more incidents being reported. Last year 300 incidents resulted in prosecution or other action. The Welsh Government said that improved safety measures are in place to protect staff and it is making progress. Data shows that much of the abuse is carried out by patients with mental health problems like dementia and is unintentional. The figures were obtained by BBC Wales using the Freedom of Information Act and show that the reported violence has remained fairly static over six years despite targeted measures to tackle the problem. However, it was down this year, from 8,343 last year to 7,558. More than 9,000 incidents in the past four years resulted in injury to staff and led to thousands of days of work lost. The most serious assaults included more than 80 sexual assaults of staff at hospitals across Wales. A further 50 involved weapons. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board even had figures showing that since 2007, 258 members of staff had suffered abuse - either verbal or physical - at the hands of their co-workers. They said that around 60 were reported each year with most relating to claims of verbal abuse or perceived disruptive behaviour. A spokesman said: \\"While occasional disagreements will inevitably occur between colleagues, especially working in an environment that at times can be pressured and stressful, the fact that the number of incidents that are reported formally is so low shows that most of these are resolved at a local level.\\" Neil Evans, 40, is an A&E nurse at Bridgend's Princess of Wales Hospital. He says violence and aggression is a fact of life for most staff. \\"We do have a zero tolerance policy and there is a lot of support at our hospital. \\"The police do intervene but it would be good to have more feedback on how these people are being dealt with and if they are being prosecuted.\\" He says he has been threatened and almost punched a few times and colleagues do experience regular threats from drunken patients. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) applauded the work being done but questioned why some health boards are still referring so few cases to the police. Tina Donnelly, director of the RCN in Wales, said: \\"It is pleasing to see an increase in the number of prosecutions and the number of reported cases has increased due to a zero tolerance policy. \\"Our anecdotal evidence is that nurses in Wales are delighted things are changing as four years ago eight out of 10 reported being a victim of violence,\\" she added. In 2009 a cross-party group of AMs said aggression against NHS workers in Wales had been tackled with a \\"lack of urgency\\". CCTV was installed at four hospital A&E departments and in five ambulances, while thousands of lone workers were given panic buttons. Last December then Health Minister Edwina Hart launched a new drive with the NHS, the police, and the Crown Prosecution Service. But Dr Charles Allanby, a Cardiff GP who was been a victim of violence and once foiled a knife-wielding patient in his surgery, said more needs to be done to tackle the root cause - alcohol. He told BBC Wales: \\"Attacks on doctors or nurses are indefensible. \\"One does have to accept it's something you come across and is sometimes the result of people having mental health problems. \\"In A&E departments there is a clear association with alcohol and it is directly to do with the longer licensing hours. \\"People should be lobbying their councillors and local MPs to see this problem tackled.\\" His view was shared by the Welsh Ambulance Service, which saw attacks rise to 257 in 2010. A spokesman said the causes of violence are \\"societal\\". \\"Incidents experienced by ambulance crews are often associated with excessive alcohol consumption by the assailants. \\"We uphold a zero tolerance policy against this form of abuse and do our utmost to report this behaviour to the police to pursue prosecution against offenders.\\" The Welsh Government said that when the programme started in 2008, prosecutions were in single figures. In 2010-11 there were 126 successful prosecutions with some leading to custodial sentences. In addition, there were 143 other sanctions, such as fixed penalties and anti-social behaviour orders. A spokesperson said: \\"Case management is a key component of the Welsh Government's approach to protecting staff against violence and aggression, while supporting those who have been affected by it. \\"There is still much to do, but the early indicators are that, working together, we are making progress. \\"Pressure to reduce the risks of violence and aggression towards NHS staff will continue.\\" Reassurance Encouraging staff to report incidents is a key priority, the spokesperson said. In future hospitals in Wales are to try to reduce the levels of crime in their A&E departments through the use of better design. Cwm Taf Health Board said: \\"Whilst no prosecutions have been made, there has been a noticeable rise in reassurance and a reduction in the fear of crime in all staff groups.\\" It said there have been 75 incidents in which the police were involved and in the period April 2010 to March 2011 there were 13 Asbo referrals while there are two incidents currently under investigation by the police. Powys, which does not have any A&E units, said most incidents were connected with patients with mental health issues or elderly patients. \\"It should be noted that the number of incidents has fallen considerably in the last year or so despite an increased awareness amongst staff in terms of reporting.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"The text discusses the ongoing issue of violence and abuse against healthcare staff in Wales. Despite efforts to tackle the problem, the reported incidents have remained fairly constant over the past six years. In the last year, 300 incidents resulted in prosecution or other actions.

The Famous Flames were an American rhythm and blues vocal group founded in Toccoa, Georgia, in 1953 by Bobby Byrd. James Brown began his career as a member of the Famous Flames, emerging as the lead singer by the time of their first professional recording, \\"Please, Please, Please\\", in 1956. On hit songs such as \\"Try Me\\", \\"Bewildered\\", \\"Think\\", \\"I Don't Mind\\", and \\"I'll Go Crazy\\", the Flames' smooth backing harmonies contrasted strikingly with Brown's raw, impassioned delivery, and their synchronized dance steps were a prominent feature of their live shows. Altogether, they performed on 12 songs that reached the Billboard R&B and pop charts, in addition to being featured on numerous albums, including the groundbreaking Live at the Apollo. James Brown began singing with the R&B group the Cremona Trio while growing up in Toccoa, Georgia. In 1949, Brown, then sixteen, was sent to a juvenile detention center after committing several offenses of armed robbery. While at the detention center, he formed a group called the Swanees, which included Johnny Terry. The band made their own instruments, including a comb and paper, a washtub bass and a drum kit made from lard tubs, while Brown himself played \\"a sort of mandolin [made] out of a wooden box.\\" This led to Brown's first nickname, \\"Music Box\\".  In 1952, Brown's reform school baseball team played another team that featured Bobby Byrd and they soon became friends. Shortly after, Byrd and his family offered to be Brown's sponsors for an early prison release. Brown was paroled on June 14, 1952, on the condition he not return to his hometown. In response, Brown moved into Byrd's parents' home in Toccoa, finding work as a dishwasher and also trying short careers as a boxer and semi-professional baseball pitcher.  Around this time, Byrd had formed the gospel vocal group, the Starlighters, which included Byrd's sister Sarah. Within a year, the group wanted to perform R&B but was afraid of being confronted by church leaders for \\"singing the Devil's music\\". This led the group to perform R&B under the name The Avons, which included members such as Troy Collins, Doyle Oglesby, Sylvester Keels and Willie Johnson. After deciding to focus primarily on R&B, they retired the Starlighters and performed in the South Carolina and Georgia areas as the Avons.  In 1954, Brown again turned his attention to music with the group the Ever Ready Gospel Singers, which included his old reform school friend, Johnny Terry, who had been paroled at approximately the same time as Brown. However, when the group failed to get a recording deal they disbanded, leading Brown to return to Toccoa. Later in 1954, the Avons faced a tragedy when Troy Collins died in a car accident. Byrd asked Brown to replace Collins. At first, lead vocals were split between Byrd, Keels and Brown. Johnny Terry was also asked to join and he brought in a guitarist, Nafloyd Scott, and Fred Pulliam replaced Willie Johnson. It was around this time that the Avons changed their name to The Toccoa Band in order to avoid confusion with two other groups also named the Avons. Under their manager, Barry Tremier, the group began playing instruments, with Brown playing drums and Byrd the piano. How did the group first get together?","output":"The group first got together in Toccoa, Georgia, in 1953 when Bobby Byrd founded the American rhythm and blues vocal group, The Famous Flames. James Brown joined the group after he was paroled from a juvenile detention center and became friends with Bobby Byrd. Brown moved into Byrd's parents' home and joined Byrd's gospel vocal group, the Starlighters, which later transitioned to perform R&B under the name The Avons. After a tragedy struck the Avons, Byrd asked Brown to replace a member who passed away in a car accident. They then reformed into The Toccoa Band, with additional members joining, under the management of Barry Tremier. The group's dynamic began to take shape, eventually giving rise to The Famous Flames as they gained prominence with James Brown as the lead singer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 1: uh-huh yeah oh um and how a five year old can grasp something like that is beyond is just a uh Sentence 2: I cannot understand how a five-year-old can understand that. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Entailment in linguistics refers to the relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence (the conclusion) is necessarily implied by the other (the premise). Meaning, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true. Looking at the provided sentences: Sentence 1: \\"uh-huh yeah oh um and how a five year old can grasp something like that is beyond is just a uh\\" Sentence 2: \\"I cannot understand how a five-year-old can understand that.\\" Sentence 1 seems to suggest that there might be some difficulty in understanding how a five-year-old could grasp a particular concept, implied by the phrase \\"is beyond.\\" However, the sentence doesn't clearly state that the speaker cannot understand how a five-year-old can understand a given concept. Furthermore, the speaker's thought is unfinished, as evidenced by the trailing \\"uh,\\" so we don't know the full extent of their view.  Sentence 2, on the other hand, explicitly says that the speaker cannot understand how a five-year-old can understand something. This is not necessarily implied within Sentence 1. While Sentence 1 suggests that there might be some difficulty in understanding how a five-year-old could comprehend a certain concept, it doesn't firmly convey that the speaker is incapable of understanding it. Hence, the first sentence doesn't necessarily mean the speaker can't understand how a five-year-old can understand a concept, so it doesn't entail the second sentence. The two sentences may be related or could be part of the same conversation, but they don't have a relationship of entailment."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

How is \\"I tried to swim back down to them, but... it was so dark.\\" said in Czech?","output":"In order to translate this sentence to Czech, I will follow these steps: 1. Identify the key words and phrases in the English sentence. 2. Translate each key word or phrase into its Czech equivalent. 3. Rearrange the Czech words into the correct sentence order, considering Czech grammar rules. 4. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure the translated sentence flows smoothly and maintains the original meaning. The English sentence is: \\"I tried to swim back down to them, but... it was so dark.\\" Step 1: Identifying key words and phrases: - I tried: \\"I\\" is the subject and \\"tried\\" is the action. - to swim back down: This is the main action the subject is trying to do. - to them: This is the destination or target of the main action. - but: introduces an opposition or contradiction. - it was so dark: Describes a condition that complicates the main action. Step 2: Translate each key word or phrase into Czech: - I tried: Zkoušel jsem (for a male speaker), Zkoušela jsem (for a female speaker) - to swim back down: plavat zpět dolů - to them: k nim - but: ale - it was so dark: Bylo to tak tmavé Step 3: Rearrange the Czech words into the correct sentence order: - Zkoušel jsem plavat zpět dolů k nim, ale... Bylo to tak tmavé (for a male speaker) - Zkoušela jsem plavat zpět dolů k nim, ale... Bylo to tak tmavé (for a female speaker) Thus, the translated sentence in Czech is: \\"Zkoušel jsem plavat zpět dolů k nim, ale... Bylo to tak tmavé\\" for a male speaker, and \\"Zkoušela jsem plavat zpět dolů k nim, ale... Bylo to tak tmavé\\" for a female speaker."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"Two types of misstatements are relevant to the auditors' consideration of fraud in an audit of financial statements- misstatements arising from fraudulent financial statements and misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Misstatements can never arise from misappropriation of assets.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the given premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"Misstatements can never arise from misappropriation of assets.\\" is true. In fact, the premise contradicts the hypothesis, as it states that there are two types of misstatements relevant to auditors' consideration of fraud in an audit of financial statements, and one of those types is misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets. This indicates that misstatements can, in fact, arise from the misappropriation of assets. Misstatements arising from fraudulent financial reporting involve intentional manipulation of financial statements to depict a company's financial position, performance, or cash flows more favorably than they really are. This may include practices such as inflating revenues, suppressing expenses, or overstating assets. The primary motivation behind fraudulent financial reporting is to deceive financial statement users, typically the investors and creditors, into believing that the company is performing better than it actually is. On the other hand, misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets involve the theft or misuse of an entity's assets for personal gain or for the benefit of others. For example, this could include embezzlement of cash, fraudulent billing schemes, or inventory theft. When assets are misappropriated, it results in a misstatement of the financial statements, as the missing or misused assets are not accurately reflected in the financial statement balances. The motivation behind misappropriation of assets is typically to either benefit the person committing the fraud or deceive others into believing a false representation of the company's financial situation. By acknowledging the existence of misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets, the given premise directly refutes the hypothesis that misstatements can never arise from misappropriation of assets. Auditors should be aware of both types of misstatements when conducting an audit, as detecting and addressing these potential fraud risks is a crucial part of ensuring the accuracy and reliability of financial statements. In summary, the given premise states that misstatements arise from both fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets, indicating that it is not true that misstatements can never arise from misappropriation of assets. The hypothesis is contradicted by the premise, as misappropriation of assets is presented as one of the sources of misstatements that auditors need to consider during financial statement audits."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He was wondering how the vehicles would fare in coming hot weather.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which vehicle would do worse in hot weather and hot engine, car or truck? A:","output":"Based on the given information, it is difficult to definitively say which vehicle would do worse in hot weather and with a hot engine - the car or the truck. The antifreeze that Rob added to the car radiator could potentially help regulate the temperature in the car's engine and prevent it from overheating. On the other hand, without additional information on the truck's cooling system, we cannot conclude that it would fare worse than the car. Antifreeze is a coolant that not only helps to prevent the engine from freezing in cold temperatures but also aids in heat transfer, preventing the engine from overheating in hot weather. Consequently, having antifreeze in the radiator would generally improve a vehicle's performance in hot weather conditions. However, there are additional factors that come into play when considering a vehicle's sensitivity to hot weather, such as the efficiency of the cooling system, and other mechanical conditions. The lack of antifreeze in the truck's radiator does potentially increase the risk of overheating in hot weather, but determining which vehicle would fare worse requires more information on the condition, make, and model of both the car and the truck's engines and cooling systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer this question: when does a week start sunday or monday??","output":"The start of a week can be either Sunday or Monday, and the choice varies depending upon regions, countries, cultures, and individual preferences. Let's explore these differences in detail. 1. Sunday as the start of the week: In many countries, particularly in the Americas, Sunday is considered the first day of the week. This practice has its roots in religious beliefs, as Sunday is often observed as the \\"Sabbath\\" or \\"Lord's Day\\" in Christianity, marking the day Jesus Christ resurrected after the crucifixion. The United States, Canada, Brazil, and Japan are some examples of countries where Sunday is commonly considered the beginning of the week. The most widely used calendar system, the Gregorian calendar, also designates Sunday as the first day of the week. This is evident in various calendar systems and software applications, as well as when examining international standards such as the ISO week date system. However, this standard does not dictate which day should be officially recognized as the first day of the week. 2. Monday as the start of the week: Many countries and cultures, especially in Europe and Asia, adopt Monday as the first day of the week. This can be attributed to multiple factors, such as the influence of the workweek, secularization, and cultural evolution. In many European languages, Monday is named after the Moon, which is often perceived to indicate the beginning of a new cycle. Countries like the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Russia, China, and India are some examples where Monday is recognized as the start of the week. International Organization for Standardization's ISO 8601 standard specifies Monday as the first day of the week. This is a widely recognized standard that promotes consistency in international trade, communication, and data processing. It is used by specialized organizations, institutions, and industries working across different countries, cultures, or languages to ensure a consistent understanding of dates and weeks. In conclusion, whether a week starts on Sunday or Monday depends on the regional, cultural, or individual preferences. Some countries and regions consider Sunday as the first day, while others adopt Monday as the start of the week. It is essential to understand and respect the diversity of these practices when interacting with people from different parts of the world or when interpreting international calendar standards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is also a colloquial term for the instrument used by players in all genres, including classical music. Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music. Fiddle is also a common term among musicians who play folk music on the violin. The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles of music which are aural traditions, taught 'by ear' rather than via written music. Fiddle is normally the term used for Irish Traditional Music.  - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - \`\` Relentless '' is a song written by James LeBlanc and John Paul White and recorded by American country music artist Jason Aldean . It was released in May 2008 as the third and final single from his 2007 album of the same name . The song peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs in late 2008 .  - The word Dobro is, in popular usage, the generic term for a wood-bodied, single cone resonator guitar. It is also an American brand of resonator guitar, currently owned by the Gibson Guitar Corporation. The Dobro was originally made by the Dopyera brothers when they formed the Dobro Manufacturing Company. Their design, with a single inverted resonator, was introduced in competition to the patented Tricone and biscuit designs produced by the National String Instrument Corporation. The Dobro name appeared on other instruments, notably electric lap steel guitars and solid body electric guitars and on other resonator instruments such as Safari resonator mandolins.  - Broken Bow Records is an American independent record label based in Nashville, Tennessee.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What term are comic books known for in terms of humorous or non-humorous?\\"  Context: \\"The English term comics derives from the humorous (or \\"comic\\") work which predominated in early American newspaper comic strips; usage of the term has become standard for non-humorous works as well. The term \\"comic book\\" has a similarly confusing history: they are most often not humorous; nor are they regular books, but rather periodicals. It is common in English to refer to the comics of different cultures by the terms used in their original languages, such as manga for Japanese comics, or bandes dessinées for French-language Franco-Belgian comics.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Comic books are known for both humorous and non-humorous content, as the term \\"comics\\" originated from early American newspaper comic strips which were predominantly humorous. Despite this origin, the usage of the term has expanded to include non-humorous works as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Donald Duck is doing some camouflage painting on a cannon with yellow, green, and red stripes and black dots (based on the colors of the Flag of Lithuania with bullet holes in it). Sergeant Pete sees it and scolds Donald, explaining that it needs to painted so it can't be seen.  Pete then demands that Donald re-paint the cannon to make it \\"hard to see\\".  Obliging to the sergeant's orders, Donald walks to the \\"Experimental Laboratory: Camouflage Corps\\", disregarding the 'keep out' sign, and walks in. He finds some \\"invisible paint\\", which he tests with his finger, and uses it to paint the cannon. When Pete returns, he is shocked to find the cannon seemingly gone, believing it to be stolen.  But of course it isn't stolen, as the sergeant finds out the hard way by bonking his head on the underside of the cannon and discovering Donald inside.  Angered that Donald painted the cannon too invisible to see, Pete blows hard into one end of the barrel, sending Donald out the other end and into the bucket of invisible paint.  When Donald runs away, Pete finds out Donald has become invisible after seeing Donald's footprints on the ground.  Donald then swims across a lake, but the invisible paint doesn't come off. Pete continues to chase Donald through a field of flowers, until he accidentally throws some of the flowers on Donald, revealing his outline.  Pete spots Donald and tries to catch him, but he gets away again.  However, this gives Pete an idea to find Donald.  When the General drives up, Pete's antics, including jumping around a tree while singing \\"Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush\\" and throwing flowers, convinces the General that he is acting odd, especially after he asks the General \\"did you see a little guy that you can't see?\\"  The invisible Donald then puts a cactus down Pete's pants, making him scream in pain and jump around like a madman, making the General wonder what is going on with Pete.

The Republican presidential nominee ticked down a list of issues he failed to sufficiently hammer Clinton on during their 90-minute bout -- from her foreign policy failures to her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. He also insisted on defending two factually incorrect statements he made the previous night.      Trump touted unscientific, online post-debate polls as \\"things of beauty.\\"      He also again claimed to be \\"holding back\\" during the faceoff because he \\"didn't want to do anything to embarrass\\" Clinton. That comment came after blaming debate moderator Lester Holt of NBC News for being tough on him earlier in the day,      \\"For 90 minutes I watched her very carefully and I was also holding back. I didn't want to do anything that embarrassed her,\\" Trump said Tuesday. \\"For 90 minutes, she argued against change, while I called for dramatic change. We have to have dramatic change.\\"      But while he spent much of the debate on the defense, Trump was free to unleash on Clinton without abandon as he rallied thousands of supporters Tuesday night in an airplane hangar.      He slammed Clinton for having \\"defended every major failure she helped create,\\" placing particular emphasis on Clinton's track record as secretary of state.      \\"Iraq and Libya are in chaos,\\" Trump said. \\"Here in America we've seen one Islamic terror strike after another.\\"      Trump pointed to Clinton's decades-old career in the political spotlight -- arguing she has not accomplished enough, and failed too often, in that time period.      \\"I kept saying for 26 years you've been doing nothing,\\" Trump said. \\"She's the candidate of yesterday. And ours is the campaign and we're the people of the future.\\"      Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas and then the United States before she was elected for the first time to public office in 2000 as a US senator from New York.      And while Clinton made it through the debate on Monday with relatively few attacks from Trump on the subject, on Tuesday, Trump attacked her over her email practices, including her false assertion she neither sent nor received information marked classified.      \\"Another Crooked Hillary lie,\\" Trump said. \\"Have you ever seen a greater embarrassment to our country?\\"      Clinton is \\"an insider fighting only for her donors and insiders,\\" Trump said, touting his outsider status.      But Trump also entrenched himself on two issues the debate's moderator, Holt, called out on for being factually inaccurate. He insisted the stop-and-frisk practice used in New York City that a federal judge ruled unconstitutional in 2013 was constitutional. And he argued that he was \\"against going into Iraq,\\" even though he did not publicly oppose the war before it started, expressed support for it a month before Congress voted to approve military force and even praised the invasion as a \\"tremendous success.\\"      And earlier in the day, as the Clinton campaign sought to highlight disparaging comments Trump made about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, Trump reiterated his criticism.      \\"She gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem,\\" he said on \\"Fox and Friends.\\"      Trump on Tuesday also returned to his characterization of the press as \\"the most dishonest people I've ever dealt with\\" and, as he continued to review the previous night's debate, suggested Clinton's success was tied to the \\"mainstream media.\\"      \\"Without the mainstream media, folks, she wouldn't even be here. She wouldn't even have a chance,\\" Trump said.      But Trump also signaled that he and his campaign took note of his strongest moments in the debate.      Trump hammered home his commitment to addressing trade imbalances Tuesday night and pointed to his back-and-forth with Clinton over trade, particularly when he called her out for calling the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal the \\"gold standard\\" of trade agreements. Clinton now opposes the TPP trade deal.      \\"The American people rendered their verdict. The post-debate polls as I said to you were so great, but we exposed Hillary Clinton's real position on NAFTA which was by the way the single worst deal as you'll ever see and Trans-Pacific Partnership -- another great disaster that she lied about,\\" Trump said. |||||Summary:","output":"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump declared himself the winner of the first US presidential debate at a rally in Melbourne, Florida, the day after the debate took place.

But while we can count on this semiotic orgy coming around every year, we cannot be so sure that the way we use punctuation will be the same from one to the next—even if the ostensible reason for this holiday is to celebrate “the importance of proper punctuation.” After all, the proper among us once wrote today as to-day; they once referred to the 1920s as the 1920’s; and they once marked quotations with diples (>) rather than these guys: (“”). Here are five modern examples of how punctuation is evolving, with no certain conclusion and whether the traditionalists like it or not. Emoji are being wielded as punctuation. Especially on platforms like Twitter, emoji are being used to serve the same key purpose of punctuation: aiding understanding by providing clues to how the surrounding words should be interpreted. Take the text of this real tweet, randomly selected from emojitracker.com: “Who tf put cheese in my bag today ” Just as exclamation points can convey excitement or question marks can suggest a lack of certainty, the angry face helps the reader understand that writer was angry about discovering their bag contained cheese of uncertain origin. There is more freedom from conventions. Look back at the above tweet. While an English teacher might whip out her red pen and put a question mark at the end of the sentence, we can easily discern the writer’s uncertainty about the cheese-smuggler’s identity by the word who. We don’t need the mark, and space-constrained platforms like Twitter and text messages have made us more apt to drop unnecessary characters—as well as less likely to make the assumption that character-dropping equals ignorance. Meanwhile, the same marks missing from the ends of sentences or middle of words are settling into non-traditional roles. “Now you have Twitter and email taking older marks and giving them new life as emoticons,” says Keith Houston, author of Shady Characters, a history of punctuation marks. “People are punctuating in unstandard ways, and they are freed from convention because these messages are ephemeral.” The apostrophe is losing steam in some circles. Social media analytics firm Brandwatch scoured Twitter for trends in 2013 and found that the top five “grammatical errors” were: im, wont, cant, dont and id. Meanwhile, corporations like British super-bookstore Waterstones (neé Waterstone’s) have seen fit to erase those marks from their names. Cities are dropping them from street signs. And while some grammarians may cry most foul, others are calling for the apostrophe’s dumb round head. The advocates behind the “Kill the Apostrophe” website have been joined by author James Harbeck in asserting that, in most cases, rules about apostrophe usage only serve to irritate those people who know the rules and confuse those who do not. “The great question with a lot of punctuation is, Do you really need it?” says Ammon Shea, author of hilarious grammar-police-takedown Bad English. And, he says, there’s often little risk of confusion when theyre absent. Exclamation marks are becoming harder to avoid, for those who would like to avoid them. As many have noted, the period that used to innocuously signal the end of a thought—like an orchestra conductor pinching his hand—has taken on a brusque aura these days, leaving the reader of any declarative sentence open to detect apathy or annoyance. This has led to a rise in exclamation marks, because people need something to fill the gaps left by informative cues we get only in face-to-face communication—the raised brows, the wide eyes, the smile. Fearing that we could come across as unfriendly, we tack on an exclamation mark (“Thanks!”) to make sure our fine disposition comes across. The data supporting this shift is largely anecdotal, but the anecdotes are abundant. “The exclamation mark, once reserved for expressing joy or excitement, now simply marks baseline politeness,” writes New York Magazine’s Melissa Dahl, who goes on to quote a grammarian who describes them as nearly “mandatory” in email. “Dealing with such bare bones language,” says Shea, “you use whatever help you can get.” (If you don’t want this kind of help, there is a handy TIME guide on alternatives.) Hyphens are being retired, perhaps faster than ever. Hyphens have, of course, been chucked for centuries, as in the previous example of to-day becoming today. But that shift, Houston says, took about a century and wasn’t finalized until the 1900s. Today, at least some of the hyphen-tossing is happening faster. Take electronic mail, which started as the crazy notion of “E-mail” in the 1970s and became the un-hyphenated, ho-hum “email” among prevailing American media outlets in about 40 years.“The migration to ebook, ecommerce and email is not unexpected,” Merriam-Webster President John Morse previously told TIME. “This transition may come more readily in today’s technological environment.” We can only wonder what tricksy technology is going to do to punctuation between now and next year’s National Punctuation Day. In the meantime, I need to get back to my em-dash bath. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The way we use punctuation has been changing and evolving over time, as demonstrated by these five modern examples:  1.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Mao Asada (Qian Tian  Zhen Yang , Asada Mao, born September 25, 1990) is a former Japanese competitive figure skater. She is the 2010 Olympic silver medalist, a three-time World champion (2008, 2010, 2014), a three-time Four Continents champion (2008, 2010, 2013), and a four-time Grand Prix Final champion (2005-06, 2008-09, 2012-13, 2013-14). She is the only female figure skater who has landed three triple Axel jumps in one competition, which she achieved at the 2010 Winter Olympics. During the summer of 2007, Asada received additional training in Russia from Tatiana Tarasova, while Arutyunyan remained her primary coach. At the 2007 Skate Canada International, Asada was third in the short program and first in the long, finishing with the gold medal ahead of silver medalist Yukari Nakano. Asada won her second gold at the 2007 Trophee Eric Bompard with over 21 points ahead of silver medalist Kimmie Meissner.  Asada advanced to the 2007-08 Grand Prix Final in Turin, Italy. In the short program, Asada did not do the jump out of footwork required element and placed 6th with a score of 59.04 points. But the next day, she rebounded in the free skating to win the free skating with 132.55 points. She executed a triple axel, a triple flip-triple toe loop combination, a triple loop, a triple flip-triple loop, a double axel-double loop-double loop combination, and a double axel, but had a change-of-edge error in triple lutz. She won the silver medal with 191.59 points, 5.24 behind gold medalist Yuna Kim, who repeated as champion.  As in the previous year, Asada won the 2007-08 Japan Championships. Her final score was 1.15 points ahead of silver medalist and reigning World champion Miki Ando. Asada was placed on the Japanese team for both the World and Four Continents Championships. Before Four Continents, she split with Arutyunyan and returned to Japan to practice on the new Aurora Rink at Chukyo University, where she had no problems obtaining ice time.  Asada competed at both ISU Championships without a coach but an official from the Japan Skating Federation accompanied her as needed. Competing for the first time at Four Continents Championships, Asada won both segments and finished 13.71 points ahead of silver medalist Joannie Rochette. In March 2008, at the Worlds Championships, Asada won her first World title. She was second in the short program, 0.18 behind Carolina Kostner. In the free skating, she was second to bronze medalist Yuna Kim by 1.92 points but 0.88 ahead of silver medalist Carolina Kostner.

Before starting his next show, he draws attention to the bells ringing in the nearby Cathedral of Notre Dame. He offers to tell the tale of the mysterious bell-ringer--who he is, and how he came to the cathedral:Twenty years ago, on a cold winter night, four Gypsies sneaked into Paris on a hired riverboat; the Gypsies were persecuted in Paris (and possibly all over France), so the only way to enter the city without being arrested was to sneak in. These particular Gypsies consisted of two men, one woman, and her child (it is implied that one of the men was the husband and father to the last two mentioned). Upon landing, however, the group was ambushed and arrested.The man leading the arrest was Judge Claude Frollo, the Minister of Justice. He is the primary instigator of the persecution and oppression against the Gypsies in Paris, claiming that their ways will corrupt the other citizens. He arrested the men, but when he ordered his troops to take the bundle in the woman's arms (mistakenly assuming them to be stolen goods), she ran. Though he was on horseback, she outmaneuvered him by using shortcuts too small for his horse. She made it to the doors of the Cathedral of Notre Dame to claim sanctuary, but because it was nighttime the doors were locked. Before they could be opened, Frollo caught up with her. He wrested the bundle from her grasp, kicking her while doing so; she fell back and hit her head on the stone steps, which killed her.The baby started to cry. When Frollo pulled back the cloth surrounding him, he gasped in horror, proclaiming the baby to be a monster (the baby is never shown). He nearly dropped the infant down a well, but he was stopped by the Archdeacon of the cathedral, who condemned his killing of the woman and his attempt to kill the baby. Though Frollo tried to justify his actions, deceiving himself, the Archdeacon reminded him that God, the angels, etc, are fully aware of what he had...

Q:And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event.

Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  You breathe in - Diaphragm and other muscles expand to allow room for your lungs to fill - The air flows into the narrow bronchioles in the lungs - From the bronchioles to the alveoli - The oxygen enters into the bloodstream - Is switched with the carbon dioxide in the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide enters through the alveoli - Through the narrow bronchioles - Into the lungs Answer:","output":"The final step in the process you described, after the carbon dioxide travels back through the bronchioles and into the lungs, is exhalation. This is where you breathe out, expelling the carbon dioxide from your body. Just for further understanding, let's elaborate on this final stage. Exhalation, or breathing out, is primarily a passive process in which the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles (muscles situated between the ribs) relax. This causes the chest cavity to decrease in size and the volume of the lungs to reduce. As a result, the pressure inside the lungs becomes greater than the air pressure outside the body, causing air to flow out of the lungs through the bronchioles and larger bronchi, up the trachea, and finally, out through your nose and mouth. During exhalation, the elastic properties of the lungs and chest wall assist in deflation, but additional effort can be applied to force a more rapid or deeper exhalation. This is typically seen during strenuous activities or exercise where the rate of carbon dioxide production in the body increases and thus needs to be expelled more quickly. The expelled air contains a higher concentration of carbon dioxide and lower concentration of oxygen, compared to the inhaled air. This whole process ensures the continuous exchange of gases in the lungs, making certain that the bloodstream consistently receives fresh oxygen while eliminating the waste product, carbon dioxide. So, in summary: After the incoming oxygen switches with carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, the carbon dioxide goes into the alveoli, through the narrow bronchioles, and into the lungs. Here, the body readies itself to finally exhale or breathe out this \\"used\\" air, ridding the body of its main waste product from the process of respiration: carbon dioxide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To fully address the statement, \\"The only thing I ever accomplished was my college career,\\" we need more context and depth of understanding about what you consider as an accomplishment and the nature of these achievements. Your gardening experience suggests some form of accomplishment. You mentioned having gardens for a \\"long long time,\\" and growing various types of crops such as squash, tomatoes, and watermelons. This suggests that over the years, you have been successful at maintaining gardens and producing fruits and vegetables, which itself can be considered an accomplishment. It demonstrates sustained effort, commitment, and mastery of specific skills such as understanding plant cultivation and management of natural resources. However, the statement's relevance and accuracy largely depend on your personal interpretation of 'accomplishment.' If your definition of accomplishment is strictly tied to professional or academic successes, then maybe your college career could indeed be the 'only thing' you've accomplished. But if accomplishment encompasses personal achievements, hobbies, and life experiences like gardening, then it seems that you have accomplished more than just your college career. Additionally, the phrase, \\"the only thing I ever accomplished,\\" suggests a reflection on one's entire life to the present.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Ellington was born on April 29, 1899, to James Edward Ellington and Daisy (Kennedy) Ellington in Washington, D.C. Both his parents were pianists. Daisy primarily played parlor songs and James preferred operatic arias. From 1936, Ellington began to make recordings with smaller groups (sextets, octets, and nonets) drawn from his then-15-man orchestra and he composed pieces intended to feature a specific instrumentalist, as with \\"Jeep's Blues\\" for Johnny Hodges, \\"Yearning for Love\\" for Lawrence Brown, \\"Trumpet in Spades\\" for Rex Stewart, \\"Echoes of Harlem\\" for Cootie Williams and \\"Clarinet Lament\\" for Barney Bigard. In 1937, Ellington returned to the Cotton Club which had relocated to the mid-town Theater District. In the summer of that year, his father died, and due to many expenses, Ellington's finances were tight, although his situation improved the following year.  After leaving agent Irving Mills, he signed on with the William Morris Agency. Mills though continued to record Ellington. After only a year, his Master and Variety labels, the small groups had recorded for the latter, collapsed in late 1937, Mills placed Ellington back on Brunswick and those small group units on Vocalion through to 1940. Well known sides continued to be recorded, \\"Caravan\\" in 1937, and \\"I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart\\" the following year.  Billy Strayhorn, originally hired as a lyricist, began his association with Ellington in 1939. Nicknamed \\"Swee' Pea\\" for his mild manner, Strayhorn soon became a vital member of the Ellington organization. Ellington showed great fondness for Strayhorn and never failed to speak glowingly of the man and their collaborative working relationship, \\"my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes in the back of my head, my brain waves in his head, and his in mine\\". Strayhorn, with his training in classical music, not only contributed his original lyrics and music, but also arranged and polished many of Ellington's works, becoming a second Ellington or \\"Duke's doppelganger\\". It was not uncommon for Strayhorn to fill in for Duke, whether in conducting or rehearsing the band, playing the piano, on stage, and in the recording studio.

To do this, follow these steps: Step 1: Add 463*w to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -463*w term from the right side. -441*w + 463*w + 149 = -463*w + 463*w + 567 Simplifying this, we get: 22*w + 149 = 567 Step 2: Now, we have a simpler equation with the variable w on one side. To further isolate w, subtract 149 from both sides of the equation. 22*w + 149 - 149 = 567 - 149 Simplifying this, we get: 22*w = 418 Step 3: Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 22 to get the value of w. 22*w / 22 = 418 / 22 w = 19 So the solution to the equation -441*w + 149 = -463*w + 567 is w = 19."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose sediment is not picked up by wind or water happens, how will it affect less cocoon.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"This process describes the life-cycle of butterflies. To analyze the impact of the perturbation hypothesis which is \\"suppose sediment is not picked up by wind or water happens, how will it affect less cocoon?\\", let's break down the process into steps: 1. A larva is born: This is the initial stage of the butterfly's lifecycle. The supposed perturbation related to sediment movement by wind or water does not have a direct impact on this step. 2. The caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger: The caterpillar's growth is driven by dietary intake, predominantly leaves, which do not involve sediments directly. Again, the proposed hypothesis of no sediment transport via wind or water seems not to affect this phase. 3. The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon: The cocoon or chrysalis is created by the caterpillar using its own body's resources. Sediment not being moved by wind or water doesn't impact this process. 4. The caterpillar becomes a pupa: The transformation from caterpillar to pupa is internal and involves no external factors like sediments. 5. After some time the cocoon hatches: The hatching process is dependant on the internal transformation of the pupa into a butterfly. Sediment dynamics do not influence this process. 6. And a butterfly is born: This is the final stage of the process which is equally unaffected by sediment transportation. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation does not appear to have a direct or indirect effect on the described butterfly life-cycle process. The process is largely independent of sediment movement enabled by wind or water. The perturbation of sediment not being able to be picked up or moved by wind or water would more likely impact processes involving landforms, erosion, deposition, or directly, the life cycles of certain aquatic or soil-dwelling macroinvertebrates, who rely on sediment for various parts of their life-cycle.

Please answer this question: What was the name of the Independent Counsel who investigated the death of White House Counsel Vince Foster, the Whitewater real estate investment scandal, and Bill Clintons less than stellar grasp of the truth, ultimately leading to Clinton's impeachment?","output":"The Independent Counsel who investigated the death of White House Counsel Vince Foster, the Whitewater real estate investment scandal, and President Bill Clinton's alleged misconduct, which eventually led to Clinton's impeachment, was Kenneth Winston Starr. Kenneth Starr, an attorney and former federal judge, was appointed as the Independent Counsel in August 1994. Initially, his investigation focused on the Whitewater Development Corporation, a real estate venture in which Bill and Hillary Clinton had invested. The Clintons were accused of fraud and unethical conduct in connection to the failed investment, though no major legal repercussions arose from the investigation for them. In 1995, Starr's mandate was expanded to include the investigation into Vince Foster's death, who was the Deputy White House Counsel and a close associate of both Clintons. Foster's death in July 1993 was ruled a suicide, but conspiracy theories suggested that the Clintons may have been involved in his death. Starr concluded in his report that Foster indeed committed suicide, and there was no evidence of foul play. The investigation took a major turn when the focus shifted towards President Bill Clinton's personal life. This shift was sparked by a lawsuit filed by Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee who claimed that Clinton had sexually harassed her. During the discovery phase of the lawsuit, Linda Tripp, a friend of Monica Lewinsky, provided Starr with recorded phone conversations between herself and Lewinsky discussing her affair with Clinton. Starr's investigation shifted to include allegations of perjury, obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and abuse of power related to the president's relationship with Lewinsky and his testimony in the Paula Jones lawsuit. As a result of Starr's investigation and report, known as the Starr Report, the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Clinton on two charges, perjury, and obstruction of justice, in December 1998. Though President Clinton was impeached by the House, the Senate acquitted him in February 1999, and he completed his second term as President. In summary, Kenneth Winston Starr was the Independent Counsel who investigated the Whitewater scandal, the death of Vince Foster, and the various allegations surrounding President Bill Clinton, which ultimately led to his impeachment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Brennan lives with his mother, Nancy; and Dale has been living with his father, Robert; the parents meet and fall in love. Robert and Nancy get married, forcing Brennan and Dale to live with each other as step brothers. Brennan and Dale dislike each other, blaming the other for interfering with their lifestyles. Brennan plays Dale's drum set and a brawl on the front lawn ensues. They are grounded for a week and they must find jobs within a month or they will be forced out of the house. When Brennan's younger brother Derek, a helicopter leasing agent, comes to visit with his family, he mocks their unsuccessful lives and being spoiled brats, which entices Dale to punch him in the face. Brennan is awed that Dale stood up to Derek, while Derek's wife Alice finds Dale's courage a turn on, beginning a sexual affair between the two. Brennan and Dale use the incident to discover their shared interests and develop a brotherly friendship. Robert schedules several job interviews for Brennan and Dale, who offend the interviewers with their disrespectful attitudes. Robert and Nancy reveal their plans to retire and sail the world on Robert's boat and allow Derek to sell the house, and demand that Brennan and Dale attend therapy and find other living arrangements.

Answer:","output":"In the movie Step Brothers, Brennan Huff and Dale Doback initially blame each other for interfering with their lifestyles. As men-children still living at home with their respective parents, Nancy and Robert, the two are forced to live together as stepbrothers when their parents fall in love and get married. This sudden change in their lives causes tension and animosity between Brennan and Dale as they each view the other as the reason for their disrupted lifestyles. Over time, however, they come to realize that other factors are contributing to their struggles. One of these factors is Brennan's younger brother, Derek, who mocks their unsuccessful lives and calls them spoiled brats. This leads Dale to stand up to him, which in turn helps Brennan and Dale discover their shared interests and develop a genuine brotherly bond. Additionally, their parents, Robert and Nancy, serve as another external factor. They announce their plans to retire and sail the world, intending to have Derek sell their house and requiring Brennan and Dale to find new living arrangements. This further pushes the two stepbrothers together, as they devise a plan to start their own entertainment company called \\"Prestige Worldwide.\\" Ultimately, it is the combination of external factors and their own personal growth that leads Brennan and Dale to stop blaming each other for their disrupted lifestyles. Instead, they learn to work together and become more mature adults in the process. To invest in this film proposal, you should consider several aspects, such as the humor and chemistry between the lead actors, the relatability of the story to the target audience, and the potential for the film to resonate with viewers. Step Brothers has been a commercial and critical success, and if you believe similar results can be achieved with this proposal, it may be well worth the investment.

Hollywood shows some support for Israeli actors' refusal to perform in West Bank settlement To David and HumaneBeing: Here are a few quotes from independent sources that describe \\"Palestine\\" during the time of the Jews initial return: For many centuries, Palestine was a sparsely populated, poorly cultivated and widely-neglected expanse of eroded hills, sandy deserts and malarial marshes. Mark Twain, who visited Palestine in 1867, described it as: \\"...[a] desolate country whose soil is rich enough, but is given over wholly to weeds-a silent mournful expanse....A desolation is here that not even imagination can grace with the pomp of life and action....We never saw a human being on the whole route....There was hardly a tree or a shrub anywhere. Even the olive and the cactus, those fast friends of the worthless soil, had almost deserted the country.\\" As late as 1880, the American consul in Jerusalem reported the area was continuing its historic decline. \\"The population and wealth of Palestine has not increased during the last forty years,\\" he said. The Report of the Palestine Royal Commission quotes an account of the Maritime Plain in 1913: The road leading from Gaza to the north was only a summer track suitable for transport by camels and carts...no orange groves, orchards or vineyards were to be seen until one reached [the Jewish village of] Yabna [Yavne]....Houses were all of mud. No windows were anywhere to be seen....The ploughs used were of wood....The yields were very poor....The sanitary conditions in the village were horrible. Schools did not exist....The western part, towards the sea, was almost a desert....The villages in this area were few and thinly populated. Many ruins of villages were scattered over the area, as owing to the prevalence of malaria, many villages were deserted by their inhabitants. Lewis French, the British Director of Development wrote of Palestine: We found it inhabited by fellahin who lived in mud hovels and suffered severely from the prevalent malaria....Large areas...were uncultivated....The fellahin, if not themselves cattle thieves, were always ready to harbor these and other criminals. The individual plots...changed hands annually. There was little public security, and the fellahin's lot was an alternation of pillage and blackmail by their neighbors, the Bedouin. Surprisingly, many people who were not sympathetic to the Zionist cause believed the Jews would improve the condition of Palestinian Arabs. For example, Dawood Barakat, editor of the Egyptian paper Al-Ahram, wrote: \\"It is absolutely necessary that an entente be made between the Zionists and Arabs, because the war of words can only do evil. The Zionists are necessary for the country: The money which they will bring, their knowledge and intelligence, and the industriousness which characterizes them will contribute without doubt to the regeneration of the country.\\" Even a leading Arab nationalist believed the return of the Jews to their homeland would help resuscitate the country. According to Sherif Hussein, the guardian of the Islamic Holy Places in Arabia: The resources of the country are still virgin soil and will be developed by the Jewish immigrants. One of the most amazing things until recent times was that the Palestinian used to leave his country, wandering over the high seas in every direction. His native soil could not retain a hold on him, though his ancestors had lived on it for 1000 years. At the same time we have seen the Jews from foreign countries streaming to Palestine from Russia, Germany, Austria, Spain, America. The cause of causes could not escape those who had a gift of deeper insight. They knew that the country was for its original sons (abna'ihi­l­asliyin), for all their differences, a sacred and beloved homeland. The return of these exiles (jaliya) to their homeland will prove materially and spiritually [to be] an experimental school for their brethren who are with them in the fields, factories, trades and in all things connected with toil and labor.

Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd \\"a spent force creatively.\\" When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who greatly valued the familial connections of Sissinghurst?  Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal. Her biographer Victoria Glendinning considers Sissinghurst to be Sackville-West's \\"one magnificent act of creation\\".

The portrayal of poetry as a medium for Mija's search for beauty and meaning maintains the emotional depth of the film. 2. Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian: Bradshaw gives Poetry a perfect score and appreciates its refusal to provide easy answers. He highlights the sensitive performances and finely-drawn characters, particularly that of the lead actress, Yoon Jeong-hee. The movie's melancholic atmosphere and powerful drama solidify its poignant impact on the viewers. 3. Kenneth Turan from Los Angeles Times: Turan lauds the film's ability to create a complex yet gratifying portrait of humanity.

He notes that \\"Poetry\\" presents a rich, engaging drama filled with intricate psychological details.

Bong Joon-ho from Sight & Sound Magazine: Acclaimed South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho heaps praise on \\"Poetry\\" in his review. He shares that the movie's brilliance lies in its refusal to give clear-cut answers to the challenges faced by its protagonist. This approach adds depth and realism to the story, in turn making the drama more absorbing and poignant. 6. James Berardinelli from ReelViews: Berardinelli admires the director's ability to explore the human condition and address societal issues through the characters' struggles in \\"Poetry.\\" The complexity of the central conflict and the film's commitment to avoid easy answers contribute to its enigmatic aura.

I read this background article the other day: Desertification is a type of land degradation in which a relatively dry area of land becomes a desert, typically losing its bodies of water as well as vegetation and wildlife.[2] It is caused by a variety of factors, such as through climate change (particularly the current global warming)[3] and through the overexploitation of soil through human activity.[4] When deserts appear automatically over the natural course of a planet's life cycle, then it can be called a natural phenomenon; however, when deserts emerge due to the rampant and unchecked depletion of nutrients in soil that are essential for it to remain arable, then a virtual \\"soil death\\" can be spoken of,[5] which traces its cause back to human overexploitation. Desertification is a significant global ecological and environmental problem with far reaching consequences on socio-economic and political conditions.[6]  I am facing a new situation today: People in Iran used extensive grazing, fell most of their trees so they have lots of problems with desertification. Iraq took a more mindful approach to land use, they preserved native species, planted trees and didn't overgraze the land.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which country lost fewer bodies of water to desertification? A:","output":"Based on the background article you provided and the new situation, it can be concluded that Iraq lost fewer bodies of water to desertification compared to Iran. This is because Iraq took a more mindful approach to land use, preserving native species, planting trees, and preventing overgrazing, which are all factors that help to mitigate the effects of desertification. In contrast, Iran's extensive grazing and deforestation practices have contributed to their desertification problems, likely resulting in the loss of more bodies of water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Who falls in love with Corbin? , can you please find it?   Drama critic John Earl observes a piece of artwork in a museum, gazing at it reverently. He asks the museum curator how much it costs, and the curator says that it is not for sale. The artist, James Harlan Corbin [Lederer], does not wish to sell the painting. Nonplussed, Earl returns to his office and phones Corbin with his proposal to sell. Again, Corbin refuses. Earl continues his pursuit to find out who the model for the painting was. He learns it is Helen North, a young woman who looks nothing like the woman in the painting. He visits with her to learn his location, but she refuses, telling him that she will be singing at a local nightclub, where Corbin frequents. Earl finds both of them in the museum, and again confronts Corbin. Becoming clearly annoyed, Corbin invites the singer out for a night in his yacht. She agrees, but is later found washed ashore. Although Police Lt. Roberts initially questions Helen's suitor Hunt Mason, Mason implicates Corbin as the last person who saw Helen North. John Earl works with the police department to arrange for Helen's sister Linda to apply for modeling, in order to spy on Corbin. The two return to Corbin's boathouse. While there, Linda calls for Earl and tells his chef that she is in danger and to notify the police. There, she learns that Corbin did not murder her sister.

Abu (Salim Kumar) and Aishumma (Zarina Wahab) are an elderly Moplah Muslim couple living in Kerala's Malabar region. Their aspiration is to go for Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, and they sacrifice to achieve this aim. Their son Sattar has migrated to the Middle East (as a part of the Kerala Gulf boom) with his family and has virtually discarded his parents. Now in their late 70s, the couple decide to go for Hajj that year and they scrimp and save so that they can materialize their earnest wish to visit the holy place.Salim Kumar and Zarina Wahab as Abu and Aishumma, holding their new passportsAbu sells attar (a perfume obtained from flowers), religious books and Unani medicines that nobody seems to want. Aishumma breeds cattle and chickens, helping her husband realise their shared dream. Abu feels as outdated and discarded by a fast-changing world as the traditional products that he sells.A school teacher (Nedumudi Venu), Abu's friend, comes to his aid at his time of need. Hyder (Suraj Venharammud), a local teashop owner also empathises with Abu who in turn is frequently given genuine advice by a mysterious saint known simply as \\"Ustad\\" (Tampi Antony). Good-natured people try to help Abu by offering to lend him the amount but, as this goes against the accepted Islamic practices, he refuses to take anything.With the advancing years, Abu's desperation grows. Finally, in frustration and distress, he sells his cow and old jackfruit tree. Abu is helped by the manager of a travel agency (Mukesh) to get flight tickets and other documents for his journey. A policeman (Sasi Kalinga) initially tries to reject Abu's passport application, but once he gets his usual bribe he becomes quite helpful. The couple begins their preparations which include attending the Hajj preparation classes conducted by the travel agency, being vaccinated for meningococcal meningitis and buying new Ihram clothing. Abu pays off even the smallest of his old debts as part of the preparations and travels miles to seek forgiveness from Sulaiman, a previous neighbour with whom he once fought.When the passports and the tickets are ready and a bus journey away in Kozhikode, the sawmill owner (Kalabhavan Mani), while handing over the money for Abu's tree, says that its wood turned out to be rotten and useless. He insists that Abu take the money, however, since his cause is noble. Abu refuses it, saying that it wouldn't be halal and hence could anger God. When he is sure that he cannot fulfill his dream, Abu reaches another conclusionÂ â that the tree too had life, and several lives must have died when he cut the tree in front of his house. Abu conjectures that maybe one of the reasons for his not being able to go on the journey.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell visits domestic violence hotline headquarters September 27, 2014: NFL commissioner Roger Goodell arrives at the headquarters of the National Domestic Violence hotline in Austin, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) Austin, TEXAS – Facing criticism about the handling of recent abuse cases, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell spent three hours Saturday night visiting the headquarters of the National Domestic Violence Hotline and getting an up-close look at the realities victims face. Hotline CEO Katie Ray-Jones, whose organization has received a multiyear, multimillion dollar pledge of assistance from the NFL, described the private meeting as \\"emotional\\" for Goodell. \\"At one point he was physically moved to tears as he heard stories from our advocates about what women were encountering, that we took today,\\" Ray-Jones said. Hotline officials had invited Goodell to visit the facility, which is housed in a non-descript, unmarked building in suburban Austin. \\"Doing the work, as they say,\\" was all Goodell would say when as he and several league officials walked into the building. He gave a brief wave to cameras when he stepped out of his limousine. When he left, Goodell was flanked by two hotline staff members and refused to answer questions. Goodell and the league have been heavily criticized over how they handled the recent suspension of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, who punched his then-fiancee Janay Palmer in the face in an elevator. The league was criticized as not acting quickly or emphatically enough when handling domestic violence cases and Goodell has said he mishandled the Rice case. Goodell met with 11 former players this week and was told the league must act immediately when someone is accused of domestic violence. The hotline was created in 1996 and receives about 70 percent -- just over 3 million -- of its budget from the federal government and the rest from private donations. The hotline web page said that as of 2013, the service had helped more than 3.4 million people on issues of domestic violence or dating abuse. Ray-Jones said the hotline has seen an 84 percent spike in calls since the Rice video punch video was made public, but also noted that tens of thousands of calls go unanswered because the hotline doesn't have enough staff. Goodell didn't listen to specific calls, but heard the stories related from the victim advocates. Ray-Jones said Goodell did not discuss any specific policies the NFL may put in place for domestic violence. \\"He mentioned they are very committed to understanding the issue further, and that he has a team of advisers who will continue to inform him on those policies,\\" Ray-Jones said. Initially, Goodell suspended Rice -- who has since married Palmer -- for two games. After criticism, Goodell announced new stiffer penalties for future domestic violence cases. After video of the punch was released, the Ravens cut Rice and Goodell suspended him indefinitely. League and Ravens officials said they requested the video from law enforcement but were denied. ESPN and others have reported that the Ravens had a detailed description of the video shortly after Rice was arrested. After the AP reported that the video was sent to NFL headquarters, Goodell announced that former FBI Director Robert Mueller would lead an internal investigation. That probe is ongoing, and there is no timetable for its completion. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text include the visit of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to the National Domestic Violence hotline headquarters in response to the handling of recent abuse cases, particularly of Ray Rice.

Paraphrasing is the act of rewording or reshaping a text or statement in order to retain its original meaning but through alternative expression. However, these two sentences represent two diametrically opposite situations.  The first sentence establishes the following facts:  1. In 219, Guan Yu, a leading military general, was involved in an assault campaign to capture the city of Fancheng. 2. Cao Ren was under siege or trapped in Fancheng, perhaps as the defensive commanding officer against the assault.  3. Sun Quan, another third-party figure, agreed to send aid in the form of military reinforcement to assist Cao Ren in the entrapment scenario against Guan Yu's attack. On the other hand, the second sentence establishes a different set of scenarios: 1. In 219, Cao Ren was attacking, although it's unclear whether it's Fancheng or a different location. 2. Contrary to first sentence, Guan Yu is the one that's enclosed or trapped in this situation. 3. Sun Quan agreed to send military reinforcement to assist Guan Yu this time, who is under siege, flanked or enclosed.

Ignoring his initial skepticism, Van Helsing brings along an ancient mirror rumored to reveal the true nature of supernatural beings. Act 1: Van Helsing arrives at the Carpathian village where Harker resides. The locals share stories about strange occurrences and the ominous Castle Dracula that sullies their once-peaceful town. Harker informs Van Helsing about Renfield, a patient of Dr. Seward's psychiatric institution, whose recent erratic behavior includes obsessing over a mysterious box that he claims will uncover the truth behind Count Dracula. Act 2: While Van Helsing tries to root out the source of the village's unease, he discovers that several people have been suffering from inexplicable bouts of anemia, leaving them pale and weak. Following Renfield's cryptic hints, Van Helsing manages to locate and open the very box the madman had spoken of. Inside, he finds a mirror with an inscription in Latin, which translates as \\"Darkness cannot hide from the light.\\" Act 3: Determined to face the malevolent Count Dracula, Van Helsing takes the mirror to Castle Dracula. He encounters and does battle with the Count's supernatural servants along the way. Inside the castle, the monster hunter finds Dracula in the midst of feeding on another unsuspecting villager. As Van Helsing confronts the Count, he shows him the mirror, revealing to Dracula his true form - a gruesome, bloodthirsty vampire. Act 4: The agonizing battle between Van Helsing and Dracula ensues, taking them through the castle's unnerving depths and across its treacherous grounds. Eventually, Van Helsing is able to trap Dracula in a room where sunlight breaches through the crumbling walls. Seizing the opportunity, Van Helsing drives a stake through the vampire's heart. As Dracula disintegrates into dust, the castle itself begins to crumble, signaling the end of the vampire's reign of terror. Conclusion: In the aftermath of Dracula's destruction, Van Helsing cements his reputation as a legendary monster hunter and protector of humanity. The mysterious mirror, too, gains notoriety as a powerful relic capable of revealing the truth behind the supernatural. And with Van Helsing's resolute victory, villagers and visitors alike can finally rest assured that no trace of darkness remains to haunt the Transylvanian town."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Guns N’ Roses, the Beastie Boys, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Eric B. & Rakim and the Cure are among the 15 nominees for induction as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s class of 2012. In addition, ‘70s female-fronted rock acts Heart and Joan Jett & the Blackhearts are under consideration along with singer-songwriter Laura Nyro, disco queen Donna Summer, R&B collective War and British rock group Small Faces. Blues guitarist and singer Freddie King, R&B band the Spinners and Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan round out the latest batch of Hall of Fame nominees. Inductees are typically announced in December, ahead of a ceremony that takes place in New York in March. At least 25 years must have elapsed since a musician or group released its debut recording for the act to be eligible for induction. That makes Guns N’ Roses eligible for the first time because the L.A. hard rock outfit’s debut album, “Appetite for Destruction,” was released in 1987. Likewise, this is the first year of eligibility for rap duo Eric B. & Rakim, whose debut, “Paid in Full,” also appeared in 1987. King and Donovan are the senior members of this year’s nominees, having released their first recordings in 1961 and 1965, respectively. Because of the rancor over the years between Guns N' Roses founding member Axl Rose and former members of the band who have since departed, including guitarist Slash, the group's induction sets up the prospect of a dramatic reunion, if all parties opt to set aside their differences for the occasion. In a similar situation, Creedence Clearwater Revival singer, guitarist and songwriter John Fogerty refused to join with the Bay Area band's surviving members -- bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford -- when Creedence was inducted in 1993.

Question: What country did Gil González Dávila intend to explore?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Gil González Dávila set out from the Caribbean island of Hispaniola early in 1524, with the intention of exploring the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. His course took him to the north coast of Honduras. After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil Gónzalez sailed west along the coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement somewhere near the Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along the coast to Honduras. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River. Although they were in a desperate state, and near-starving, they were still there when Cortés passed through en route to Honduras, and were absorbed into his expedition.The Dominicans established themselves in Xocolo on the shore of Lake Izabal in the mid-16th century. Xocolo became infamous among the Dominican missionaries for the practice of witchcraft by its inhabitants. By 1574 it was the most important staging post for European expeditions into the interior, and it remained important in that role until as late as 1630, although it was abandoned in 1631.In 1598 Alfonso Criado de Castilla became governor of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Owing to the poor state of Puerto de Caballos on the Honduran coast and its exposure to repeated pirate raids he sent a pilot to scout Lake Izabal. As a result of the survey, and after royal permission was granted, Criado de Castilla ordered the construction of a new port, named Santo Tomás de Castilla, at a favourable spot on the Amatique Bay not far from the lake. Work then began on building a highway from the port to the new capital of the colony, modern Antigua Guatemala, following the Motagua Valley into the...

Given the following context:  Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas for the Kingdom of Castile and León in 1492. By 1580 this had unified with neighbouring kingdoms to form one Spanish kingdom. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule. In the first decades after the discovery, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hernán Cortés set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with an army to conquer the Mesoamerican kingdoms of the Guatemalan Sierra Madre and neighbouring Pacific plain; the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541. The Captaincy General of Guatemala had its capital at Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala and covered a wide territory that also included the Mexican state of Chiapas as well as El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica. The Spanish imposed colonial rule over Yucatán between 1527 and 1546, and over Verapaz from the 16th to the 17th centuries, leaving the area between – essentially Petén and much of Belize – independent long after surrounding peoples had been subjugated.  answer the following question:  What territories were not conquered by the Spanish?

Answer a question about this article: On 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club. This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club. On 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alcántara, against the Spanish national team. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his airplane. In 1928, victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled \\"Oda a Platko\\", which was written by a member of the Generation of '27, Rafael Alberti, inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper, Franz Platko. On 23 June 1929, Barcelona won the inaugural Spanish League.

Using the crash prediction model for mid-block locations, generic motorist and cyclist volumes can be used to demonstrate the impacts on the expected crash rate of varying motor vehicle and cycle volumes. As shown in figure 2.20, an increase in the proportion of cyclists to the overall traffic volume causes an increase in expected crashes at mid-block locations, but the crash rate increases at a decreasing rate. That is to say, the crash rate per cyclist goes down as the cycle volume increases.  Story: Berg village and Hill village are renowned for the high number of cyclists living there. Berg village dealt with many traffic casualties because of narrower streets and lanes, While Hill village had wide streets, more traffic signals and a greater number of cyclists.

The well-to-do family must move to the \\"countryside\\" when the father is promoted (to Obersturmbannführer). Unknown to Bruno, the new house is near a Nazi concentration camp, and Ralf is the new commandant. Bruno initially dislikes the new house as he always has to stay in the house or the garden; also there are no other children to play with, apart from his sister. From his bedroom window, Bruno spots a barbed wire fence with people in \\"striped pyjamas\\" behind it. Though he thinks it is a farm, it is the camp with Jewish people in their camp clothing. Bruno is forbidden to go there, because according to Ralf, \\"they're not really people\\"; it is agreed that at least they are a bit weird, as demonstrated by their clothing.Bruno goes there anyway, secretly, and becomes friends with a Jewish boy, named Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), whom he meets at the fence, and who is the same age. Shmuel tells Bruno that he is a Jew and that the Jewish people have been imprisoned here by soldiers, who also took their clothes and gave them the striped camp clothing, and that he is hungry. Bruno is confused and starts having doubts about his father being a good person. Later, he is relieved after seeing a propaganda film about the camp (that is a parody of Theresienstadt).

In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.  In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa.  In which place plant roots would play greater role in soil development, Kenya or Tanzania? Answer:","output":"In terms of soil development, plant roots would play a greater role in Kenya, where grasslands are more prevalent. This is due to several reasons pertaining to the characteristics of grasslands and the role of grass roots in soil development, as compared to forests, like those in Tanzania.  Grasslands are characterized by the dominance of grasses and the relative absence of trees. Grasses have extensive, fibrous root systems that penetrate deeply into the soil, providing a stable network for the soil to attach to and preventing erosion. These root systems also contribute significantly to the soil's organic matter. In grasslands, the decomposition of dead roots and the exudation of sugars, proteins, and other compounds by living roots promote the formation of humus, which is essential for soil fertility, water retention, and soil structure. On the other hand, forests, such as those in Tanzania, have a different soil development pattern. While the organic matter in forests comes primarily from fallen leaves and other debris on the forest floor, tree roots generally do not contribute as much to soil development as grass roots do. Forest soils typically have a thinner A horizon and a thicker O horizon, which is composed mostly of decomposing leaves and other organic material. The greater acidity under forests can also inhibit the action of soil organisms that would otherwise mix the surface litter into the mineral soil, leading to a more superficial distribution of organic matter in comparison to grasslands.  Moreover, grasslands are often subjected to natural fires, which remove much of the aboveground biomass but stimulate further growth of grass roots. This process results in a net increase in root mass and contributes to the soil's organic matter.  Therefore, considering the significant role that grass roots play in soil development and the contrasting characteristics of soils under grasslands and forests, it can be concluded that plant roots would have a greater influence on soil development in Kenya's grasslands than in Tanzania's forests."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In a new study in Molecular Biology and Evolution, Cornell University researchers explain that people who come from a line of mostly plant eaters likely carry a gene mutation used to help compensate for a lack of essential fatty acids from meat or fish. The problem is that those who have the mutation—about 70% of South Asians, 53% of Africans, 29% of East Asians, 17% of Europeans, and 18% of Americans, per Australia Network News—can actually hurt their bodies with a fatty acid overload, particularly if their diet is heavy in things like meat and sunflower oil, reports the Australian. The result is an increased risk of heart disease, colon cancer, and chronically high inflammation. Researchers identified the mutation in the FADS2 gene when comparing 234 people from Pune, India, where populations have historically eaten a plant-based diet, with 311 meat eaters from Kansas. Some 68% of the Indians had two copies of a sequence of DNA used to regulate genes FADS1 and FADS2—which make long-chain polyunsaturated fats like omega-3 and omega-6, used for brain development and to curb inflammation—compared to just 18% of the Americans, reports Metro. While the gene came in useful generations ago, \\"changes in the dietary omega-6 to omega-3 balance may contribute to the increase in chronic disease seen in some developing countries,\\" researchers say in a release. People with South Asian and southern African ancestry are particularly prone to high inflammation. (This population produces very little fatty acid.) Expand this summary.","output":"So, long ago, people who mostly ate plants had a special change in their genes to help their bodies get important things called essential fatty acids, because they didn't eat much meat or fish, which have these important things. Today, many people around the world still have this gene change, especially those whose families come from South Asia and Africa. But now, if these people eat a lot of meat or use something called sunflower oil, their bodies can get too much of these essential fatty acids. Too much of these things can lead to a higher chance of getting sick with heart disease or colon cancer, and can make their body feel too much inflammation (like when you get a mosquito bite and it gets red and puffy). Researchers found out about this by studying groups of people who live in India and in Kansas, and comparing how their bodies are different. They noticed a lot more people from India had this special gene change, because their families have been eating mostly plants for a very long time. Now that we know about this gene change, we can try to help people who have it to stay healthy by choosing the right things to eat, and avoid getting too much essential fatty acids in their bodies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: President Donald Trump's approval rating has headed into unfamiliar territory in recent weeks — upward. Trump's approval hit 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with 52 percent disapproving. That represents a 3 percent improvement from last month in the same survey. Several other new surveys also show Trump at or slightly above 40 percent. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts the president's approval rating at 41 percent, a noticeable bump from August, when the rating was often in the mid-30s. For much of the second half of August, Trump's approval rating in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll was either 34 percent or 35 percent, historically a low mark for a new president. On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July.  Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics.

The sight of Barney Clark----alive and conscious after trading his diseased heart for a metal-and-plastic pump----convinced the press, the public and many doctors that the future had arrived. It hadn't. After monitoring production of the Jarvik-7, and reviewing its effects on the 150 or so patients (most of whom got the device as a temporary measure) the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded that the machine was doing more to endanger lives than to save them. Last week the agency cancelled its earlier approval, effectively banning   the device. The recall may hurt Symbion Inc., maker of the Jarvik-7, but it won't end the request for an artificial heart. One problem with the banned mode is that the tubes connecting it to an external power source created a passage for infection.

The school said Tuesday Zeta Beta Tau's Fraternity's closing is effective immediately.      It comes a week after the school suspended the fraternity, and ZBT's international office expelled three of its members after saying they had behaved inappropriately.      The school previously said it's charging the fraternity with obscene behavior, public intoxication, theft, causing physical or other harm and damage to property.      The situation occurred while the fraternity and veterans were at the Laketown Wharf Resort the weekend of April 18.      --------------------------      UPDATE: March 23 12:30 p.m.      Emory University released this statement Thursday morning by email:      \\"Emory University was appalled to learn of acts of disrespect and harassment that were directed at attendees of the Warrior Beach Retreat in Florida this past weekend.      Our brave veterans who have sacrificed much for our country deserve the utmost respect and appreciation for their service.      The disrespectful behavior exhibited by students toward our veterans is not acceptable and will not be tolerated by members of the Emory community.      When Emory received complaints that students from one of our fraternities might be involved, Campus Life administrators immediately began an investigation. To date, no evidence has been found to implicate Emory students in these reported incidents. If any members of our community are identified as being responsible, they will be held accountable for their actions by the university.

It is hard for me to believe that no Emory student was a part of this.

It's been more amazing than I ever thought it would be,\\" said Gina Harden, the wife of a wounded veteran.      Our community has always gone above and beyond to give them a heroes welcome. However, during this Warrior Beach Retreat it was a different story when it comes to some of our visitors.      Some veterans say they now know how Vietnam Veterans felt when they came home. They say they were subjected to similar harassment by a group of college students.      \\"They actually spit on me and my service dog as well, and that's just so disrespectful and it hurts. I come and I feel honored and I feel safe and that I belong, but now I feel like I'm defending myself,\\" said wounded veteran Nicholas Connole.      Veterans say they were shocked at the level of disrespect these college students had. They told me that they threw beer on them from their balconies and even spit on them.      Linda Cope, founder of the Warrior Beach Retreat, says she's never seen such disgusting behavior.      \\"They're a total disgrace for our military,\\" she siad. \\"They were urinating on the American flag they were throwing things off of the balconies.\\"      These injured soldiers were staying at the Lake Town Wharf Resort at the same time students in the fraternity Zeta Beta Tau from the University of Florida and Emory University were in town for their spring formal.      \\"I have not stood up and said anything about spring break because we constantly want to get the support of the community, but if this is at all indicative of what these college students do we need to get rid of it,\\" said Cope.

Cope also received a letter of apology from the University of Florida fraternity's president, who was there during the incidents, but she still has not heard anything from Emory University. ||||| A University of Florida fraternity accused of hurling bottles and insults at a group of wounded combat veterans in Panama City Beach was closed Tuesday, just days after the launch of a misconduct investigation by the university.      “Vice President of Student Affairs Dave Kratzer said on Friday we would deal swiftly with this and we have,” said Janine Sikes, UF assistant vice president for media relations.      Kratzer, a retired U.S. Army general, said he was disgusted by the reports of the way the students treated military vets at the Laketown Wharf resort.      The UF chapter of Zeta Beta Tau was already on probation for a hazing incident last fall involving sleep deprivation when it was charged Friday with public drunkenness, obscene behavior, causing physical harm, theft, and property damage.      “I continue to be saddened and disappointed by the reported mistreatment and disrespect of our military veterans,” UF President Kent Fuchs said in a prepared statement. “Our university has always honored, and will always honor, the service of veterans.”      UF has refused to say whether any fraternity members have been suspended or expelled as a result of the incident, citing federal privacy laws.      About 60 veterans at the Warrior Beach Retreat were staying as guests of the Laketown Wharf in Panama City Beach two weekends ago when members of ZBT fraternity members attending their spring formal yelled at them, spat on them, tore flags off their cars, and threw beer bottles at them, according to people attending the veterans retreat.      Panama City Beach police were called, but let hotel management handle the situation. The management kicked the fraternity off the property. No police report was filed.      After receiving information on the incident last week, the university charged the fraternity — already on probation for a hazing incident last fall — with obscene behavior, public drunkenness, causing physical or other harm, theft and property damage.      The university worked with the fraternity's parent organization to come to a mutual decision on closing the UF chapter.      “We are absolutely disgusted by the accusations that have been made regarding the behavior of members of this chapter,” ZBT International Fraternity President Matthew J. Rubins said in a news release. “ZBT will work diligently to demonstrate that the alleged behavior of a few does not represent the values of the many.”      Zeta Beta Tau is conducting its own investigation into the matter.      Linda Cope, founder of the Warrior Beach Retreat, a nonprofit group based in Panama City Beach, said she was pleased with the rapid response of the university and the international fraternity.      “The nation needs to see they're not going to take this lightly,” Cope said.      Because of numerous threats against the fraternity posted on social media, including death threats, the fraternity has removed the name and photo of the chapter president from its website. Also, UF has posted campus police at the fraternity house.      The safety and security of the rest of the UF campus was another reason behind the decision to close the chapter, Sikes said.      UF Department of Student Affairs is helping to find alternate housing for the students living in the frat house and letting students vacate when they are done with their final exams, Sikes said. The spring semester ends this week.      Zeta Beta Tau was renting the house owned by Sigma Phi Epsilon, popularly known as “Sig Ep.” Sig Ep was kicked off campus in January 2013 following accusations of hazing, underage drinking and theft. Sigma Phi Epsilon's international organization withdrew the chapter's charter before a hearing could be held.      Sig Ep will not be returning to campus in the fall, Sikes said.      ZBT was also the subject of a hazing investigation last fall after university officials received separate complaints of pledges being forced to stay up all night, sit cross-legged on the floor for several hours and perform physical acts that made them vomit.      Jack Causseaux, UF director of Sorority and Fraternity Affairs, reported on Oct. 21 that he got a call from a staff member reporting that a student complained he was forced to sit “Indian style” on a floor for seven hours while fraternity members grilled him, and that it was affecting his academic performance.      On the same day, the Office of Student Affairs received a separate phone call from the father of another pledge saying his son was forced to stay awake all night and well into the next morning and perform “lots of cleaning” and physical activity that made some of the other pledges vomit.      In November, the fraternity was accused of two counts of hazing — one for conduct that interferes with a student's academic performance, and another for activities that threaten a student's physical or mental health and safety.      In December, the fraternity was placed on probation with sanctions that included suspension or expulsion if any other violations were committed.      Two months after the fraternity was placed on probation, Cory Baach, the chapter's executive vice president, was arrested and charged with breaking the sideview mirror of a SNAP van after the driver refused to let him in the van, authorities said.      Baach agreed to a pretrial diversion program on April 17 to avoid prosecution. ||||| UF chapter of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity to close Posted: Tuesday, April 28, 2015 3:12 PM EDT Updated: Tuesday, May 5, 2015 3:12 PM EDT      The University of Florida chapter of Zeta Beta Tau will close in the wake of misconduct allegations following a recent event in the Florida Panhandle, officials from the national organization and the University of Florida announced Tuesday.

Federal law prohibits the university from discussing individual students in this matter.      April 24, 2015      GAINESVILLE, Fla. --- The University of Florida today placed the Zeta Beta Tau chapter on interim suspension and charged the organization with a series of offenses as part of its formal investigation into allegations of disturbing illegal behavior toward veterans while at an event in Panama City last weekend.      The chapter is charged with causing physical or other harm, obscene behavior, public intoxication, theft and damage to property. An interim suspension means the organization is suspended from all activities. There will be a complete investigation by the university.      “I am personally offended and disappointed by the behavior that has been described to me,” said Student Affairs Vice President Dave Kratzer, also a retired U.S. Army major general and combat veteran. “This is not representative of our students or of the university.”      Panama City police responded to the incident and no charges were filed. UF policies establish standards of conduct for individuals and organizations, and officials are addressing the situation through appropriate channels. The fraternity is currently on probation at UF for hazing during the fall semester, and as a result faces stiffer penalties if found to be in violation.      Federal laws prohibit the university from discussing anything about the conduct process for individuals.      The University of Florida takes pride in serving the veteran community in many ways and will continue to do so, using this opportunity as a teaching moment.      The Collegiate Veterans Society, a UF student organization, has reached out to the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity to propose a restorative justice meeting, and the Collegiate Veterans Success Center on campus hosted discussions with veterans to talk through the situation. Kratzer also will contact local veterans groups, and a team from UF and ZBT will offer to attend each group’s meetings to hear concerns.      UF President Kent Fuchs, UF’s dean of students and UF’s director of sorority and fraternity affairs have reached out to apologize to Warrior Beach Retreat founder Linda Cope and the individual veterans who reported the incident. The president’s letter is included as part of this release.      The ZBT chapter and the national organization also have apologized. The national office has placed the organization on interim suspension awaiting the conclusion of a full investigation.      “In the days and weeks ahead, I assure you that the University of Florida will address this immediate situation as well as reinforce the long term commitment to community service and respect for others that have always been hallmarks of the University of Florida community,” Kratzer said.

Richard and Emmeline (now portrayed by Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields) begin to fall in love, although this is emotionally stressful for them because of their lack of education on human sexuality. Emmeline is frightened after she begins her first menstrual period; confused about it, she refuses to allow Richard to inspect her for what he imagines is a cut. Sometime later, their relationship suffers a major blow when a ship appears for the first time in years. Richard's desire to leave comes into conflict with Emmeline's desire to stay, and she does not light the signal fire. As a result, the ship passes by without noticing them. Richard's fury leads him to kick Emmeline out of their hut. They make up for this fight after Emmeline is nearly killed upon stepping on a stonefish and Richard admits to his fear of losing her.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Goldfrapp are an English electronic music duo from London, formed in 1999. The duo consists of Alison Goldfrapp (vocals, synthesizer) and Will Gregory (synthesizer). Despite favourable reviews and a short-listing for the Mercury Prize, their 2000 debut studio album Felt Mountain did not chart highly. Goldfrapp's second album Black Cherry, which incorporated glam rock and synthpop sounds into their music, was released in 2003. Goldfrapp's second album Black Cherry was released in April 2003. The band recorded the album in a darkened studio in Bath, England. The album focused more heavily on dance music and glam rock-inspired synths than its predecessor. Alison Goldfrapp commented that the album differed from Felt Mountain because the band \\"felt that we really didn't want to repeat what we had done...we kind of wanted to do something that felt equally as fresh to us as the first one felt fresh to us, and we wanted to put more kind of \\"oomph\\" in it.\\" The album received positive reviews from critics. The Guardian found it to be an \\"unexpected delight\\" and About.com called it a \\"rare electronica album of warmth and depth...the ultimate chillout pleasure\\". Black Cherry peaked at number 19 on the UK Albums Chart and number four on the Billboard Top Electronic Albums chart in the United States. It sold well, reaching platinum status in the UK and selling 52,000 copies in the US as of August 2006.  The first single released from the album was \\"Train\\", which reached number 23 on the UK Singles Chart. The song's lyrics discuss obsession and overindulgence and were inspired by Goldfrapp's visit to Los Angeles while touring in support of Felt Mountain. \\"Strict Machine\\" was released as the album's second single. The song proved successful on several formats, and reached number one on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. In 2004, \\"Strict Machine\\" won an Ivor Novello Award for \\"Best Dance Single\\". The third single released from Black Cherry was \\"Twist\\", a song inspired by a fantasy that Goldfrapp had about a boy who worked in a fairground. The title track was released as the album's fourth single and reached number 28 in the UK.  In 2003, Alison Goldfrapp modified her image, from a sophisticated Marlene Dietrich inspired look to that of a new wave diva. The reinvented image included false eyelashes, customised T-shirts, military uniforms and fishnet stockings. Starting in March 2003, the band toured the album, with a concert series entitled Black Cherry Tour. In 2004, the band further toured Australia, Japan, Europe and North America and embarked on the Wonderful Electric Tour. Sections of the stage show featured Goldfrapp in a white dress wearing a horse tail and dancers with deer heads, and were inspired by Goldfrapp's interest in animals and mythology. was the album a success","output":"Yes, the album was a success. As stated in the article, \\"Black Cherry peaked at number 19 on the UK Albums Chart and number four on the Billboard Top Electronic Albums chart in the United States.

The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), one of the asylum's orderlies, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape. At the moment she is lobotomized, Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster. She befriends four other dancers Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), and Rocket's sister and \\"star of the show\\", Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish).

Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part  # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Instructions: In mathematics, the absolute value of a number is the non-negative value of that number, without regarding its sign. For example, the absolute value of -2 is 2, and the absolute value of 5 is 5. In this task you will be given a list of numbers and you need to return the element with highest absolute value. If a negative and positive element have the same absolute value you should return the positive element. The absolute value for negative numbers can be found by multiplying them by -1. After finding the element with the maximum absolute value you should return the value of that element before you applied the absolute value. Input: [-60.61   64.219  -1.133  83.413] Output:","output":"Part #1: Finding the absolute value of a number. Usage: The absolute value of -2 is |-2| = 2 because multiplying -2 by -1 gives 2, which is a non-negative value. The absolute value of 5 is |5| = 5 because it is already non-negative. Part #2: Given a list of numbers. Usage: A list of numbers is a sequence of numeric values, such as [-60.61, 64.219, -1.133, 83.413]. This list has four numerical elements: two positive and two negative. Part #3: Identifying the element with the highest absolute value. Usage: In the list of numbers [-60.61, 64.219, -1.133, 83.413], we first find the absolute values of each element: [60.61, 64.219, 1.133, 83.413]. The element with the highest absolute value is 83.413 because it is the largest non-negative value in the list of absolute values. Part #4: If a negative and positive element have the same absolute value, return the positive element. Usage: In the list of numbers [-5, 5], both elements have the same absolute value of 5. However, we must return the positive element, which is 5. Part #5: Return the value of the element with the highest absolute value before applying the absolute value. Usage: In the list of numbers [-60.61, 64.219, -1.133, 83.413], we have identified 83.413 as the element with the highest absolute value. Since this element is already positive, we don't need to reverse the absolute value. The output is 83.413."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here are the steps: Step 1: Identify the equation 349 = 41*s - 307 Step 2: To isolate s, we should first get rid of -307 on the right side of the equation. We can do this by adding 307 to both sides of the equation. 349 + 307 = 41*s - 307 + 307 Step 3: Perform the operations on both sides of the equation. 656 = 41 * s Step 4: Now we need to isolate s by removing the multiplication by 41. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 41. 656 / 41 = ∗ s or s = 656 / 41 Step 5: Perform the division. s = 16 So, the solution to the equation 349 = 41*s - 307 for s is s = 16."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Berg mountains in Berg county are of a volcanic nature, very massive, few caves. The Gorge mountains in Gorge county are made of sedimentary rocks, predominantly limestone. They were exposed to water and that lead to karst lanscapes, caves, blue holes, stalactites and stalagmites.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which of the two mountains had fewer karst landscapes?  Hint: About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock. The answer to this question is:","output":"The Berg mountains. Step 1: Identify the types of rocks in each mountain range. - Berg mountains: volcanic rocks - Gorge mountains: sedimentary rocks, predominantly limestone Step 2: Understand the relationship between limestone and karst landscapes. - Limestone is a sedimentary rock that is soluble in water and weak acid solutions, which leads to the formation of karst landscapes. Step 3: Evaluate the formations in each mountain range. - Berg mountains have a volcanic nature, which typically does not have any limestone. Thus, they have very few karst landscapes. - Gorge mountains have limestone formations, which have been exposed to water and led to the development of karst landscapes, caves, blue holes, stalactites, and stalagmites. Step 4: Compare the karst landscape presence in both mountain ranges. - The Berg mountains, being of volcanic nature, tend to have the least amount of karst landscapes. - The Gorge mountains, being composed primarily of limestone, have a higher amount of karst landscapes. Conclusion: The Berg mountains in Berg County had fewer karst landscapes as they are mainly composed of volcanic rocks, whereas the Gorge mountains in Gorge County are composed of limestone which contributes to karst landscape formation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered a thinly veiled criticism of China, even while insisting on closer relations with Beijing, during a speech Friday in Singapore.  Speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size.  \\"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\\" the Indian prime minister said. \\"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\\"  While those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.  India has grown close with the U.S., especially as China projects its growing military power beyond its shores.  The U.S.-India relationship, Modi said, \\"has resumed new significance in the changing world.\\" An important aspect of that partnership is \\"a shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\\" he added.  For decades, India has embraced a non-aligned status, which means it does not choose sides between world powers. In keeping with that position, Modi warned against a \\"return to great power rivalries.\\"  The Indian prime minister also insisted that \\"Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other's interests.\\" India is the world's largest democracy. It has the world's seventh-largest economy. Within a decade, it is expected to pass China to become the world's most populous country.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Three Little Bops Context: The short opens with a display of the book that shows the Three Little Pigs who used to play pipes and dance jigs. The short then focuses to the present day and reveals the pigs now play modern instruments and perform as The Three Little Bops. During a gig at the House of Straw, the Big Bad Wolf appears and proves he is friendly by stating that he wants to join the band. The Wolf happens to be terrible at playing his choice instrument (a trumpet) so the pigs throw him out. Feeling insulted, the Wolf retaliates by blowing down the straw house, forcing the pigs to go to the Dew Drop Inn, the House of Sticks. Things go well (including the piano playing pig doing an imitation of Liberace's \\"I wish my brother George was here\\"), until the Wolf comes in and attempts to play his trumpet again. Like the pigs, the people watching also think the wolf's playing is corny, so they call for the pigs to \\"throw the square out\\", which they do. Again, the Wolf retaliates by blowing down, or \\"dropping out,\\" the Dew Drop Inn. The pigs then realize that in order to escape the Wolf's \\"windy tricks,\\" they will go to the House of Bricks (built in May 1st 1776, according to a cornerstone). Coincidentally, another relevant event related to that date is the foundation of the Illuminati Society. For the pigs, the House of Bricks has a \\"No Wolves Allowed\\" rule, so when the Wolf tries to get in, he is punched in the face by a bouncer. Then he tried to ram the door down with a log but with no success. The Wolf runs out of breath in trying to blow away the club, but thinks he can get in by disguising himself. He reenters in fur coat and ukulele with his perfect rendition of the Charleston song (cut short by slipping on a strategically thrown banana peel). He returns in the disguise of a houseplant with his trumpet but gets blasted outside by a plunger shot from the double bass. For his third try, the Wolf shows up in a drum major outfit playing a big bass drum to the tune of \\"Don't Give Up the Ship\\". A dart is shot into the drum to deflate...

By late 1990, Phish's concerts were becoming more and more intricate, often making a consistent effort to involve the audience in the performance. In a special \\"secret language\\", the audience would react in a certain manner based on a particular musical cue from the band. For instance, if Anastasio \\"teased\\" a motif from The Simpsons theme song, the audience would yell, \\"D'oh!\\" in imitation of  Homer Simpson . In 1992, Phish introduced a collaboration between audience and band called the \\"Big Ball Jam\\" in which each band member would throw a large beach ball into the audience and play a note each time his ball was hit. In so doing, the audience was helping to create an original composition.  In an experiment known as \\"The Rotation Jam\\", each member would switch instruments with the musician on his left. On occasion, a performance of \\"You Enjoy Myself\\" involved Gordon and Anastasio performing synchronized maneuvers, jumping on mini-trampolines while simultaneously playing their instruments.  Phish, along with Bob Dylan, the Grateful Dead, and the Beatles, was one of the first bands to have a Usenet newsgroup, rec.music.phish, which launched in 1991. Aware of the band's growing popularity, Elektra Records signed them that year. The following year A Picture of Nectar was complete: their first major studio release, enjoying far more extensive production than either 1988's Junta or 1990's Lawn Boy. These albums were eventually re-released on Elektra, as well.  The first annual H.O.R.D.E. festival in 1992 provided Phish with their first national tour of major amphitheaters.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"In order to analyze if the premise entails the hypothesis, let's break down each one: Premise: The agency policy necessitates assigning accountability for recording and maintaining 'T.' Hypothesis: No one has the responsibility to record and maintain the minutes of the meetings. Step 1: Understand the premise The first step to determine entailment is to understand the premise. The premise here establishes that there is a firm rule within the agency to make someone responsible for recording and maintaining 'T.' However, it's not explicit what 'T' represents. Step 2: Understand the Hypothesis The hypothesis states that there is no requirement for any person to record and maintain the minutes of the meetings. This is a clear statement with no ambiguity. Step 3: Compare and Analyze  In entailment, the truth of the premise should guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. In this scenario, the premise talks about recording and maintaining 'T', but we don't know exactly what 'T' stands for. If 'T' meant \\"minutes of the meetings,\\" then the premise would directly contradict the hypothesis since the policy assigns someone to maintain 'T'. Therefore, if 'T' stands for something else, the premise doesn't say anything about the recording and maintaining of meeting minutes, thus not guaranteeing the truth of the hypothesis. Conclusion: The premise does not entail the hypothesis. Without more information about what 'T' refers to, we cannot definitively say that the premise entails the hypothesis. The statement about recording and maintaining 'T' in the premise does not directly involve maintaining and recording minutes of meetings as described in the hypothesis, hence they do not entail each other based on the information provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was the first High King of the Elven Noldor to lead his people on the journey from Middle-earth to Valinor in the blessed realm of Aman. He was a great friend of Elu Thingol, the King of Doriath. The story of Finwë and Míriel, his first wife, has been described as an important element of Tolkien's mythology. \\"The Silmarillion\\", prepared by Christopher Tolkien from his father's unpublished writings, only briefly mentions the tale, although sources suggest that Tolkien had intended to incorporate a fuller version.  - Fëanor is a fictional character from J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium who plays an important part in \\"The Silmarillion\\". He was the eldest son of Finwë, the High King of the Noldor, and his first wife Míriel Serindë. Fëanor's mother, Míriel, died shortly after giving birth, having given all her strength and essence to him.  - In J. R. R. Tolkien 's legendarium , Amrod ( IPA : ( amrod ) ) is a fictional character . He was the youngest son of Fëanor and the younger twin of Amras . From their mother Nerdanel they inherited red hair , instead of Fëanor 's black . Amrod 's father name in Quenya is Telufinwë , \`\` Last Finwë '' , for he was the last of Fëanor 's sons . His mother name was originally Ambarussa ( \`\` top - russet '' , referring to his hair ) , the same as his brother Amras , but Fëanor insisted that the twins ought to have different names and Nerdanel later called him Umbarto , \`\` the Fated '' . His father , disturbed by it , changed it to Ambarto . Nevertheless , both twins called each other Ambarussa . However \`\` Umbarto '' proved to be a prophetic name , for Amrod was accidentally killed in the swan ships of the Teleri , when his father ordered them to be burnt at Losgar .  - A pen name (\\"nom de plume\\", or \\"literary double\\") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their \\"real\\" name. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge.  - The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel written by English author J. R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel \\"The Hobbit\\", but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.  - In the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Noldor (also spelled Ñoldor, meaning \\"those with knowledge\\" in Quenya) are High Elves of the Second Clan who migrated to Valinor and lived in Eldamar. The Noldor are called \\"Golodhrim\\" or \\"Gódhellim\\" in Sindarin, and \\"Goldui\\" by Teleri of Tol Eressëa. The singular form of the Quenya noun is \\"Noldo\\" and the adjective is \\"Noldorin\\". They were the Second Clan of the Elves in both order and size, the other clans being the Vanyar and the Teleri. Like the Teleri, they typically had grey eyes and dark hair (except for those who had Vanyarin blood, most prominently the members of the House of Finarfin).  - The Hobbit, or There and Back Again is a children's fantasy novel by English author J.

Answer the following question: What is the full name of the person who denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate's discussion of a book written by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  According to the Dictionary of American Hymnology \\"Amazing Grace\\" is John Newton's spiritual autobiography in verse.In 1725, Newton was born in Wapping, a district in London near the Thames. His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a Catholic but had Protestant sympathies, and his mother was a devout Independent unaffiliated with the Anglican Church. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old. For the next few years, Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother while his father was at sea, and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated. At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience. As a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, a book by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, with him. In a series of letters he later wrote, \\"Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the Gospel at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me.\\" His disobedience caused him to be pressed into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit Mary \\"Polly\\" Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love. After enduring humiliation for deserting, he managed to get himself traded to a slave ship where he began a career in slave trading. Answer:","output":"The full name of the person who denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate's discussion of a book written by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury is John Newton."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Get a wire coat hanger and shape it into a ring. The easiest way to do this would be to slide it over a 5-gallon (18.5-L) bucket. Pull the hanger off of the bucket when you are done. Use some pliers to untwist the wire at the top of the hanger. Open up the hanger; you will be stringing the flowers onto the hanger, then twisting it back together. Leave the hook intact; do not cut the hanger. Purchase a bunch of fake flowers with wired stems; they must have wired stems or the next step won't work. Use wire cutters to cut the flowers so that the stems are 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) long. If there are any leaves on the cut stems, be sure to pull those off too.  Large flowers, such as roses or peonies work the best for this. How many flowers you buy depends on how big they are and how full you want the wreath to be. You are not attaching these to the hanger just yet. Instead, twist the flower stem into a loop about halfway down. When you are done, you'll have a flower with a short stem that has a loop at the bottom.  Repeat this step for all of your flowers. Use a skewer or knitting needle to form the loops. They need to be small enough to slide onto the hanger. The wreath should be full enough so that the flowers don't slide around.  You can fit more flowers by rotating the flowers around the wreath in a spiral rather than stacking them together. Do not cover the twisted part of the coat hanger, or you won't be able to reassemble it. Move the flowers aside if needed, then twist the wires back together like they used to be. Once your wreath is reassembled, hang it up somewhere using the hook. You can reuse this wreath base simply by untwisting it, pulling off the old flowers, then adding new ones.","output":"This article explains how to create a wreath using a wire coat hanger and fake flowers with wired stems by shaping the hanger into a ring, cutting the stems, looping the flowers, and attaching them to the hanger."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - believe in god - migraine - complete high school - die suddenly - cross river  I believe the correct choice is \\"die suddenly\\", here's why: The answer is:","output":"\\"die suddenly\\", here's why: When a bullet penetrates the skull and enters the brain, it can cause severe damage to the brain tissue, blood vessels, and surrounding structures. The brain is a vital organ responsible for controlling all bodily functions, including breathing, heartbeat, and consciousness. Consequently, such an injury can result in immediate death. There are several reasons why \\"die suddenly\\" is the most likely outcome when a person is shot in the head: 1. Massive brain damage: A bullet can cause widespread destruction of vital areas in the brain, leading to an instant loss of consciousness and an inability to sustain basic life functions such as breathing and circulation. 2. Hemorrhage and swelling: The injury can lead to significant bleeding inside the skull, which can cause increased pressure on the brain. This can lead to a rapid decline in brain function and ultimately prove fatal. 3. Damage to the brainstem: The brainstem controls essential functions such as breathing and heart rate. If the bullet penetrates or damages the brainstem, it can cause an immediate cessation of these functions, resulting in sudden death. It is important to note that not everyone who suffers a gunshot wound to the head will die instantly, as various factors such as bullet size, speed, trajectory, and location of injury can influence the outcome. However, the majority of individuals who experience a gunshot wound to the head will suffer severe, often fatal consequences, making \\"die suddenly\\" the most probable answer.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi touted the agreement in a letter to her Democratic colleagues, saying negotiators \\"fought for and achieved drastic reductions to the Trump/GOP plan,\\" including much less funding for the wall than Trump requested and a limit on the number of immigrants that can be...

Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"No, those questions do not have the same meaning. They both ask about charging times for batteries, but they are pertaining to different types of batteries used in different applications. 1) How long does it take to charge a Nikon camera battery? The time it takes to charge a Nikon camera battery depends on the specific battery model and the charger being used. Most Nikon camera batteries are Li-ion or Lithium-polymer batteries, and their charging times may differ. Here's a breakdown of approximate charging times for some common Nikon camera batteries: - Nikon EN-EL14a (used in Nikon D3300, D3400, D3500, D5300, D5500, D5600, etc.): It takes around 1.5 to 2.5 hours to charge this battery fully, using the Nikon MH-24 Quick Charger. - Nikon EN-EL15 (used in Nikon D610, D750, D800, D810, D850, D500, D7500, D7200, etc.): It takes around 2 to 3 hours to charge this battery fully, using the Nikon MH-25a Quick Charger. - Nikon EN-EL20 (used in Nikon 1 J1, 1 J2, 1 J3, 1 S1, etc.): It takes around 2.5 to 3 hours to charge this battery fully, using the Nikon MH-27 Charger. - Nikon EN-EL3e (used in Nikon D50, D70, D70s, D80, D90, D100, D200, D300, D300S, D700): It takes around 2 hours to charge this battery fully, using the Nikon MH-18a Quick Charger. Please note that these charging times are approximate, and various factors like battery age, temperature, and charger performance can affect the actual charging time. 2) How long does it take to charge a 12v 85 MH battery? The question seems to have a typo and should be asking about charging a 12v 85Ah (85 amp-hours) battery. The charging time for a 12v 85Ah battery depends on the type of battery (lead-acid, AGM, gel, lithium, etc.) and the charger's output amperage. To calculate the charging time, you can use the following formula: Charging time (hours) = (Battery Capacity (Ah) / Charger Output Current (Amps))  * 1.2 (Factor for inefficiencies) For example, if you have a 12v 85Ah battery and a charger with 10A output current: Charging time (hours) = (85Ah / 10A) * 1.2 ≈ 10.2 hours This calculation assumes that the battery is fully discharged and needs to be charged up to its full capacity. In practice, the charging time may vary depending on battery type, how discharged the battery is, and other factors like temperature and battery age. In summary, the two questions are not the same. One refers to Nikon camera batteries, while the other pertains to a larger 12v battery typically used in automotive or marine applications. The charging times will depend on specific battery models, capacity, chargers, and various factors affecting the charging process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has an indirect effect on the process. When the storm passes and the sky is filled with clouds, the amount of sunlight reaching the greenhouse is reduced. This decrease in sunlight will cause less sunlight to pass through the glass into the greenhouse, and therefore less absorbed sunlight will be converted to heat.

On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle; on the first day, Charles disposed of 110,000 soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon. By the second day, reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70,000. The battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal points of the French bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling. A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island. Both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other.

Write an article based on this \\"Two Indians who were taken hostage in a cafe by a gunman in Sydney, Australia, are safe, India's foreign minister Sushma Swaraj has tweeted.\\"","output":"Title: Indian Hostages Emerge Safely from Sydney Siege: A Triumph of International Cooperation Introduction In a harrowing incident that made international headlines, two Indian nationals found themselves in the midst of a hostile situation at a cafe in Sydney, Australia. Faced with a dangerous gunman, the tense stand-off finally concluded with a successful rescue operation, and the Indian hostages were later confirmed to have made it out unscathed. News of the hostages' safety brought a collective sigh of relief, especially from the Indian expatriate community and authorities of both countries. This event serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of global cooperation and coordination in crisis situations. The Hostage Incident On an otherwise ordinary day at the Lindt Chocolate Café in Sydney, Australia, unsuspecting patrons found themselves at the mercy of a captor armed with a gun and a vicious agenda. The armed individual claimed to have planted explosives in the café and in the surrounding area, thereby posing a significant threat to multiple lives. The hostages, including two Indian nationals among those held inside the café, were thrust into a nerve-wracking dilemma as the Australian authorities worked painstakingly to neutralize the threat and diffuse the situation. As the drama unfolded, live updates streamed across news channels and social media platforms, making it evident that the crisis had captured the world's attention. Role of the Indian Foreign Minister Upon learning about the situation, India's foreign minister, Sushma Swaraj, actively followed the event; she maintained regular communication with the Indian Consulate in Sydney to gather accurate information about the incident. The foreign minister remained available for updates around the clock, ensuring that the Indian embassy offered all necessary support to the affected Indian nationals in Sydney. Swaraj's perseverance in the matter exemplifies the proactive engagement of the foreign minister in real-time crisis management, particularly when fellow Indian citizens are at stake. International news providers and social media lauded her diligent efforts and praised her quick response to the escalating danger. Safe and Sound The hostage crisis spanned over 16 hours, finally ending with the storming of the café by heavily armed police officers. A series of gunshots and loud bangs dominated the scene, captivating the attention of onlookers and media personnel. The resulting chaos left three people dead, including the gunman, but thankfully for the Indian nationals trapped in this perilous situation, they emerged from the café safe and sound. A Triumphant Show of Global Coordination Upon the hostages' safe release, foreign minister Sushma Swaraj triumphantly took to Twitter to express her relief and gratitude, stating that both Indian hostages were \\"safe\\" and that the Indian Consulate kept her informed throughout the ordeal. Her tweet received an outpouring of appreciation from well-wishers and fellow politicians alike, setting an example of successful international cooperation during times of crisis. This incident stands as a testament to the necessity of global solidarity, particularly in distinguishing between innocent civilians and those who wish to do harm. The successful resolution – and the safety of the hostages – following this potentially catastrophic ordeal serves as a beacon of hope for the progress of international coordination in the face of uncertainty. Conclusion The ordeal of the Indian hostages and the critical role of India's foreign minister during this crisis underscore the importance of global collaboration and solidarity. In a world where the threat of violence can come from any corner, the coordinated actions of the governments and brave first responders of both India and Australia conveyed a strong message of dedication to the safety of their citizens. The safe return of the Indian nationals underlines that despite the turmoil that occasionally besets the world, there remains a steadfast commitment to making the world a safer place."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), an asylum orderly, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape. Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster, where she and the other patients are sex slaves.

Then, the reviewer mentions that they have tried different poachers, which shows that they have a basis for comparison and that this particular poacher is not satisfactory in comparison to others. The main complaints about the product highlight its inability to fulfill its primary function: being non-stick. The reviewer states that, even when using spray oil or butter, the poacher still sticks and is challenging to clean. This criticism demonstrates that the product's performance is not up to par with what the user needs, resulting in a negative overall impression. Additionally, the review reveals that the user has to resort to leaving the product to soak, which further underscores the inconvenience caused by the product's shortcomings.

However, the Commonwealth forces suffered defeats between Vyazma and Mozhaisk, and Chodkiewicz's plans for a counterattack and an advance to Moscow failed. Władysław did not have enough forces to advance to Moscow again, especially because the Russian support  for the Poles was all but gone by that time. In response to Władysław's invasion, the burghers of Smolensk revolted against Polish rule, and the Polish troops had to fight their way back as they retreated from the city. However, in 1617 Polish forces, besieged in Smolensk  by Russian forces, were relieved by Lisowczycy, when Russian forces retreated to Bely soon after receiving news that Lisowczycy, then commanded by Stanisław Czapiński, had appeared in the area. In 1618 Petro Sahaidachny's campaign against Muscovy resulted in sacking numerous forts such as Putivl, Kursk, Yelets, and others. Together with Chodkiewicz he laid siege to Moscow in September 1618. Due to unclear reasons, both Hetmans failed to take the city. Negotiations began and a peace treaty was signed in 1618. Answer this question: What happened first, the failure of  advance on Moscow, or the revolt against Polish rule?","output":"The failure to advance on Moscow happened first. After the rapid surrender of Dorogobuzh and Vyazma in October 1617 and recognizing Władysław as the tsar, the Commonwealth forces faced defeats between Vyazma and Mozhaisk. Hetman Chodkiewicz's plans for a counterattack and an advance to Moscow failed as Władysław did not have enough forces to reach Moscow again, and Russian support for the Poles had dwindled. In response to Władysław's invasion, the burghers of Smolensk revolted against Polish rule, which followed the failed advance on Moscow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He lives in Washington. @jamesoliphant ||||| I'm headed off to a D.C. eating and drinking establishment where I'll join supporters of Obama-Biden 2012 and watch the GOP candidates debate. My preview, with advice and sample lines for the contenders, is here. Starting at 8 p.m. ET, I'll be analyzing the goings-on in this space and tweeting as my funnier, more concise alter ego @daveweigel. John Dickerson will rule the Slate homepage after that with his own analysis.            In the meantime, here's Christopher Hitchens discussing Rick Perry's old friend Al Gore.      8:04: Rick Perry's first time at bat goes... perfectly well. He was at unlike Bush as it's genetically possible for him to be, with a happy disarming rebuttal to Brian Williams's charge that Texas has mostly been creating minimum wage jobs. \\"Actually, the first part of that statement is incorrect.\\"            8:07: And it's Perry with the first jab: \\"We created more jobs in the last three months in Texas than he created in four years in Massachusetts.\\" Also true! Also the attack Democrats have been making!      8:10: Romney's attack on Romney was actually meaner than the one I suggested, even if the substance was similiar -- crediting the success of Perry's state to forces beyond his temporal control. It's... not effective. For starters, Perry had to govern through some periods where conservatives lost clout and it was tougher to get votes, like 2009-2011. And it's not a little whiny.      8:13: A little cognitive dissonance there, as the limitations of time and pre-debate research makes it sound like these Republicans are crediting themselves with their states' good job growth.      8:16: One flaw with the Huntsman grand strategy is that independents like all sorts of things. They like lobbyist-bashing and special interest bashing. Ron Paul loves doing that. I see no reason why an angry independent would be happier with Paul than he was with Huntsman.            8:19: Why won't President Obama talk to Herman Cain, as Gingrich demands? The obvious answer: Racism.      8:23: Like I said, I'm watching this from a bar full of Obama supporters. There are some candidates who reduce them to silence, and some whom they talk over. There is dead silence for Perry, mostly silence for Romney, the same level of din for Bachmann, and chatter over everyone else.      8:25: Bachmann wrestles and defeats a total strawman -- who thinks that any of these candidates would simply issue an executive order and call it a day, instead of pushing for PPACA repeal legislation? Her promise to elect 13 Republican senators is needlessly over the top, because a strong argument can be made that most of the bill, which was passed by reconciliation, can be repealed by reconciliation.      8:29: Newt takes my advice, and belittles the media -- which has been insanely charitable to him, given that he last won an election in 1998.      8:33: With Perry in the race, the rationale for Herman Cain being here has completely evaporated. The same philosophy, but less convincing answers -- with less experience to back them up.      8:38: Ah -- the long-awaited (by which I mean \\"awaited for two days\\") Perry-Paul showdown! Perry goes easier than Paul than he could have, because his letter criticized Ronald Reagan's tenure in ways no Republican would dare.            8:45: A mid-speech Ronald Reagan tribute video might actually entice Republicans to stay and sit for Barack Obama's jobs speech.      8:49: For now, Perry elides the Social Security question with a line crafted with care and baked at 400 degrees in a clay oven: \\"I'm not responsible for Karl any more.\\" But there is now video of Perry calling the promise of Social Security a \\"monstrous lie.\\" Fantastic for the GOP primary. Untested in a general election since, what, 1964?      8:52: FreedomWorks's Brendan Steinhauser likes Perry's answer, and tweets: \\"Rick Perry gave a fantastic answer on social security. It sets him apart on entitlements. Good for him.\\" That's a mighty fine noise from a very credible Tea Party group.            8:56: I think you can safely mix a drink or read a chapter of that new James Patterson novel during this Gardisil debate.            9:00: Don't stop Ron Paul, he's rolling. \\"Don't forget,\\" he says, \\"9/11 came about because there was too much government.\\" In a very short amount of time, he denounced, as far as I can tell, all government spending on anything, ever.            9:05: Does anyone else have incredible difficulty recalling what Huntsman says right after he's done saying it? His answers are Obamaesque, vaporous, which is partly a function of the fact that he's not being asked to respond to anyone.            9:09: In 2007, back when voters were actually somewhat interested in immigration, Barack Obama was very good at deflecting questions about it by blaming the Bush administration for fumbling on the border. Which is what Perry just did, on an issue that turns some Republicans into xenophobe lookalikes. Democrats should be getting cold sweats right now.            9:14: Bachmann's habit of leaning on campaign trail anecdotes gets a little strange. Her visit with Cubans at the Bay of Pigs museum tells her... what, exactly, about what an entirely different community of Hispanic voters think about immigration?      9:16: This is the banner image of the email Romney's campaign is sending out to attack Perry.                  9:18: I'm suddenly worried about the border fence keeping us in. Good work, Ron Paul.            9:23: Romney's new economic plan has him endorsing cut, cap, and balance. But it was Perry who got to refill his Tea Party credit card by saying he supported it.            9:27: Huntsman regains his footing by taking a sort of lame question about whether we're safer after 9/11 and using it to summarize his (very popular!) America First foreign policy.            9:30: By contrast, Perry doesn't have a concise or credible follow-through on his \\"philosophical statement\\" about war and intervention. His first pointless, meandering answer all night.            9:35: Huntsman shies away from naming who, exactly, is anti-science. If he wanted to punt, he could have said \\"Hey, I was talking about Pawlenty.\\"      9:37: Perry wins the enmity of the liberals in this bar with the line \\"Galileo got out-voted for a spell.\\"            9:43: For an ideas man, Newt Gingrich seems to completely misunderstand the threat of inflation. That said, the reappointment of Ben Bernanke, and the lack of attention to the Fed generally, may go down as the decision that ended the Obama presidency.            9:55: So, what happened? I will assign grades based on how they did for the primary, and how they did for the general.            Mitt Romney: B+ (A-). After some early grappling with Perry, he completely avoided attacks from every other candidate. Ron Paul focused on Perry. Santorum focused on Paul and Huntsman. Romney played the exact same game.      Rick Perry: B+ (C-). A proud reiteration of his view that Social Security is a \\"Ponzi scheme.\\" A jarringly cold statement of support for the death penalty in Texas, one that he walked into at the beckoning of moderators. There is video here that will scare the hell out of Democrats and construct a textbook general election campaign; that same video will delight Republicans. (The economy's rotten enough that I think Perry could run far right and narrowly win anyway.)      Jon Huntsman: D+ (B+). With fairly sympathetic questions, and a much tighter set of responses than he brought at the last debate, he reaffirmed that he will be all things to swing voters, the Republican that Democrats can stand. If I'm a standard Republican primary voter, I hate him with the heat of 1,000 suns.      Ron Paul: B (D+). I'm still stuck on the concept of a fence that could trap Americans inside the country for... some reason. With more time to explore ideas, Paul gets to deliver the best red meat conservative lines and the weirdest discursions. The more independents learn about the latter views, the less adorable he seems.            Michele Bachmann: B- (N/A). Hate to agree with the conventional wisdom, but unless something torpedoes Perry, she's no longer a factor in the race. The mannered efforts to pretend that some congressional battles have given her all the experience she needs to serve are just unbearably weak with three governors onstage.            Herman Cain: C+ (N/A). Just kind of a mess, with a tax plan that he didn't have time to explain fully.            Rick Santorum: B (N/A). What purpose is served when Rick Santorum walks onto this stage? I guess it's a nice comment on neoconservatives that the only guy left who runs on their agenda is an embittered stunt candidate, but it gets old after five or six seconds.            Newt Gingrich: B+ (N/A). He's just fighting for a legacy and the possibility that he'll be remembered fondly by the others when he leaves. He needs to re-establish the political and economic credibility he had before getting into this. By that standard, he did fine, although nothing he said will be particularly relevant to the rest of us.       ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"In this news article, the author analyzes the performances of the GOP candidates during a debate. Rick Perry and Mitt Romney receive B+ grades for their primary performances, but Perry receives a lower C- grade for the general, reflecting some controversial statements on Social Security and the death penalty that might not appeal to Democratic and Independent voters. Jon Huntsman gets a D+ for the primary but a B+ for the general, while Ron Paul, Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Rick Santorum, and Newt Gingrich receive varied grades without much potential impact on the general election. The author highlights that while certain performances might please Republican primary voters, they might not necessarily translate well into a general election campaign."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The 55-year-old man had composed a text message addressed to his brother, in which he gave \\"all that I have\\" to his brother and nephew.      The message was found in the drafts folder on the man's phone after he took his own life last year .      Brisbane Supreme Court ruled that the wording of the text indicated that the man intended it to act as his will.      In the message, the man gave details of how to access his bank account and where he had hidden money in his house.      \\"Put my ashes in the back garden,\\" he wrote. \\"A bit of cash behind TV and a bit in the bank.\\"      According to ABC News, the man's wife applied to manage his assets and argued that the text message was not valid as a will because it was never sent.      Typically, for a will to be valid in Queensland, it must be written and signed by two witnesses.      Justice Susan Brown said the wording of the text message, which ended with the words \\"my will\\", showed that the man intended it to act as his will.      \\"The reference to his house and superannuation and his specification that the applicant was to take her own things indicates he was aware of the nature and extent of his estate, which was relatively small,\\" she said.      She said the \\"informal nature\\" of the message did not stop it representing the man's intentions, especially as it was \\"created on or about the time that the deceased was contemplating death, such that he even indicated where he wanted his ashes to be placed\\".      Validity of wills      In 2006, the law in Queensland was changed to allow less formal types of documents to be considered as a will.      Another unusual will accepted in Queensland includes a DVD marked with \\"my will\\", in 2013.      The UK's Law Commission is currently fielding a public consultation on the legal rules applying to wills.      The proposals listed by the body includes giving courts the capacity to \\"dispense with the formalities for a will where it's clear what the deceased wanted\\". ||||| Unsent text on mobile counts as a will, Queensland court finds      Updated      A Queensland court has accepted a dead man's unsent, draft text message leaving his possessions to his brother and nephew instead of his wife and son, as an official will.      The Supreme Court in Brisbane heard the 55-year-old took his own life in October 2016, after composing a text addressed to his brother, which indicated his brother and nephew should \\"keep all that I have\\", because he was unhappy with this wife.            A friend found the text message in the drafts folder of the man's mobile phone, which was found near his body.      The unsent message detailed how to access the man's bank account details and where he wanted his ashes to be buried.      \\"You and [nephew] keep all that I have house and superannuation, put my ashes in the back garden … [wife] will take her stuff only she's ok gone back to her ex AGAIN I'm beaten. A bit of cash behind TV and a bit in the bank Cash card pin … My will\\"      In Queensland, if a person dies without a valid will their next of kin, such as a spouse, takes on the role of managing the deceased's estate.      The Queensland Government's website says for a will to be valid, it must be in writing and \\"signed by you in front of two witnesses, both of whom must be over 18 years old, cannot be visually impaired and should not be included as beneficiaries in the will.\\"      The man's wife applied to the Supreme Court to manage her late husband's assets, arguing the text message was not final because it was never sent.      But in her decision, Justice Susan Brown said the wording of the text, including the use of the words \\"my will\\" indicated the man knew what he was doing.      \\"The reference to his house and superannuation and his specification that the applicant was to take her own things indicates he was aware of the nature and extent of his estate, which was relatively small,\\" she said.      \\"Since the respondents stand to benefit if the text message is treated as a will, I have treated their evidence with caution and weighed it against all of the evidence.\\"      Justice Brown also found the man had no relationship with his son and while he and his wife did have happy times, there was evidence they had a \\"rocky\\" relationship.      \\"The deceased and the applicant had difficulties in their relationship and had separated on a number of occasions for short periods of time, the most recent occasion being just days before the deceased took his own life,\\" Justice Brown said.      Law changed in 2006      Queensland Law Society president and succession law specialist Christine Smyth said the law was changed in 2006 to allow for less formal types of documents to be accepted as wills.      \\"It used to be the case that if you did not strictly comply with the legislation as to the drawing of a will, it would not be considered a will,\\" she said.      Ms Smyth said while it was accepted in this case, writing a will in a text message was \\"absolutely not\\" recommended.      \\"As you read through this case, you get a sense of the amount of evidence that has to be produced to satisfy a court,\\" she said.      \\"If a person hasn't drawn a formal will, there are some significant hurdles which must be overcome to establish that the document that looks like a will, is in fact, a will.\\"      Topics: law-crime-and-justice, courts-and-trials, death, suicide, community-and-society, mobile-phones, qld      First posted ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"An unsent text message found as a draft on a deceased man's mobile phone has been accepted as an official will by a court in Australia.

Here is a question about this article: UN aerial reconnaissance had difficulty sighting PVA units in daytime, because their march and bivouac discipline minimized aerial detection. The PVA marched \\"dark-to-dark\\" (19:00–03:00), and aerial camouflage (concealing soldiers, pack animals, and equipment) was deployed by 05:30. Meanwhile, daylight advance parties scouted for the next bivouac site. During daylight activity or marching, soldiers were to remain motionless if an aircraft appeared, until it flew away; PVA officers were under order to shoot security violators. Such battlefield discipline allowed a three-division army to march the 286 miles (460 km) from An-tung, Manchuria, to the combat zone in some 19 days. Another division night-marched a circuitous mountain route, averaging 18 miles (29 km) daily for 18 days. What is the answer to this question: What made seeing the PVA units difficult during the day?","output":"The difficulty in sighting PVA units during the day can be attributed to multiple factors, which include: 1. The PVA's march and bivouac discipline minimized aerial detection: They marched during \\"dark-to-dark\\" (19:00-03:00) hours, ensuring limited visibility for aerial reconnaissance. 2. Deployment of aerial camouflage by 05:30: This concealment strategy involved hiding soldiers, pack animals, and equipment, making it difficult for aerial reconnaissance to spot them. 3. Daylight advance parties scouted for the next bivouac site, ensuring the hiding of troops during daylight hours. 4.

However, Palin herself described the symbol as a \\"bullseye.\\"      Rep. James P. Moran Jr. (D-Va.), a friend of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' (D-Ariz.) since she was elected to the House, said Sunday she told him just a week and a half ago that she was worried about the potential for violence back home. Giffords is currently in intensive care after a shooting that left six dead and 14 injured.      \\"Gabby did tell me that she was concerned,\\" Moran said. \\"She did say it's really bad out there, particularly in a district like [hers]. She was very much troubled that Sarah Palin put her in the crosshairs.\\"      Moran said Giffords explained that, unlike in his Northern Virginia district, \\"a substantial percentage\\" of her district was \\"anti-government and pro-gun\\" --- a potentially dangerous mix.      Palin's \\"Take Back the 20\\" campaign came under renewed fire after Saturday's deadly shooting. The 2010 midterm election campaign featured a map with crosshairs over Giffords' district, along with the districts of 19 other Democratic lawmakers who voted for the health-care bill.      After posting the map on her Facebook page, Palin told her Twitter followers to go there with the message \\"Don't Retreat -- Instead RELOAD!\\" At the time, Palin was accused of using unnecessarily violent rhetoric. (This weekend, the map was taken offline.)      \\"We never ever, ever intended it to be gun sights,\\" said Rebecca Mansour, who works for Palin's political action committee, in a interview with conservative radio host Tammy Bruce.      \\"It's a surveyor's symbol,\\" Bruce suggested. Mansour agreed, adding that the graphic was contracted out to a professional and approved without much thought. \\"We never imagined, it never occurred to us that anybody would consider it violent,\\" she said. It was simply \\"crosshairs that you would see on a map.\\"      There is \\"nothing irresponsible about our graphic,\\" Mansour added.      Giffords herself criticized the target map when her office was vandalized last year.      \\"For example, we're on Sarah Palin's targeted list, but the thing is, that the way that she has it depicted has the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, they have to realize that there are consequences to that action,\\" Giffords said in an interview with MSNBC.      There is a surveyor's symbol that resembles the circle used on Palin's map. (You can see it on the lower right-hand side of this U.S. Geological Survey guide to topographical map symbols). However, Palin herself referred to the targets as a \\"'bullseye' icon\\" in a post-election tweet. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"This article talks about Sarah Palin's controversial campaign target map, which had circles over certain districts.

Spain and Italy participated in a global warming global forum this year. it turns out that Spain uses lots of fossil fuel and natural gas for their economy, while Italy relies on ecological alternatives.  Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

A yarmulke, also known as a kippah, is a small, round skullcap worn by Jewish males to signify their devotion and reverence for God. Wearing a yarmulke is traditional and an important part of the Jewish faith, serving as a reminder of the individual's connection with their Creator. A synagogue is the most appropriate place where a person might wear his yarmulke, as it is a Jewish place of worship and community gathering. Synagogues serve many functions, such as a venue for prayer services, religious study, and lifecycle events. In a synagogue, individuals come together to express their shared faith within a setting that is both religious and communal. Wearing a yarmulke in a synagogue demonstrates a commitment to the Jewish faith and adherence to religious customs. Although some Jewish people choose to wear their yarmulkes throughout the day, it is not necessary to do so in places unrelated to religious practice, unless one follows a strict observance of Jewish law. Wearing a yarmulke to a demonstration, concert, garage, or bus stop might not be considered as significant or respectful as wearing one in the context of a religious gathering or ceremony.

He emphasized the importance of self-annihilation (fana) in the spiritual journey of a Sufi and illustrated it through the experience of Moses when he asked for a vision of God. In the story, although Moses' desire to see God was denied, he was deeply affected by God's manifestation upon the mountain. The mountain crumbled, and Moses fainted due to the intensity of this experience. Qushayri used this event to explain that Moses had to let go of his own self (ego) in order to truly experience a direct connection with God. This profound state of self-annihilation led to the unveiling of the deeper spiritual realities. From the Sufi perspective, God is always considered the ultimate Beloved, and the seeker's (wayfarer's) longing and suffering in their spiritual journey are essential for the realization of the divine truths."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does it follow that \\"Station IX was the station where Jesus was stripped.\\"?","output":"Based on the given information, it can be inferred that \\"Station X\\" (Jesus is stripped) is indeed the station where Jesus was stripped of his garments. This station is likely one of the Stations of the Cross depicted in the church. In the context of the Stations of the Cross, also known as the Way of the Cross or Via Crucis, these are a series of images or sculptures representing certain scenes from the Passion of Jesus Christ, particularly his journey to Calvary and his crucifixion. The Stations of the Cross are typically found in Christian churches and are used by the faithful during special liturgical seasons, such as Lent and Holy Week, to meditate and contemplate on the suffering and sacrifice of Jesus for the redemption of humanity. There are traditionally 14 stations, though some churches may have additional ones; some churches also use the Scriptural Way of the Cross introduced by Pope John Paul II in 1991, which has slightly different stations based on the Gospel accounts. The 14 traditional Stations of the Cross are as follows: 1. Jesus is condemned to death 2. Jesus carries his cross 3. Jesus falls for the first time 4. Jesus meets his mother 5. Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus carry the cross 6. Veronica wipes the face of Jesus 7. Jesus falls for the second time 8. Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem 9. Jesus falls for the third time 10. Jesus is stripped of his garments (Station X) 11. Jesus is nailed to the cross 12. Jesus dies on the cross 13. Jesus is taken down from the cross 14. Jesus is laid in the tomb Thus, according to the given information, when entering the church and navigating to the area where the Stations of the Cross are displayed, one must turn right and climb the narrow staircase to find Station X, which is where Jesus was stripped of his garments. This particular station is a poignant and powerful reminder of the humiliation and vulnerability Jesus experienced during his journey to the cross, as well as an opportunity for the faithful to reflect on their own journey of sacrificial love, self-giving, and solidarity with the suffering of others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Abstract: Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by somatic cell reprogramming involves global epigenetic remodelling. Whereas several proteins are known to regulate chromatin marks associated with the distinct epigenetic states of cells before and after reprogramming, the role of specific chromatin-modifying enzymes in reprogramming remains to be determined. To address how chromatin-modifying proteins influence reprogramming, we used short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to target genes in DNA and histone methylation pathways, and identified positive and negative modulators of iPSC generation. Whereas inhibition of the core components of the polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2, including the histone 3 lysine 27 methyltransferase EZH2, reduced reprogramming efficiency, suppression of SUV39H1, YY1 and DOT1L enhanced reprogramming. Specifically, inhibition of the H3K79 histone methyltransferase DOT1L by shRNA or a small molecule accelerated reprogramming, significantly increased the yield of iPSC colonies, and substituted for KLF4 and c-Myc (also known as MYC). Inhibition of DOT1L early in the reprogramming process is associated with a marked increase in two alternative factors, NANOG and LIN28, which play essential functional roles in the enhancement of reprogramming. Genome-wide analysis of H3K79me2 distribution revealed that fibroblast-specific genes associated with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition lose H3K79me2 in the initial phases of reprogramming. DOT1L inhibition facilitates the loss of this mark from genes that are fated to be repressed in the pluripotent state. These findings implicate specific chromatin-modifying enzymes as barriers to or facilitators of reprogramming, and demonstrate how modulation of chromatin-modifying enzymes can be exploited to more efficiently generate iPSCs with fewer exogenous transcription factors.. Title: Chromatin modifying enzymes as modulators of reprogramming A:","output":"Part 1: Identify the abstract of an article.

The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

The tourism industry began in the early 19th century when foreigners visited the Alps, traveled to the bases of the mountains to enjoy the scenery, and stayed at the spa-resorts. Large hotels were built during the Belle Époque; cog-railways, built early in the 20th century, brought tourists to ever higher elevations, with the Jungfraubahn terminating at the Jungfraujoch, well above the eternal snow-line, after going through a tunnel in Eiger. During this period winter sports were slowly introduced: in 1882 the first figure skating championship was held in St. Moritz, and downhill skiing became a popular sport with English visitors early in the 20th century, as the first ski-lift was installed in 1908 above Grindelwald.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Before you approach your parents with your wish to move, think about what your motivation is. Not only can this help you flesh out your feelings, but also help you more convincingly make your case to your parents.  Write down your reasons for wanting to move. For example, you can have things like “better educational opportunities for me and job chances for dad,” or it could be something like “the house is too big for mom to care for.”  It also helps if you have relatives where you are planning to move, with something like \\"closer to grandma and grandpa.\\" Consider keeping a list of pros and cons for moving. Think about factors such as expenses, losing friends, gaining new opportunities or helping shoulder burdens. Try and not spring on your parents immediately that you want to move. Take time to plant the seed at the right moments once you’ve had a chance to write out your own motivations.  Avoid being pushy. At times that are not rushed, mention that moving might make life a little better or easier. For example, you could say “mom, maybe we both wouldn't be so frantic to leave every morning if we didn't live so far from school\\" or “dad, maybe you’d have more energy if you didn’t have such a large space to care for.” Point out potential new places when you’re out. For example, say to your mom and dad when you’re headed to the grocery store, “wow, look at everything in this neighborhood: schools, stores, restaurants, and it’s so much closer to your jobs.” You can also say “wow, this assisted living facility has so many amenities and is really close to our house.” Once you’ve planted the seed that you want to move, your parents will likely start to get the message. Researching potential options before your parents start asking questions about your motivation and where you want to move can help you make a more convincing case.   Go online for places you might like to live or move. Use these as a part of the hints you subtly drop hints. Keep in mind elements such as finances when you’re searching. You may not be aware of your parents’ financial situation and how your suggestions affect them emotionally and possibly financially. Research new places to live at a variety of price points.  Keep notes on different places so that you can convincingly present them. For example, if you want to move to a different city, you could include things like the standard cost of housing and living, the overall health profile of the place, and the advantages it presents to you over the current place you live. The next time a parent shows stress about the house, suggest moving. Let this stimulate an open discussion about your desire to move and the practicability of it.  Have the discussion when you’re less likely to be interrupted.  Start the conversation with your observations and concerns about staying and the reasons you would like your parents to consider moving. Let them know you are serious, but try and keep the conversation as honest and positive as possible. For example, you can say “I’m really interested in pursuing my interest in science and the school in New York has much better opportunities for me to do this,” or “I’m being bullied at school and feel like an outcast.” Likewise, you can say “mom, I think it’s a good idea to move so that you have a built-in community and help whenever you might need it.”  Suggest that your parents talk to your friends, colleagues, or teachers about your wishes. This may help them better understand that your position is serious. After you’ve had the discussion with your parents about moving, wait and let them think about moving. Remember that moving doesn’t happen overnight and may require that your parents take time to consider the pros and cons for them and your entire family.  Put yourself in your parents’ shoes and be sensitive. As they consider your wishes, keep in mind how it affects your parents. Although moving might be great for you, it can put financial and emotional stress on your parents.  Stay away from pushing the idea on your parents once you’ve discussed your wishes. This may annoy or stress them and could end up in them dismissing the idea altogether. No matter what your parents decide about moving, respect the decision they reach. There may be factors about which you are unaware that influence your parents’ decision and nagging them may have negative consequences for you.  Offer to help your parents in any way you can if they decide to move.  Keep your parents in the loop about your feelings if the motivation for wanting to move is issues at school. Talking about problems with them may help.  Revisit the issue in the future if your parents said they weren’t sure or wanted some more time to think about it.

Question: Plants can grow as much as 50 percent faster in concentrations of 1,000 ppm CO2 when compared with ambient conditions, though this assumes no change in climate and no limitation on other nutrients. Elevated CO2 levels cause increased growth reflected in the harvestable yield of crops, with wheat, rice and soybean all showing increases in yield of 12–14% under elevated CO2 in FACE experiments.Increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations result in fewer stomata developing on plants which leads to reduced water usage and increased water-use efficiency. Studies using FACE have shown that CO2 enrichment leads to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants. This may have knock-on effects on other parts of ecosystems as herbivores will need to eat more food to gain the same amount of protein.The concentration of secondary metabolites such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids  Jerry and Gary each live in separate cities, but both run equally sized farms that grow the same produce.

Q:I can use this background: A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases.  Now, I have a new situation: Mike was visiting the African Savannah. One animal that interested him most was the African Buffalo. He noticed that the buffaloes would usually live in a large herd, often exceeding few hundreds. He noted that as case A. But sometimes the buffaloes would live in a small herd. He noted that as case B. Interestingly, there are incidents when an aggressive male buffalo would live by itself. He noted that as case C.  Answer this question please: In which case the group would get less benefit as a whole, case A or case B? A:","output":"In order to answer this question, let's consider the dilution effect and its impact on the risk faced by the African Buffaloes in case A and case B. Case A (Large Herd): In a large herd, the buffaloes will \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, as each individual is just one out of many. The large group size will reduce the probability of any individual buffalo being targeted, hence, providing a greater benefit to each individual member. However, the group as a whole may become more conspicuous and attract more attention from predators. Case B (Small Herd): In a small herd, the dilution effect will be weaker, as the risk of attack won't be distributed among as many members. The group would be less conspicuous, but an individual buffalo's chance of being targeted by predators would be relatively higher in comparison to a larger herd. Based on the dilution effect, less benefit to a group as a whole is observed in case B (Small Herd) compared to case A (Large Herd). The reason for this is that a larger herd (case A) provides greater protection to its individual members through risk dilution, while a smaller herd (case B) offers less protection to the individual members due to the weaker dilution effect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The smallest of the bunch have lower or higher boiling points?    Text:  Larger alkenes have lower boiling and melting points, so they are liquids or waxy solids at room temperature. The answer is:","output":"Based on the given text, the smallest of the bunch of alkenes would have higher boiling points. The text states that \\"Larger alkenes have lower boiling and melting points\\", which implies that smaller alkenes would exhibit the opposite behavior, meaning they would have higher boiling points in comparison to their larger counterparts.  To provide further context, alkenes are a group of organic compounds consisting of carbon and hydrogen atoms, with at least one carbon-carbon double bond. The size of the alkene refers to the number of carbon atoms in its structure. As the alkene's size, or carbon chain length, increases, the boiling and melting points decrease. This is due to the relatively weaker London dispersion forces acting between the larger molecules, which require less energy to separate from one another. Conversely, smaller alkenes have stronger intermolecular forces, so they need more energy to overcome these forces, resulting in higher boiling points. In conclusion, when Harry was sorting the alkenes, the smallest alkenes within the bunch would have higher boiling points than the larger alkenes. This contrasting behavior is due to the differences in intermolecular forces acting on the alkenes - smaller alkenes have stronger forces that require more energy to overcome, leading to higher boiling points."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"The critic is thinking positively about the movie. This conclusion is derived from the specific phrases and adjectives used throughout the review. Firstly, calling a film \\"touching\\" suggests that the movie deeply resonated with the critic on an emotional level. This term is typically employed to describe films that successfully evoke powerful feelings, such as sadness, compassion, or empathy, in the audience, which is generally viewed as a mark of high-quality storytelling. Secondly, the critic uses the term \\"drama about old age and grief.\\" While this does not inherently suggest a positive or negative opinion, it gives us an idea of the movie’s thematic focus. In order to reference the themes directly, the critic likely appreciated the thoughtful or sensitive exploration of these subjects. Lastly, the critic’s mention of a \\"tour de force performance by Michel Piccoli\\" is a high praise. A \\"tour de force\\" refers to an impressive performance or achievement that has been accomplished with great skill. Saying this about Michel Piccoli means that the critic thinks highly of his acting in this film. They believe that his performance was skillfully done and remarkably powerful. Each of these positive aspects—the evocative nature of the movie, its exploration of heavy themes, and Michel Piccoli's powerful performance—contributed to the overall positive impression that the critic gathered from the film. Hence, we can confidently suggest that the critic did indeed think positively of the movie. This constructive analysis, however, does not indicate any negative perspectives. If the critic had any criticisms, they have not shared it in this truncated review. Therefore, based on the given information, it can be assumed that the critic viewed the movie very favorably."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This has sparked a debate on the impact of early exposure to violence and the potential effect on teenage minds as well as the adequacy of the criminal justice system in dealing with juvenile offenders. Background of the Case: (Step 2: Provide details about the case) The two girls, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were found guilty of torturing and murdering a vulnerable woman. The victim, a 39-year-old woman, was found dead in her home with multiple injuries inflicted by a variety of weapons, including a wooden stick and a television set. The trial revealed that the girls had subjected the woman to a prolonged and brutal assault before eventually killing her. The Motive: (Step 3: Discuss possible motives) While the specific motives behind the horrifying act remain unclear, evidence suggested that the teenagers spiraled into violence without any clear or conceivable motive. Factors such as mental health, substance abuse, and a possible history of neglect and trauma were taken into consideration during the trial, hinting at complex and interlinked reasons for their actions. The Sentencing: (Step 4: Explain the reasoning behind the sentencing) Considering the brutal nature of the crime and the age of the perpetrators, the judge handed down life sentences with a minimum term of 15 years for both girls. The judge cited that their young age was considered as a mitigating factor, while the egregiousness of their actions justified the harsh sentence. However, this decision has attracted criticism, with some arguing that the sentence is too harsh for juveniles, while others maintain that the punishment should act as a deterrent to other potential offenders. Impact on Society and Legal System: (Step 5: Discuss the implications of the case for society and the legal system) The case has raised questions about how society and the legal system handle juvenile offenders and address the root causes of violent crime among young people. Some argue that punitive measures alone will not suffice to address the problem and that greater emphasis must be placed on preventive measures such as early intervention, mental health support, and rehabilitation programs. Conclusion: (Step 6: Summarize the main points and provide a closing remark) The tragic case of these two teenage girls serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers lurking within the minds of troubled youth and calls for a reevaluation of our approach to juvenile crime. Greater focus must be placed on understanding the complex motivations behind such heinous acts and providing appropriate support to prevent young lives from being lost to a cycle of violence. Only by addressing these underlying issues can we hope to create a safer and more compassionate society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty’s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his “ranch” on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms—Galleries 105 to 108—share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty’s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place. From a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa Getty bought the 64-acre ranch—once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant—just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (“Teddy”) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection. He knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies.

However, his rule was opposed by Sheikh Abdullah, the popular leader of Kashmir's largest political party, the National Conference, who demanded his abdication.Pakistan, attempting to force the issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air.

Evans' first-quarter performance was a Buffalo record for a period and just shy of the NFL record for yards receiving in a quarter of 210 by Baltimore's Qadry Ismail in 1999. The first touchdown came after Nate Clements' interception on the third play of the game. Both were after Evans got in front of Texans cornerback Demarcus Faggins for the easy score. The 83-yard TDs were career highs for both Losman and Evans and marked the first time in franchise history the Bills have had two 80-yard passes in a single game. David Carr opened 1 for 3 with an interception on his first pass before completing his next 22 throws. Carr finished 25 of 30 for 223 yards and no touchdowns. Carr tied the record held by Mark Brunell, who had 22 consecutive completions in Washington's 31-15 win over the Texans at Reliant Stadium on September 24. He tied Brunell's record on a short pass to Wali Lundy for no gain with 6:19 left. The streak was broken when his pass to Andre Johnson with 5:44 remaining fell short. Lundy cut the lead to 14-7 with a 17-yard run in the first quarter. That score was set up by a 17-yard reception by Eric Moulds on third-and-8.

Question: Why does Jessica  take off her cross? Movie plot title: The Thing That Couldn't Die Movie plot: A young woman named Jessica Burns (Carolyn Kearney), who claims to have psychic powers, lives on a remote ranch with her Aunt Flavia (Peggy Converse). She discovers an ancient box while water-witching and her Aunt takes it back to their house. Her boyfriend, Gordon (William Reynolds), goes for an archaeologist, arguing the box should be kept intact for appraisal and opening by an expert. However, the Aunt's greedy ranch foreman, anticipating treasure, secretly convinces the slow-witted handyman to break it open. Instead, the box contains the intact head of Gideon Drew (Robin Hughes), a man executed for sorcery 400 years earlier. The head awakens and telepathically takes over the mentally vulnerable handyman. After murdering the foreman, the head has the handyman conceal it while arranging to have a coffin retrieved containing Gideon's body. After the handyman helps the head take control of a young woman (Andra Martin) staying at the ranch, it drives him to approach police in a threatening manner holding the knife that killed the foreman. The police had arrived to investigate the theft of the box's remains and the blood left behind from the killing of the foreman. Failing to stop, the handyman died in a hail of police bullets. Once his head and body are joined, Gideon will be fully able to exercise his powers over all comers. The young woman is aware of the evil and is protected from the head's influence by an ancient cross she wears around her neck, but when her boyfriend removes it, to make a cast so its historical value could be appraised, the head takes control of her mind. So, ironically, though the guest under control of the head was unable to remove it, Jessica was put in harms way by her protector. Jessica then helps find the head's body, previously being against doing so since they only wished to make money out of it as well as fear that it was an evil business. The young woman joins head to body and Gideon arises from his coffin, but the boyfriend, aware of the error of his ways, catches the monster... The answer to this question is:","output":"Jessica takes off her cross when her boyfriend, Gordon, removes it to make a cast so its historical value could be appraised. Unfortunately, this action inadvertently puts Jessica in harm's way, as the ancient cross was protecting her from the evil influence of Gideon Drew's head. Once the cross is removed, the head takes control of Jessica's mind, which sets further events into motion and ultimately leads to the reuniting of Gideon's head and body. The removal of the cross represents a crucial turning point in the movie plot, as it allows the evil force to gain more control over the characters and situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

South Africa. Life is normal at the farm on the slopes of a Karoo Kopje. Fat Tant Sannie (Karin van der Laag) looks after her charges, the sweet Em (Anneke Weidemann) and the independent Lyndall (Kasha Kropinski), with a strict Biblical hand - it was Em's father's dying wish. Gentle Otto (Armin), the farm manager, runs the farm and cares for Waldo, his son. Waldo (Luke Gallant) is bright, and busy building a model of a sheep-shearing machine that he hopes will make them all rich. Things change when the sinister, eccentric Bonaparte Blenkins (Richard E.

Their childhood is disrupted by the bombastic Irishman who claims blood ties with Wellington and Queen Victoria and so gains uncanny influence over the girls' gross stupid stepmother, Tant Sannie.As the story of Lyndall, Em and Waldo unfolds to its touching end, we learn not merely of a backwater in colonial history, but of the whole human condition.Armin Cruz's intense story of three children living in the African veldt has often been compared to Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights.

The group, consisting of scientist Marlowe Cragis, his research assistant Radford Baines, the scientist's daughter Ann, her recent fiancÃ© Jerry Farrel, and a servant Mario, welcome the captain and his first mate, but subtly resist the visitors staying overnight, even though a hurricane approaches. Thorne goes with the group to their compound. Griswold stays with the boat, to come ashore later. The situation in the compound is less than safe. During evening cocktails, Thorne becomes aware of a life-threatening situation. Marlowe Cragis performs well-meaning research on serums and uses shrews as test animals. The doctor's purpose is to make humans half-size in order to reduce world hunger; smaller humans will eat less food on a planet with a limited food supply. Unfortunately, the doctor's experiments created mutant giant shrews that escaped and are reproducing outside the compound, growing larger by the day. The scientist and his staff barricade themselves inside their compound each evening. Thorne and Ann begin to fall in love, causing jealousy in Jerry. Meanwhile, outside the compound, the giant shrews, which have a poisonous bite, are running out of smaller animals to eat. The shrews attack and kill Griswold.

Mario finds the shrew and shoots it, but it bites him. The shrew is then shot by Thorne and killed. The others arrive in the basement, but Mario dies.

Which entity is this text about? Dorothy Day, Obl.S.B. (November 8, 1897 - November 29, 1980) was an American journalist, social activist, and Catholic convert. Day initially lived a bohemian lifestyle before gaining fame as a social activist after her conversion. She later became a key figure in the Catholic Worker Movement and earned a national reputation as a political radical, perhaps the most famous radical in American Catholic Church history. Day encountered anarchism while studying in university. She read The Bomb by Frank Harris, a fictionalized biography of one of the Haymarket anarchists. She discussed anarchy and extreme poverty with Peter Kropotkin. After moving to New York, Day studied the anarchism of Emma Goldman and attended the Anarchists Ball at Webster Hall.  Day was saddened by the executions of the anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti in 1927. She wrote that when they died, \\"All the nation mourned.\\" As a Catholic, she felt a sense of solidarity with them, specifically \\"the very sense of solidarity which made me gradually understand the doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ whereby we are all members of one another.\\"  Discussing the term anarchism, she wrote: \\"We ourselves have never hesitated to use the word.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: With the exception of the opening and final scenes, which depict the 1941 suicide by drowning of Virginia Woolf in the River Ouse, the action takes place within the span of a single day in three different years and alternates between them throughout the film. In 1923, Virginia has begun writing the book Mrs Dalloway in her home in the town of Richmond outside London. In 1951, troubled Los Angeles housewife Laura Brown escapes from her conventional life by reading Mrs Dalloway. In 2001, New Yorker Clarissa Vaughan is the embodiment of the novel's title character, as she spends the day preparing for a party she is hosting in honor of her former lover and friend Richard, a poet and author living with AIDS who is to receive a major literary award. Richard tells Clarissa he has stayed alive for her sake, and the award is meaningless because he didn't get it sooner, until he was on the brink of death. She tells him she believes he would have won the award regardless of his illness. Richard often refers to Clarissa as \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" - her namesake - because she distracts herself from her own life the way the Woolf character does. Virginia, who has experienced several nervous breakdowns and suffers from bipolar disorder, feels trapped in her home. She is intimidated by servants and constantly under the eye of her husband, Leonard, who has begun a publishing business, Hogarth Press, at home to stay close to her. Virginia both welcomes and dreads an afternoon visit from her sister Vanessa and her children. After their departure, Virginia flees to the railway station, where she is awaiting a train to central London, when Leonard arrives to bring her home. He tells her how he lives in constant fear that she will take her own life. She says she fears it also but argues that if she is to live, she has the right to decide how and where.

Given those answer options, answer the question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid. Question: Why did Barend's shadow caught the narrator's eye? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"The narrator found Barend's shadow to be incredibly attractive and unique, like a piece of art.

Answer the following question: Information:  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions.  - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities.  - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region.  - In computing, WinG (pronounced \\"Win Gee\\") is an application programming interface that is a port of Windows 95's Device Independent Bitmaps to provide faster graphics performance on Windows 3.x operating environments, and was initially positioned as a way to help game developers more easily port their DOS games to Microsoft Windows, although it was quickly discontinued in favor of DirectX.  - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek.  - Sir George Hamilton Kenrick FRES ( 1850 -- 28 May 1939 ) was an English entomologist who specialised in Lepidoptera especially those of New Guinea and he was a councillor in Birmingham .  - Birmingham is a major city and metropolitan borough of West Midlands, England. It is the largest and most populous British city outside London, with a population in 2014 of 1,101,360. The city is in the West Midlands Built-up Area, the third most populous urban area in the United Kingdom, with a population of 2,440,986 at the 2011 census. Birmingham's metropolitan area is the second most populous in the UK with a population of 3.8 million. This also makes Birmingham the 9th most populous metropolitan area in Europe.  - Moths comprise a group of insects related to butterflies, belonging to the order Lepidoptera. Most lepidopterans are moths; and there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which are yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are also crepuscular and diurnal species.  - The Lepidoptera is an order of insects that includes moths and butterflies (both called lepidopterans). 180,000 species of Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families and 46 superfamilies, 10% of the total described species of living organisms. It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world. The term was coined by Linnaeus in 1735 and is derived from Ancient Greek (scale) and (wing). The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution. Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought, and is among the four most speciose orders, along with the Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera.  - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.  - A Councillor is a member of a local government council.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What did the company that toured the United States in 1984 produce in 1990?, using the article: Productions during the 1980s included the company's first presentations of Pelléas and Mélisande (1981), Parsifal (1986) and Billy Budd (1988). 1980s productions that remained in the repertory for many years included Xerxes directed by Hytner, and Rigoletto and The Mikado directed by Jonathan Miller. In 1984 ENO toured the United States; the travelling company, led by Elder, consisted of 360 people; they performed Gloriana, War and Peace, The Turn of the Screw, Rigoletto and Patience. This was the first British company to be invited to appear at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where Patience received a standing ovation and Miller's production of Rigoletto, depicting the characters as mafiosi, was greeted with a mixture of enthusiasm and booing. In 1990 ENO was the first major foreign opera company to tour the Soviet Union, performing the Miller production of The Turn of the Screw, Pountney's production of Macbeth, and Hytner's much-revived Xerxes.The 'Powerhouse' era ended in 1992, when all three of the triumvirate left at the same time. The new general director was Dennis Marks, formerly head of music programmes at the BBC, and the new music director was Sian Edwards. Pountney's post of director of productions was not filled. Marks, inheriting a large financial deficit from his predecessors, worked to restore the company's finances, concentrating on restoring ticket sales to sustainable levels. A new production by Miller of Der Rosenkavalier was a critical and financial success, as was a staging of Massenet's Don Quixote, described by the critic Hugh Canning as \\"the kind of old-fashioned theatre magic which the hair-shirted Powerhouse regime despised\\".Marks was obliged to spend much time and effort in securing the funding for an essential restoration of the Coliseum, a condition on which ENO had acquired the freehold of the theatre in 1992. At the same time the Arts Council was contemplating a cut in the number of opera performances in London, at the expense of ENO, rather than Covent Garden. By..., what would be the answer ?

Originally limited to researchers at a handful of universities and government departments, the Internet has quickly become a worldwide network providing users with information on a range of subjects and allowing them to purchase goods directly from companies via computer. By 1999, 84 millionU.S.citizens had access to the Internet at home or work. More and more Americans arc paying bills, shopping, ordering airline tickets, and purchasing stocks via computer over the Internet. Internet banking is also becoming increasingly popular. With lower overhead costs in terms of staffing and office space, Internet banks are able to offer higher interest rates on deposits and charge lower rates on loans than traditional banks.  \\"Brick and mortar\\" banks are increasingly offering online banking services via some special websites to enlarge their traditional services. At present, 14 percent of Internet households conduct their banking by means of the Internet, and the figure is expected to double during the next two or three years. Increasing commercial use of the Internet has heightened security and privacy concerns. With a credit card, an Internet user can order almost anything from an Internet site and have it delivered to their home or office. Companies doing business over the Internet need many security measures to protect credit card, bank account, and social security numbers from unauthorized access as they pass across the Internet.

Maybe it's just me thinking it, sending myself doolally after what I've done. But I swear every morning it creeps up and it's looking at me, all knowing like. And when you reckon the sun's acting like that over you there isn't a right lot you can do about it, beyond burying yourself away like a mole in the soil. That's what I've been doing more or less in the score or so years that have gone by since. But however tight I shut them curtains to stop that damn sun lighting me up, it still don't stop the inside of my head from pounding out the truth. No way it's ever going to stop harassing me neither, not unless the deaf and dumb lass was to happen right back on my doorstep and give me the chance to tell her that it wasn't never meant to work out this way. The deaf and dumb lass went by the name of Mitzi Barker. Her being deaf and dumb, she was the kind of lass you went up the lane with if you didn't want no-one shouting their gob off about it after.

Make sure that no food falls off the tree or vine onto the ground. If they do, pick them up right away. Look for one that is completely sealed or that has a locking lid. A container that sits up off the ground is also effective. This will prevent rats from smelling or getting into the compost. If you’re worried about rats, you may want to stop adding food scraps to your compost pile. Food adds little value to compost, and it is what the rats are attracted to. You can put food waste in a worm bin, however. If you feed any dogs, cats, rabbits, or chickens outside, you need a sealed metal container, preferably one with a locking lid. When the animals are done feeding, remove the dish if possible or throw out any leftovers. If you have animals like chickens that might graze on foods, a treadle feeder can help dispense food regularly without rats getting into it. You can install a rodent-baffle on your bird feeder or buy a bird feeder that is squirrel or rodent proof. Clean up under the bird feeder whenever you notice spilled seed to keep rats from coming to eat it.  Try using no-waste bird food. This type of seed is designed to reduce how much waste the bird leaves behind when they are done eating. Make sure to store your bird seed in a sealed metal container. Look for containers that are advertised as “rodent-proof.” Rats like to hide in dense vegetation and wood piles. Make sure to clear any garden debris, such as fallen branches or leaves, as soon as possible. Mow the lawn so that grass and weeds are no higher than a few inches. You can also:  Stack wood on a platform at least 18 inches (46 cm) off the ground and about 12 inches (30 cm) from any structures like fences or buildings. Trim large plants that rats could climb, such as trees, ivy, vines, and shrubs. Keep them about 4 feet (1.2 m) away from your roof to stop rats from climbing over. Repair fences to cover any holes larger than a dime. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article provided would be: To prevent rats from being attracted to your garden, ensure that no ripe or overripe food is left on the ground and maintain cleanliness. Use sealed or locking containers for compost, food waste, and pet food. Opt for a treadle feeder for animals that graze and consider rodent-proof bird feeders with no-waste bird food. Keep bird seed in sealed metal containers and clear garden debris regularly. Maintain short grass and trim large plants away from structures to prevent rat hiding spots.

At the airport, she meets Daniel, a successful music label executive, who covertly arranges for her to be upgraded to First Class and seated next to him on the flight. When she sells the ticket to another passenger and Daniel finds his seatmate is an obnoxiously loud woman instead of the girl of his dreams, he moves back to the Economy section and takes the vacant seat next to Martha. Before landing in London, he offers her the use of a deluxe suite in a luxury hotel at his company's expense in exchange for a lunch date the following day. Through a series of flashbacks and flashforwards, we learn Laurence, a former bridge champion who now teaches the game to wealthy women, went to the airport to pick up Daniel but missed him because the flight landed early. Instead, he literally runs into Martha, who hits him with a luggage cart while searching for the exit. She coerces him into taking her into the city and invites him to the suite for dinner. While she is in the bathroom, a bouquet of flowers from Daniel is delivered to the suite, and when Laurence sees the attached card, he departs without explanation.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person who might have assisted with the underdrawing in Van der Weyden's workshop?  The Annunciation draws heavily on van der Weyden's 1430s Louvre Annunciation, his c. 1455  Saint Columba altarpiece, and the Clugny Annunciation (c. 1465–75), which is attributed to either van der Weyden or Memling. Memling almost certainly was apprenticed to van der Weyden in Brussels until setting up his own workshop in Bruges sometime after 1465. Memling's Annunciation is more innovative, with motifs such as the attendant angels that were absent in the earlier paintings. According to Till-Holger Borchert, not only was Memling familiar with van der Weyden's motifs and compositions, but he might have assisted with the underdrawing in van der Weyden's workshop. The shutters on the right are copied from the Louvre panel, the knotted curtain appears in the Columba triptych's \\"Annunciation\\".A sense of movement is conveyed throughout. The trailing edges of Gabriel's garment fall outside the pictorial space, indicating his arrival. The Virgin's \\"serpentine\\" pose, with attendant angels supporting her, adds to the sense of flow. Memling's use of color achieves a startling effect. The traditional rays of light are replaced with light color indicators; the white clothes rendered in \\"icy\\" blue, the angel to the right in yellow patches seems \\"bleached by light\\", the left-hand angel appears to be steeped in shadow, dressed in clothes of lavender and bearing deep green wings. The effect is iridescent, according to Blum, who writes, \\"this shimmering surface gives [the figures] an unearthly quality, separating them from the more believable world of the bedchamber.\\" The effect deviates from the pure naturalism and realism which typifies Early Netherlandish art, causing a \\"startling\\" juxtaposition, an effect that is \\"unsteadying\\" and contradictory. The answer to this question is:","output":"The person who might have assisted with the underdrawing in Van der Weyden's workshop is Hans Memling. According to Till-Holger Borchert, Memling was not only familiar with van der Weyden's motifs and compositions, but he might have assisted with the underdrawing in Van der Weyden's workshop.

As a result, we think we can see something that is not actually there or we ignore things that actually are there. Scientists Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris have researched this phenomenon , which they call \\"change blindness\\". Their experiments show how we sometimes just do not see what is in front of our eyes because _ . Here is one of their most famous experiments. In this experiment, the participants were shown a video of two groups of people (one group in white T-shirts and one group in black T-shirts) who passed basketballs around in a hallway. Each group had three members. Simons and Chabris asked the participants to count how many times the white team passed the ball. While the two teams were passing their balls around, a person dressed up as a big bear walked through the group and stopped to look at the camera. Simons and Chabris found that about half of the research participants did not notice the big bear.","output":"Which of the following best describes the phenomenon of \\"change blindness\\" as demonstrated in the experiment by Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris?

Write some highlights for the following article: There is a real danger of Sergio Aguero becoming the Premier League’s greatest striker of all-time if he manages to maintain a freak minutes-per-goal record which even tops Thierry Henry. The Manchester City man scored the only goal in Sunday’s derby win against rivals United – meaning he now notches once every 109 minutes. It was Aguero’s 62nd in the league for City – and 10th this season – and puts him ahead of Henry, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Alan Shearer. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero has netted 62 Premier League goals in 6783 minutes in England. Sergio Aguero converts Gael Clichy's low cross from the left to put Manchester City 1-0 ahead in the derby. Aguero (second from left) is mobbed by his team-mates after giving the hosts the lead against Man United. Thierry Henry is widely-regarded as one of the best strikers to have ever graced the Premier League. Not only that, the 26-year-old is comfortably in front of every other frontman to have lit up the top flight since 1992. Henry – Arsenal’s main man for eight years – netted 175 times in 237 Premier League games. Widely-regarded as a revolutionary in the modern era, Henry’s capability of scoring 20-a-season in double-quick time put him on a pedestal as the best there had been. Even superior to Shearer, who ended his career with more, 260, but took longer in between strikes to find the net. Van Nistelrooy’s trailblazing four campaigns at Manchester United – ignoring the injury-ravaged first – garnered 95 goals at a rate of one every 128 minutes. Robin van Persie’s strike rate is healthy at 137 minutes per goal, while the year spent in England by Samuel Eto’o had proved profitable – his 12 goals coming in 1609 minutes. Manchester United skipper Wayne Rooney, on the other hand, has taken 168 minutes for each of his 176 in the Premier League. That isn’t a record to be sniffed at. It comes in at better than a goal every other game if purely using minutes. Aguero’s 109 minutes for every strike – which is half-an-hour more impressive than Luis Suarez and Edin Dzeko – makes him the most lethal marksman to have graced English football. Henry comfortably finishes past Bolton Wanderers goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen in an FA Cup tie. Aguero has a better minutes-per-goal ratio than ex-Liverpool talisman Luis Suarez (celebrating at Norwich) Alan Shearer's goals were crucial in Blackburn winning the 1995 Premier League title (Chris Sutton right) Detractors may point to the City striker’s injury record – he always struggles to get through a full campaign without tweaking something – as reason enough to suggest he can never be named No 1. But even last year, when Aguero spent two months on the sidelines, he was up there with Suarez and Daniel Sturridge. His manager Manuel Pellegrini said last December that this season’s top scorer was a better player than the Uruguayan. ‘Suarez is a very important striker, but I think Sergio participates more in the game,’ Pellegrini claimed. ‘He has always been a top player and he has always scored goals, but I think at this moment, he has added working for the team without the ball, which is also important for him.’ Shearer scored 260 Premier League goals, most marked with his trademark celebration. The bustling centre forward often notched from the penalty spot but got plenty from open play. Wayne Rooney is in the top 25 but his record is worse than the likes of Robin van Persie and Javier Hernandez. The Chilean certainly isn’t wrong – Aguero contributes so much more – but it is for his goalscoring that he will be remembered most fondly for. There was never any danger of Gael Clichy’s centre not ending up nestled beyond David de Gea at the Etihad Stadium this weekend. It is that sort of clinical finishing that sets him apart. He rarely needs more than one chance. While Aguero offers much more across the width of a pitch and in behind defenders, there are a number of players who have merely relied on their prowess in front of goal to retain a spot in the upper echelons of this all-time Premier League list. Javier Hernandez, now at Real Madrid, was renowned for doing very little in United games before a ball broke inside the opposition penalty area, while Adam Le Fondre – whose record is only topped by Henry and Aguero – has forever been an impact substitute. Ivan Klasnic's goalscoring record while at Bolton puts him among the Premier League's elite. Tony Yeboah (pictured scoring for Leeds against Liverpool in 1995) scored picture-book goals. Reading used Adam Le Fondre as a super sub - but his minutes-per-goal ratio was exemplary. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer often saved Manchester United late on in games after being called from the bench. Shearer was chief penalty taker wherever he played, while Ivan Klasnic’s 20 Bolton goals tended to come in gluts (and often from the bench) before Owen Coyle sent him packing. Unsurprisingly, both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Owen feature, although their records of a goal every 150 minutes might have been better if the pair didn’t spend so much time coming back from injuries. Derby’s Branko Strupar makes the list, but his four years at Pride Park from 1999 actually only brought about 15 goals, with Tony Yeboah’s record slightly more impressive. Of the current crop to surprise, Andre Schurrle and Wilfried Bony both make the top 25. Whether Aguero’s record can be beaten remains to be seen, but it looks doubtful.","output":"This article discusses the possibility of Sergio Aguero becoming the Premier League's greatest striker of all-time if he maintains his impressive minutes-per-goal record. Some highlights from the article include: 1. Aguero's goal in the Manchester City vs. Manchester United derby put him ahead of Thierry Henry, Ruud van Nistelrooy, and Alan Shearer in terms of minutes-per-goal in the Premier League. 2. Aguero's minutes-per-goal record stands at one every 109 minutes, significantly better than other prolific strikers such as Henry, van Nistelrooy, and Rooney. 3. Despite having a higher overall goal tally, Shearer took longer between goals and Henry's own goal-per-game ratio is not as impressive as Aguero's. 4. Aguero is praised not only for his goalscoring ability but also for his contributions to the game without the ball, as highlighted by his manager, Manuel Pellegrini. 5. The article suggests that it's doubtful whether Aguero's minutes-per-goal record can ever be beaten by another striker in the Premier League."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: There are two hydroelectric dams in North Dakota. Both of them has large lakes or reservoirs, reservoir A and reservoir B. Since North Dakota has one the lowest unemployment rates in the country, it's hard to find an engineer to regulate and maintain the reservoirs. This year reservoir A could hire an engineer, but reservoir B failed to find an engineer. As a result, there is no one to regulate reservoir B. The engineer for reservoir A let the water out in the fall. But there was no one to do that for reservoir B.  and a hint : The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year.  Please answer this question : Which reservoir would most likely not casue damaged dock, reservoir A or reservoir B? Answer:","output":"Reservoir A would most likely not cause damaged docks. This is because the engineer at reservoir A regulates the water level by letting the water out in the fall, allowing the water level to drop by about 10 feet (3.0 m) during the winter. This helps prevent ice from damaging docks and other structures around the lake. On the other hand, reservoir B failed to find an engineer, and as a result, there is no one to regulate its water level during the fall and winter. Without proper regulation, the water level in reservoir B might not decrease in time, which could potentially lead to ice damaging docks and other structures around the lake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Background: Klinefelter's syndrome is caused by the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells. Extra genetic material from the X chromosome interferes with male sexual development, preventing the testicles from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Triple X syndrome (trisomy X) results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female's cells. Females with trisomy X have a lower IQ than their siblings. Turner syndrome results when each of a female's cells has one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is missing or altered. The missing genetic material affects development and causes the characteristic features of the condition, including short stature and infertility.  Paragraph: David is a physician with the children's hospital. He is seeing four patients, patient A, patient B, patient C, and patient D. Patient A is a male with Klinefelter's syndrome. Patient B is female with Turner syndrome. Patient C is a male and does not have any of these illnesses. Patient D is a female and she too does not have any of these illnesses.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which patient would have lower level of testosterone, patient A or patient C? Answer:","output":"Patient A would have a lower level of testosterone. Step 1: Identify the patients with relevant conditions. - Patient A is a male with Klinefelter's syndrome. - Patient C is a male without any of these illnesses. Step 2: Recall the information about Klinefelter's syndrome. - Klinefelter's syndrome is caused by the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells. - This interferes with male sexual development, preventing the testicles from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Step 3: Compare the testosterone levels of Patient A and Patient C. - Since Patient A has Klinefelter's syndrome, his testosterone levels will be reduced due to the extra X chromosome interfering with his sexual development. - Patient C, on the other hand, does not have any of these illnesses and can be assumed to have normal testosterone levels for a male without these conditions.

Please answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who played drums for the Smashing Pumpkins?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Smashing Pumpkins (or Smashing Pumpkins) are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), the band has undergone many line-up changes. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up. In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014.

Q:Information:  - Old French (', ', \\"\\"; Modern French ) was the Gallo-Romance dialect continuum spoken from the 9th century to the 14th century.  In the 14th century, these dialects came to be collectively known as the \\"langues d'oïl\\", contrasting with the \\"langue d'oc\\" or Occitan language in the south of France. The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance, specifically based on the dialect of the Île-de-France region.  - Emperor Seinei (  Seinei - tenn ) was the 22nd emperor of Japan , according to the traditional order of succession . No firm dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign , but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 480 -- 484 .  - Empress dowager (also dowager empress or empress mother) is the English language translation of the title given to the mother of a Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Vietnamese emperor.  - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire.  - An emperor (through Old French \\"empereor\\" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as \\"Emperor\\".  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Honour (also honor in American English, see spelling differences) is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or corporate body such as a family, school, regiment or nation. Accordingly, individuals (or corporate bodies) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific code of honour, and the moral code of the society at large.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Jennifer and Justin are examining the principle of chemical equilibrium in their second year organic chemistry course. They are performing a reaction that involves hydrogen gas and glucose as the starting reactants, and the products formed in the reaction are carbon dioxide and oxygen gas. Jennifer and Justin add the materials, and then wait until the reaction has reached equilibrium. Afterwards, Jennifer removes glucose from her reaction mixture, while Justin removes carbon dioxide from his reaction mixture.  But I can use this background: An equilibrium can also be disrupted by the full or partial removal of a reactant or product. If the concentration of a substance is decreased, the system will respond by favoring the reaction that replaces that substance. In the industrial Haber-Bosch process, NH 3 is removed from the equilibrium system as the reaction proceeds. As a result, the forward reaction is favored so that more NH 3 will be produced. The concentrations of N 2 and H 2 decrease. Continued removal of NH 3 will eventually force the reaction to go to completion until all of the reactants are used up. If either N 2 or H 2 were removed from the equilibrium system, the reverse reaction would be favored, and the concentration of NH 3 would decrease.  What is an answer for this question: Which person's reaction, Jennifer's or Justin's, will begin producing more carbon dioxide? Answer:","output":"In the given situation, Jennifer and Justin are studying chemical equilibrium in an organic chemistry course. They are performing a reaction with hydrogen gas and glucose as the starting reactants, and carbon dioxide and oxygen gas as the products. They wait for the reaction to reach equilibrium before Jennifer removes glucose from her reaction mixture, and Justin removes carbon dioxide from his reaction mixture. To answer the question of whose reaction will begin producing more carbon dioxide, we need to consider the effect of removing a reactant or product on the equilibrium system. As mentioned in the background information, when the concentration of a substance is decreased, the system responds by favoring the reaction that replaces that substance. In Jennifer's case, she removed glucose from her reaction mixture. Glucose is one of the starting reactants in the reaction. By removing it, the system will respond by shifting the equilibrium to favor the reverse reaction that consumes the products (carbon dioxide and oxygen gas) and produces more reactants (hydrogen gas and glucose). As a result, the concentration of carbon dioxide will decrease in her reaction mixture. On the other hand, Justin removed carbon dioxide from his reaction mixture. Carbon dioxide is one of the products formed in the reaction. The removal of carbon dioxide causes the system to shift the equilibrium in the forward direction in order to replace the removed product. The forward reaction consumes hydrogen gas and glucose to produce more carbon dioxide and oxygen gas. Consequently, the concentration of carbon dioxide will increase in Justin's reaction mixture. In conclusion, Justin's reaction will begin producing more carbon dioxide after he removes it from his reaction mixture. This is because the removal of a product, like carbon dioxide, favors the forward reaction that replaces it, leading to an increase in its concentration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: I like my Skechers Women's Bikers-Spokes... Review: I am a big fan of Skechers because they have so many different styles of shoe-they are really diverse and creative with their products.I really like this model of shoe a lot-it looks cool and it is extremely comfortable for light walking. I got the white/red/black pair.I am giving this shoe 4 stars instead of 5 because while it has good cushioning in the heel, it is pretty thin under the toes/forefront of the foot. You can feel everything if you are walking on a non-smooth surface.The straps are velcro and quick to open/close, yet secure which is a positive. I have gotten a lot of compliments on the looks of this shoe from strangers and aquaintances alike.I certainly would recommend this shoe strictly for fashion reasons, not for atheletics. Answer: A:","output":"Overall, the tone in this review is mixed, leaning towards positive. There are more positive elements than negative ones.  The reviewer initially expresses the positive attributes of the Skechers Women's Bikers-Spokes, such as the diversity and creativity of the Skechers brand, the cool looks, and the comfort of the shoes for light walking. A specific color combination of the pair that the reviewer owns is also shared, indicating a positive personal choice. In addition, the reviewer positively notes the practicality of the velcro straps and the compliments received from others.  However, there are some minor negative elements present in the review. One noteworthy point is the unsatisfactory cushioning in the toe/forefront area where the reviewer mentions that it is thin and one can feel irregularities if the surface walked upon is not smooth. This is the essential factor that led the reviewer to rate the shoe with 4 stars instead of 5, representing a slight decrease in the satisfaction level of the product.  Lastly, the reviewer recommends the shoe, but restricts the recommendation to fashion purposes and clearly states that they would not recommend it for athletic uses. This can be interpreted as neither wholly negative nor positive - it is simply the reviewer's advice based on their personal experience with the shoes.  Despite the implicit and minor discontent expressed in the review, most of the review is positive which makes the overall tone of the review more positive than negative. So, in conclusion, while the review includes some criticisms, it generally highlights the product's strengths and the reviewer's satisfaction with the product."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does \\"There are two types of amensalism, competition and antibiosis.\\" correctly answer the question of What kinds of amensalism are there?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"There are two types of amensalism, competition and antibiosis.\\" correctly answers the question, but to provide a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of amensalism, let's explore each type further. Amensalism is a type of ecological interaction where one species is negatively affected while the other remains unaffected. The two primary kinds of amensalism are competition and antibiosis. 1. Competition: In this type of amensalism, the two interacting species are competing for a shared, limited resource such as food, territory, or mates. This competition has a negative impact on one or both of the species, but neither species benefits from the interaction. For example, two species of birds may compete for the same source of food, and if the larger species can access the food faster and more efficiently, this would harm the smaller species. However, the larger bird's access to food is not improved by hindering the smaller bird's access as they would be consuming the same amount of resources regardless. Moreover, competition can be further divided into two types: intra-specific competition and inter-specific competition. Intra-specific competition occurs within members of the same species, while inter-specific competition occurs between individuals of different species. 2. Antibiosis: This type of amensalism is characterized by the production of substances by one organism that are harmful to another organism, while the producing organism remains unaffected. Such substances are called antimicrobial or allelopathic compounds. Some examples include antibiotics produced by microorganisms to inhibit the growth of competing species, or toxins released by plants to prevent the growth of nearby plants (allelopathy). In these cases, the producing organism does not gain an advantage from harming the affected organism; rather, it is an incidental effect of their existence. One notable example of antibiosis is the production of penicillin by the fungus Penicillium. When Penicillium produces penicillin, it inhibits the growth of nearby bacteria, but the fungus itself is not affected by the antibiotic. Similarly, certain plants, like the black walnut tree (Juglans nigra), produce a chemical called juglone, which reduces the growth of nearby plants. This doesn't necessarily benefit the black walnut tree, but it still indirectly affects other plants in the vicinity. In conclusion, the statement \\"There are two types of amensalism, competition and antibiosis\\" is accurate in summarizing the kinds of amensalism. However, understanding the details of each type of interaction and the examples associated with them provides a more comprehensive knowledge of amensalism as an ecological concept."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

One day, she decided to have a nice time and go eat at a restaurant. But when she came back home, she found out her baby was very sick and not feeling good at all. Baby Flynn was napping with his daddy on a comfy sofa. But suddenly, when they were both sleeping, Flynn's body stopped working, and he turned grey. This made everyone very sad and worried. A special doctor, called a coroner, looked at baby Flynn to try to find out what had happened. The coroner found out that Flynn passed away from something called Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. This is when a baby suddenly stops breathing and their heart stops beating during their sleep. It is a very sad and surprising thing, but the doctor said it was a natural cause. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome is also known as SIDS. No one knows exactly why it happens or how to stop it, and it can happen to any baby, even those that are very healthy and happy. Unfortunately, there's no way to be sure that a baby won't have SIDS. But there are some things that parents can do to help reduce the chances of it happening. They can make sure that the baby is sleeping in a safe place, like on their back, in a crib without lots of blankets or toys. Even though it's a very sad story, it is important for people to learn about SIDS so they can try to help other little babies like Flynn. By knowing the story of Leigh Arnold and baby Flynn, families can be more aware of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and try to make the best choices for their own little ones. In the end, baby Flynn's family and friends will always remember him as a happy and sweet baby. And while they can't change what happened, they can take the lessons they've learned and help others to understand the importance of being careful with sleeping babies."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Denver then answered with a 10 play drive that led to a field goal by Jason Elam, making it 7-3. In the second quarter Denver scored first with a 48-yard field goal.  Bills kicker Rian Lindell then missed a 45-yard field goal.  The Broncos drove deep into Bills territory at the close of the half but Cutler threw an interception to end the drive.  The Bills then drove into Denver territory and tried a long field goal but failed due to a false start, then ended the half with an interception thrown to Elvis Dumervil. On the opening kickoff for the second half, a scary injury occurred to Bills TE Kevin Everett, as he suffered a cervical spine injury while making a tackle on Domenik Hixon. Everett later underwent surgery that day and is currently in intensive care.  He does have feeling and partial movement in his extremities and it is believed he will walk again. The Broncos began the second half with a drive that ended with a missed 50-yard field goal.  The Bills then made a nine play drive that ended with a 23-yard touchdown run by Marshawn Lynch.  The Broncos responded with a drive ending with a touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall.  They then attempted to tie the game with a two-point conversion but failed with an incomplete pass to Javon Walker. The fourth quarter had little scoring.  Elam missed a field goal, but the Bills failed to score or run out the clock, giving Denver the ball with a little over two minutes to play. After an ill-advised lateral bounced free, (saved by rookie back Selvin Young smartly batting the loose ball out of bounds) the Bronco's faced a seemingly insurmountable 3rd and 23 to go. Cutler immediately turned in the best clutch performance of his NFL career to date, one that drew comparisons to John Elway by both sportswriters and teammates. Cutler's drive included two fourth down conversions to drive deep into Bills' territory, where, with no time outs, they rushed the field goal unit onto the field with ten seconds left and the clock ticking down. Execution by the field goal unit allowed Jason Elam to kick the game winning 42-yard field goal just as the clock ticked to 0:00.

Summarize this article: Place 1 tbsp (9.45 g) of yeast, 1 cup (240 ml) of lukewarm water, and 1 tbsp (12.5 g) of sugar into the bowl. Use a whisk to mix the ingredients together. Whisk the ingredients until the yeast and sugar have dissolved. Place 1 cup (120 g) of flour into the bowl with the yeast, lukewarm water, and sugar. Use a whisk to combine the flour with the other ingredients. Leave the mixture resting until small bubbles appear. The amount of time that it takes for the yeast to start bubbling depends on the temperature of the environment. The cooler the environment is, the longer it will take. Transfer 1/3 cup (75 g) of butter, 1 tsp (5 g) of salt, and the remaining 2 1/2 cups (300 g) of flour into the bowl with the yeast mixture. Use your hands to knead the ingredients together. Stop kneading once the butter is evenly distributed throughout the mixture. Keep the ingredients in the bowl while you are kneading. Take the dough from the bowl and place it onto a clean work surface. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out until it looks like a thin sheet and is approximately 1⁄5 in (0.51 cm) thick.  Sprinkle some flour over the work surface if the dough starts to stick. Avoid rolling the dough too thin, otherwise, it may begin to break. Crack 3 eggs into a bowl. Use a whisk to beat the eggs until the whites and the yolks have combined. Coat the dough thoroughly using a pastry brush to spread the egg mixture out.  If you don’t have a pastry brush, you can use the back of a spoon to spread the egg mixture out instead.  Coating the dough with egg is called an egg wash. This helps to give the dough color and makes it shiny when it is cooked. Summary:","output":"We are making yummy dough! First, mix yeast, water, and sugar in a bowl. Then, add flour and wait for bubbles. Next, add butter, salt, and more flour, and squish it all together with your hands. Roll the dough flat, but not too thin. Beat 3 eggs and brush them on the dough to make it shiny and colorful when cooked."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lord Aberdeen formed a coalition government between the Whigs, Peelites, and Radicals, known as the Aberdeen Ministry. During his tenure, Lord Aberdeen focused on the Crimean War and improving the nation's infrastructure. However, his government ultimately collapsed due to internal divisions and the widespread criticism of the government's handling of the Crimean War.

Touch something, and your brain knows. The hand sends signals to the brain to announce contact was made. But that feeling of touch may not require making actual contact, tests on monkeys now show. Zapping brain cells can fool the animal into thinking its finger has touched something. A person who has lost a limb or become paralyzed may need an artificial limb to complete everyday tasks. But such patients may not truly feel any objects they hold. The new findings point toward one day creating a sense of touch in those who use such artificial limbs. Psychologist Sliman Bensmaia of University of Chicago worked on the new tests. His team's findings appeared on October 14 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. The sense of touch is crucial to everyday tasks: People without _ may have difficulty cracking an egg, lifting a cup or even turning a doorknob. That's why restoring it is a major goal for designers of artificial limbs. In their new study, Bensmaia and his co-workers worked with rhesus monkeys  . The scientists implanted electrodes  --- small devices that can detect and relay an electrical signal--into the animals' brains. The scientists used the electrode data to identify which neurons had become active. Then the scientists used the implanted electrodes to zap those same neurons. And the monkeys reacted as though their fingers had been touched. In fact, they hadn't. The monkeys couldn't use words to tell the scientists what they had felt. Instead, they communicated by looking in a particular direction--just as when they had really been touched. The new findings show how touch-sensitive devices could be built. The new study also offers \\" a nice clear pathway\\" for figuring out how to restore a sense of touch to an amputee  or someone with a injury of spinal cord. The study shows how artificial limbs might be connected to the brain so that a person can \\"feel\\" with... Monkeys tell researchers their sense of touch by   _  .

Movie plot title: National Lampoon's Van Wilder: Freshman Year Movie plot: Van Wilder (Jonathan Bennett) has graduated from high school. He is supposed to go on a trip to Amsterdam with his dad (Linden Ashby), but his dad is busy with work, so Van ends up going alone. Van ends up going to Coolidge, following family tradition. His family has their name on a building there, Wilder Hall. However, when he gets there, Coolidge is no longer the fun loving school of his dad's time, but a military-based institution run by Dean Reardon (Kurt Fuller). Reardon, a military man who hates the senior Wilder, wants to make the younger Wilder's life miserable. He can not force him out because his dad is rich and has ties to the school, so he tries to make Van's life a living hell. Van turns a one bedroom dorm into a two bedroom (by breaking down a wall). His roommate is Farley (Nestor Aaron Absera), a pothead from Jamaica. The boys decide to throw a party on campus, which is not allowed, along with kissing, drugs, alcohol, sex, or anything else that is 'fun'. The only person to show up to the party is Yu Dum Fok (Jerry Shea). The boys try to find the girls, but they just find some religious, prudish girls led by Eve (Meredith Giangrande). After she throws sacramental wine on them, Van pulls a prank on them during church. Reardon knows Van is behind the prank, so he commands his ROTC students, Dirk (Steve Talley) and his closeted sidekick Corporal Benedict (Nick Nicotera), on Van, trying to make him crack. Van falls for Dirk's girlfriend, Kaitlin (Kristin Cavallari), causing Dirk to get even more upset. Kaitlin thinks, lives, and breathes the military, and believes in chastity before marriage. Of course, Van has to shake things up. After playing a military game with Reardon that results in him stepping down as dean and being tasered, Van and Kaitlin end up together and Van decides to finish college. The film ends as Van leaves Dirk and Benedict tied to each other in their underwear.
