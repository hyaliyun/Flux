Article: I was twenty years old, and my parents were looking forward to the day when I would be earning my own living. Unfortunately, I had absolutely no idea what I wanted my future occupation to be. The only thing I did know was that I did not want to spend the next 45 years teaching, being a nurse or sitting in an office. But that was before the postman delivered a catalogue of courses that were being offered at the local college. As I looked through it, I was attracted by a page that talked about the difficulties faced by deaf people in their everyday lives and how students could help by learning sign language. It went on to say that graduates of the course usually find work in different organizations, such as law companies, the Stock Exchange, insurance companies and banks. Then I saw something that really caught my eye: \\"Singer\\" are also needed for sporting events, concerts, theatrical performances and, believe it or not, circuses! By the time I got to the bottom of the page, I knew I had found the perfect occupation. I enrolled on the course, which to my parents' great delight was free of charge. The course was brilliant. My favourite part was the final lesson, when our teacher asked us to sign our favourite song. It was really difficult because not only did we have to sign the words, but we also had to find a way of showing whether the song was happy or sad and whether the beat was slow or fast. It was the hardest thing I have ever done--but also the most rewarding.

During the service, the names of the 193 people who died in the disaster were read out. The service was attended by more than 250 bereaved family and friends, as well as some survivors of the tragedy.

This task involves various steps, tools, and materials, as well as the understanding of the physical properties of the objects in order to assemble a sturdy and functional bookshelf. 1. Materials: The first step is to gather all the necessary materials for the construction of the bookshelf. This includes wooden planks or boards that will be used for the various components of the bookshelf, such as the shelves, top, bottom, and side panels. You would need to know the appropriate size, shape, and type of wood that is suitable for making a bookshelf. 2. Measuring and Cutting: Once the materials are gathered, the next step is to measure and cut the wood according to the desired dimensions of the bookshelf. Knowledge of how to use measuring tools (like a tape measure or ruler) and cutting tools (such as a saw) is crucial to ensure precise and accurate cuts. Understanding the physical properties of the wood, such as density and grain direction, will help in properly cutting and shaping the components of the bookshelf, as well as anticipating how they will fit together. 3. Drilling and Joinery: After the pieces are cut to the required dimensions, holes must be drilled for screws, dowels, or other hardware that will be used to assemble the bookshelf. Knowledge of the proper drill bit size, depth of the hole, and location of the holes is essential for a strong and stable construction. Additionally, having knowledge of different joinery techniques, such as mortise and tenon, dovetail, or pocket-hole joinery, can significantly improve the quality and durability of the bookshelf. 4. Sanding and Finishing: Once the different components of the bookshelf have been cut and drilled, they must be sanded smooth to remove any rough edges or surface imperfections. This step requires knowledge of the appropriate sandpaper grit to use as well as proper sanding techniques to ensure a smooth and even surface. Understanding the different types of finishes, such as paint, stain, or clear coats, and how they interact with the properties of the wood is important to achieve the desired look and protection for the bookshelf. 5. Assembly: After all the components have been prepared, the final step is to assemble the bookshelf using the appropriate hardware, such as screws, brackets, or wooden dowels. Knowledge of how to properly tighten and secure the hardware, as well as the correct order of assembly, will ensure a stable and well-built bookshelf. It is also important to have an understanding of the various physical forces acting on the bookshelf, such as gravity and the weight of books it will hold, to ensure the bookshelf design is capable of withstanding normal use. In conclusion, the construction and assembly of a wooden bookshelf is a task that requires knowledge of physical objects - their properties, the tools and materials required, and the techniques used throughout the process - to ensure a successful and well-built final product."},{"instruction":"Objective: how do you bribe someone? Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Pick from: (a). offer them something for no reason.; (b). offer them something for something in return.;","output":"When it comes to bribing someone, naive physics reasoning does not directly apply, as it primarily deals with the interpretation of physical interactions or motion of objects. Bribing, on the other hand, is a social and ethical issue that involves the exchange of goods, services, or money in return for some preferential treatment or influence. However, between the two given solutions, option (b). offer them something for something in return is a more sound solution when considering the nature of a bribe. Please note that bribing is an act of dishonesty and it's important to understand the potential legal, ethical, and moral consequences associated with it. Bribing essentially involves a quid pro quo transaction, where one party offers something of value to another party in exchange for a favor, influence, or other benefits. This act is unethical and illegal in many jurisdictions, and it can lead to serious consequences as it undermines the fairness and integrity of various systems, be it public, corporate or individual. Option (a). offer them something for no reason doesn't qualify as a bribe in the traditional sense since there's no reciprocated or expected favor involved in the exchange. This could be interpreted as a gift, an act of generous charity or a form of altruism, which has different ethical implications. To reiterate, option (b). offer them something for something in return aligns more with the concept of bribing when compared to offering something for no reason, which typically constitutes a gift. However, engaging in bribery is illegal and unethical in most cases, so it's crucial to be aware of the potential consequences and always follow the legal and moral guidelines in any given situation."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the below conversation.

In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re-interpreted the terms of the agreement. Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15. Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned. Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens. Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes. However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.The reputation of Martin Luther King Jr. soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero.

Next, press the warm washcloth over your ingrown hair for up to 15 minutes. Repeat this up to 4 times a day, as needed. This will help the hair rise to the surface. You can also use a hot water bottle as a warm compress. Wet the area around the ingrown hair with warm water. Then, apply soap to your fingers and gently massage the hair for 10-15 seconds. Finally, rinse the area with warm water to wash away the soap. The gentle massage and heat from the water may draw the hair out. An exfoliator can remove the dead skin cells that cover the ingrown hair, which might help it surface. Rub your exfoliator over the area, then let it sit for 10 minutes.

Blow took to Twitter on Sunday, writing that he was \\"fuming\\" after his son called to tell him what happened Saturday -- that he was walking out of the library when university police \\"accosted\\" him and drew their weapons. Blow tweeted that his son was detained because he \\"fit the description\\" of a suspect. Then","output":", in his column, Blow went on to share the harrowing details of his son's experience, emphasizing the trauma and fear that young African-American men face when encountering law enforcement. He expressed frustration and anger at the prevalence of racial profiling and the systemic issues contributing to a culture where young black men are routinely treated as suspects, regardless of their background or achievements. Blow wrote that his son, an accomplished student at one of the country's top universities, had been reduced to a stereotype – a threatening black male – merely for walking out of a library. He also expressed concern about the potential consequences of such confrontations, particularly in a climate where these encounters can turn fatal in mere moments. He went on to address the challenges that black parents face in trying to protect their children from these situations, explaining that he had always urged his son to be cautious and respectful when interacting with police, even though it was disheartening to admit that this advice might be necessary. But Blow also acknowledged that, despite his best efforts to prepare his son, it's impossible to completely shield young African-Americans from the reality of racial bias and police misconduct. As the column gained traction, it sparked a renewed outcry over the insensitivity and injustice experienced by young black men at the hands of law enforcement, with readers sharing their own stories and expressing solidarity with Blow and his family. Many called for increased oversight of police practices and investments in anti-racism training, as well as a reexamination of the policies that contribute to racially biased policing. In response to the public's reaction, Yale University issued a statement, acknowledging the incident and pledging to review the campus police's actions. Additionally, they expressed their commitment to fostering an environment where all students feel safe and respected and promised to facilitate ongoing conversations on race and policing. The incident involving Blow's son not only served as a chilling reminder of the everyday dangers faced by black men in America but also as a rallying point for the public to demand change. Blow's powerful testimony highlighted the urgent need to address the systemic racism that persists within law enforcement and society at large, underscoring the invaluable role that storytellers like himself can play in challenging these injustices and inciting meaningful action."},{"instruction":"Here is some data: Andrews County Airport LOCATION Texas; Texas DEMONYM Texan; Texas COUNTRY United States.

Its origin is attributed to English author Horace Walpole, with his 1764 novel \\"The Castle of Otranto\\", subtitled (in its second edition) \\"A Gothic Story.\\" The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror, an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole's novel. It originated in England in the second half of the 18th century and had much success in the 19th, as witnessed by Mary Shelleys \\"Frankenstein\\" and the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Another well known novel in this genre, dating from the late Victorian era, is Bram Stokers \\"Dracula\\". The name \\"Gothic\\" refers to the (pseudo)-medieval buildings, emulating Gothic architecture, in which many of these stories take place. This extreme form of romanticism was very popular in England and Germany. The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German \\"Schauerroman\\" and the French \\"Georgia\\". - Ragnhild Westgaard Sigland (born November 13, 1976), mostly known by her stage name Nell Sigland, is a Norwegian singer from Hamar, best known as the lead vocalist of Norwegian gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy as a replacement for Liv Kristine, from June 3, 2004 to October 2, 2010. She was also the lead singer for Norwegian gothic rock band The Crest, founded by her husband Kristian Sigland and herself. - Liv Kristine Espenæs (born 14 February 1976 in Stavanger, Norway), better known as Liv Kristine, is a singer/songwriter who has performed and composed songs mostly for various subgenres of heavy metal music. She is known for her work in close association with her then-husband and leader of the German band Atrocity, Alexander Krull. She started her career in the music industry as a vocalist for the gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy, and is the former lead vocalist for the symphonic metal band Leaves' Eyes. - Storm is the sixth studio album by the Norwegian gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy , released in March 2006 . It is the band 's first album with a new lead singer Nell Sigland . The song \`\` Storm '' was released as the album 's only single . The album shows something of a return to gothic metal , although its sound is much lighter and more upbeat than that of earlier albums and it still uses modern English lyrics . The band embarked on a European tour to support the release . The cover art was designed by Thomas Ewerhard , who also made the covers for Assembly and Forever Is The World . The song \`\` Senseless '' was originally titled \`\` Seven '' , as it is written in septuple meter and is the seventh track on the album . - Gothic rock (also referred to as goth rock or simply goth) is a musical subgenre of post-punk and alternative rock that formed during the late 1970s. Gothic rock bands grew from the strong ties they had to the English punk rock and emerging post-punk scenes. Proto-gothic bands include Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, Bauhaus and the Cure. - Stavanger is a city and municipality in Norway. The city is the third-largest urban zone and metropolitan area in Norway (through conurbation with neighbouring Sandnes) and the administrative centre of Rogaland county. The municipality is the fourth most populous in Norway. Located on the Stavanger Peninsula in Southwest Norway, Stavanger counts its official founding year as 1125, the year the Stavanger Cathedral was completed. Stavanger's core is to a large degree 18th- and 19th-century wooden houses that are protected and considered part of the city's cultural heritage. This has caused the town centre and inner city to retain a small-town character with an unusually high ratio of detached houses, and has contributed significantly to spreading the city's population growth to outlying parts of Greater Stavanger. - Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a fusion genre combining the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences. - Death-doom is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal. It combines the slow tempos and pessimistic or depressive mood of doom metal with the deep growling vocals and double kick drumming of death metal. The genre emerged in the mid-1980s and gained a certain amount of popularity during the 1990s, but had become less common by the turn of the 21st century. In turn, death/doom gave rise to the closely related genre of funeral doom as well as to the more melodic and romantic gothic metal. - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Theatre of Tragedy was a Norwegian band from Stavanger, active between 1993 and 2010. They are best known for their earlier albums, which influenced the gothic metal genre.

At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents.

Answer:","output":"Ralph Shields was born in 1892 in Newbiggin, Lanchester, County Durham, England. A talented and impactful forward, he went on to play for numerous clubs over a career spanning nearly 15 years. Shields had his football debut playing for Newcastle Spartans United in 1913. Despite a short stint with the team from 1913 to 1914, his talent quickly became apparent, catching the eyes of many. Consequently, his career rapidly progressed as he moved onto bigger clubs. Between 1914 and 1920, Shields played for Huddersfield Town, earning 45 caps and scoring an impressive 21 goals. His attacking prowess attracted further interest and led to the next phase of his career. In 1920, Ralph Shields joined Exeter City and continued his football journey for a single season (1920-1921). Though his time at Exeter was brief, he managed to leave his mark by scoring four goals in his 19 appearances with the club. The following year, Shields signed with Brentford, where he appeared only eight times between 1921 and 1922, registering one goal to his name. Ralph Shields' career then took him to Sittingbourne, a club he represented from 1922 to 1926. During his time at Sittingbourne, Shields continued to display his skill and passion, building on his already impressive career. In 1926, Ralph made a move to Blyth, where he played for a single season (1926-1927). Throughout his career, Ralph Shields played as a forward, showing great prowess in attack.

In this case, the statement provided is: \\"A black woman wearing a yellow smock in an office.\\" From this information, we know that a woman is in an office and she is wearing a smock, which could possibly indicate a specific role or job in the workplace depending on the type of office and context. However, the statement doesn't provide explicit information on whether the woman is currently performing work-related duties. While one might infer that the woman is working because she's in an office and dressed in a specific way, this is an assumption and not a definitive conclusion. A person in an office could be there for many other reasons, including being a visitor, attending a meeting, or performing maintenance tasks, among others. However, we can state as follows, given the context: \\"Since offices are generally places of work, and the woman is dressed in a smock – a garment often associated with many professions – it might be reasonable to hypothesize that she is working, but without further information, one cannot definitively conclude this.\\" So, it is important to remember that while assumptions can be made based on the available evidence, they might not always yield accurate conclusions. Further information about the woman's role, actions, or purpose in the office would be needed to confirm if she is indeed working. Every piece of information helps to make more accurate inferences or draw more definitive conclusions."},{"instruction":"The Christian Saint Christopher is most commonly depicted carrying what across a swollen river????","output":"Saint Christopher is often shown in pictures carrying a little child across a big, fast-flowing river.

After numerous tries, she found it was all in vain and was very upset. \\"Maybe it's my destiny ! I'm not destined to reach the vast ocean in the legend, \\" she murmured sadly to herself. At this time, a deep voice came, saying, \\"If a breeze can cross the desert, so can a river.\\" It was the voice of the desert. Unconvinced, the little stream replied, \\"That's because a breeze can fly, but I can't.\\" \\"That's because you stick to what you are.

The little stream had never heard of such a thing. \\"Give up what I am now and disappear into the breeze? No! No!\\" She could not accept this idea. After all, she had never experienced anything like it before.

Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution states that \\"The Congress shall have Power... To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water.\\" This separation of powers ensures that the decision to go to war is made collectively by elected representatives, rather than by one individual, to prevent the misuse of military force and maintain checks and balances within the government. The War Powers Resolution of 1973 further limits the President's authority to engage in armed conflict without congressional authorization, although some argue that the resolution's effectiveness is debatable due to various conflicts that have occurred since its enactment.

The ratio can be written as follows: R / H = 2 / 1 We know that there are a total of 9,000 chickens (roosters and hens combined), so: R + H = 9,000 Now, we can use the proportion to express the number of hens in terms of the number of roosters: H = R / 2 We can plug this equation into our total chicken equation to have it based on a single variable (roosters, in this case): R + (R / 2) = 9,000 Now we can solve for R: (3/2)R = 9,000 R = (2/3) * 9,000 R = 6,000 So there are 6,000 roosters on the chicken farm. The reason behind this answer is that we used the given ratio of roosters to hens (2:1) and the total number of chickens (9,000) to set up a proportion, and then solved the resulting equations to find the number of roosters."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: What are mutant versions of normal genes called?

He has developed his views and positions across many fields, including social, political, and economic theory. In legal theory, he is best known by his work in the 1970s and 80s while at Harvard Law School as part of the Critical Legal Studies movement, which is held to have helped disrupt the methodological consensus in American law schools. His political activity helped the transition to democracy in Brazil in the aftermath of the military regime, and culminated with his appointment as Brazil's Minister of Strategic Affairs in 2007 and again in 2015. Unger's critique of economics begins with the identification of a key moment in economic history, when the analysis of production and exchange turned away from social theory and engaged in a quest for scientific objectivity. In Unger's analysis, classical economics focused on the causal relations among social activities, which were connected with the production and distribution of wealth. Classical economists asked questions about the true basis of value, activities that contributed to national wealth, systems of rights, or about the forms of government under which people grow rich. In the late-nineteenth century, in response to attacks from socialist ideas and debates about how society works, and as a means to escape the conundrums of value theory and to answer how values could become prices, marginalist economics arose. This movement in economics disengaged economics from prescriptive and normative commitments to withdraw the study of economies from debates about how society worked and what kind of society we wanted to live in. For Unger, this moment in the history of economics robbed it of any analytical or practical value. Unger's critique of Marginalism begins with Walras' equilibrium theory, which attempted to achieve a certainty of economic analysis by putting aside normative controversies of social organization. Unger finds three weaknesses that crippled the theory: foremost, the theory claimed that equilibrium would be spontaneously generated in a market economy. In reality, a self-adjusting equilibrium fails to occur. Second, the theory puts forth a determinate image of the market. Historically, however, the market has been shown to be indeterminate with different market arrangements. Third, the polemical use of efficiency fails to account for the differences of distribution among individuals, classes, and generations. The consequences of the marginalist movement were profound for the study of economics, Unger says. The most immediate problem is that under this generalizing tendency of economics, there is no means by which to incorporate empirical evidence and thus to re-imagine the world and develop new theories and new directions. In this way, the discipline is always self-referential and theoretical. Furthermore, the lack of a normative view of the world curtails the ability to propose anything more than a policy prescription, which by definition always assumes a given context. The discipline can only rationalize the world and support a status quo. Lastly, Unger finds that this turn in economics ended up universalizing debates in macroeconomics and leaving the discipline without any historical perspective. A consequence, for example, was that Keynes' solution to a particular historical crisis was turned into a general theory when it should only be understood as a response to a particular situation. Ask a question about this article.","output":"Sure, that sounds like a lot of big words, doesn't it? So, think of Roberto Unger as someone who spends a lot of time thinking deeply about how things work. He looks at how we live together in society (that's social theory), how we make and enforce rules (that's political theory), and how we create and share things that people need or want (that's economic theory). One of his biggest ideas is about how we understand economics. He thinks that a long time ago, economists (people who study how we make, share and use things) shifted their focus away from understanding the society and instead tried to make economics a science. According to Unger, this shift was not a good thing, since it took the humanity out of economics. So now, instead of asking questions like \\"Why does this thing cost this much?\\", \\"Who gets what and why?\\", \\"What leads to a rich society?\\", economists are more concerned with equations and theories. And while this might seem like it makes economics more accurate and reliable, Unger think it's stopping us from coming up with new, more helpful ways of understanding economics. This is the gist of his work in economics. Oh, and he's also had a big role in politics in Brazil. He helped make Brazil a democratic country and even served as a minister, kind of like a big boss helping run the country.

Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns. - Improvisation is broad term referring to the process of devising an atypical method of solving a problem due to lack of time or resources. In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation, within the context of performing arts, is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines. - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa.

The trumpet group contains the instruments with the highest register in the brass family. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC; they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late-14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through almost-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a \\"buzzing\\" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century they have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent.

The term 'Galanthophile' derives from the Latin name of the plant, 'Galanthus', and the ancient Greek word 'philia', which means 'love for' or 'strong affinity towards'. Snowdrops are very distinctive, small, white flowers that typically bloom in winter or early spring, often among the earliest blooms to appear in colder climates. They are native to a large swath of Europe, from Spain and Italy in the west, across central and eastern Europe to Ukraine, and even extending into Turkey and the Caucasus region. In recent decades, they have become increasingly popular around the world, particularly in temperate climates, and they have become naturalized in many areas beyond their original range, including North America. A true Galanthophile does not merely collect different types of snowdrops, but they are typically well-versed in the different species, subspecies, and cultivars of this flower. There are around 20 species of Galanthus, but thanks to natural variation and human cultivation, there are now many hundreds of different cultivars, each with its unique beauty and often with its named variety. These can differ in various ways, from the pattern and shape of the petals, the size of the flower, the height and form of the plant, even to the exact time of blooming or subtle differences in fragrance. Some snowdrops have green markings or double petals, and others have remarkably large or small flowers. Galanthophiles might travel internationally to study and collect different snowdrop varieties. They may also participate in 'snowdrop walks' which are special events organized in late winter or early spring where enthusiasts can view large displays of snowdrops. These collectors may also visit horticulture shows, plant sales, or specialist nurseries to procure rare and unusual varieties and to learn more about them from experts and fellow enthusiasts. The plant’s popularity has led to an active secondary market, and very rare varieties can command very high prices. Further, galanthophiles can also engage in cultivation, breeding, and propagation of new snowdrop varieties. This pursuit requires a high level of expertise and patience, as creating new cultivar that is distinct and stable through successive generations can take many years. It is not uncommon for a galanthophile to have a deep knowledge of botany and gardening practices. It is noteworthy to mention that the term 'Galanthophile' is relatively new, first appearing in the 1990s and has become more widespread as interest in these charming flowers has grown. This interest is associated with a broader trend towards 'minor bulb' cultivation and a fascination with the subtleties and diversity found within narrowly defined groups of plants. In summary, a Galanthophile's devotion to snowdrops embodies a deep appreciation for the beauty and variety of nature, an excitement for discovery, camaraderie with other collectors, and often, a pleasure in the quiet and patient cultivation of these wonderful plants."},{"instruction":"Generate a 5-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.gms.","output":"Title: Stellar App - A True Game-changer!

Jazz originated in New Orleans as a fusion of African and European music and played a significant part in wider cultural changes in this period, and its influence on pop culture continued long afterwards. The Jazz Age is often referred to in conjunction with the Roaring Twenties. - A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as web comics. There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes. - An editorial cartoon, also known as a political cartoon, is an illustration containing a commentary that usually relates to current events or personalities. An artist who draws such images is known as an editorial cartoonist. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - Flappers were a generation of young Western women in the 1920s who wore short skirts, bobbed their hair, listened to jazz, and flaunted their disdain for what was then considered acceptable behavior. Flappers were seen as brash for wearing excessive makeup, drinking, treating sex in a casual manner, smoking, driving automobiles, and otherwise flouting social and sexual norms. Flappers had their origins in the liberal period of the Roaring Twenties, the social, political turbulence and increased transatlantic cultural exchange that followed the end of World War I, as well as the export of American jazz culture to Europe. - The Roaring Twenties is a term for Western society and culture in the 1920s. It was a period of sustained economic prosperity with a distinctive cultural edge in the United States, Canada and Western Europe, particularly in major cities such as New York City, Montreal, Chicago, Detroit, Paris, Berlin, London and Los Angeles. In France and Quebec, it was known as the \\"\\"années folles\\"\\" (\\"Crazy Years\\"), emphasizing the era's social, artistic and cultural dynamism. Jazz music blossomed, the flapper redefined modern womanhood, Art Deco peaked, and, in the wake of hyper-emotional patriotism after World War I, normalcy returned to politics. This era saw the large-scale use of automobiles, telephones, motion pictures, radio, and electricity; commercial, passenger, and freight aviation; as well as unprecedented industrial growth, accelerated consumer demand, plus significant changes in lifestyle and culture. The media focused on celebrities, especially sports heroes and movie stars, as cities rooted for their home teams and filled the new palatial cinemas and gigantic sports stadiums.

A real set of braces in Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand, for example, will cost around 1,200, which is a large amount for the country with a GDP of 345 billion ( a billion is 1,000 million), compared to the US which had a GDP of 1,506 Trillion ( a Trillion is 1,000 billion) last year. While Asian teens may think that their colorful fake braces are cool, experts say that these trendy fashion braces can cause illness and can even lead to death. According to the New York Daily News, fake fashion braces have already been linked to the deaths of two teens in Thailand.A 17-year-old in the northeast city of Khon Kaen died from heart failure caused by a thyroid infection from a pair of fake fashion braces. Police also linked the death of another 14-year-old girl in Chonburi to a pair of fashion braces she had brought from an illegal shop. Although the government is giving warnings about fake braces, the trend has been going strong for at least four years. What's worse, the trend for fake braces shows no sign of slowing down.

So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle.

When I washed it, the blue from the shoulders bled all over the white of the shirt. It looks awful and I will never be able to wear it again. What a waist of money! Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction and disappointment with the product's performance, specifically addressing a significant issue with the shirt's quality. The blue from the shoulders of the shirt bled onto the white of the shirt during washing, which has rendered it unwearable in the reviewer's opinion. A negative tone can be identified by the use of several strong markers in the review. The reviewer mentions that the shirt \\"looks awful\\" after being washed, indicating displeasure with the product's appearance. Additionally, they state that they \\"will never be able to wear it again,\\" emphasizing the severity of the problem. Furthermore, the phrasing of \\"what a waist of money!\\" is another indicator of the displeasure and disappointment experienced by the reviewer. It implies that they feel they have wasted their money on a product that did not perform as expected. The misspelling of \\"waist\\" instead of \\"waste\\" is likely unintentional, but it does not alter the overarching negative tone of the review. In conclusion, the product review of the shirt has a decidedly negative tone. The reviewer has had a poor experience, and the dissatisfaction with the product's quality and performance is evident in their choice of words and overall sentiment."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Where was the biggest department store which IBM Printer Model 4 headquartered?

W: I don't understand how the inventor earns money from the invention. After all, anyone can copy and sell it. Really, what is a patent? A piece of paper? A philosophy? You can't see it. M: I am glad you asked that. Actually when an inventor has a patent, it's enforceable by the laws in the country where the inventor developed the invention. If anyone makes and sells the product then the inventor can take them to civil court. W: What can the inventor expect to receive if he sues and wins? M: Well, there are different things the court could do, but there's no guarantee. There's a good chance the court could award him compensation and orders to stop the manufacture and sale of goods. It may well be that the goods would be ordered to be destroyed. W: Can the other person being sued do anything to help themselves? M: That's the beauty of the whole thing. Ignorance of the law doesn't count, I'm afraid. However, the other person can counter-sue pretending that they were actually the original inventor. W: You said the inventor is protected by the laws of the country. Is everything equal? Do all countries have the same law? M: No, they're not all equal. You're right. It's only in theory.

A new radio ad bankrolled by an influential city union for mayoral candidate John Liu is raising eyebrows among government watchdogs who warn that it could set a dangerous precedent.

UPDATED:. 09:56 EST, 30 March 2013. More than 2,000 people displaced by Superstorm Sandy are still living in hotels five months after the devastating natural disaster destroyed their New York City homes. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is paying on average 252 a night to house families and individuals from across the hurricane hit area. According to the New York Times, social service groups are hoping to get all those affected into a permanent home by the end of April but admit it may not be possible. Homeless: More than 2,000 victims of Superstorm Sandy are still living in hotels across New York City. Some experts say such accommodation will put pressure on individuals - leaving them in cramped conditions with no feeling of permanency. Others say it is just too expensive as a long-term solution. 'The problem with hotels is that it’s not a normal life — you can’t cook a meal,' said Martha J. Kegel, executive director of Unity of Greater New Orleans, a coalition that helped relocate residents after Hurricane Katrina, told the Times. 'You can’t even store much food. There’s going to be domestic violence because there’s not enough room. It’s not a good situation for people to be long-term.' Rosanne Haggerty, president of Community Solutions, a homelessness charity said: 'Why are we spending money on hotels instead of helping families pay the rent?' Devastation: Those still in hotels can't afford current housing available in New York City. Their previous homes were destroyed in the storm. 'For a fraction of the cost, families could be in a stable situation and getting a running start in putting their lives together.' Wanda Wilson, a mother-of-two made homeless after Sandy told the paper she hoped for a more permanent solution. 'The whole situation is really messed up. It’s a waste of money,' she said. Many of those affected by Sandy are too poor to afford available housing and have nowhere to return to because of the devastating impact of the storm. 43 per cent of those who registered for FEMA funding made less than 30,000 per year per household. The lack of available housing made hotels the only choice according to city officials. 'The hotels provided flexibility and availability that you can’t get anywhere else,' the city’s commissioner of homeless services Seth Diamond said. Recovery: Many of those affected by the storm were New York's poorest earning less than 30,000 per household. Support: Thousands needed help after the storm. People are pictured here waiting in line at a distribution site in Coney Island. It is hoped newly available public housing will plug the gap but in some instances families will also be given vouchers to subsidize 70 per cent of their rent. If the April 30 target is missed many of the families could end up back in homeless shelters, according to the Times. 'Shelter is one of many possibilities,' said Barbara Brancaccio, a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Homeless Services. The ongoing difficulties in dealing with the 7,000 residents who went to evacuation centers following Hurricane Sandy on October 29, has prompted many to call for wholesale reform of the city's emergency disaster planning. 'The city may have been overly optimistic,' said Councilman Brad Lander. 'You need to have emergency rental vouchers ready to be deployed.' After Hurricane Katrina many of those made homeless were put in hotels for years. And there are many people affected by Sandy who may never get help. According to the Times, around two per cent of those in need are illegal immigrants who don't want to reveal their status to officials. On Friday, the Government announced 1.4billion in aid to New York transit agencies to help rebuild systems after Sandy. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict. - The Mexican Revolution was a major armed struggle that radically transformed Mexican culture and government. Although recent research has focused on local and regional aspects of the Revolution, it was a \\"genuinely national revolution.\\" Its outbreak in 1910 resulted from the failure of the 35-year long regime of Porfirio Díaz to find a managed solution to the presidential succession. This meant there was a political crisis among competing elites and the opportunity for agrarian insurrection. Wealthy landowner Francisco I. Madero challenged Díaz in 1910 presidential election, and following the rigged results revolted under the Plan of San Luis Potosí.

Egypt lies to the northeast and encompasses part of West Asia, while Sudan is situated on the edge of the Sahel, to the south of Egypt. - The Boxer Rebellion, Boxer Uprising or Yihequan Movement was a violent anti-foreign and anti-Christian uprising that took place in China between 1899 and 1901, towards the end of the Qing dynasty. It was initiated by the Militia United in Righteousness (\\"Yihetuan\\"), known in English as the \\"Boxers\\", and was motivated by proto-nationalist sentiments and opposition to imperialist expansion and associated Christian missionary activity. - Edward Sinnott \`\` Tex '' O'Reilly ( 15 August 1880 -- 9 December 1946 ) was an American soldier of fortune who is said to have fought in ten wars under many flags . Initially serving in the U.S. Army in the Spanish -- American War and Philippine -- American War , as well as the Boxer Rebellion , he would claim to fight in Venezuela , Honduras and Nicaragua . He fought with Pancho Villa in Mexico and claimed to have fought in the Rif War with the Spanish Foreign Legion in North Africa , as well as serving as an international policeman in Shanghai . He became a writer , including as a reporter for the Associated Press . He wrote an autobiography , Roving and Fighting , and Lowell Thomas wrote Born to Raise Hell about him . The latter book has been reprinted and is distributed by The Long Riders ' Guild Press . - The Spanish Civil War, widely known in Spain simply as The Civil War or The War, took place from 1936 to 1939 and was fought between the Republicans, who were loyal to the democratic, left-leaning and a relatively urban Second Spanish Republic in an alliance of convenience with the Anarchists, versus the Nationalists, a falangist, Carlist and a largely aristocratic conservative group led by General Francisco Franco. Although the war is often portrayed as a struggle between democracy and fascism, some historians consider it more accurately described as a struggle between leftist revolution and rightist counterrevolution. Ultimately, the Nationalists won, and Franco then ruled Spain for the next 36 years, from April 1939 until his death in November 1975. - \\"Don\\" Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja, 2nd Marquis of Estella, 22nd Count of Sobremonte, Knight of Calatrava (January 8, 1870 March 16, 1930) was a dictator, aristocrat, and military officer who served as Prime Minister of Spain from 1923 to 1930 during Spain's Restoration era. He deeply believed that it was the politicians who had ruined Spain and that governing without them he could restore the nation. His slogan was \\"Country, Religion, Monarchy.\\" Historians depict him as an inept dictator who lacked clear ideas and political acumen, and who alienated his potential supporters such as the army. He did not create a base of support among the voters, and depended instead on elite elements. His actions discredited the king and ruined the monarchy, while heightening social tensions that led in 1936 to a full-scale Spanish Civil War. - The Rif War, also called the Second Moroccan War, was fought in the early 1920s between the colonial power Spain (later joined by France) and the Berbers of the Rif mountainous region. Led by Abd al-Karim, the Riffians at first inflicted several defeats on the Spanish forces by using guerrilla tactics and captured European weapons. After France's entry into the conflict and the massive landing of Spanish troops at Al Hoceima, Abd el-Karim surrendered to the French and was taken into exile. Despite victory, controversy in Spain over the conduct of the war led to a military coup by Gen. Miguel Primo de Rivera in 1923 and foreshadowed the Spanish Civil War of 193639.

The statement provided says that shortbread is traditionally served at Yuletide and Hogmanay and that it is rich in butter and sugar. It does not mention the inclusion of oranges and figs in the recipe. To clarify, shortbread is a type of traditional Scottish biscuit made primarily from flour, sugar, and butter. Its origins date back to medieval times, when it was derived from a type of bread known as \\"biscuit bread.\\" Over time, the recipe evolved into what we know today as shortbread. The classic shortbread recipe does not contain oranges or figs, but rather focuses on the three principal ingredients: flour, sugar, and butter. The high butter content gives the shortbread its crumbly and rich texture, while the sugar provides the sweetness. That being said, there are numerous variations on the traditional shortbread recipe, which can include additional flavors and ingredients such as chocolate, nuts, caramel, and various spices. In some variations, ingredients like orange zest, candied orange peel, or dried figs might be incorporated into the mixture to create a unique and different flavor profile. These adaptations, however, are personal preferences or modern twists on the classic recipe and not considered traditional. To sum up, we cannot conclude that shortbread is made with oranges and figs simply because it is sweeter and traditionally served at Yuletide and Hogmanay. The base recipe for shortbread does not include these ingredients, and their addition would represent a variation on the classic shortbread rather than a defining characteristic."},{"instruction":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Gulf Stream, together with its northern extension towards Europe, the North Atlantic Drift, is a powerful, warm, and swift Atlantic ocean current that originates in the Gulf of Mexico and stretches to the tip of Florida, and follows the eastern coastlines of the United States and Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The process of western intensification causes the Gulf Stream to be a northward accelerating current off the east coast of North America. At about , it splits in two, with the northern stream, the North Atlantic Drift, crossing to Northern Europe and the southern stream, the Canary Current, recirculating off West Africa. - Gunnar Gunnarsson (18 May 1889 21 November 1975) was an Icelandic author who wrote mainly in Danish. He grew up, in considerable poverty, on Valþjófsstaður in Fljótsdalur valley and on Ljótsstaðir in Vopnafjörður. Despite great difficulties, he became one of the most popular novelists in Denmark and Germany. - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - A lava field, also called a lava plain or lava bed, is a large expanse of nearly flat-lying lava flows. Such features are generally composed of highly fluid basalt lava, and can extend for tens or even hundreds of miles across the underlying terrain. The extent of large lava fields is most readily grasped from the air or in satellite photos, where their typically dark, nearly black color contrasts sharply with the rest of the landscape. According to the US Geological Survey, monogenetic volcanic fields are collections of cinder cones, and/or Maar vents and associated lava flows and pyroclastic deposits. Sometimes a stratovolcano is at the center of the field, as at the San Francisco Volcanic Field in Arizona. Monogenetic volcano fields have systematic growth patterns that suggest they represent single magmatic systems in the same way that stratovolcanoes do, but monogenetic volcanoes grow laterally rather than vertically (Wood and Shoan, 1984). Detailed mapping indicates that some cinder cones in monogenetic fields (e.g., Cima, California, and Timber Mountain Volcanic Field, Nevada) may have had multiple eruptions separated by tens to hundreds of thousands of years (Wells, et al., 1989). Thus, some monogenetic cones may actually be polygenetic. This possibility differs from observations of historic eruptions (Wood, 1979), and is physically difficult to understand because cinder cone conduits are narrow and must solidify within a few years of eruption. Nonetheless, such multiple eruptions appear to have happened at least twice: Other cinder cones need to be closely reexamined. - Fljótsdalur is a valley in east Iceland, formed by the Lagarfljót River. Lake Lagarfljót and the city of Egilsstaðir are located in the valley. - Vopnafjörður is a village and municipality in Northeast Iceland, standing on a peninsula in the middle of a mountainous bay by the same name. The main industries of Vopnafjörður are fish processing, agriculture and tourism and other services. - Sons of the Soil ( Danish : Borgslægtens historie , Icelandic : Saga Borgarættarinnar ) is a Danish film directed and shot by Gunnar Sommerfeldt in Iceland in 1919 , based on the novel by Gunnar Gunnarsson . It was released in 1921 . - Reykjavík is the capital and largest city of Iceland. It has a latitude of 64°08' N, making it the world's northernmost capital of a sovereign state, and is a popular tourist destination. It is located in southwestern Iceland, on the southern shore of Faxa Bay. With a population of around 130,000 (and over 200,000 in the Capital Region), it is the heart of Iceland's cultural, economic and governmental activity.

The Spirit tells that Ebenezer is ok, but in his past, there are other Blackadders who are quite miserly.

Stanley, formerly known as Port Stanley, is a small settlement situated on the eastern coast of East Falkland Island, which is one of the two primary islands that constitute the Falkland Islands. As a British Overseas Territory, the Falkland Islands operate under a distinct administrative body, and Stanley serves as the primary center of governance and administration. While the total population of the Falkland Islands is relatively small, with approximately 3,400 residents, the majority of the population lives in Stanley, making it the largest settlement in the region. The town’s layout follows the natural slope of the land, with the elevated streets offering stunning views of the harbor and the ocean beyond. Stanley is also the main commercial and logistical hub of the Falkland Islands, with many local services and businesses located within the town. In addition, the Falkland Islands Government, the Falklands Islands Museum, the Christ Church Cathedral, and Community School, among other essential facilities, are also situated in Stanley. Historically, Stanley has had immense strategic value. It became the center of attention during the Falklands War in 1982 when Argentine forces occupied the region briefly. Eventually, the British military reestablished control over the Falkland Islands, including Stanley. In recent years, the wind patterns of the area have prompted the development of sustainable energy endeavors, such as wind farms, that significantly contribute to the island's power grid. In addition, tourism has been steadily growing as a vital industry in Stanley, with more cruise ships visiting the islands annually.

Eventually, he was able to categorize them in three different groups, group A, group B, and group C. He placed the animals that can only hear ifrasound in group A. Then he placed the animals that are only able to hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do in group B. The last group of animals were able to hear only ultrasound. He placed them in group C. But I can use this background: The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a second. Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound . Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound . Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs but not people can hear. The whistles produce a sound with a frequency too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, for example, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz. What is an answer for this question: Which group would be able to hear lower frequency, group A or group B? A:","output":"Group A would be able to hear lower frequency sounds compared to group B. This is because animals in Group A can only hear infrasound, which consists of sound waves with frequencies below 20 Hz. In comparison, animals in Group B can hear sound frequencies within the same range as humans, which is between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Infrasound is characterized by its low frequency and, as a result, the ability to travel long distances without losing much energy. Some animals, including elephants, whales, and some species of birds, are known to use infrasound for communication and navigation purposes. On the other hand, Group B animals, which include humans, can hear sounds within a range that is considered average for mammals. This allows them to communicate effectively and be aware of their environment. However, their hearing range does not include the lower frequency sounds that Group A animals can detect, making Group A the one able to hear lower frequencies."},{"instruction":"16 I will delight myself in thy statutes I will not forget thy word Please fix the punctuation.","output":"Verse 16: \\"I will delight myself in Thy statutes; I will not forget Thy word.\\""},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

He goes to the Tucks and orders them to reveal where the spring is; when they deny any knowledge about the spring he threatens Winnie with a pistol. He calls their bluff by shooting Jesse and exposing his youth; but in return Jesse's mother, Mae, kills him with the rear end of a rifle.

Given the context: Why did Remy do this? Possible answers: So people would know about the event, So people would go to the flyers, make new ones","output":"Given the context, the most logical explanation for Remy posting flyers about the event would be to inform people about it. 1) Assumption: The action of creating and posting flyers is usually aimed at distributing information to a broad audience. This common use of flyers provides the basis for my assumption. 2) Analysis: In the context, Remy is putting on an event, and they've chosen to communicate this via flyers. Events require attendance to be successful and people can't attend if they're not aware of the event. Therefore, Remy's goal must be to advertise the event, thereby drawing attention to it. 3) Conclusion: Considering these factors, the most likely reason as to why Remy posted flyers about the event is \\"so people would know about the event\\". The other options, \\"so people would go to the flyers\\" proceeds from a misunderstanding of the goal of posting flyers because people don't go to flyers, they go to the events that flyers advertise. Likewise, \\"make new ones\\" doesn't align with the given task since it does not explain why Remy posted flyers for the event they are hosting - he is not posting flyers to make new ones.

Created by writer Len Wein and artist Dave Cockrum, he debuted in the comic book Giant-Size X-Men #1 (May 1975). Nightcrawler is a member of a fictional subspecies of humanity known as mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities. Nightcrawler possesses superhuman agility, the ability to teleport, and adhesive hands and feet. In the 2008 miniseries X-Infernus, Pixie summons her Souldagger and stabs Kurt in the chest, knocking him out. When Pixie removes her Souldagger, Magik's Soulsword emerges from his chest. Magik teleports away after taking out Pixie, Mercury, Rockslide, and Beast. Kurt wakes up and stops Pixie from going after her and Pixie breaks down and apologizes for stabbing him. Later the X-Men gather and Kurt is put in charge of a team of X-Men to go help save Magik. Upon entering Limbo, Kurt, Mercury, Colossus, Rockslide, Pixie, and Wolverine fight their way through many demons. Pixie, Mercury, and Rockslide are horrified at how brutal the older X-Men are towards the demons. An octopus type creature attacks Kurt until Pixie jumps in and kills it with her Souldagger. Hearing the screams from the castle, Kurt teleports the X-Men into the throne room. Once there, Witchfire turns Colossus and Wolverine against Mercury and Rockslide. Kurt notices Illyana chained to a pillar and she asks him to stab her with Pixie's Souldagger, as it's the only way and he is the only one to do it because he is attuned to magic.He apologizes and he stabs her; at that moment Colossus punches Kurt, and Witchfire finishes making her fifth and final Bloodstone from the now demonic Pixie. The fact however that Colossus and Wolverine have not killed him, makes Kurt realize they are not fully under her control. Using Pixie's Dagger, Kurt then pulls Illyana's Soulsword from her, and uses it to free Wolverine and Colossus of Witchfire's control. Unfortunately, the demon manages to use the Bloodstones to summon the Elder Gods. Through their combined efforts, the X-Men and Magik managed to banish both Witchfire and the Elder Gods, but not without losing four of the five Bloodstones. Furious at losing another part of her soul, Pixie flees. Being told by Illyana to let her go, Kurt consoles Magik about the theology of a soul, before she teleports them back to Earth. Kurt, along with Colossus, Cyclops, and the former New Mutants team, convinces her to stay with them and join the X-Men.

(CNN) -- The Supreme Court tried mightily to wade through a cloud of bureaucratic regulations Monday over setting clear air standards, a high-stakes environmental and economic fight pitting the Obama administration against a coalition of states and utilities. The justices on Monday heard six separate appeals, which were consolidated into more than 100 minutes of often dense oral arguments. A ruling is expected by June. At issue is narrow, but potentially far-reaching -- whether the Environmental Protection Agency can tighten emissions standards for \\"stationary\\" greenhouse gas sources, such as power plants, in what the administration says is an effort to stem the effects of climate change and global warming. Some progressive groups worry the conservative majority","output":"on the court might use this opportunity to limit the EPA's regulatory powers, which could have lasting implications on the agency's ability to protect the environment and public health. As the debate rages on, both sides of the argument have their say. The Obama administration, backed by environmental groups, argues that the EPA must be allowed to tighten emissions standards in order to protect the environment and public health. They believe that stricter regulations will force industries to invest in cleaner technologies and help reduce the nation's overall carbon footprint. On the other hand, the coalition of states and utility companies argue that the EPA is overreaching its authority and that tighter regulations will result in higher energy costs for consumers and stifle economic growth. They also fear that stricter standards will lead to job losses and drive businesses overseas. After months of deliberation, the Supreme Court issues its ruling in June. In a closely divided decision, the court rules in favor of the EPA, holding that the agency has the authority to tighten emissions standards for stationary greenhouse gas sources. The court asserts that the Clean Air Act grants the EPA broad authority to protect public health and welfare, and that the Obama administration's efforts to curb climate change fit within this mandate. The ruling is met with mixed reactions. Environmentalists and progressive groups celebrate the victory, believing it is a crucial step forward in the fight against climate change. However, the coalition of states and utility companies express disappointment, arguing that the ruling allows the EPA too much power and could lead to a future of excessive regulation. In the months and years following the Supreme Court decision, the EPA moves forward with implementing its new regulations. While there are initial concerns about job losses and increased energy costs, these issues are mitigated by government incentives for clean energy development, advancements in technology, and a gradual transition to renewable energy sources. As a result, industries begin to invest more heavily in cleaner technologies, leading to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and a reduction of the nation's overall carbon footprint. Although the transition is not without its challenges, the strict emissions standards prove to be an effective motivator for companies to invest in cleaner energy sources, resulting in a greener economy and a healthier environment. In the end, the Supreme Court's decision in this case has far-reaching consequences not just for the United States, but for the collective global efforts to combat climate change. By upholding the EPA's authority to tighten emissions standards, the court sends a clear message that national governments have a responsibility to take meaningful action in the fight against climate change. This ruling serves as a catalyst for further progress in environmental protection, providing an example for other nations to follow in the pursuit of a cleaner, more sustainable future for all."},{"instruction":"Question: When a book is dropped onto a wooden desk, the molecules in the wood begin to vibrate from the force of the book.

Russian emigres living in Paris and Copenhagen ten years after the Tsar was executed during the First World War were historically drawn into an extortion scheme to draw on one of the family's unclaimed ten million pound bank accounts in the form of war reparations. .Yul Brynner is a player in the extortion scheme. As the group's window of opportunity to cop the lolly is drawing to a close, he boxes homeless woman, Ingrid Bergman, into being the claimant asking for fiscal executorship to draw on the ten million pound bank account. Because the players and their sycophants do not seem to be able to generate the legal paperwork to prepare the civil suit to claim the lolly, the second half draws into it a recluse widow played by Helen Hayes, whom they believe will be able to sort it out. What none in the group, least of all Yul Brynner, expects is that two of Hollywood's most admired stars, Ingrid Bergman and Helen Hayes, are given character blocking to exhibit loose cannon personalities who purposefully blow everything up at every turn, and also light up the screen with heart-rending performances as foils to Brynner's charismatic presence and powerful gut determination to extort money. Following their powerful confrontations which take up much of the second half, Bergman and Hayes disappear from the action to prepare, offscreen, a formal diplomatic reception to which the press will be invited to witness Hayes' proclamation of support for Bergman's civil suit petition to cop the ten million pound lolly so Brynner can distribute some of it to each cohort.

Like most of his childhood friends, Ronaldo began his soccer career playing barefoot in the streets of his neighborhood. At the age of 14, he joined SCristovo soccer club and only two years later became the star of Cruzeiro Belo Horizonte scoring a total of 58 goals in 60 matches and earning himself a reputation for his explosive pace and outstanding finishing skills. His goal-scoring record and unusual _ led him to be included in the Brazilian World Cup winning team the following year. After the World Cup, many top European football clubs were trying to sign him. Many people, including Brazilian football legend Pele, referred to him as the most promising footballer of his generation. Since his transfer to Dutch team PSV Eindhoven, Ronaldo's biography is one of success after success. Two Copa America s, a UEFA Cup, a Dutch Cup, a Spanish League Cup, and two awards as best player in the world, all in the space of two years, are some of Ronaldo s impressive achievements. On arrival to Inter-Milan in 1997, Ronaldo became the idol of the local fans who refer to him as \\"il Fenomeno.\\" Since the 98 World Cup he has suffered two serious knee injuries that have severely limited his appearances. Just when people began to wonder whether Ronaldo would be able to continue with his football career, he proved to the world that he still could play. In the World Cup held in Korea and Japan, the magical striker won the Golden Shoe award and tied Pele's Brazilian record for career World Cup goals with 12. He helped Brazil capture its fifth World Cup championship on June 30 with a 2-0 win over Germany. It was the third time that Ronaldo has ever played in the World Cup. We can infer from the passage that Ronaldo _ . A) comes from a rich family B) began to play soccer at 14 C) won a total of 58 goals at 14 D) became a star of Cruzeriro Belo Horizonte in 1992","output":"We can infer from the passage that Ronaldo began to play soccer at 14 (Option B). The text states that \\"at the age of 14, he joined SCristovo soccer club,\\" which marks the beginning of his soccer career. Although the passage mentions that he scored 58 goals in 60 matches while playing for Cruzeiro Belo Horizonte, this does not mean he started playing soccer at that time, as he had already been playing for SCristovo. Additionally, it is worth noting that Ronaldo did not come from a rich family, as the passage states he was born in a poor suburb of Rio de Janeiro (Option A is incorrect). The passage also suggests that he became a star of Cruzeiro Belo Horizonte after joining SCristovo and playing for two years, which implies this happened around 1992 (Option D is correct). However, it is not mentioned that he won a total of 58 goals at 14 (Option C is incorrect), as his incredible goal-scoring record was achieved while playing for Cruzeiro Belo Horizonte, not right when he started his soccer career at the age of 14."},{"instruction":"Countering Krugman, Peter J.

Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Peter J. Wallison's conclusions regarding the financial crisis are not in agreement with this economist's views?","output":"Peter J. Wallison's conclusions regarding the financial crisis are not in agreement with the views of economist Paul Krugman. Krugman is an economist who has supported the idea that large bubbles, such as the U.S. housing bubble, have the potential to cause financial crises when they deflate. Wallison, on the other hand, believes that not every bubble, even a large one, has the potential to cause such a crisis. Instead, he attributes the severity of the U.S. financial crisis to the high number of substandard loans with low or no downpayments. Wallison's argument is based on the observation that other developed countries also experienced large bubbles during the 1997-2007 period but did not suffer losses as severe as those in the United States. He believes that this is evidence that the presence of a bubble alone is not enough to cause a financial crisis. Rather, it is the underlying quality of the loans supporting the bubble that determines the impact of the bubble's collapse on the economy. Krugman, on the other hand, has argued that bubbles can have a destabilizing effect on the economy due to their impact on credit conditions, asset prices, and investment. The burst of a bubble can lead to a sudden drop in demand, which can then cause a sharp decline in economic activity, ultimately leading to a financial crisis. In summary, Peter J. Wallison's conclusions regarding the financial crisis are not in agreement with economist Paul Krugman's views. Wallison contends that bubbles do not necessarily lead to financial crises, and it was the poor quality of loans in the U.S. that led to the 2008 crisis. Conversely, Krugman argues that large bubbles can have a destabilizing effect on the economy and contribute to financial crises."},{"instruction":"Question: Bivalves feed on plankton and nonliving organic matter, and most animals that live on rocky shores eat plankton.

Tracy, played by actress Kate Ford, was responsible for the death of Charlie Stubbs, a character portrayed by Bill Ward. Tracy and Charlie's turbulent and often abusive relationship was the centerpiece of a dramatic plotline in the soap opera. Charlie Stubbs was introduced as a builder working on various projects in the vicinity of the street. He was a charming, tough, and assertive character with a streak of menace beneath the surface. Despite these qualities, Tracy was drawn to him, and their relationship was filled with many highs and lows. The storyline of Charlie's death began to unfold in 2007 when Tracy decided to murder him; this decision took root as Tracy began systematically planning her actions. She came up with a devious plot to appear as a vulnerable woman abused by her violent boyfriend. The plan was to kill Charlie and make it look like an act of self-defense. To reinforce her act, she started telling her friends and family about Charlie's supposedly abusive behavior. However, her claims were often deflected or not taken seriously due to her track record of causing problems and lying. Tracy's opportunity to carry out her diabolical plan came when she convinced Charlie to let her tie him to a bed under the pretext of a kinky sex game. Once he was defenseless, Tracy struck him on the head with a heavy metal sculpture, inflicting a fatal blow. Awaiting for her plan to come to fruition, Tracy then called the police claiming that she had acted in self-defence against her abusive boyfriend. However, Tracy's scheme began to unravel during her trial. Not able to convincingly portray herself as a defenseless victim, she was ultimately found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 15 years. Tracy's killing of Charlie Stubbs is one of \\"Coronation Street's\\" most famous storylines, marking Tracy Barlow as a notorious character and setting the stage for her subsequent dramatic life events on the street."},{"instruction":"Q: Passage: \\"Have n't Met You Yet\\" is the first single from Canadian singer Michael Bublé's fourth album, Crazy Love, released on August 31, 2009.

Question: Why might someone purposefully be going into trance? Options: A. meditation B. nothing C. confused D. epilepsy E. meditate Answer:","output":"Option A. Meditation is the most in line with common sense as to why someone might purposely be going into a trance. Meditation is an ancient practice that has been utilized for thousands of years, across different cultures and traditions. Its primary purpose is to promote relaxation, focus, self-awareness, and create a sense of inner peace and balance. Meditation can be done in various forms, such as mindfulness, concentration meditation, transcendental meditation, or guided meditation, among others. All these methods involve deliberate efforts to focus the mind and enter a state of deep relaxation or contemplation. When one meditates, they often enter a trance-like state, where they are more focused, relaxed, and detached from the external environment and internal mental chatter. Entering such a state intentionally has various benefits, which may include: 1. Reduced stress and anxiety: By focusing on the present moment and promoting relaxation, meditation can help relieve people of stress and anxiety. 2. Improved concentration and focus: Training the mind during meditation can enhance one's ability to concentrate and maintain focus on tasks. 3. Emotional regulation and self-awareness: Meditation enables individuals to better understand their thoughts, emotions, and reactions, making it easier to manage their feelings and respond to situations in a calm and balanced manner. 4. Health benefits: When practiced routinely, meditation has been shown to lower blood pressure, boost immune function, and improve overall wellness. 5. Spiritual growth: For many, meditation is not only a means for relaxation but also a way to connect with their spiritual selves, explore existential questions, or grow closer to a higher power. These are some of the reasons why someone might purposefully enter a trance through practices like meditation. Although options B, C, and D involve different states of mind or situations, they are not in line with common sense as to why someone would intentionally go into a trance.

With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's..., what would be the answer ?

Two men were jailed for a year in 2012 for stealing a sculpture called Sundial (1965) and the bronze plinth of another work, also from the foundation's estate. In October 2013 Standing Figure (1950), one of four Moore pieces in Glenkiln Sculpture Park, estimated to be worth £3 million, was stolen. In 2012, the council of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets announced its plans to sell another version of Draped Seated Woman 1957–58, a 1.6-tonne bronze sculpture. Moore, a well-known socialist, had sold the sculpture at a fraction of its market value to the former London County Council on the understanding that it would be displayed in a public space and might enrich the lives of those living in a socially deprived area. Nicknamed Old Flo, it was installed on the Stifford council estate in 1962 but was vandalised and moved to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1997.

Context: SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program.

Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions. It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out. During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands. It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray. But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore. Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised. In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest. The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank. Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"No, the suggested answer does not accurately address the question about what not to say to someone with an eating disorder. Instead, it provides information about the relationship between ADHD and eating disorders in girls. Here's a more appropriate and detailed answer for the original question: When talking to someone with an eating disorder, it is essential to be empathetic, supportive, and sensitive to their struggles. Avoid making any triggering statements or perpetuating harmful stereotypes or misconceptions. Here are some examples of what not to say to someone with an eating disorder: 1. \\"Just eat more\\" or \\"Just stop eating\\": Eating disorders are complex mental health disorders, and recovery cannot be achieved by simply starting or stopping specific behaviors. Such comments oversimplify the issue and can make the individual feel invalidated. 2. \\"You don't look like you have an eating disorder\\": Eating disorders affect people of all shapes, sizes, and appearances. Making such a statement can be invalidating and dismiss the seriousness of the person's struggles. 3. \\"You'll grow out of it\\" or \\"It's just a phase\\": Eating disorders are not something that someone will naturally \\"grow out of,\\" and such comments can minimize the severity of the condition. 4. Commenting on their appearance or weight: Even if intended as a compliment, any remark about the person's weight or appearance can trigger negative thoughts or feelings related to their eating disorder. 5. \\"I wish I had the willpower to diet like you\\" or \\"I wish I could eat whatever I want and not gain weight\\": These comments might glamorize or trivialize the person's struggles and can be triggering. 6. Comparing your own eating habits or weight concerns: Comparisons are generally unhelpful and can make the individual feel self-conscious or defensive. 7. \\"Can't you see what you're doing to yourself?\\": This might come off as accusatory and can make the person feel guilty, ashamed, or defensive, further eroding their self-esteem and confidence. Instead, focus on expressing understanding, care, and non-judgmental support, avoiding any comments that may inadvertently be hurtful or triggering to the individual.

These platforms allow adolescents to communicate, express themselves, and understand their peers in ways that were not previously possible. However, there has been growing concern regarding the potential negative impact these platforms could have on the mental health of young individuals. The constant exposure to carefully curated social profiles and an endless stream of information can lead to a sense of decreased self-esteem and increased social anxiety. Teens often feel pressured to maintain an attractive online presence, leading to unrealistic expectations and a constant feeling of comparison with others. This can also lead to excessive use of social media, further exacerbating this cycle of comparison and feelings of inadequacy. Moreover, the anonymity provided by social media platforms may embolden people to engage in cyberbullying, which can have serious consequences on a victim's mental health. Young people can be particularly vulnerable to this kind of attack, as their developing sense of identity may be undermined by cruel comments or public shaming. Additionally, the instant gratification provided by likes and comments on social media can lead to a decrease in the ability to focus on long-term goals, affecting not only mental well-being but also academic and career success. Hypothesis: The excessive use of social media has a negative impact on the mental health of teenagers, contributing to increased levels of anxiety, depression, and other psychological issues. To test the hypothesis, one would have to analyze and gather empirical evidence from various sources. These sources may include surveys of adolescents about their social media usage; studies that examine social media use patterns in relation to mental health indicators, such as anxiety or depression symptoms; and research exploring possible mechanisms of how social media consumption is linked to psychological well-being. By examining data from these sources, it would be possible to determine whether there is a significant correlation between the excessive use of social media and mental health issues in teenagers. Furthermore, this information could be used to identify specific aspects of social media that may be particularly detrimental to young people's mental well-being, allowing for more targeted interventions and policies aimed at mitigating these harmful effects."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question. Which country, in 1893, was the first to give women the vote?","output":"In 1893, New Zealand became the first country in the world to grant women the right to vote. This groundbreaking milestone in the history of women's suffrage was the result of years of campaigning by New Zealanders, who were inspired by the broader movement for gender equality and women's rights that was emerging in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The women's suffrage movement in New Zealand was led by Kate Sheppard, a suffragist and social activist who arrived in the country from England in 1869. Sheppard became an influential figure within the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), an organization that advocated for social reform and women's issues, including the rights to vote and control their own property. Following the WCTU's establishment of a franchise department in 1885, Sheppard was appointed the national superintendent of the franchise, a role that allowed her to coordinate the group's efforts and focus on the issue of women's suffrage more closely. Under Sheppard's direction, the WCTU began to mobilize public support for women's suffrage. The organization initiated a series of petitions to the New Zealand Parliament and held public meetings to raise awareness and gather signatures. The first campaign in 1887 garnered over 4,000 signatures, demonstrating the growing public support for the cause. Over the next few years, the number of signatures on subsequent petitions continued to increase, eventually reaching remarkable numbers. In 1893, the final and largest petition was presented to Parliament, boasting a remarkable 31,872 signatures which represented approximately one-quarter of New Zealand's adult female population at the time. Throughout this period, political attitudes within New Zealand were also evolving. John Ballance, who served as the country's Premier from 1891 to 1893, championed the cause of women's suffrage and lent his support to the movement. When Ballance's Liberal Party emerged as the dominant political force in the country, favorable legislation for women's suffrage seemed increasingly likely. In 1893, the women's suffrage bill, known as the Electoral Act, was introduced in the Parliament. The Liberal Party's commitment to the cause along with multiple years of determined and organized campaigning by suffrage supporters led to the bill's successful passage. On September 19, 1893, New Zealand's Governor, Lord Glasgow, signed the bill into law, officially granting women over the age of 21 the right to vote. This historic achievement was celebrated not only in New Zealand but also around the world as a significant step forward in the advancement of women's rights and gender equality. New Zealand's success in granting women the right to vote paved the way for other countries to follow suit, inspiring a global women's suffrage movement that eventually resulted in many other nations enacting similar legislation. For instance, Australia granted women the right to vote in 1902, followed by Finland in 1906, and the United Kingdom in 1918, albeit it was initially only for women over the age of 30 who met certain property requirements. In conclusion, New Zealand was the first country in the world to give women the right to vote in 1893. The women's suffrage movement in the country, led by the likes of Kate Sheppard and supported by politicians such as John Ballance, successfully campaigned for change, culminating in the groundbreaking Electoral Act which laid the foundation for further progress on the road to gender equality."},{"instruction":"Is play used to mean the same thing in the next two sentences (see options)?

Since the slowdown, only one manufacturing company has gone bankrupt, says the city's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, because Toyota spread out orders among many of the more than 400 auto parts factories in the city, to keep them afloat through hard times. Nonetheless, Toyota's downturn has rippled through the city's economy, idling many smaller auto-related suppliers, which also cut payrolls, mainly by refusing to renew the contracts of short-term workers. After losing their jobs, many of the city's 16,400 foreign residents, mostly ethnic Japanese from Brazil and Latin America, packed up and left, residents and city officials said. Hypothesis: Toyota's is the town's market driver.","output":"Based on the provided context, the hypothesis \\"Toyota is the town's market driver\\" can be well-supported and drawn for multiple reasons. 1. Toyota's impact on the auto parts industry: The text mentions that Toyota spread out orders among more than 400 auto parts factories in the city to help keep them afloat during difficult times. This demonstrates a direct influence of Toyota on the economic well-being of many businesses in the city, which supports the idea that Toyota is the market driver in this town. 2. Indirect impact on smaller suppliers: The effects of Toyota's downturn were not limited to the auto parts factories; it also impacted smaller auto-related suppliers that subsequently had to cut payrolls and let go of short-term workers. This ripple effect provides further evidence that Toyota is a major market driver in the city, as its performance has significant consequences for other local businesses. 3. Impact on the foreign community: After job losses due to the slowdown, many of the city's 16,400 foreign residents, mostly ethnic Japanese from Brazil and Latin America, had to leave the city. This exemplifies how Toyota's economic influence extends beyond local businesses and affects the area's demographics, driving people to migrate based on the stability of job opportunities in the town. 4. Nonexistent crime rate: The context states that the city has maintained a nonexistent crime rate. While not directly mentioning Toyota, it can be hypothesized that the company's presence and influence result in numerous jobs and opportunities, which may contribute positively to keeping the crime rate low. 5. Role of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry: The context also mentions the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which highlights Toyota's bankruptcy story as a unique case during the downturn. This suggests that the organization recognizes the company's significant role in the city's economy. Based on these points, it is reasonable to conclude that Toyota is indeed the town's market driver. The company's actions and performance have direct and indirect consequences on the local economy, affecting businesses, workers, and residents. As Toyota's success goes, so does the well-being and stability of the city."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise \\"It will require immense The United States must nurture a democratic Taiwan while discouraging a declaration of independence, must arm Taiwan against Chinese invasion while promoting closer Sino-Taiwanese ties.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Taiwan has been fighting for its democracy since 1990.\\" is true?","output":"To determine the validity of the hypothesis \\"Taiwan has been fighting for its democracy since 1990\\" based on the given premise, let's take the following steps: Step 1: Determine the main components of the premise. The premise involves at least three key components: 1. The United States nurturing a democratic Taiwan. 2. Discouraging Taiwan's declaration of independence. 3. Arming Taiwan against Chinese invasion and encouraging closer Sino-Taiwanese ties. Step 2: Examine the historical context. Taiwan has undergone significant political changes since the end of Martial Law in 1987, which implies that Taiwan's fight for democracy began sometime before 1990. Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise mentions the United States' role in supporting Taiwan's democracy, which suggests that Taiwan has indeed been fighting for democracy. Step 4: Determine if there is enough evidence to conclude the hypothesis. The given premise implies that Taiwan has been fighting for its democracy. However, it does not directly mention the specific timeframe (since 1990) stated in the hypothesis. While Taiwan started its democratization process after 1987, it is possible that the statement might hold true for the post-1990 period. Nevertheless, the premise insufficiently supports the claim that Taiwan has been fighting for democracy since 1990. In conclusion, the analysis of the premise suggests a connection between Taiwan’s fight for democracy and the international support it receives, but it does not provide enough evidence to definitively conclude that the hypothesis \\"Taiwan has been fighting for its democracy since 1990\\" is true. Further research and historical context would be required to provide stronger evidence supporting this claim."},{"instruction":"Question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

He was a career soldier who spent much of his military career in India, where he rose to become Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army by early 1941. In July 1941 he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East theatre, but after initial successes the war in North Africa turned against the British, and he was relieved of the post in 1942 during the crucial Alamein campaign. In June 1943 he was once more appointed Commander-in-Chief, India, where his support through the organisation of supply, maintenance and training for Slim's Fourteenth Army played an important role in its success. Auchinleck continued as Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army after the end of the war helping, though much against his own convictions, to prepare the future Indian and Pakistani armies for the Partition of India: in November 1945 he was forced to commute the more serious judicial sentences awarded against officers of the Indian National Army in face of growing unease and unrest both within the Indian population, and the British Indian Army. On 1 June 1946 he was promoted to field marshal, but he refused to accept a peerage, lest he be thought associated with a policy (i.e. Partition) that he thought fundamentally dishonourable. Sending a report to British Government on 28 September 1947 Auchinleck wrote: \\"I have no hesitation, whatever, in affirming that the present Indian Cabinet are implacably determined to do all in their power to prevent the establishment of the Dominion of Pakistan on firm basis.\\" He stated in the second, political part of his assessment, \\"Since 15th August, the situation has steadily deteriorated and the Indian leaders, cabinet ministers, civil officials and others have persistently tried to obstruct the work of partition of the armed forces.\\" When partition was effected in August 1947, Auchinleck was appointed Supreme Commander of all British forces remaining in India and Pakistan and remained in this role until the winding up and closure of the Supreme H.Q. at the end of November 1948. This marked his effective retirement from the army (although technically field marshals in the British Army never retire, remaining on the active list on half pay). He left India on 1 December. After a brief period in Italy in connection with an unsuccessful business project, Auchinleck retired to London, where he occupied himself with a number of charitable and business interests and became a respectably skilled watercolour painter. In 1960 he settled in Beccles in the county of Suffolk, remaining there for seven years until, at the age of eighty-four, he decided to emigrate and set up home in Marrakesh, where he died on 23 March 1981.

Context: Luckily I was not the target or victim of this road rage, but I was a first hand witness. Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction.

His father, Vivian Davies (1925-2015), and his mother, Barbara (1929-1999), were teachers. Davies was the youngest of three children and their only son. Because he was born by C-section, his mother was placed on a morphine drip and was institutionalised after an overdose resulted in a psychotic episode. Davies' next project was The Grand, a period soap drama set in a Manchester hotel during the interwar period. It was designed to be a valuable show in a ratings war with the BBC and was scheduled at 9 pm on a Friday night. After the original writer abandoned the series, Granada approached him to write the entire show. His scripts for the first series reflect the pessimism of the period; each episode added its own emotional trauma on the staff, including a soldier's execution for desertion, a destitute maid who threatens to illegally abort her unborn child to survive, and a multi-episode storyline centred on the chambermaid, Monica Jones (Jane Danson), who kills her rapist in self-defence, is arrested, and eventually hanged for murder. The show was renewed for a second series despite the first's dark tone. The second series had a lighter tone and greater emphasis on character development, which Davies attributed to his friend Sally, who had previously warned him of the adult humour in Breakfast Serials; she told him that his show was too bleak to be compared to real life. He highlighted the sixth and eighth episodes of the second series as a time of maturity as a writer: for the sixth, he utilised then-unconventional narrative devices such as flashbacks to explore the hotel barman's closeted homosexuality and the societal attitudes towards sexuality in the 1920s; and he highlighted the eighth as when he allowed the series to \\"take on its own life\\" by deliberately inserting plot devices such as McGuffins to enhance the comic relief of the series. Although well received, the series' ratings were not high enough to warrant a third series. After its cancellation in September 1997, Davies had an existential crisis after almost dying from an accidental overdose; the experience persuaded him to detoxify and make a name for himself by producing a series that celebrated his homosexuality. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: what is the grand?","output":"The Grand is a period soap drama set in a Manchester hotel during the interwar period. It was created by Stephen Russell Davies and was designed to be a valuable show in a ratings war with the BBC, scheduled to air at 9 pm on Friday nights. The series followed the tumultuous lives and emotional traumas of the hotel staff, touching on various social issues prevalent during that time period."},{"instruction":"\\"have returned from the beyond to warn you \\" How would the sentiment of this sentence be perceived?","output":"To determine the sentiment of the sentence \\"have returned from the beyond to warn you,\\" I would follow these steps: 1. Analyze the keywords or phrases in the sentence: The main keywords/phrases to consider are \\"returned from the beyond\\" and \\"warn you.\\" 2. Evaluate the tone of the keywords/phrases: \\"Returned from the beyond\\" has an eerie, supernatural connotation, whereas \\"warn you\\" has an urgent and cautionary tone. 3. Determine the mood or sentiment of the entire sentence based on the keywords/phrases: Combining the eerie tone of \\"returned from the beyond\\" with the sense of urgency and caution in \\"warn you,\\" the overall sentiment of the sentence can be perceived as mysterious and somewhat negative. 4. Justify the determined sentiment: The mysterious and somewhat negative sentiment is a suitable interpretation since the sentence combines supernatural elements with a warning, potentially evoking feelings of unease or concern in the reader or listener."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Alexander is heating up water in his kitchen because he is preparing to make pasta. He has split the water into two containers, container A and container B. Container A has been heating up for a long amount time, while container B has only been heating up for a short amount of time. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which container has particles with lower average kinetic energy? Hint: As a liquid is heated, the average kinetic energy of its particles increases. The rate of evaporation increases as more and more molecules are able to escape the liquid’s surface into the vapor phase. Eventually a point is reached when the molecules all throughout the liquid have enough kinetic energy to vaporize . At this point the liquid begins to boil. The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the external pressure. The Figure below illustrates the boiling of liquid. A:","output":"Container B has particles with lower average kinetic energy compared to container A. This is because, based on the given information, container A has been heating up for a longer period of time than container B. Heating up a substance leads to increased kinetic energy in its particles, as mentioned in the hint that the average kinetic energy of its particles increases as the substance is heated. Given that container A has been exposed to heat for a longer duration, it stands to reason that its particles will have attained a higher average kinetic energy than those in container B, which has been heated for a shorter duration. Therefore, container B, having been heated less, contains water particles with a lower average kinetic energy."},{"instruction":"Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Dora for the following movie plot: In a newspaper advertisement, taxi driver Tarek Fahd discovers an invitation to participate in an experiment. 4000 German marks are offered to the participants of the experiment, in which a prison situation is simulated. The experiment is led by Professor Klaus Thon and his assistant, Dr. Jutta Grimm.Tarek participates as a journalist while wearing a pair of glasses with a built-in mini-camera. Tarek has a car accident shortly before the experiment, after which he meets a woman called Dora. She spends the night with him and Tarek keeps thinking of her, shown in flashbacks. The 20 volunteers are pronounced guards and prisoners and are being observed by a team of scientists. The prisoners lose their civil rights and have to obey arbitrary rules, such as completely eating their meals. The guards are given nightsticks but are told not to use violence in any case. Each prisoners name is taken away and replaced by a number. Tarek (prisoner nr. 77) initially refuses to acknowledge the guards' superiority by drinking the milk of one of his co-prisoners because of that prisoner's lactose intolerance or by throwing his blanket out of his cell to provoke the guards. He befriends his cellmates, Steinhoff and Schütte. Psychological changes develop and the situation deteriorates. The circumstances seem to be escalating after a few days. It becomes clear that limits are not only being reached but being surpassed.The guards become excessively aware of their power and use the prisoners' fear to make them obedient. On both sides, one person is considered dominant. On the prisoners' side, this is Tarek, and aon the guards side, it is the quiet guard Berus, a sadist, whose motto during the experiment is: \\"Humiliation is the only way we can solve these troubles.\\" From that moment, the guards start to use more and more violence against the prisoners.

His job title is the “Chief” of the Met Police, which means he is the boss and makes decisions to keep everyone safe. He has been the boss for six years. Before him, there were two other bosses in the past six years, but they were not able to stay as the leader for a long time.

Presley's physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged. \\"He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful\\", in the words of critic Mark Feeney. Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the '68 Comeback Special, reported, \\"I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence.\\" His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described him as \\"the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl\\". In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as \\"the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America\\". Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some cultural critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, Sight and Sound's Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as \\"aggressively bisexual in appeal\\".

This might seem counterintuitive at first, but there are several reasons why this pairing can be highly effective in supporting Aaron's growth and development within the program. Firstly, Steven's more recent experience of undergoing the initial stages of detox can make him an empathetic and relatable mentor for Aaron. Steven can share his personal experiences, challenges, and insights more effectively since they are still fresh in his mind. This helps to bridge the gap between mentor and mentee, as Aaron can see himself in Steven's shoes and recognize the path to recovery is achievable. Secondly, Steven's shorter tenure in the program demonstrates that progress and growth is possible in a relatively short period of time. This can be inspiring and motivating for Aaron, who may be feeling overwhelmed or unsure about his ability to succeed in recovery. By witnessing Steven's progress firsthand, Aaron can gain confidence in his own capabilities and develop a growth mindset. Thirdly, mentoring Aaron provides an opportunity for Steven to further solidify his understanding of the program's principles and practices. By guiding Aaron through the process, Steven can reinforce and reiterate the skills and strategies he has learned in the program, which in turn strengthens his own recovery journey. Fourthly, considering Steven has been in the program for a shorter time, he may also have a better understanding of Aaron's hesitations and confusions than someone who has been in the program for a significantly longer time. This allows Steven to address Aaron's concerns more effectively and provide tailored advice and solutions to help him overcome the initial challenges of detoxification. Lastly, assigning a mentor who has been in the program for a shorter period, like Steven, fosters a sense of community and camaraderie among program participants. This helps to break down the hierarchical barriers that can sometimes exist between newcomers and longer-term attendees. It also encourages collaboration and peer support, both of which are crucial components in creating a successful and sustainable recovery environment. In conclusion, although Steven has been in the program for a shorter period of time than Aaron, this unique dynamic fosters empathy, inspiration, knowledge reinforcement, tailored support, and camaraderie that can be highly effective in helping Aaron navigate the challenges of detox and ultimately progress in his journey toward recovery."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

With the Han Dynasty lacquered chopsticks came, followed by gold and silver chopsticks still later. Today we have chopsticks made of plastics. The most expensive are made of part of tusks of elephants and hard green stone. Chopsticks tell Chinese tradition in their way. In ancient times the rich used hard green stone or gold chop-sticks to show their wealth . In history many kings used silver chopsticks to take their food to see if it was poisonous . It was said that if it was, the silver chopsticks would turn colour.

For a sentence to be considered acceptable, it should adhere to the syntactical and grammatical rules of the language and convey a clear meaning to the reader or listener. Taking a closer look at this sentence, we can see that it fulfills these criteria: 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the arrangement of words and phrases in a sentence to create a well-formed and coherent structure. In this sentence, the syntax is logically arranged and easy to understand: subject (\\"we\\"), verb (\\"made\\"), object (\\"enough pudding\\"), and additional information related to time (\\"to last for days\\"). Subject: \\"We\\" -- This is the pronoun referring to the speaker and other individuals involved in the action. Verb: \\"made\\" -- This is the past tense of the verb \\"to make,\\" indicating that the action has already been carried out. Object: \\"enough pudding\\" -- This phrase specifies what was made—the quantity of pudding is described as being sufficient. Additional Information: \\"to last for days\\" -- This part of the sentence provides more context about the amount of pudding made, emphasizing that it was enough to cover several days. 2. Grammar: Grammar encompasses the rules pertaining to the structure and formation of sentences within a language. This sentence follows standard English grammar rules: - The subject and verb agree in number (both are singular). - The verb tense is consistent (past tense is used throughout). - The word \\"enough\\" is used appropriately as an adverb to quantify \\"pudding,\\" highlighting its sufficiency. - The prepositional phrase \\"to last for days\\" is used correctly to provide additional information about the amount of pudding. 3.

Usain tried to convince his brother, Asafa, to take up running as well. Asafa didn't really like running, though, so he hardly ran much at all. Who will increase the strength of their cardiac muscles more? Answer:","output":"In this scenario, it is Usain who will increase the strength of his cardiac muscles more due to his decision to transition from competitive swimming to running very frequently. There are several reasons behind this conclusion. Firstly, the physical benefits of running are well-documented, particularly pertaining to the cardiovascular system. Running is an aerobic exercise that requires the heart to work harder, pushing blood and oxygen throughout the body to meet the increased demand for energy. Over time, the heart adapts and becomes stronger, resulting in improved cardiovascular fitness. Cardiac muscles are a key component of this process as they are responsible for pumping blood throughout the body; hence, the more consistently and intensely you exercise, the stronger these muscles will become. In Usain's case, he was already a competitive swimmer before deciding to start running very frequently. Swimming is also an excellent cardiovascular workout, which means that his heart was already trained to supply oxygen throughout his body more efficiently. As Usain switches to running, his cardiac muscles are set to benefit further from the increased frequency of cardiovascular workouts. On the other hand, Asafa, who is not fond of running, will not experience the same extent of cardiovascular benefits. For one, he hardly engages in running activities, meaning his heart does not undergo the same level of training as Usain's. Consequently, Asafa's cardiac muscles are not likely to grow or strengthen as much as Usain's. This discrepancy is critical to the overall strength and conditioning of the heart. It is important to note that the individual's genetic makeup, overall health, and commitment to a regular workout routine can also influence the development of cardiac muscles. Nonetheless, with the information provided, it is reasonable to assert that Usain will experience a more significant increase in the strength of his cardiac muscles due to his consistent and regular running regimen."},{"instruction":"Ich bin mir sicher, dass wir schon heute den ersten wichtigen Schritt in Richtung europäischer Lösung sehen werden, mit oder ohne Internationalem Währungsfonds.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. Problem:jump after jump right thrice Solution:","output":"Part #1: Identifying and understanding the sequences in the command. Usage: The command \\"jump after jump right thrice\\" contains two sequences - \\"jump right thrice\\" and \\"jump\\". The word \\"after\\" indicates that the \\"jump\\" action must be performed following the \\"jump right thrice\\" sequence. So the proper order is \\"jump right thrice\\" and then \\"jump\\". Part #2: Identifying the repetition in the command. Usage: In the sequence \\"jump right thrice\\", the word \\"thrice\\" signifies that the \\"jump right\\" action must be repeated three times. So it is transformed into \\"jump right, jump right, jump right\\". Part #3: Translating the natural language command into actions. Usage: Having processed the repetitions, we must now convert the command into individual actions. The command now is \\"jump right, jump right, jump right, jump\\". This translates to the actions: I_JUMP, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_JUMP.

The negative sentiment extends to the comparison with other movies and genres, as well as the disappointment in the actors' performances. The reviewer clearly expected more from the thriller genre and was left underwhelmed by the French cinema's attempt to make an engaging and suspenseful film.

All I know is ... we made a record, everybody was happy with it. A few weeks later I hear that it's unreleasable and it's all got to be redone\\". While Albini's remarks in the article drew no immediate reply from the group or its label, Newsweek ran a similar article soon afterwards that did. Nirvana denied there was any pressure from its label to change the album's sound, sending a letter to Newsweek that said that the article's author \\"ridiculed our relationship with our label based on totally erronous [sic] information\\"; the band also reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in Billboard. Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder David Geffen made the unusual move of personally calling Newsweek to complain about the article.Nirvana wanted to do further work on the recorded tracks, and considered working with producer Scott Litt and remixing some tracks with Andy Wallace (who had mixed Nevermind). Albini vehemently disagreed, and claimed he had an agreement with the band that it would not modify the tracks without his involvement. Albini initially refused to give the album master tapes to Gold Mountain, but relented after a phone call from Novoselic. The band decided against working with Wallace and chose to remix and augment the songs \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" and \\"All Apologies\\" with Litt at Seattle's Bad Animals Studio in May 1993. Furthermore, a remix of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" by Scott Litt (at Bad Animals on November 22, 1993) appears on the censored Wal-Mart and Kmart versions of In Utero; this remix is also available on the band's 2002 best-of compilation, Nirvana, and is the same mix that appeared on the single.... answer the following question: What is the name of the album whose sound Nirvana denied there being any pressure from its label to change?

It is familiar to millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the Last Night of the Proms, where it is traditionally performed. When the theme of the slower middle section (technically called the \\"trio\\") of the first march came into his head, he told his friend Dora Penny, \\"I've got a tune that will knock 'em – will knock 'em flat\\". When the first march was played in 1901 at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by Henry J. Wood, who later wrote that the audience \\"rose and yelled ... the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore.\\" To mark the coronation of Edward VII, Elgar was commissioned to set A. C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House in June 1901. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song. It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem. In the United States, the trio, known simply as \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" or \\"The Graduation March\\", has been adopted since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.In March 1904 a three-day festival of Elgar's works was presented at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer. The Times commented, \\"Four or five years ago if any one had predicted that the Opera-house would be full from floor to ceiling for the performance of an oratorio by an English composer he would probably have been supposed to be out of his..., can you guess it ?

If more coal seams are discovered, it could result in an increased demand for coal extraction and processing, which might require more workers in coal mining and transportation. However, coal-fired power plants may still lay off workers if automation and technological advancements reduce the labor needed for certain tasks in the coal power generation process. On the other hand, new job opportunities might be created in other areas of the coal industry due to the discovery of more seams.

However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue. Two friends went to the doctor because they weren't feeling well. As it turns out Danny had a condition called hypercalcaemia, while Greg had hypocalcaemia. Which friend hadn't taken enough calcium? Answer:","output":"Greg is the friend who hadn't taken enough calcium. He has hypocalcaemia, which is a condition characterized by low levels of calcium in the blood. This can be caused by inadequate calcium or vitamin D intake, among other factors.

Avicenna believed his \\"Floating Man\\" thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance, and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness, even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input. The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air, isolated from all sensations, which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argued that, in this scenario, one would still have self-consciousness. Because it is conceivable that a person, suspended in air while cut off from sense experience, would still be capable of determining his own existence, the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection, independent of the body, and an immaterial substance. The conceivability of this \\"Floating Man\\" indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually, which entails the soul's separateness from the body. Avicenna referred to the living human intelligence, particularly the active intellect, which he believed to be the hypostasis by which God communicates truth to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature.

Turn the knob to the desired temperature, likely in the 375 to 400 range by turning the knob with your hand.;","output":"Option B makes more sense to accomplish the goal of prepping the oven to bake pizza. Here's the step-by-step process and justification: 1. Check the pizza recipe or instructions: Before preheating the oven, it is crucial to know the recommended temperature to bake the pizza. This will ensure optimal cooking. 2. Turn the oven knob: Option B specifically refers to turning the knob for temperature adjustment. The clock dial mentioned in Option A is not relevant to setting the oven temperature, as it serves a different purpose (usually to set a timer or adjust the clock time). 3. Set the desired temperature: Based on the pizza recipe or instructions, turn the oven knob to the recommended temperature, which is likely to be in the range of 375 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. This ensures that the oven temperature is appropriate for baking the pizza. 4. Allow the oven to preheat: Give the oven enough time to reach the target temperature before placing the pizza inside. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes, depending on the oven. Preheating ensures even cooking and helps the pizza crust become crispy on the outside while staying tender on the inside. 5. Prepare the pizza for baking: While the oven is preheating, use this time to prepare the pizza by adding toppings and ensuring it is ready for baking. 6. Once the oven has reached the desired temperature, place the pizza inside and start the baking process.

Rub the wax across the board from the back to the top and a small amount of the edges of the board. Take a handful of dry sand and rub it over the wax to help smooth it out. Apply sand to the board until it no longer sticks on the wax. Slide the board back and forth in the sand, bottom down, so the board glides easily in the sand. Do not use wet sand on the board, as this can cause your board to stick to the sand as you ride. Make sure you are facing in the direction you are heading down the dune. Keep your arms and legs tucked into the center of the board. You will need to use a sandboard with no bindings to be able to lie down on your belly comfortably. Sit down and strap your feet into the bindings. Make sure your dominant foot is in front of the board, pointing in the direction you are heading down the dune. You should be able to rock back on your heels when you are strapped into the bindings. Look for a dune with dry sand that has a 4 to 5 m (13 to 16 ft) slope. Make sure there are no shrubs, sticks, shells, or obstructions around the dune or at the bottom of the dune. If you are standing on the board, keep your weight centered and your knees slightly bent. Shift your weight forward and keep your hips and shoulders stacked on top of each other. Turn your head in the direction you are heading and keep your arms relaxed at your sides. If you are lying on your belly, keep your body in the center of the board, with your legs tucked in and your chin up. If you are standing, tip your weight slightly forward and slide the board until it moves down the dune. If you are lying on your belly, use your hands to push yourself off the dune. If you are standing, allow the board to pick up speed as you ride down the dune, keeping your back leg strong and your weight in the center of the board. If you are lying on your belly, keep your arms and legs tucked in and your chin up as you slide down the dune. Avoid leaning forward or shifting your weight too far forward as you ride. Stretch your hands out to help you balance as you ride. You should slow down as you reach the bottom of the dune and come to a gradual stop. There are usually no lifts to carry you back up to the dunes so you will have to run back up the dune on your own. Do another run on the same hill to get the hang of sandboarding. Then, challenge yourself to do a bigger dune or a dune with a bigger slope. You may need to wax your board again between runs to keep it smooth and help it to slide on the sand.","output":"The article provides instructions on how to properly sandboard, emphasizing the importance of using appropriate equipment and techniques for a safe and enjoyable experience. Firstly, it advises applying a small amount of sandboard wax on the bottom of the board and using dry sand to ensure smooth gliding. Wet sand should be avoided since it can cause the board to stick. To prepare for sandboarding, one should choose a dune with a 4 to 5 meters slope and ensure the absence of any obstructions. Depending on the rider's preference, they can either stand or lie down on the sandboard. For standing, the rider must strap their feet into the bindings and keep their dominant foot in front. Maintaining balance involves keeping the knees slightly bent and the weight centered while shifting forward. If choosing to lie down on the belly, a sandboard without bindings is required for comfort. The body should be centered on the board with legs tucked in and chin up. In both positions, it's crucial to maintain proper body alignment and avoid leaning forward too much. To start sandboarding, standing riders can tip their weight forward and allow the board to move down the dune, while those lying down can use their hands to push off. As riders progress down the dune, they must keep their arms and legs appropriately positioned, and use their hands for balance. As they approach the dune's bottom, they should slow down, coming to a gradual stop. Since there are usually no lifts at sandboarding locations, riders will need to ascend the dune manually. It's recommended to repeat runs on the same hill before attempting more significant or steeper dunes. Waxing the board between runs may be necessary to maintain smooth gliding."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - Alexandros Othonaios ( Greek : , Gytheio , 1879 - Athens , 20 September 1970 ) was a distinguished Greek general , who became briefly Prime Minister of Greece , heading an emergency government during an abortive coup in 1933 . - Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication. Recorded history can be contrasted with other narratives of the past, such as mythological, oral or archeological traditions. - Aristotle (\\"Aristotéls\\"; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. - The Prime Minister of the Hellenic Republic (\\"Prothypourgós tis Ellinikís Dimokratías\\"), colloquially referred to as the Prime Minister of Greece (\\"Prothypourgós tis Elládas\\"), is the head of government of the Hellenic Republic and the leader of the Greek cabinet. The incumbent prime minister is Alexis Tsipras, who took office on 21 September 2015. - Alexis Tsipras (; born 28 July 1974) is the 185th and current Prime Minister of Greece, having been sworn in on 21 September 2015. He previously served as the 183rd Prime Minister of Greece from 26 January 2015 to 27 August 2015. Tsipras has been leader of the left-wing Greek political party Syriza since 4 October 2009. - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece. - East Mani (- \\"Anatolikí Máni\\") is a municipality in Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece. Its seat of administration is the town Gytheio (before 2011 the small town Kotronas). The municipality is located in the eastern part of the Mani Peninsula. It is a mountainous and rocky area. Its economy relies on fishing, olive oil and tourism. - Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. - The city of Athens during the classical period of Ancient Greece (508322 BC) was the major urban center of the notable polis (city-state) of the same name, located in Attica, Greece, leading the Delian League in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League. Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC (aftermath of Lamian War). The peak of Athenian hegemony was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC, known as the Age of Pericles. - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country. - A metropolis is a large city or conurbation which is a significant economic, political, and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections, commerce, and communications. The term is Greek and means the \\"mother city\\" of a colony (in the ancient sense), that is, the city which sent out settlers. This was later generalized to a city regarded as a center of a specified activity, or any large, important city in a nation. - Piraeus (\\"Pireás\\" , , \\"Peiraieús\\") is a port city in the region of Attica, Greece. Piraeus is located within the Athens urban area, southwest from its city center (municipality of Athens), and lies along the east coast of the Saronic Gulf. - Gytheio, the ancient Gythium or Gytheion, is a town and a former municipality in Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality East Mani, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 197.313 km. It was the seaport of Sparta, some north. Gytheio used to be an important port until it was destroyed in 4th century AD, possibly by an earthquake. Today it is the largest and most important town in Mani. It is also the seat of the municipality of East Mani. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)?

(November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) An older man and his dog are out hunting, when they discover a serving tray on a stand in the middle of a frozen lake. He notices the words \\"Come and See\\" painted on several trees as he lifts the lid. Detective Aidan Breslin is a widower who has become emotionally distanced from his two sons, Alex and Sean, following the death of his wife three years prior to the film's events. Due to his former dental forensics expertise, Aidan receives a call regarding the contents of the tray, where it is revealed that it contained human teeth. After analyzing the teeth, Breslin is able to match them to a man who had been reported missing. Aidan is once again called to investigate the bizarre murder of a woman named Mrs. Spitz, who was discovered hanging in her bedroom, eerily displayed and strung up on a series of hooks connected to a rig; the words \\"Come and See\\" displayed prominently on the walls. According to her autopsy report, she drowned in her own blood due to a precise stabbing. They also discover that Mrs. Spitz had been pregnant and the fetus was removed. Aidan speculates that there were four attackers and that they had used a camera to record the murder. After leaving the crime-scene, Breslin comforts one of the Spitz's three daughters, their adopted Asian daughter Kristen, reassuring her that he will do his best to solve the crime. The next murder shares the same M.O. with the Spitz murder; the similar hook contraption leads Breslin to a local tattoo parlor. There, he is informed that the owner constructed four devices in total. Yet another murder occurs, but this time no hook rig was involved and the message only appears on three of the room's walls. While Aidan reviews the evidence at his home, Sean stumbles on one of the photographs. Sean's insights point Breslin to the Bible, where he...

Who was he?","output":"The winner of the second Formula One World Championship in 1951, who also went on to win the title in 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957, was the legendary Argentine racing driver Juan Manuel Fangio. He held the record of five World Championship titles until 2003, when it was broken by another legendary driver, Michael Schumacher. Born on June 24, 1911, in Balcarce, Argentina, Juan Manuel Fangio began his career in motorsports in the late 1930s. He debuted in the European racing scene in 1948, and by 1950, when the first Formula One World Championship was established, Fangio had already gained considerable experience and was known for his outstanding skills and talent behind the wheel. In the 1950 Championship, Fangio drove for the Alfa Romeo team, and despite a strong performance throughout the season, he finished 2nd overall. In 1951, Juan Manuel Fangio claimed his first World Championship title, still driving for the Alfa Romeo team. He continued his dominance on the racetrack and won the title again in 1954 with the Mercedes-Benz team, having missed most of the 1952 and 1953 seasons due to injury. From 1954 onwards, Fangio was practically unstoppable. He proceeded to win the next three championships with three different teams: Mercedes-Benz in 1955, Ferrari in 1956, and Maserati in 1957. These incredible accomplishments not only solidified his position as the top driver of his era but also set a new standard for Formula One excellence. Throughout his Formula One career, Fangio competed in 51 Grand Prix races, securing 24 wins and 35 podium finishes, making him one of the most successful drivers in the history of the sport. His unique combination of driving intelligence, raw speed, and an unmatched ability to read a race situation allowed him to maintain his dominance throughout much of the 1950s. Fangio retired from racing in 1958, but his legacy would live on, influencing future generations of drivers and motorsport enthusiasts. His record of five World Championship titles remained unbeaten for nearly half a century, testament to his extraordinary talent and incredible contributions to the sport. It was only in 2003, more than four decades after Fangio's last title, that German driver Michael Schumacher broke his record by securing his sixth World Championship driving for Scuderia Ferrari. Schumacher would go on to win a total of seven titles in his career, surpassing Fangio's impressive five-title milestone. Nonetheless, Juan Manuel Fangio's incredible achievements, supreme driving skills, and immense contributions to the world of motorsports remain an essential part of Formula One history, and he is often considered one of the greatest drivers of all time."},{"instruction":"Q:Title: Coolio! its a gotta get Product review: This game is out of this world.

I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” The author's blood was not drained after the first five days in the hospital for how long?

However, after my experience at \\"Insert Restaurant Name,\\" I feel compelled to share my deep disappointment and discomfort. To kick things off, upon entering the establishment, we were met with an unwelcoming atmosphere that set the tone for the rest of the evening. The lighting was far too dim, and the musty odor inside was quite off-putting. Both my partner and I found it hard to believe the positive reviews that had brought us here in the first place. The seating arrangements were cramped, with tables packed so tightly together that we could hardly have a private conversation. Unsurprisingly, this overcrowding made it difficult for the servers to navigate, causing a domino effect of prolonged waiting times and frustration. We ended up waiting for 30 minutes just to get our menus, and another half hour before our drink orders were taken. Speaking of the service, it fell well below the standard that one would expect from any reputable establishment. Our server seemed overwhelmed and agitated, barely making eye contact as they scribbled down our orders. We couldn't entirely blame them because the understaffing was evident, yet one expects businesses to manage their staffing levels appropriately. This failure to do so severely impacted our experience. The menu appeared promising at first glance, featuring a seemingly diverse range of dishes from various cuisines. However, little did we know quite how misguided our optimism was. Not only did our food take an excruciatingly long time to arrive, but once it finally graced our table, it was severely lacking in both presentation and quality. My partner ordered the grilled salmon, which looked like it had seen better days. It was overcooked and smothered in a sauce that tasted more like a mishmash of spices, rather than the delicate lemon butter we anticipated. I opted for the pasta primavera, hoping for a tasty, comforting dish. However, what arrived was a soggy, bland mess swimming in oil, leaving me questioning the culinary skills of the chef. As if our experience weren't bad enough, we also noticed signs of poor hygiene throughout the restaurant. At one point, I spotted a server handling both food and dirty dishes without washing their hands. We also encountered a noticeable amount of dust on our table's edge - a clear sign that cleanliness was not a top priority. When we finally mustered the courage to request our bill, we were shocked to see that the prices were exceptionally steep for the shoddy quality of food and service we had experienced. As we left, feeling both disappointed and lighter in our wallets, we vowed never to set foot in \\"Insert Restaurant Name\\" again.

Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Blyton knew Chase for a long time.\\"?","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is reasonable to conclude that Enid Blyton and Phyllis Chase knew each other for a long time. The paragraph states that Phyllis Chase was Blyton's childhood friend, which implies that their relationship began during their early years and most likely continued as they grew older. As both individuals collaborated on \\"Child Whispers\\", it is evident that they maintained a strong working relationship as well. Furthermore, the fact that Enid Blyton chose Phyllis Chase to illustrate her first published work indicates that Blyton trusted Chase's artistic abilities and the two had a strong enough bond for Blyton to involve her friend in such a milestone moment in her career. This collaboration likely served as a stepping stone for the author and the illustrator as they went on to create other masterpieces. Considering the fact that long-lasting friendships often develop from childhood, it is plausible to conclude that Blyton and Chase knew each other for a significant duration. It is important to note that \\"Child Whispers\\" was published in 1922, which can be used as a rough marker to deduce the longevity of their friendship. Assuming that both Blyton and Chase were born in the late 19th or early 20th century, their friendship could have spanned several decades by the time \\"Child Whispers\\" was published. In conclusion, the evidence provided in the given paragraph supports the statement that Blyton knew Chase for a long time, both as a childhood friend and a professional collaborator.

The heartwarming love story of singing nun meets handsome captain, told through a host of chirpy, addictive songs has both an enthusiastic fan following and widespread family appeal. But what is it that the fans love so much? Musical theatre superfan Keith Milward, from Swansea, says it's that tale of romance that got him hook, line and sinker. \\"It's such a great story. It has just got everything you want and even across the generations people have always responded to the loveliness of it.\\" The seemingly innocent and wholesome plotline sees young nun Maria sent out of her convent to be the governess of the seven cute von Trapp children. A few Do-Re-Mis later and Maria and the children's navy captain father, played by Christopher Plummer, have fallen in love. But then they have to flee the Nazis during the annexation of Austria. So far, so gloriously far-fetched, you might think. But actually the story was based on the memoir of the real-life Maria von Trapp. Published in 1949, the book was later turned into a stage musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein before the film came along in 1965. You would think even the hardest of souls would be softened by such a hefty dose of syrupy sentimentality but reviews at the time were lukewarm. Critics were keen to point out the historical inaccuracies of the film, claiming it glossed over Austria's role in World War Two. One eminent critic, Pauline Kael, condemned it as a \\"sugar-coated lie that people seem to want to eat\\". Source: IMDB / Official Charts But current film critic Richard Fitzwilliam says audiences completely disagreed. \\"There was just something so romantic about it. Musical films were really taking off and people liked seeing them on the wide-screen. It was completely different to the swords and sandals epics that were also popular at the time but it was just pure escapism. It was also perfect for families to watch together. \\"Some said it was too schmaltzy and sentimental but it was hugely successful.\\" So while the film might score few points for factual accuracy, it's not the nuances of the plotline that has kept fans entertained for over five decades. It's the songs. The Sound of Music soundtrack album was the UK's best-selling LP, not just in 1965, but in 1966 and 1968. \\"They are just so infuriatingly hummable,\\" Richard Fitzwilliam says. \\"Just talking about the film, I can hear the songs like the Lonely Goatherd, Sixteen Going on Seventeen and I'm tapping along and mumbling the lyrics.\\" \\"It's like a test,\\" Keith Milward says. \\"You can say to anyone in the street 'Do a deer, a female deer' and they'd know the tune and respond with the next line. \\"Even the most cynical will be swayed once they hear the music. I saw a touring production of it at the Swansea Grand just a couple of weeks ago and everyone was singing along. \\"The BBC even said that, should the end of the world be on its way, they would play the Sound of Music, so they must have thought it would brighten even the darkest of days.\\" And it seems that might be true... to some extent. It is believed that, at the height of Cold War paranoia, the film was selected by TV executives to be broadcast as part of a series of recorded programming in the event of a nuclear strike. In 2006, the master of the musicals, Lord Lloyd-Webber, brought the story right back into the popularity stakes with a TV contest to find an undiscovered performer to play Maria in a new West End production. Meanwhile, a sing-a-long version of the film still attracts hundreds of people every month. At the Prince Charles Cinema in London, fans turn up dressed as nuns and von Trapp children ready to sing their hearts out. Many fans hope the original film won't be subjected to a Hollywood remake. \\"It shouldn't be touched,\\" Fitzwilliam says. \\"There are so many enduring memories that come with it and the original is still so good.\\" So good indeed that last year to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the cult classic, Lady Gaga took to the stage at the Oscar's to belt out a Sound of Music medley. For those still not convinced, you may be pleased to hear that actor Christopher Plummer was for many years unimpressed by the film that he became well-known for, famously referring to it as the \\"Sound of Mucus\\". But despite his misgivings, even he can understand its enduring appeal. Last year he told Vanity Fair magazine: \\"As cynical as I always was about The Sound of Music, I do respect that it is a bit of relief from all the gunfire and car chases you see these days. \\"It's sort of wonderfully, old-fashionedly universal. It's got the bad guys and the Alps; it's got Julie and sentiment in bucketloads. Our director, dear old Bob Wise, did keep it from falling over the edge into a sea of treacle.\\" This article was about:","output":"The enduring appeal of the musical movie, \\"The Sound of Music.\\" The film, released in 1965, follows the heart-warming love story of a singing nun, Maria, who becomes the governess of seven children and ultimately falls in love with their father, Captain von Trapp. While the plot itself is based on the memoir of the real-life Maria von Trapp, it is the film's music, written by Rodgers and Hammerstein, that has embedded itself in popular culture. Despite criticisms at the time of its release for being historically inaccurate and overly sentimental, the allure of the movie has been tied to its romantic narrative and the catchy, addictive songs. The soundtrack album was the UK's best-selling LP in 1965, 1966, and 1968. Fans have continued to celebrate and enjoy the film over the past five decades, attending sing-along versions of the screenings, dressing up as the characters, and maintaining its preservation against potential Hollywood remakes. Notable figures like Keith Milward, Richard Fitzwilliam, and even Lord Lloyd-Webber have expressed their love for the film, citing its perfect mix of romance, musical appeal, and escapism. Even actor Christopher Plummer, famous for his role as Captain von Trapp and known for his own criticisms of the film, recognized its enduring appeal due to its contrast from more violent contemporary cinematic offerings, providing relief with its old-fashioned universality, heartwarming sentiment, and of course, memorable songs."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Fact 1: Threatening behavior causes a fight-or-flight response in animals.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. I am facing a new situation today: Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which candidate will Mike not vote for?","output":"Given the background information and the new situation, Mike will most likely not vote for Jessica. The steps I took to reach this conclusion are as follows: Step 1: Understand the viewpoint and priorities of Mike. Mike is an avid environmentalist and from the scenario given, we can deduce that he considers saving the planet and the animals that inhibit it a priority. Step 2: Evaluate Jessica's stance. Jessica replied to the question by suggesting that we should emit more anthropogenic gases, which is in disagreement with the concerns raised in the background article about the adverse effects of human-made greenhouse gases on the planet. Step 3: Evaluate Milly's stance. Milly suggested that the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere should be decreased. This aligns with the concerns in the background article about the harmful effect of these gases on the environment. Step 4: Compare both the stances with Mike's viewpoint, which is prioritising the planet and animal life. Jessica's viewpoint doesn't align with Mike's as she suggests increasing greenhouse gas emissions, which have been identified as harmful to the environment and wildlife. On the other hand, Milly's viewpoint aligns with that of Mike's. With all these considerations in mind, it is safe to say that Mike will not vote for Jessica as her stance on greenhouse gas emissions contradicts Mike's priorities."},{"instruction":"Build a movie plot around this: What does Ralph go shortly after his arrival ?

Along with the inheritance, Ralph learns that he is connected to a royal family in England and is now considered to be an honorary duke. Excited and eager to start the next chapter of his life, Ralph travels to England to claim his title and meet his newfound family. Upon his arrival, he discovers that the Royal Palace is in desperate need of repair and redecorating. The once-great castle has become dilapidated over the years due to dwindling funding. Seeing an opportunity to make a big splash and leave his mark on the palace, Ralph decides to combine his passion for classic rock and roll with his interior designing skills. He envisions a palace filled with jukeboxes, neon signs, and token memorabilia from the golden age of American music— the 1950s and 60s. Ralph's colorful and quirky ideas, however, clash with the stodgy, conservative members of the royal family, led by the ever-so-proper Queen Victoria III. They believe that the palace should be restored to its original, traditional glory and that Ralph's vision is a disgrace to the family's legacy. In spite of the resistance, Ralph inspires a group of passionate, creative outcasts from around the castle to help him on his quest to overhaul the Royal Palace. Together, they work tirelessly to transform the palace into a lively, groovy, and fun space. The once-dingy corridors are now adorned with neon lights, chrome trims, and autographed guitars from rock legends. It's a stark contrast to the conventional, stately appearance it once held.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"Patient, a person who is qualified to treat people who are ill.\\" - Sentence B: \\"Doctor, a person who is qualified to treat people who are ill.\\" Let me think hard. Detailed solution:","output":"After closely analyzing both sentences, it is clear that Sentence A does not make sense. Here is the step-by-step justification for this conclusion: 1. In Sentence A, the term \\"Patient\\" is used. A patient is someone who receives treatment or healthcare services from a medical professional, such as a doctor or a nurse. 2. In Sentence A, the definition provided is: \\"a person who is qualified to treat people who are ill.\\" This definition is inconsistent with the meaning of \\"Patient\\" as it describes the qualifications and role of a medical professional, not a person receiving treatment. 3. In Sentence B, the term \\"Doctor\\" is used. A doctor is a person who has completed the required education and training to diagnose, treat, and prevent illnesses and injuries in patients. 4. In Sentence B, the definition provided is: \\"a person who is qualified to treat people who are ill.\\" This definition correctly describes the role of a doctor as a medical professional who treats people with illnesses. Therefore, it is Sentence A that does not make sense, as it inaccurately defines a patient as someone qualified to treat people who are ill, when in fact, it is a doctor who fulfills this role."},{"instruction":"See the multi-choice question below: Sentence 1: The first kabuki theater was built in on this site in 1889. Sentence 2: It is the first kabuki theater in the world. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Available choices: [a]. yes. [b]. it is not possible to tell. [c]. no.","output":"[b]. it is not possible to tell. In order to determine whether Sentence 2 is true or not, we need to analyze the two sentences carefully. Sentence 1: \\"The first kabuki theater was built in on this site in 1889.\\" This sentence tells us the following key points: 1. It's about a kabuki theater 2. The location of the theater, referred to as \\"this site\\" 3. The theater was built in 1889 4. The theater is referred to as \\"the first\\" Sentence 2: \\"It is the first kabuki theater in the world.\\" This sentence tells us: 1. It's about a kabuki theater 2. The theater is referred to as \\"the first\\" in the world Now let's compare the information from both sentences. While Sentence 1 provides information about the location, timeline, and reference to \\"the first\\" kabuki theater, it does not specifically mention that this theater was the first one globally. Sentence 2, on the other hand, states that the theater in question is the first in the world, but it does not provide a time or location. While it is easy to assume that the two sentences are related and could be referring to the same theater, we cannot say for certain without further information. The first sentence describes a kabuki theater built on a specific site in 1889, but it does not explicitly state that it was the very first kabuki theater worldwide. It could be the first theater in a certain region or the first theater built by a specific person or group, for example. In conclusion, based on the information provided, it is not possible to tell whether Sentence 2 is true if Sentence 1 is true. We would need more context or information to confirm the relationship between the two sentences and if they are indeed referring to the same kabuki theater."},{"instruction":"This is an email Use the \\"Daily Activity\\" worksheet in this file.

It has been blamed for altering women’s moods – but it seems the Pill also has an impact on their male partners. Men feel less attractive if their wife or girlfriend takes the oral contraceptive, a study claims. British and Dutch researchers studied 14 women who were on the Pill, then stopped taking it. They were asked how attractive they felt – and their partners were asked how they saw them. The men were also asked how they rated their own looks. The team found being on the Pill made no difference to how a woman saw herself. However, the men felt more attracted to women when they were not on the Pill, which is taken by three million Britons. The researchers say this could be because the treatment stops hormonal fluctuations that make a woman particularly fertile at certain times in a monthly cycle. At these times, said Kelly Cobey, of Stirling University, women display subtle cues, such as clear skin and flirty behaviour, that men respond to subconsciously by feeling attracted to them. So why did a partner on the Pill make men feel less attractive? The scientists said men’s sense of their own appeal is based on their partner’s looks. Differing perspectives: Alternatively, being on the Pill makes no difference to how a woman sees herself. When women are off the Pill, men are more attracted to them. As a result, they get an ego boost that makes them feel good about themselves, they suggest. In the journal Biological Psychology, Dr Cobey said the results should not affect use of the Pill, but said ‘subtle psychological effects’ may have been overlooked. Write highlights for this article.","output":"This article talks about a study that found out how the birth control pill can affect men in relationships. Here are the main points: 1.

They asked the women how attractive they felt, and their partners were asked how attractive they found the women. 4. The men also had to say how attractive they thought they were themselves. 5. The researchers found that being on the pill didn't change how a woman saw herself, but the men felt more attracted to the women when they were not on the pill. 6.

Far away, in an observation room, M, her assistant, Charles Robinson and a British admiral, Roebuck, are watching the operation through cameras placed by an agent they've sent into the area. They identify many of the weapons and several of the buyers.Over M's protests, the officers agree to launch a guided missile into the area believing that they will eliminate half of the world's most dangerous criminals. The missile is launched from a British frigate and speeds toward the target just as the command center receives a radio call from their agent on the scene. Among the camera images is a plane holding two powerful soviet nuclear weapons which may be triggered by the guided missile. An attempt to abort the missile attack fails and the agent, who is revealed to be James Bond, rushes into the area to steal the plane and the bombs. The attack causes most of the terrorists to flee the area.Bond reaches the plane and knocks the pilot in it unconscious. He successfully escapes the valley before the missile hits but is pursued by another of the surviving terrorists in a plane identical to his. He evades the 2nd plane, however, the pilot he knocked out awakes and throws a heavy cord around Bond's neck. Bond keeps control of the plane, flying under the second one and activates the rear ejection seat of his own plane, throwing the man up into the other plane, causing it to explode. Bond contacts the command center and tells them he is flying home with the nukes, asking the admiral where he wants his bombs delivered.In the South China sea, a British missile frigate, the HMS Devonshire, is on patrol and is being threatened by Chinese MIGs.

Chapati is a flatbread made from wheat flour. It's like eating a small, soft bread in a round shape. Chapati can be healthy if you eat it daily, as it contains some good stuff like fiber and nutrients. But, it's important to also eat other healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, and proteins to have a balanced diet. Question 2: Is it healthy to eat fish every day? Fish is a good source of protein and has healthy fats like Omega-3, which is good for our heart and brain. Eating fish every day can be healthy, but it's best to have different kinds of fish to get various nutrients and avoid too much of the same thing. And again, make sure to eat other foods like fruits, veggies, and grains for a balanced diet. So, to answer your question, eating both chapati and fish daily can be healthy, but it's important to include other nutritious foods in your meals.

The berry , also known as the miracle fruit , was first documented by explorer Chevalier des Marchais , who searched for many different fruits during a 1725 excursion to its native West Africa . Miraculin itself is not sweet . However , after the taste buds are exposed to miraculin ( which binds to sweet receptors on the tongue ) , acidic foods which are ordinarily sour ( such as citrus ) are perceived as sweet . This effect lasts up to an hour . The active substance , isolated by Prof. Kenzo Kurihara ( Kurihara Kenz ) , a Japanese scientist , was named miraculin after the miracle fruit when Kurihara published his work in Science in 1968 . - Reynaud Des Marchais, Chevalier des Marchais was a French cartographer and navigator who travelled extensively in the west coast of Africa, the West Indies and the northwest coast of South America between 1704 and 1727, under service to the King of France. His maps and manuscripts were published posthumously by Père J. B. Labat in Amsterdam in 1730-31. - An oligosaccharide (from the Greek \\"olígos\\", \\"a few\\", and \\"sácchar\\", \\"sugar\\") is a saccharide polymer containing a small number (typically two to ten) of simple sugars (monosaccharides). Oligosaccharides can have many functions including cell recognition and cell binding. For example, glycolipids have an important role in the immune response. - Food energy is chemical energy that animals (including humans) derive from their food and molecular oxygen through the process of cellular respiration. (Cellular respiration involves either the process of joining oxygen from air with the molecules of food (aerobic respiration) or the process of reorganizing the atoms within the molecules (anaerobic respiration).) - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo. - Glycosylation (see also chemical glycosylation) is the reaction in which a carbohydrate, i.e. a glycosyl donor, is attached to a hydroxyl or other functional group of another molecule (a glycosyl acceptor). In biology glycosylation mainly refers in particular to the enzymatic process that attaches glycans to proteins, lipids, or other organic molecules. This enzymatic process produces one of the fundamental biopolymers found in cells (along with DNA, RNA, and proteins). Glycosylation is a form of co-translational and post-translational modification. Glycans serve a variety of structural and functional roles in membrane and secreted proteins. The majority of proteins synthesized in the rough ER undergo glycosylation. It is an enzyme-directed site-specific process, as opposed to the non-enzymatic chemical reaction of glycation. Glycosylation is also present in the cytoplasm and nucleus as the O-GlcNAc modification. Aglycosylation is a feature of engineered antibodies to bypass glycosylation. Five classes of glycans are produced: - Synsepalum dulcificum is a plant known for its berry that, when eaten, causes sour foods (such as lemons and limes) subsequently consumed to taste sweet. This effect is due to miraculin. Common names for this species and its berry include miracle fruit, miracle berry, miraculous berry, sweet berry, and in West Africa, where the species originates, agbayun, taami, asaa, and ledidi. - The lemon (\\"Citrus\\" × \\"limon\\") is a species of small evergreen tree native to Asia. - Proteins (or ) are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity. - Glycoproteins are proteins that contain oligosaccharide chains (glycans) covalently attached to polypeptide side-chains. The carbohydrate is attached to the protein in a cotranslational or posttranslational modification. This process is known as glycosylation. Secreted extracellular proteins are often glycosylated. - Taste, gustatory perception, or gustation is one of the five traditional senses that belongs to the gustatory system. - A sugar substitute is a food additive that provides a sweet taste like that of sugar while containing significantly less food energy. Some sugar substitutes are produced by nature, and others produced synthetically. Those that are not produced by nature are, in general, called artificial sweeteners. - Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for sugar, described as artificial sweeteners. - Food additives are substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance its taste and appearance. Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as with wines. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin. - In biology, a common name of a taxon or organism (also known as a vernacular name, English name, colloquial name, trivial name, trivial epithet, country name, popular name, or farmer's name) is a name that is based on the normal language of everyday life; this kind of name is often contrasted with the scientific name for the same organism, which is Latinized.

In 2014, the world was shocked to learn about the brutal killing of Rebecca Johnson, a young and talented healthcare professional from Australia. Working in a hospital in the Southeast Asian country, she was known for her kindness, passion, and dedication to saving lives. However, her life was cruelly cut short when she tragically became the victim of a violent crime that soon garnered international attention. The three men convicted for the heartless murder of Rebecca Johnson were sentenced to death by a judge who referred to the case as \\"one of the most heinous and cold-blooded murders\\" he had ever witnessed. While legal procedures continue in an attempt to bring justice to the fallen nurse, the possibility of clemency for the perpetrators remains a contentious issue. Peter Johnson, Rebecca's older brother, has emerged as the voice of the victim's family, articulating their unwavering stance on the matter. The Johnson family is united in their opposition to any leniency or clemency for the men responsible for their precious daughter and sister's demise. They firmly believe that forgiving and absolving the criminals would only serve to devalue not just Rebecca's life, but the lives of other potential and past victims as well. Echoing the sentiments of the bereaved loved ones, Peter Johnson asserts that it is the responsibility of the criminal justice system to ensure that its decisions reflect the gravity of such a heinous crime. As citizens who have suffered indescribable anguish, the family implores the authorities to take into consideration the impact that granting clemency would have on their unending grief, as well as on overall public safety and social order. The family's adamant opposition to clemency stems not from a desire for vengeance, but from the hope that by refusing leniency, they can contribute to deterring similar acts of violence in the future. Such a cruel and wanton taking of an innocent life ought to be met with the full weight of the law, they believe, to send a clear and unequivocal message that society will not tolerate such abhorrent acts. While the family mourns the loss of their daughter, sister, and friend, they remain steadfast in their convictions, understanding that nothing can bring Rebecca back. They also acknowledge the magnitude of this issue, especially the contentious debate surrounding the death penalty. However, their ultimate priority remains ensuring that their beloved family member's memory is honored, and her senseless death is not without consequence nor meaning. In the face of this tragic ordeal, the Johnson family's courageous stand against clemency for the individuals responsible for Rebecca's murder serves as a powerful reminder of the value that societies place on justice, accountability, and the inherent worth of human life. As the legal process unfolds, it is crucial that the voices of victims' families, such as the Johnson, are heard and considered, ensuring that the criminal justice system strives to uphold the principles of fairness, compassion, and respect to all those affected by violent crime."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Industrialized nations agreed to start phasing the subsidies out after an agreement at the Group of 20 summit meeting of the world’s largest economies in 2009, and some progress has been made. The International Energy Agency said its 490 billion estimate for worldwide fossil fuel subsidies in 2014 would have been 610 billion if not for changes since that agreement. But calls for greater cuts continue. The energy agency issued a statement last month identifying the elimination of subsidies as one of the most effective strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The subsidies are “public enemy No. 1 in terms of sustainable development,” said Fatih Birol, executive director of the agency. On Monday, the first day of the climate conference, representatives of 35 governments and hundreds of businesses and organizations issued a call for countries to take aggressive action to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said, “The huge sums involved globally could be better spent on schools, health care, renewable energies and building resilient societies.” We’re tracking developments from the COP21 climate conference in Paris. Get daily news and analysis by email from the climate change conference in Paris. You will also be among the first to receive our new Science newsletter. In their simplest form, fossil fuel subsidies amount to government spending to keep the price of fuel low for citizens. They are why gasoline in Venezuela costs about 2 cents per gallon. The International Energy Agency estimates that global subsidies total about 490 billion a year. Those direct subsidies are found chiefly in the developing world and in oil-producing nations. Industrialized countries like the United States are less likely to reduce the cost of fuel at the pump with government money, but experts who track subsidies say that America, too, finds ways to support fossil fuel use through tax breaks and in backing for exploration and production. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has counted 800 ways that rich industrial nations use taxpayer money to support fossil fuel producers. A new report from Oil Change International, an energy research and advocacy group, estimates that aid to the coal, oil and natural gas industries came to 452 billion last year. The group said the situation amounted to governments “allowing fossil fuel producers to undermine national climate commitments, while paying them for the privilege.” “We have to stop using government funds to support the industry that is causing the problem,” said Stephen Kretzmann, executive director and founder of Oil Change International. “That would seem to be the low-hanging fruit of solving climate change: When you’re in a hole, stop digging. And yet we really haven’t made much progress.” The International Monetary Fund has come up with a much higher estimate for the global total of fossil fuel subsidies — 5.3 trillion, which includes the costs of the effects of energy use on people’s health, the environment and climate change. That figure constitutes 6.9 percent of the global gross domestic product. Whatever the estimates, they stand in sharp contrast to the money being spent on reducing the effects of climate change. Even the lowest subsidy estimates far exceed the pledge by advanced industrialized nations to spend 100 billion a year by 2020 to fight climate change. A recent report from the Climate Policy Initiative, a nonprofit research and policy organization funded by the financier George Soros, suggested that to keep the global temperature from rising more than two degrees Celsius would require about 1 trillion per year. Bill Hare, chief executive of the nonprofit research and policy group Climate Analytics, said taking action on direct subsidies could have a profound effect. “Emissions could be reduced by up to 20 percent from what would otherwise occur if you removed fossil fuel subsidies,” he added. Critics of subsidies say their greatest benefits go to the middle class and the rich, who can better afford cars. By keeping conventional fuels at low prices, subsidies also make alternative energy sources less affordable in comparison. The International Energy Agency’s 2014 World Energy Outlook report warned, “Fossil fuel subsidies rig the game against renewables and act as a drag on the transition to a more sustainable energy system.” The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet. That report noted that some countries spent a greater share of their gross domestic product on fossil fuel subsidies than on health or education. Going into the Paris climate talks, China, Ethiopia, India, Mexico, Morocco, Singapore and Vietnam had committed to addressing subsidies, Mr. Kretzmann said. “Governments have a lot of incentive and opportunity to eliminate those now, with oil prices so low,” he added. And as prices have dropped, subsidies have been reduced in many countries, including India, Indonesia, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates, said Dr. Hare of Climate Analytics. While attempts to cut subsidies have led to social unrest, more recent efforts, including a gradual phaseout to soften the blow, have enjoyed quiet success. But previous efforts have often been abandoned when global fuel prices rise and consumers are pinched. “If you look at the history of fuel subsidy reform, it doesn’t always stick,” said Michael L. Ross, a professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies energy subsidies. A study from the Carbon Tracker Initiative, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis and other groups suggested that eliminating production subsidies for the Powder River Basin coal region in Wyoming and Montana alone would raise the price of that coal enough to reduce demand for it by 30 percent in the long term, which the study estimates would equal the emissions from as many as 32 coal-burning plants. Michael A. Levi, an energy expert with the Council on Foreign Relations, said that fuel subsidies were an inefficient way to help the poor, anyway. However, he noted that better ways were not necessarily available. Giving money directly to the poor to make up for the lost fuel savings would require a banking and credit infrastructure that often cannot be found in the developing world. “You shouldn’t want to solve these countries’ fiscal problems on the backs of their weakest citizens,” Mr. Levi said. In the United States, a longstanding coalition of environmentalists and libertarians has sought to eliminate tax breaks and policies that support the fossil fuel industry. Eli Lehrer, the co-founder of the R Street Institute, a free-market think tank in Washington, said the oil industry did not need many of the tax breaks it received. “I doubt that eliminating the intangible drilling cost write-off would reduce oil production at all,” he said. Carlton Carroll, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, said the tax breaks for his industry “are similar to other manufacturing sectors.” He added, “As an industry, we pay higher taxes than any other.” Such arguments do not convince Mr. Lehrer, whose group is part of the Green Scissors coalition that includes environmentally conscious budget cutters across the political spectrum. “These subsidies on fossil fuels are a very good, transideological issue,” he said. “To the left, it’s a terrible act of environmental destruction. To the right, it’s crony capitalism. And both sides are true.” A version of this article appears in print on December 6, 2015, on page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Global Fossil Fuel Subsidies Dwarf Funding Commitment to Climate Change. Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe","output":"As representatives from nearly 200 countries gather in Paris for the COP21 conference, many have pointed to the need to stop widespread subsidies that encourage the use of fossil fuels. Industrialised nations agreed to start phasing the subsidies out after an agreement at the Group of 20 summit meeting in 2009, and some progress has been made. The International Energy Agency said its 490bn estimate for worldwide fossil fuel subsidies in 2014 would have been 610bn if not for changes since that agreement. Last month, the energy agency issued a statement identifying the elimination of subsidies as one of the most effective strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In response, representatives of 35 governments and hundreds of businesses and organisations issued a call for countries to take aggressive action to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. In their simplest form, fossil fuel subsidies amount to government spending to keep the price of fuel low for citizens. The International Energy Agency estimates that global subsidies total about 490bn a year."},{"instruction":"Attributes: name = Strada, eatType = restaurant, priceRange = moderate, customer rating = 1 out of 5, familyFriendly = yes.

If you know your computer will save information, why store it in your own personal memory, your brain? Experts are wondering if the Internet is changing what we remember and how. In a recent study, Professor Betsy Sparrow conducted some experiments. She and her research team wanted to know the Internet is changing memory. In the first experiment, they gave people 40 unimportant facts to type into a computer. The first group of people understood thatthe computer would save the information. The second group understood that the computer would not save it. Later, the second group remembered the information better. People in the first group knew they could find the information again, so they did not try to remember it. In another experiment, the researchers gave people facts to remember, and told them where to find the information on the Internet. The information was in a specific computer folder . Surprisingly, people later remember the folder location better than the facts. When people use the Internet, they do not remember the information. Rather, they remember how to find it. This is called \\"transactive memory \\". According to Sparrow, we are not becoming people with poor memories as a result of the Internet. Instead, computer users are developing stronger transactive memories; that is, people are learning how to organize huge quantities of information so that they are able to access it at a later date. This doesn't mean we are becoming either more or less intelligent, but there is no doubt that the way we use memory is changing. Question: What can we learn about the first experiment? Yes or no, is the answer \\"The first group did not try to remember the formation.\\"? A:","output":"We can learn that in the first experiment, people were given 40 unimportant facts to type into a computer.

After triumphing, he morphs into modern day Ned Thacker (also played by Fairbanks). Ned is born and raised in Kansas by a mother who passes along to him her love of D'Artagnan and The Three Musketeers, despite his father's concern that it is not good for him. In fact, Ned does get into trouble with his (sometimes unwanted) chivalrous attempts to help women. Finally, Ned can stand it no more; he decides to leave dull Kansas. In mirroring scenes, D'Artagnan is astride a somewhat less-than-noble steed, a present from his father for his departure from home, while Ned's father gives him the modern equivalent: a car. While driving in the desert, he comes upon a chauffeur-driven automobile stopped because the road ahead has been washed away. Unimpressed with one passenger, the middle-aged Forrest Vandeteer (the \\"richest man in Yonkers\\"), Ned is quite taken with the lovely \\"Park Avenue flapper\\" Elsie Dodge. Her mother, the third passenger, sees her only daughter's marriage to Vandeteer as the solution to their dire financial straits. Vandeteer buys what he wants, and he wants Elsie. She, however, loathes her suitor; she much prefers young Ned. Scene from the movie Ned comes up with the idea to put his car on railroad tracks. He takes the party (with Elsie in the front seat beside him) to their Grand Canyon resort hotel. There, Vandeteer tells Ned to stay away from the ladies. John Blabb, who works for \\"Town Topics\\", informs Ned that Vandeteer already has three wives hidden away somewhere. Meanwhile, Chin-de-dah, the Native American leader of an outlaw gang hiding in a tributary canyon, is bored.

For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith.

This allows readers to be aware of the context and to understand the reasons for the protests becoming violent. Introduction: Recent protests in Moscow have taken a turn for the worse - prompting fear among residents and international observers alike. The streets have become a battleground, as citizens voice their demand for change and enhanced political freedom, while law enforcement tries to suppress the dissent. Step 2: Discuss the cause of the protests It is important to understand the cause of the protests since it provides the basis for the actions of the people involved. I will use reliable sources to gather accurate information on the reasons behind the protests in Moscow. Causes of the Protests: These protests were sparked by the arrest of a prominent opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, which led to widespread dissatisfaction among the public. Thousands of people took to the streets, calling for the release of Navalny and condemning the government's oppressive policies. Step 3: Describe how the protests turned violent As I delve into the main topic, I will provide specific events and instances that demonstrate how the protests turned violent. This section will give readers an insight into the dangerous atmosphere of these protests, with various sources providing evidence of the unfolding violence. Violence Erupts: Tensions grew as law enforcement started using brutal tactics such as tear gas, rubber bullets, and excessive force to disperse the crowds. Protesters began fighting back by throwing objects at the police, setting fires, and building barricades. Multiple reports indicate that both protesters and police officers were injured during the ongoing clashes, further escalating the situation. Step 4: Highlight the impact on the city and international response To provide a complete picture of the current situation in Moscow, I must also address the effects of these violent protests on everyday life in the city. The international community's response also serves as an indicator of the protests' significance and the potential implications for global politics. Impact on Moscow and International Response: The escalating violence has instilled fear among Moscow's residents, forcing many to stay inside their homes and local businesses to close. The international community has expressed concern over the situation, with various countries and human rights organizations condemning the excessive use of force by law enforcement and calling for a peaceful resolution. Step 5: Conclude the article Finally, I will conclude the article by summarizing the key points and emphasizing the ongoing nature of the protests and the volatility of the situation. Conclusion: The violent turn of events in Moscow's protests has brought about great concern and unease among citizens and international observers. With no resolution in sight, the fear and tension continue to grow, as both protesters and law enforcement remain steadfast in their positions. The outcome of these protests remains uncertain, but the impact on Moscow and its people is undeniably palpable."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence based on this summary: iranian president says country will respond to package of nuclear incentives in mid-august","output":"Step 1: Identify the main pieces of information from the summary. - Iranian president - Respond to package of nuclear incentives - Mid-August Step 2: Organize the information in an understandable order. - Iranian president - Mid-August - Respond to package of nuclear incentives Step 3: Create a sentence using the information, ensuring it accurately reflects the summary and maintains coherence.

Article: The Enigma of Beauty The search for beauty spans centuries and continents.Paintings of Egyptians dating back over 4,000 years show both men and women painting their nails and wearing makeup.In 18th-century France,wealthy noblemen wore large wigs of long,white hair to make themselves attractive.Today,people continue to devote a lot of time and money to their appearance. There is at least one good reason for the desire to be attractive: beauty is power.Studies suggest that good-looking people make more money,get called on more often in class,and are regarded as friendlier. But what exactly is beauty? It's difficult to describe it clearly,and yet we know it when we see it.And our awareness of it may start at a very early age.In one set of studies,six-month-old babies were shown a series of photographs.The faces on the pictures had been rated for attractiveness by a group of college students.In the studies,the babies spent more time looking at the attractive faces than the unattractive ones. The idea that even babies can judge appearance makes perfect sense to many researchers.In studies by psychologists,men consistently showed a preference for women with larger eyes,fuller lips,and a smaller nose and chin while women prefer men with large shoulders and a narrow waist.According to scientists,the mind unconsciously tells men and women that these traits--the full lips,clear skin,strong shoulders--equal health and genetic well-being. Not everyone thinks the same way,however.\\"Our hardwiredness can be changed by all sorts of expectations--mostly cultural,\\" says C.Loring Brace,an anthropologist at the University of Michigan.What is considered attractive in one culture might not be in another.Look at most Western fashion magazines: the women on the pages are thin.But is this \\"perfect\\" body type for women worldwide? Scientists' answer is no; what is considered beautiful is subjective and varies around the world.They found native peoples in southeast Peru preferred shapes regarded overweight in Western cultures.

It is situated south-west of Bodmin Moor. - Londinium was a settlement established on the current site of the City of London around 43. Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century. - A conurbation is a region comprising a number of cities, large towns, and other urban areas that, through population growth and physical expansion, have merged to form one continuous urban or industrially developed area. In most cases, a conurbation is a polycentric urbanised area, in which transportation has developed to link areas to create a single urban labour market or travel to work area. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Devon (archaically known as Devonshire) is a county of England, reaching from the Bristol Channel in the north to the English Channel in the south. It is part of South West England, bounded by Cornwall to the west, Somerset to the northeast, and Dorset to the east.

It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831. - Cornwall is a ceremonial county and unitary authority area of England within the United Kingdom.

It is in size, and dates from the Carboniferous period of geological history. It includes Brown Willy, the highest point in Cornwall, and Rough Tor, a slightly lower peak. Many of Cornwall's rivers have their sources here. It has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic era, when primitive farmers started clearing trees and farming the land. They left their megalithic monuments, hut circles and cairns, and the Bronze Age culture that followed left further cairns, and more stone circles and stone rows. By medieval and modern times, nearly all the forest was gone and livestock rearing predominated. - The Tamar is a river in south west England, that forms most of the border between Devon (to the east) and Cornwall (to the west). The area is a World Heritage Site due to its historic mining activities. - The City of London is a city and county within London.

The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor. - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - A watchmaker is an artisan who makes and repairs watches. Since a majority of watches are now factory made, most modern watchmakers only repair watches. However, originally they were master craftsmen who built watches, including all their parts, by hand. Modern watchmakers, when required to repair older watches, for which replacement parts may not be available, must have fabrication skills, and can typically manufacture replacements for many of the parts found in a watch. The term clockmaker refers to an equivalent occupation specializing in clocks. - John Arnold ( born 1736 probably in Bodmin , Cornwall -- died 1799 in London ) was an English watchmaker and inventor . John Arnold was the first to design a watch that was both practical and accurate , and also brought the term \`\` Chronometer '' into use in its modern sense , meaning a precision timekeeper . His technical advances enabled the quantity production of Marine Chronometers for use on board ships from around 1782 . The basic design of these , with a few modifications unchanged until the late twentieth century . With regard to his legacy one can say that both he and Abraham - Louis Breguet largely invented the modern mechanical watch . Certainly one of his most important inventions , the Overcoil balance spring is still to be found in most mechanical wrist watches to this day . It is necessary to point out that the brand name Arnold & Son used by a Swiss watch company has absolutely no connection to the original firm founded by John Arnold . It was from around 1770 that Arnold developed the portable precision timekeeper , almost from the point where John Harrison ended his work in this field . But compared to Harrison 's complicated and expensive watch , Arnold 's basic design was simple whilst consistently accurate and mechanically reliable . Importantly , the relatively simple and conventional design of his movement facilitated its production in quantity at a reasonable price whilst also enabling easier maintenance and adjustment . But three elements were necessary for this achievement : A detached escapement , which gave minimal interference with the vibrating balance and balance spring A balance design that enabled compensation for the effect of temperature on the balance spring A method for adjusting the balance spring , so that the balance oscillates in equal time periods , even through different degrees of balance arc - Surrey is a county in the south east of England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London. Surrey shares borders with Kent to the east, East Sussex to the south-east, West Sussex to the south, Hampshire to the west and south-west and Berkshire to the north-west. The county town is Guildford. Surrey County Council sits extraterritorially at Kingston upon Thames, administered as part of Greater London since 1965. With a resident population of 1.1 million, Surrey is the most densely populated and third most populated county in the South East region, after Kent and Hampshire. - A clockmaker is an artisan who makes and/or repairs clocks. Since almost all clocks are now factory-made, most modern clockmakers only repair clocks. Modern clockmakers may be employed by jewellers, antique shops, and places devoted strictly to repairing clocks and watches. Clockmakers must be able to read blueprints and instructions for numerous types of clocks and time pieces that vary from antique clocks to modern time pieces in order to fix and make clocks or watches. The trade requires fine motor coordination as clockmakers must frequently work on devices with small gears and fine machinery. - Redruth is a town and civil parish in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The population of Redruth was 14,018 at the 2011 census. In the same year the population of the Camborne-Redruth urban area, which also includes Carn Brea, Illogan and several satellite villages, stood at 55,400 making it the largest conurbation in Cornwall. Redruth lies approximately at the junction of the A393 and A3047 roads, on the route of the old London to Land's End trunk road (now the A30), and is approximately west of Truro, east of St Ives, north east of Penzance and north west of Falmouth. Camborne and Redruth together form the largest urban area in Cornwall and before local government reorganisation were an urban district. - Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties. It borders Greater London to the north west, Surrey to the west, East Sussex to the south west, and Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north. The county town is Maidstone. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.

Their music is known for its brand of \\"minimalistic psychedelia\\". Spacemen 3 had their first independent chart hits in 1987, gaining a cult following, and going on to have greater success towards the end of the decade. However, they disbanded shortly afterwards, releasing their final studio album post-split in 1991 after an acrimonious parting of ways. Context: In November 1985, Spacemen 3 played a gig at a leisure centre in Coventry to an audience of fewer than ten people. Nevertheless, encouraged by the support of Pat Fish, they determined that they ought to record a new demo tape. By this time they had reconfigured and honed their musical style, and their repertoire consisted of newer songs and re-worked older ones. \\"The band's sound had crystallised into the intense, hypnotic, overloaded psychedelia which characterised their early [record] output, and which would serve as a template for their live act throughout their existence\\" (Ian Edmond, Record Collector). At Pierce's instigation, Pete Bain rejoined the band on bass in order to fill out their sound. Despite being a 4-piece again, they would retain the name 'Spacemen 3'. Kember and Pierce opted to upgrade their guitar equipment ahead of recording the new demos. Kember purchased a Burns Jazz electric guitar and 1960s Vox Conqueror amplifier; whilst Pierce bought a Fender Telecaster and a 1970s HH amplifier. Both of their new amplifiers included distortion/fuzz and tremolo; these two effects were key components of Spacemen 3's signature sound. In January 1986, Spacemen 3 attended the home studio of Carlo Marocco at Piddington, outside Northampton, to record their new demo tape. They spent three-and-a-half days at the 16-track studio. Recording live as a group, with minimal overdubs, they managed to get demos for approximately seven songs. Kember and Pierce handled the production. These \\"fine set of performances\\" (Ned Raggett, AllMusic) would later be unofficially released as the vinyl album Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To on the Father Yod label in 1990 (albeit described incorrectly as \\"rehearsals in Rugby\\"). Spacemen 3 managed to obtain a record deal shortly after producing their new demos. Pat Fish had given a copy of the demo tape to Dave Barker, the owner of the independent record label Glass Records, to whom Fish's band The Jazz Butcher were signed. Spacemen 3 signed a three-year, two-album recording contract with Glass Records in early 1986. Question: What is Nothanmton about? Answer:","output":"Nothanmton appears to be a typographical error in the text you provided. However, within the context, it seems that it should be referring to \\"Northampton.\\" Northampton is a town in the East Midlands region of England, which is relevant to this context because Spacemen 3 attended a recording studio in Piddington, located outside Northampton, in January 1986. Here, they spent three-and-a-half days recording a new demo tape consisting of approximately seven songs. The sessions were recorded live as a group, with minimal overdubs. Peter Kember and Jason Pierce managed the production aspects themselves. Northampton is not a thematic subject or a concept related to Spacemen 3's music; rather, it is simply a geographical location where they recorded their demos in 1986. These demos would later be released as the unofficial vinyl album 'Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To' in 1990 on the Father Yod label.

Inzamam-ul-Haq ( pronunciation ;Punjabi, Urdu: nDmm lHq; born 3 March 1970), also known as Inzy, is a former Pakistani cricketer, and former captain. He is the leading run scorer for Pakistan in one-day internationals, and the third-highest run scorer for Pakistan in Test cricket. He was the captain of the Pakistan national cricket team from 2003-07 and is considered to be one of the best leaders in Pakistan Cricket history. Inzamam rose to fame in the semi-final of the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Inzamam made his (ODI) debut in a home series against West Indies in 1991, and made a good start to his career by scoring 20 and 60 runs in two matches against West Indies. This was followed by 48, 60, 101, and 117 runs against Sri Lanka. Handpicked by former Pakistan captain Imran Khan for the 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, 22-year-old Inzamam was relatively unheard of before the tournament. To the surprise of many he was persevered with throughout the tournament, coming in at various positions in the batting line-up, despite not being very successful early on. Yet it was his performances at the most crucial stage of the competition that made fans and summarisers take note. Inzamam rose to fame in Pakistan's dramatic semi-final against New Zealand at Auckland. With his side in a precarious position, chasing 262 against an impressive New Zealand side, he hit a fiery 60 run innings from just 37 balls to rescue his side and guide them into the final. The innings was regarded as one of the finest World Cup performances. He hit a massive six in that match which was described by David Lloyd as the shot of the tournament. Inzamam made an equally vital contribution in the final of the World Cup, scoring 42 runs off just 35 balls, helping Pakistan reach a score of 249 after a sluggish start. These innings established Inzamam's billing as a big-game player, although he was unable to replicate his World Cup success in later tournaments. Inzamam regard his best least highlighted innings of 90 not out against West Indies when Pakistan won their first ODI in the West Indies on 27 March 1993. In total, Inzamam set a record for scoring the most half centuries in One Day Internationals, 83 - though this is now surpassed by Sachin Tendulkar, Jacques Kallis and Kumar Sangakkara. He also became the second batsman to score 10,000 runs in One-day Internationals (again after Tendulkar) and was named in the ICC World XI for both Tests and One-day Internationals in the 2005 ICC Awards. In his final ODI for Pakistan, playing against Zimbabwe in the 2007 Cricket World Cup, he took three catches whilst fielding, including the last one of the match, ending his One Day career.","output":"This text is about Inzamam-ul-Haq, also known as Inzy, a former Pakistani cricketer and former captain of the Pakistan national cricket team.

Romney told me that the statement came out wrong, because it was an attempt to placate a rambling supporter who was saying that Obama voters were essentially deadbeats. “My mistake was that I was speaking in a way that reflected back to the man,” Romney said. “If I had been able to see the camera, I would have remembered that I was talking to the whole world, not just the man.” I had never heard Romney say that he was prompted into the “47 percent” line by a ranting supporter. It was also impossible to ignore the phrase “If I had to do this again.” Liebovitch was interested in the “on-the-record-all-the-time” idea as a reflection of Romney’s “limitations as a candidate.” But I’d say it captures the central nature of Romney’s entire 2012 campaign. Throughout the primaries he was always in effect talking to some angry if not entirely coherent Republican voter or donor or media opinion-leader, and trying to “reflect back” to their POV, which Mitt did not entirely share but had to take very, very seriously. It’s an almost impossible habit to break, and at a crucial moment, he couldn’t. ||||| Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) who was the GOP vice presidential nominee in 2012 reflected on one of the more controversial moments of that race in an interview with Charlie Rose that aired on PBS Monday evening. During the discussion, Rose asked Ryan about a video that emerged showing Romney telling donors 47 percent of Americans would vote for President Barack Obama \\"no matter what\\" because they are \\"dependent on government.\\" Ryan responded that what Romney said \\"was wrong.\\" He went on to describe it as an ineffective way to articulate their economic policies. \\"What we are trying to communicate is we want to have a system so that everybody can get to where they want to get in life,\\" Ryan explained. Ryan remains a vocal supporter of Romney's and discussed this in his interview with Rose. He addressed mounting speculation Romney could mount a third White House bid in 2016 and implied he would gladly be Romney's running mate once again. \\"I'll be his bus driver if he wants me to be. Look, I think he'd be a great president,\\" said Ryan. He addressed the infamous \\"47 percent: video, which was widely seen as pivotal in the last election, during a larger discussion of what Ryan described as \\"mistakes\\" he believes he and other conservatives have made when discussing poverty. Rather than criticizing those who are \\"dependent\\" on government, Ryan argued conservatives need to clearly articulate support for \\"bottom-up pro-growth policies\\" to combat poverty that are focused on local community organizations. He contrasted this with what he described as the \\"governing philosophy that's prevailing in Washington right now,\\" which is focused on social welfare programs run by the government. Ryan, who recently wrote a book outlining his ideas to combat poverty also discussed the possibility he could run for president in 2016. He said he would make a decision \\"in the spring of 2015.\\" Ryan described the main questions he would evaluate in making his choice. \\"Family, is there somebody else that I would like and I can back,\\" Ryan said. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"In a recent interview, Mitt Romney reflected on his 2012 presidential campaign, noting that if he had to do it again, he would want a camera on him at all times to help him stay aware of the broader audience.

On average, how many marbles of other colors will his friend end up getting?","output":"Step 1: Determine the percentage of other colored marbles To find the percentage of other colored marbles, subtract the percentages of clear and black marbles from 100%. 100% - (40% + 20%) = 100% - 60% = 40% Step 2: Set up a proportion Let x be the number of other colored marbles the friend is likely to get on average when he takes five marbles. 40% (percentage of other colored marbles) = x (number of other colored marbles) / 5 (total number of marbles the friend takes) Step 3: Solve for x To solve for x, multiply both sides of the equation by 5: 40% * 5 = x Step 4: Calculate x Convert the percentage into decimal by dividing 40 by 100: 40 ÷ 100 = 0.4 Now, multiply this decimal by 5: 0.4 * 5 = 2 Step 5: Final answer Therefore, on average, the friend will end up getting 2 marbles of other colors when he takes five marbles from Percius' collection."},{"instruction":"A lamington is an Australian cake, made from squares of sponge cake coated in an outer layer of chocolate (or sometimes raspberry) sauce and rolled in desiccated coconut.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: What is the problem in Sandy and Susan's marriage? Movie title: Carnal Knowledge Movie plot: The story follows the sexual exploits of two Amherst College roommates over a 25-year period, from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. Sandy (Art Garfunkel) is gentle and passive, while Jonathan Fuerst (Jack Nicholson) is tough and aggressive. Sandy idolizes women, Jonathan objectifies women. He frequently uses the term \\"ballbuster\\" to describe women as emasculating teases whose main pleasure as he sees it is to deny pleasure to men. Since each man's perspective of womanhood is extreme and self-serving, neither is able to sustain a relationship with a woman. The film has three parts. Part I occurs when Sandy and Jonathan are college roommates. Part II follows the men several years after college. In the final part, the men have become middle-aged. In the beginning, Sandy and Jonathan are discussing women, and what kind appeals to each. Sandy wants a woman who is intellectual. Jonathan is more interested in a woman's physical attributes. Sandy shyly meets Susan (Candice Bergen) at an on-campus event and they begin dating. Although they enjoy each other's company, Susan is reluctant to enter into a physical relationship. Unknown to Sandy, she meets Jonathan, feeling a physical attraction for him. They have sex. Jonathan convinces Susan not to have sex with Sandy. Susan therefore has a purely intellectual relationship with Sandy, while at the same having a purely physical relationship with Jonathan. Part II finds Sandy married to Susan, while Jonathan is still searching for his \\"perfect woman.\\" Jonathan now defines perfection by a woman's bust size and figure. Jonathan begins a relationship with Bobbie (Ann-Margret), a beautiful woman who fulfills all of Jonathan's requirements. However, Jonathan constantly berates Bobbie for being shallow.

As a result, Sandy and Susan's marriage is built on a foundation where their individual needs and expectations are not being fully met, causing dissatisfaction and struggles in their relationship. Additionally, the influence of Jonathan is another factor that affects Sandy and Susan's marriage, as Susan had a purely physical relationship with him while being with Sandy, which further complicates their marital dynamic."},{"instruction":"Blue Nile is an online specialty retailer of fine jewelry.

Let's be accurate as possible.","output":"To find TJ's average time per kilometer, we first need to find his total time for the race and then divide it by the race distance of 10 kilometers. Step 1: Find the total time. TJ ran the first half of the race (5 kilometers) in 20 minutes and the second half (another 5 kilometers) in 30 minutes. Total time = 20 minutes (first half) + 30 minutes (second half) = 50 minutes Step 2: Convert the total time to seconds for better accuracy. 1 minute = 60 seconds Total time = 50 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 3000 seconds Step 3: Divide the total time by the race distance (10 kilometers). Average time per kilometer = Total time / Distance Average time per kilometer = 3000 seconds / 10 kilometers = 300 seconds per kilometer Step 4: Convert the average time per kilometer back to minutes and seconds. 300 seconds per kilometer = 5 minutes (since 300/60 = 5) and 0 seconds (since there's no remainder) TJ's average time per kilometer is 5 minutes and 0 seconds or 5 minutes."},{"instruction":"What is the final step of the following process: - A bird lays an egg - The egg hatches into a baby bird - Baby bird eats - Grows into an adult bird - The bird finds a mate - The pair build a nest","output":"- The adult birds mate and lay eggs, repeating the cycle"},{"instruction":"Translate to Finnish: Flexibility is important too in the current context of enlargement of the euro zone. Finnish:","output":"Joustonvaraisuus on myös tärkeää nykyisessä laajentumisen yhteydessä euroalueella. Joustonvaraisuus tarkoittaa kykyä mukautua ja reagoida muutoksiin nopeasti ja tehokkaasti. Euroalueen laajentumisen yhteydessä tämä on erityisen tärkeää, koska se vaikuttaa monilla eri tasoilla ja koskee monia eri osa-alueita taloudellisesta politiikasta ja markkinoiden integraatiosta aina kulttuurisiin eroihin ja poliittiseen yhteistyöhön saakka. Kun uusia jäsenvaltioita liittyy euroalueeseen, niiden taloudelliset järjestelmät ja valuutta sulavat yhteen euroalueen talouden ja euron kanssa. Tässä yhteydessä joustonvaraisuus on oleellista, jotta voidaan varmistaa sujuva siirtyminen ja sopeutuminen uuteen ympäristöön sekä minimoida taloudelliset riskit ja epävarmuus. Esimerkiksi valuuttakurssien muutokset ja niiden vaikutus kauppaan tai pankkijärjestelmän vakaudelle ovat asioita, joihin tulee löytää joustavia ratkaisuja. Toisaalta tämä merkitsee myös sitä, että euroalueen nykyisten jäsenvaltioiden on oltava joustonvaraisia uusien jäsenvaltioiden liittymisen myötä. Tämä saattaa tarkoittaa uusien kumppanuuksien luomista, poliittisten päätösten koordinointia ja yhteistyötä talouspolitiikkojen kehittämisessä. Kulttuuriset erot voivat vaikuttaa myös raaka-aineiden hankintaan, työvoimaan ja kaupankäyntiin. Joustonvarainen strategia auttaa selviytymään näistä haasteista samalla, kun säilytetään jäsenvaltioiden omaleimaisuus ja identiteetti. Lisäksi joustonvaraisuuden ansiosta voidaan kehittää aidosti yhteisiä ja johdonmukaisia politiikkoja jäsenvaltioiden välillä, jotta koko euroalue voi hyötyä laajentumisesta. Politiikkojen sopeuttaminen ja uusien ratkaisujen löytäminen joustonvaraisesti tukevat kestävää kasvua ja investointeja euroalueella, ja auttavat siten varmistamaan, että laajentuminen on hyödyllistä sekä nykyisille että tuleville jäsenvaltioille. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että joustonvaraisuus on ratkaisevan tärkeää euroalueen laajentumisen nykyisessä kontekstissa, koska se auttaa mukautumaan ja reagoimaan tehokkaasti muuttuvaan toimintaympäristöön, edistää jäsenvaltioiden välistä yhteistyötä ja yhtenäisyyttä sekä tukee kestävää talouskasvua ja investointeja koko alueella."},{"instruction":"Shag.

Title: Disappointing Performance and Poor Battery Life Review: I purchased this smartphone a month ago, and I must say, it has been a rather disappointing investment. The main issues I've encountered are its poor performance and a subpar battery life, which severely limit the usability of the phone. For a device that claims to have a powerful processor, I expected smoother performance and quicker loading times. However, the smartphone frequently lags when running multiple apps and tends to overheat after just a few minutes of gaming, which is frustrating. Moreover, the battery life is far from satisfactory. With normal usage, the phone barely lasts an entire day without needing a recharge. This has forced me to carry a power bank at all times, which is quite inconvenient. The camera quality is passable, but nothing impressive when compared to competitor models in the same price range. Low-light photography is especially disappointing, and the images often come out looking grainy and poorly lit. I would not recommend this smartphone to anyone seeking an efficient device with a good battery life. If there's any room for improvement, the manufacturer should address the performance issues and enhance the battery life in future models. I'm definitely considering switching to a different brand for my next purchase. Overall, a less-than-satisfying experience with this smartphone."},{"instruction":"Tweet: @yeshenia sounds like a good idea Predict the sentiment of this tweet.

Given the sentence \\"A person wearing a brown outfit and large cone shaped hat sitting on stairs with plates of red items.\\" is it true that \\"A man in a dunce's cap gives out red cupcakes to the people in his building.\\"?. Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"Step 1: Identify key elements from the original sentence. Original sentence: \\"A person wearing a brown outfit and large cone shaped hat sitting on stairs with plates of red items.\\" Key elements: - Person - Brown outfit - Large cone-shaped hat - Sitting on stairs - Plates of red items Step 2: Identify key elements from the statement to be evaluated. Statement: \\"A man in a dunce's cap gives out red cupcakes to the people in his building.\\" Key elements: - Man - Dunce's cap - Gives out red cupcakes - People in the building Step 3: Compare the key elements. - Person vs. man - Brown outfit vs. dunce's cap - Large cone-shaped hat vs. dunce's cap - Sitting on stairs vs. gives out red cupcakes - Plates of red items vs. red cupcakes Step 4: Analyze the comparison results. - The original sentence does not specify the gender of the person, so \\"person\\" vs. \\"man\\" might be true. - A dunce's cap is typically cone-shaped, so the large cone-shaped hat could potentially be a dunce's cap. Brown outfit is a separate piece of information that doesn't contradict the dunce's cap claim. - The activity mentioned in the original sentence (sitting on stairs) does not match the statement (giving out red cupcakes). - The red items described in the original sentence could potentially be red cupcakes, but it's not specified. Conclusion: The statement \\"A man in a dunce's cap gives out red cupcakes to the people in his building\\" isn't completely true based on the original sentence. There isn't enough information to confirm if the person is a man, giving out red cupcakes, and interacting with people in the building. The only similarities are the large cone-shaped hat (possibly a dunce's cap) and the mention of red items (possibly red cupcakes)."},{"instruction":"Here is some data about a restaurant: name = Taste of Cambridge, eatType = coffee shop, food = Fast food, area = city centre, familyFriendly = yes, near = Crowne Plaza Hotel.

For many, their substance of choice is beer - a seemingly harmless, widely-available drink that often fosters social bonding. However, it is important not to overlook the detrimental impact that excessive beer consumption can have on one's physical, emotional, and psychological health. In this article, we explore the various motivating factors that can lead an individual to quit drinking beer, effective methods to overcome this addiction, and valuable tips on maintaining sobriety in the long term. Step 1: Identify Your Reasons for Quitting The first and foremost step in the journey toward quitting beer is to recognize and contemplate your motivations. People quit for a myriad of reasons - a few of the most common being health concerns, financial woes, and strained relationships. Take some time to weigh the costs and benefits, and identify your grounds for quitting. Jot down these reasons on a piece of paper or a digital document. Cementing these motivators in writing creates a crucial reference point when the process gets challenging. Step 2: Consult a Medical Professional Before taking any definitive action, schedule an appointment with your doctor. They will be able to provide tailored guidance based on your personal health and medical history. Additionally, they might suggest effective interventions like therapy, medication, or support groups that can significantly increase your odds of successfully quitting. Step 3: Develop a Well-Crafted Plan Having established your reasons for quitting and obtained professional advice, the next step is to develop a comprehensive plan. This blueprint should encompass your long-term and short-term goals, coping mechanisms, and support networks. Remember, your plan should be realistic, structured, and flexible. A few elements to include in your plan: - A quit date: This creates accountability and demonstrates commitment to the process. - Triggers: Making a list of activities or places that could spark cravings will help keep you prepared. - Replacement activities: Substitute beer drinking with healthier habits such as exercising, reading, or learning a new skill. - Accountability measures: Engage in regular check-ins with a therapist, counselor, or trusted friend. Place your quitting plan somewhere visible to serve as a constant reminder and motivation. Step 4: Track Your Progress In the pursuit of sobriety, maintaining a record of your progress can be essential. Monitoring daily or weekly milestones will not only provide you with valuable insight but also create a sense of pride in your accomplishments. This accountability tool can be in the form of a journal, spreadsheet, or a mobile app specifically designed to track progress. Step 5: Build a Support Network Finally, it is crucial to have a strong support system to rely on as you navigate the challenges of quitting. By confiding in friends, family, or a professional, you create an environment where sharing experiences, doubts, and achievements is encouraged. The camaraderie established through mutual understanding and support can make this journey less daunting and more rewarding. Conclusion The decision to quit drinking beer is a courageous and commendable one. It requires dedication, motivation, self-awareness, and effective planning. By following the steps outlined above, you will be better equipped to confront and eventually conquer your addiction. Remember, setbacks are a part of the process, but with persistence and support, you can achieve long-term sobriety and reap the numerous benefits that come with it."},{"instruction":"Possible answers: a).

Never used their Forensics degree.; d). not enough information; Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: The First of March is my most hated day of the year. Every year, without fail, I feel a little bit depressed on the First of March. I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies. Once the body parts have been harvested, they are stored in Formaldehyde to be preserved.

(CNN) -- Congratulations, Jimmy Fallon. You've won the \\"Tonight Show.\\" You start Monday. Now, what are you going to do with it? A lot is riding on the answer -- especially viewers. Jay Leno hosted \\"Tonight,\\" the jewel of NBC's late-night lineup, for 22 years, and though he was regularly criticized for lacking the comedic sting and interviewing skills of rival David Letterman, he topped the ratings for almost his entire run. On the other hand, Conan O'Brien, who held the job for just nine months in 2009-10, was quickly removed when his numbers didn't measure up to his sometimes out-there humor. Also, for some viewers, not to mention the news media, there's still the shadow of the Big Man, the long-time king of \\"Tonight,\\"","output":"Johnny Carson. Carson reigned over the late-night landscape for 30 years, retiring in 1992.

With a mix of innovation and a nod to tradition, Fallon succeeds in making \\"The Tonight Show\\" his own, while still capturing the respect and admiration of the show's long-time fans. His comedic prowess, natural engaging presence, and talent for viral-friendly segments allow him to appeal to a broader, younger audience, while maintaining the show's signature elements. Fallon's \\"Tonight Show\\" retains the iconic monologue and interviewing formats which were staples of the program since the days of Carson, but with Fallon's distinctive brand of humor. His monologues blend current events, pop culture references, and self-deprecating jokes in a way that both captivates and entertains the audience. Similarly, his interviews are known for their engaging and lighthearted nature, which, though different from Carson's and Leno's styles, are welcomed by viewers. Additionally, Fallon introduces a number of new segments, such as \\"Lip Sync Battle,\\" \\"Thank You Notes,\\" \\"Tight Pants\\" and \\"Wheel of Musical Impressions,\\" which become immensely popular and draw in millions of views on YouTube, garnering a more diverse audience beyond traditional television viewers. He often engages his celebrity guests in these fun and memorable activities, effectively humanizing them and breaking away from the typical Q&A format, making each episode fresh and interesting. Fallon incorporates live music performances, rekindling \\"The Tonight Show\\" audience's appreciation for musical guests. With the Roots as the show's house band, their unique influence on the musical component of the show gives Fallon yet another edge in the competitive world of late-night television. As Fallon's tenure on \\"The Tonight Show\\" continues, his popularity and success grow, establishing him as a worthy successor to the likes of Johnny Carson and Jay Leno. The ratings remain consistently strong, proving that Fallon's relatability, humor, and digital-age approach to late-night TV resonate with modern audiences. In the end, Fallon brings a renewed sense of energy and excitement to \\"The Tonight Show,\\" solidifying his place in the echelon of great late-night television hosts. While he respectfully acknowledges the rich legacy of his predecessors, he also forges his own path, ushering in a new era of late-night television that continues to entertain and delight viewers of all ages.

The premise explicitly states \\"During a soccer game, two players jump up to headbutt the ball.\\" This definitely implies that there are at least two individuals participating in a game of soccer, therefore validating the hypothesis \\"Two players are playing soccer.\\" This statement is a direct scenario representing a game of soccer where two players are involved, which makes it clear that the players are participating to the extent of actively engaging in plays, such as trying to headbutt the ball, a common maneuver in the sport. This means that, within the context given, the hypothesis \\"Two players are playing soccer\\" is not only possible but factual. Soccer is a team sport that requires multiple players, and the premise provided outlines an event that could only happen in such a context. Therefore, based on the premise, we can concretely confirm the hypothesis as the actions described in the premise (jumping up to headbutt the ball) sufficiently validate the hypothesis. These actions clearly demonstrate an ongoing soccer match, thus establishing that at least two individuals are actively contributing to this game. It's important to note that the validity of the hypothesis from the premise provided relies heavily on the understanding of the game mentioned. Soccer, by its nature, is a sport that involves multiple players, with two as the bare minimum for a very simplified version of the game. Furthermore, the action of headbutting the ball is unique to soccer and certain other sports, hence further supporting the claim that the players in the premise are indeed playing soccer. In conclusion, given that the premise is true, we can directly connect the actions described back to the hypothesis \\"Two players are playing soccer,\\" hence confirming it as true."},{"instruction":"Generate a short summary this sentence: the rapid spread of large-scale industrial livestock production focused on a narrow range of breeds is the biggest threat to the world 's farm animal diversity , according to a report presented on thursday to the commission on genetic resources for the un food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- .

There are more than 4,000 people of 48 nationalities. However, all of the people live underground! Coober Pedy was established in 1915, following the discovery of opals . The town is sometimes called the \\"opal capital of the world,\\" because it is the largest opal mining area in the world. Due to a desert climate , people came to realize that while working under the ground was easy, living above it was not. The solution was to move underground, by changing old mines into homes and establishing the world's first and most likely, only underground town. As years have gone by, the homes have become bigger. There are now also some hotels for tourists. They come from all over the world just to see this unusual town. Coober Pedy is probably best known for its unique style of underground living. While the structures may be located underground, they are in no way worse than those that lie above. Not only do their walls have the color of beautiful red, but also the structures have all the modern equipment like walk-in closets, modern kitchens and televisions. And the town also has gift shops selling opal jewelry, a couple of museums and even a church! Besides, Coober Pedy is also a favourite among filmmakers. And it has appeared in a series of movies such as Pitch Black, Red Planet and Opal Dream. Question: Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?

Protests can take many different forms, from individual statements to mass demonstrations. Protesters may organize a protest as a way of publicly making their opinions heard in an attempt to influence public opinion or government policy, or they may undertake direct action in an attempt to directly enact desired changes themselves. Where protests are part of a systematic and peaceful campaign to achieve a particular objective, and involve the use of pressure as well as persuasion, they go beyond mere protest and may be better described as cases of civil resistance or nonviolent resistance. - In July 1972, William Whitelaw, the British government's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, granted Special Category Status (SCS) to all prisoners convicted of Troubles-related offences. This had been one of the conditions set by the Provisional IRA when they negotiated a meeting with the British Government to discuss a truce. - The blanket protest was part of a five-year protest during the Troubles by Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners held in the Maze prison (also known as \\"Long Kesh\\") in Northern Ireland. The republican prisoners' status as political prisoners, known as Special Category Status, had begun to be phased out in 1976. Among other things, this meant that they would now be required to wear prison uniforms like ordinary convicts. The prisoners refused to accept that they had been administratively designated as ordinary criminals, and refused to wear the prison uniform. - The dirty protest (also called the no wash protest) was part of a five-year protest during the Troubles by Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners held in the Maze Prison (also known as \\"Long Kesh\\") and a protest at Armagh Women's Prison in Northern Ireland. - Patrick \`\` Paddy '' Agnew ( born 8 March 1955 ) is a former IRA volunteer and was elected to Dáil Éireann during the 1981 Irish hunger strike . Agnew was born in Dundalk , County Louth , Ireland in 1955 . His grandfather , was also an Irish republican and an internee during the Irish War of Independence . Agnew was imprisoned at Portlaoise , Mountjoy , Crumlin Road and the H - Blocks of Long Kesh . He was involved in the blanket protest in the H - Blocks . Although he was not on hunger strike , he was elected as a Teachta Dála ( TD ) for the Louth constituency at the 1981 general election , topping the poll . He did not take his seat . This was along with Kieran Doherty , who was elected in Cavan -- Monaghan and died on hunger strike . Agnew was released from prison in 2000 and joined the Gerard Halpenny Sinn Féin cumann in Dundalk , where he remains an active member of the party . - A hunger strike is a method of non-violent resistance or pressure in which participants fast as an act of political protest, or to provoke feelings of guilt in others, usually with the objective to achieve a specific goal, such as a policy change. Most hunger strikers will take liquids but not solid food. - The Troubles is the common name for the ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century. Also known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict, it is sometimes described as a \\"guerrilla war\\" or \\"low-level war\\". The conflict began in the late 1960s and is usually deemed to have ended with the Good Friday \\"Belfast\\" Agreement of 1998. Although the Troubles mainly took place in Northern Ireland, violence spilled over at times into parts of the Republic of Ireland, England and mainland Europe. - The 1981 Irish hunger strike was the culmination of a five-year protest during The Troubles by Irish republican prisoners in Northern Ireland. The protest began as the blanket protest in 1976, when the British government withdrew Special Category Status for convicted paramilitary prisoners. In 1978, after a number of attacks on prisoners leaving their cells to \\"slop out\\", the dispute escalated into the dirty protest, where prisoners refused to leave their cells to wash and covered the walls of their cells with excrement. In 1980, seven prisoners participated in the first hunger strike, which ended after 53 days. - Northern Ireland (; Ulster Scots: \\"\\") is a top-level constituent unit of the United Kingdom in the northeast of Ireland.

Think slowly and carefully, before giving your answer.","output":"To answer whether Ivan the Terrible used the Byzantine calendar, let's first consider the context of his reign and the prevalent calendars used during that time. 1. Ivan the Terrible (Ivan IV Vasilyevich) was the Grand Prince of Moscow and later the Tsar of All the Russias from 1547 until his death in 1584. 2. The Byzantine calendar, also known as the \\"Creation Era of Constantinople\\" or the \\"Era of the World,\\" was the official calendar of the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Byzantine Empire, which began its count at the date of the creation of the world, calculated as September 1, 5509 BC. 3. The Byzantine Empire fell in 1453, almost a century before Ivan IV became Tsar. Despite this, the Eastern Orthodox Church continued to use the Byzantine calendar for religious purposes. 4. Russia, during Ivan the Terrible's reign, was an Eastern Orthodox Christian country with strong cultural and religious ties to Byzantium before the latter's fall. Therefore, it is plausible that the Byzantine calendar was present in Russia during Ivan's time. 5. However, it is crucial to note that between the 14th and 15th centuries, Russia adopted the Julian calendar for civil matters, which was more aligned with the Western Christian world. Based on these points, it is likely that Ivan the Terrible was familiar with the Byzantine calendar because of Russia's ties to the Eastern Orthodox Church. However, it is important to note that the Julian calendar was the one predominantly used for civil matters during his reign."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this \\"Cast on Knit all of the stitches in the first row.

A versatile and attractive pattern, the stockinette stitch ruffle adds depth and character to any project. In this article, we will provide you with a step-by-step guide to mastering this simple yet effective technique. **Step 1: Cast on** The first step in creating a stockinette stitch ruffle is to cast on the desired number of stitches onto your knitting needles. This will lay the foundation for your project, ensuring that it starts off with the right dimensions. Make sure to use the appropriate yarn and needle size recommended for your specific pattern. **Step 2: Knit the first row** Once you have cast on your stitches, begin to knit the first row. To do so, simply knit all the stitches across the entire row. This will create a smooth and even base for your stockinette stitch ruffle pattern to take shape. **Step 3: Purl the second row** After completing the first row of knit stitches, proceed to purl all stitches in the second row. Purling, which is essentially the reverse of knitting, creates a distinct texture in your project, effectively establishing the stockinette stitch pattern. **Step 4: Continue alternating rows** To achieve the full stockinette stitch ruffle effect, continue to alternate between rows of knit stitches and purl stitches. Repeating this pattern will cause your piece to develop its signature ruffled appearance, which can be as subtle or as dramatic as you desire. **Step 5: Decrease the stitches for a finished edge** Once you have reached the desired length for your project, it is time to create a finished edge. To do this, knit 2 together (k2tog) and purl 2 together (p2tog) all the way across the row. By decreasing the number of stitches in this manner, you will form a neater and more polished edge for your creation. **Step 6: Complete your project** Continue working rows of either knit or purl stitches, depending on the pattern you are following, until your project is complete. Once finished, bind off your work and weave in any loose ends. Be sure to block your piece if necessary, as this will help to even out the ruffles and provide a more professional finish. In conclusion, the stockinette stitch ruffle is an attractive and versatile addition to any knitting project. By following these simple steps, even novice knitters can create stunning and unique pieces that are sure to be cherished for years to come. So, gather your yarn and knitting needles, and embark on an exciting new knitting journey with the stockinette stitch ruffle."},{"instruction":"What is the most logical next event?

In a competitive environment, you can't depend on the other team to use one kind of shot. If you feel like you've mastered certain blocks but other players are still getting shots past you, it is likely you haven't taken all possible shots into account yet. Here are some common shots to look out for: A jump shot is the most common shot. To gain height, offensive players will jump in the air and throw the ball towards the net. A slam dunk is the most efficient shot in basketball. This is where an offensive player runs directly up the court, jumps up, and delivers it directly into the net. A fadeaway is an advanced shot where the offensive player will lean away from the net as he throws it in. This is done to avert the efforts of blocking players. It can be resisted by putting your arms in the predicted path of the basketball. A faked shot is where an offensive player lines up a shot but doesn't actually throw the ball. This is done for psychological reasons of tricking up the opposing team. Slam dunks are considered very risky shots, as it's difficult to get a proper block without incurring a foul call. If you do attempt to block a slam dunk, get in between the net and the other player and jump directly up, aiming your hand in the path of the ball. A fadeaway shot is where a shooting player will hop backwards as he throws the ball towards the hoop. This tactic is specifically geared to trick up a blocking player. To maximize your chances of blocking a fadeaway, jump up between the ball and the net and extend your hands towards the ball. Don't swing your arms unnecessarily around as you're blocking. This will incur a foul call. A significant part of blocking shots in basketball involves the proper use of jumping. Jumping is a muscle-based exercise, but it's not often seen as a primary workout focus for many players. Practice doing sets of vertical jumps, attempting to get as much force off the ground as you can. Next, add on to this exercise by holding barbells in each hand and jumping with them. This will increase the pressure on your legs, making them better-suited for jumping blocks when you play competitively. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article discusses the importance of accommodating a wide range of techniques for successful athletes, particularly focusing on basketball shots and how to block them. It covers various shots, including jump shots, slam dunks, fadeaways, and faked shots, and offers advice on how to effectively block these different attempts. Furthermore, the article emphasizes the significance of proper jumping techniques and suggests exercises to improve a player's jumping ability, like practising vertical jumps and incorporating weights to strengthen leg muscles for enhanced competitive performance. Overall, the article aims to help basketball players refine their skills by being aware of different shots and developing their physical abilities."},{"instruction":"Does the following sentence make sense? \\"Cucumbers originated in South Asia, but are now grown on most continents.\\" Options: - yes - no Let's think first.

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care.

When the entire British royal family is killed in a freak accident outside Buckingham Palace, Sir Cedric Willingham leads a search for any surviving heirs to whom to pass the crown. After days of researching, his team finally locates a living heir in the form of an American named Ralph Jones. Shortly after being fired from his job as a lounge singer in Las Vegas, Ralph is informed by Cedric's assistant private secretary Duncan Phipps that his grandmother Constance had an affair with the first Duke of Warren while working as a hotel waitress when the Duke was visiting the United States, resulting in Ralph having royal blood. Phipps provides further proof by showing Ralph a duplicate of the ring his grandmother used to wear that the Duke had given her. Ralph is flown to London, where Cedric gives him a crash course on royal etiquette. In only his second day as King, he goes to a strip club and meets Miranda Greene, an out-of-luck exotic dancer and aspiring fashion designer, and dares her to go out on a date with him if the British press proves his claim to the monarchy. Meanwhile, Lord Percival Graves is opposed to having an American on the throne and proposes to declare the reigning House of Wyndham at an end and replace it with the House of Stuart, of which he is patriarch. Prime Minister Geoffrey Hale states that Ralph's succession is legitimate unless he commits a grievous error. With this in mind, Graves bribes a cash-strapped Miranda to stir up controversy by having a public relationship with Ralph. Despite warnings by Cedric not to commit a mistake similar to that of King Edward VIII, Ralph sneaks out of the Palace to have a romantic date with Miranda at Hyde Park. The next day, Miranda returns the money to Graves, but he already has photographs of her with Ralph. In order to preserve Ralph's reputation, Miranda breaks up with him.

A step-by-step solution is:","output":"To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to examine and compare the information provided in both statements. First, let's break down the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: - A dog is white. - The dog is wearing a red tag. - There is brown on the left side of the dog's face. - The dog is jumping into the water. Hypothesis: - The dog needed to cool down in the water. Now let's analyze if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise in a step-by-step manner: Step 1: Check if the premise contains information about the dog's need to cool down. - The premise provides a description of the dog's appearance and the action of jumping into the water. However, it does not offer any information about the reason behind this action, such as the dog's need to cool down. Step 2: Examine if there's any implicit information in the premise that could link to the hypothesis. - The only relevant information from the premise is the dog jumping into the water. While this may indicate the dog's desire to swim or play, there is no explicit or implicit information suggesting that the dog needed to cool down. Step 3: Determine if the hypothesis cannot be false if the premise is true. - It is possible for the premise to be true, as we can easily imagine a white dog with brown on its face, wearing a red tag, and jumping into the water. Nevertheless, there could be various reasons for the dog's action. It might be chasing a toy, playing with another dog, or simply enjoying the water. Even if the premise is true, it does not necessarily indicate that the dog needed to cool down. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the hypothesis (\\"The dog needed to cool down in the water.\\") is not entailed by the premise (\\"A white dog wearing a red tag with brown on the left side of its face is jumping into the water.\\"). There is insufficient information provided in the premise to conclude that the dog's motive for jumping into the water was to cool down."},{"instruction":"Answer a question about this article: Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Jesus Christ began to rule in heaven as king of God's kingdom in October 1914, and that Satan was subsequently ousted from heaven to the earth, resulting in \\"woe\\" to humanity.

A former gas station, car dealership and dental school building are helping to transform central Johannesburg from a hotbed of crime to a hub for art. The repurposed buildings make up the Wits Art Museum, which opens Saturday as a showcase for African art. Built on the edge of the University of the Witwatersrand's campus in the South African city's bohemian Braamfontein district, the new museum has soaring glass windows and an open-air entry way. Along with Cape Town, with its South African National Gallery, and Harare, with the National Gallery of Zimbabwe, South Africa's commercial capital has had a longtime art-world presence. Its contemporary galleries are well regarded, and another museum in the city center—the Johannesburg Art Gallery, which opened in 1915—has a fine collection of modern South African artwork and lesser pieces by European masters, including Pablo Picasso and Claude Monet. The 5.4 million Wits project created 54,000 square feet of exhibition and teaching space—still modest compared with the two million square feet of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. The work was funded by the university and donors led by South Africa's Standard Bank Group Ltd., which contributed half the artworks. The gallery forecourt of the Wits Art Museum in Johannesburg. The museum bridges the traditional and modern. An initial installation by the South African visual artist Gavin Olivier uses tracking cameras, even at night, to project images onto the museum's front windows that react to the shape and movements of people within their range. \\"We want to engage people who come by when the gallery is closed, who are on the wrong side of the glass,\\" Mr. Olivier said. The museum will display rotating highlights from the university's 10,000-piece collection of African art, stretching from 16th-century Congolese pottery to contemporary works by William Kentridge, South Africa's most famous working artist and a Wits graduate. Many of the paintings reflect the political and cultural upheaval of South Africa's recent past. \\"Baggage,\\" by the Cape Town-based artist Randy Hartzenberg, is an abstract portrayal of the white-minority government's campaigns in the 1970s to force black, mixed-race and ethnically Indian South Africans into separate townships. Willem Boshoff's \\"The Purple Shall Govern\\" reproduces the lyrics from 49 anti-apartheid songs and slogans in Zulu and other indigenous languages across three large panels. English translation runs under each line in much smaller script. “Works include 16th-century Congolese pottery and paintings evoking apartheid. ” On a nearby wall hangs \\"Totem Figure,\\" a facial relief carved in wood and painted by Cecil Skotnes, who in the 1950s and 1960s presided over a Johannesburg artists' salon called Polly Street that became a training ground for many of South Africa's most influential painters and sculptors. Sculptures and cultural artifacts in the same room hark back to more traditional African forms—even as they reflect the continent's encounter with Europe as well. Carved wooden figurines from Ivory Coast and elsewhere in West Africa portray soldiers and policemen in colonial uniforms and pith helmets and even a Victorian lady, possibly a missionary's wife. \\"African art is often treated as coming from before the colonial past,\\" said senior curator Julia Charlton. \\"But this artwork reflects all those cross-references and influences.

Adults in the herd surround and protect the young, who are most vulnerable to predators. Q: Why do adult herbivores in a herd surround their young? A: Answer:","output":"Adult herbivores in a herd surround their young primarily to provide protection for the vulnerable offspring. Living in a group offers several advantages such as increased vigilance and defense against predators, as well as social interaction and support. By surrounding the young, adult herbivores create a physical barrier that makes it more difficult for predators to attack the weaker and less experienced members of the herd.

The character development in this movie is outstanding. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, portrays a man who is initially reserved and dejected, gradually becoming a symbol of hope and strength for his fellow inmates.

Both describe a man who is carrying boxes on his shoulders while walking past a building that has a Coca-Cola sign on it. However, there are slight differences in the phrasing and the implications that could be inferred from each statement. In the first statement, \\"A man carrying boxes on his shoulder is walking past a building with a Coca-Cola sign on it\\", the focus is on the man and his action of carrying boxes on his shoulder. The building with the Coca-Cola sign is mentioned as a secondary feature of the scene. This statement provides a clear and specific visual image of the man walking and the presence of a Coca-Cola sign on the building. The second statement, \\"A man with boxes on his shoulders walks past a Coca-Cola building\\", while expressing the same scenario, implies a slightly different focus. By using the term \\"Coca-Cola building,\\" it seems to emphasize more on the building with its association with Coca-Cola. This might lead one to think that the building itself is owned or operated by Coca-Cola, or that it is an iconic or important location related to the brand. In reality, it could just be a building that happens to have a sign featuring Coca-Cola. Furthermore, with this phrasing, the man carrying boxes and the action of walking past the building are presented together without the use of the present continuous tense, making it sound slightly more like a general observation than a specific, ongoing action. In summary, the underlying scenario in both statements is the same, involving a man carrying boxes on his shoulders and walking past a building that has a Coca-Cola sign. The differences in phrasing, however, slightly affect the focus and the possible implications in each case. The first statement emphasizes the man's action, while the second statement puts slightly more emphasis on the Coca-Cola association of the building."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer.

The question requires an understanding of what people would likely do after watching a successful performance that is considered as the go-to performance of the year. Step 2: Assess the options. Each of the given options can be evaluated based on how well they fit the context of the question. a) admiration: Although people might feel admiration for the play, admiration is not something you would physically 'stand and do'. b) applaud: This option represents a common reaction after watching a successful performance, as people often stand and clap as a sign of appreciation. c) make reservations: Making reservations is not something people would collectively do while standing at the end of a performance.

The term 'shareholder' refers to anyone who owns one or more shares in a company. These shareholders have a vested interest in the company's performance as they stand to gain or lose money based on the corporation's success or failure. They are the legal owners of the company and have invested their money into buying stocks with the hope of experiencing a return on their investment. Shares in a company represent ownership stake. When a person or an entity buys a share of stock in a company, that person or entity becomes a shareholder and thus a part-owner of that company. This ownership stake entitles them to a proportionate share of the company's profits, among other rights. The process of distributing dividends usually follows this sequence: 1. Earnings and Profits Calculation: The corporation will first determine its earnings and profits for a given financial period. 2. Board of Directors' Decision: The corporation's board of directors will then make a decision on whether to distribute these profits to shareholders and if so, how much should be distributed. This decision typically depends on a variety of factors, including the company's financial health, reinvestment needs, business plans, debt obligations, and more. 3. Announcement: Once a decision is made, the corporation will announce a dividend payout. This announcement will include information about the amount to be paid per share, the date of record (The date which determines who is entitled to receive the dividend), and the payment date. 4. Dividend Distribution: On the payment date, the corporation will distribute dividends to shareholders who are registered as the owners of the corporation's stock on the record date. The actual amount that a shareholder receives as dividends depends on the number of shares they own. If a company declares a 1 dividend and a shareholder owns 100 shares, that shareholder would receive 100. These dividends can be in the form of cash, additional shares of stock also known as stock dividends, or other property. Cash dividends are the most common, and shareholders typically need to pay taxes on the dividends they receive. It's significant to remember that not all corporations pay dividends to their shareholders. Sometimes, companies may choose to reinvest their profits back into the business in what we term retained earnings for potential growth and expansion or to fund their ongoing business operations, instead of distributing them as dividends. These are often younger or growth-oriented companies who need to reinvest their profits to continue their expansion efforts."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Made me download 4-5 times..

The Redskins started the game very well with Josh Wilson recovering a Danny Amendola fumble and returning it to the endzone for a 7-0 Redskins lead on the first snap of the game. St. Louis would fight back, however, and pick up a Greg Zuerlein 39-yard field goal to cut the Redskins advantage to 7-3. Washington would close the first quarter with a Robert Griffin III touchdown run to give the Redskins a 14-3 lead going into the second quarter. In the second, St. Louis continued to battle, as Zuerlein hit another field goal. However, on the Redskins' ensuing possession, Griffin III connected with Leonard Hankerson for a 68-yard strike on a play action pass, and the Redskins appeared to take firm control, with a 21-6 edge. However, St. Louis would prove resilient, led by Danny Amendola's 12 receptions in the first half, St. Louis pulled within 8 when Sam Bradford found the aforementioned Amendola to cut the Redskins' advantage to 21-13. Then, just before the half, Griffin threw his first career interception to Cortland Finnegan which set up Zuerlein's 42-yard field goal as the half ended to cut the lead to 21-16. In the third, momentum continued to swing St. Louis' way as Bradford found a wide open Brandon Gibson to give St. Louis its first advantage of the game. Griffin III continued to amaze as he found the endzone for a second time on the ground, and Washington ended the third quarter up 28-23. However, late in the third, for the second straight week, a Saverio Rocca punt was blocked, this time by St. Louis tight end Matthew Mulligan. To open the fourth, Bradford found Mulligan, and rookie Daryl Richardson scampered into the endzone for the two-point conversion, and St. Louis led 31-28. Washington was unable to get into position to tie the game, but had an opportunity late when Richardson fumbled and DeJon Gomes picked it up to give Washington the ball with less than three minutes to play. Washington drove the ball to the St. Louis 29, which would have set up a 46-yard field goal attempt by Billy Cundiff, but Josh Morgan was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct after he threw the ball at Cortland Finnegan, moving Washington back to the St. Louis 46, and making it a 62-yard field goal. Cundiff's attempt was wide right and well short of the distance, and St. Louis held on for the 31-28 win. With the loss, the Redskins fell to 1-1. Also, Washington fell to 2-3 in their last five games against St. Louis, dating back the 2008 NFL season. In that time, the Rams have compiled a 13-53 overall record.

The Monument to the Conquerors of Space, constructed in 1964, also includes Laika.

However, when it comes to telling stories that have the power to change minds and hearts, what better format than a song? In a groundbreaking move, a group of bold creators has come together to produce Pakistan's answer to 'Glee,' the famed American television series. This pioneering show will use songs to tackle topics like homosexuality and extremism, which are typically brushed under the carpet in the country. A Glimpse into the Show Taking inspiration from 'Glee,' a musical drama series that ran from 2009 to 2015, the Pakistani version promises to incorporate powerful performances and original songs. The storyline revolves around a group of talented but misunderstood misfits who come together to form a musical ensemble. Through triumphs and tribulations, the characters explore the complexities of sexuality, societal injustice, and radicalism in modern-day Pakistan. The creators of the Pakistani series have designed the show to speak to today's youth. By utilizing song and dance, young talents showcase their unique abilities, stimulating discussions and highlighting themes that might seem controversial. Hence, music becomes the primary vehicle in which the show drives crucial conversations while entertaining its viewers. Addressing Homosexuality The creators of the Pakistani 'Glee' wish to bring forth conversations surrounding homosexuality, a topic considered tabooin the South Asian country. By incorporating various LGBTQIA+ characters, the show aims at dismantling misconceptions and fostering empathy. The television series will share stories of acceptance, love, and self-discovery, presenting a fresh perspective on the LGBTQIA+ community's struggles in a predominantly conservative environment. Through the portrayal of numerous homosexual characters and their journeys, the show seeks to educate the masses on the unique challenges faced by the community in Pakistan. By addressing these issues through art, Pakistan's 'Glee' aims to create a safe space for viewers to discover and discuss these sensitive topics, building bridges of understanding and compassion. Tackling Extremism Apart from addressing homosexuality, the Pakistani 'Glee' will dive into the subject of extremism. The show will depict characters' struggles against radical ideologies that often result in violence and hatred. Music and drama will be used to challenge these extremist beliefs, promoting principles of unity, love, tolerance, and peace. This approach comes at a vital time, as the nation strives to reduce the prevalence of extremist perspectives. The storyline will offer alternative ways for young people to express their emotions and frustrations, spotlighting the potential for music and art to heal and transform. By presenting instances where characters confront and challenge these radical ideas, the series hopes to inspire a sense of responsibility within the viewers, particularly the youth. Expectations and Impact Given the controversial nature of the themes being addressed, it is no surprise that the creators of the Pakistani 'Glee' are preparing for potential backlash. However, they remain focused on their mission to generate conversations, dismantle prejudices, and create opportunities for dialogues around these themes. The success of the American 'Glee,' which championed important conversations surrounding sexuality, identity, and mental health, raises hopes for the Pakistani counterpart. With its fresh storyline and powerful performances, the show has the potential to make a lasting impact on the Pakistani television landscape. In conclusion, the bold approach taken by the creators of Pakistan’s answer to 'Glee' is a testament to their dedication to addressing sensitive topics through the medium of art. By using song and dance as vehicles for change, the series aims to build bridges, foster empathy, and challenge discrimination, steering the country towards a brighter future."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What does UNPO stand for?

Stream of thoughts:","output":"To determine whether the hypothesis \\"The race car is on fire\\" is entailed by the premise \\"A race car is smoking on the track,\\" we need to think about the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis step by step: 1. The premise states that a race car is smoking on the track. This information implies that there is some sort of issue with the race car, as smoke is usually a sign of a problem. 2. The hypothesis suggests that the race car is on fire. This is one possible explanation for the presence of smoke. However, it's important to note that there might be other explanations for smoke coming from a race car, such as engine overheating, a blown gasket, or a simple mechanical failure. 3. In order to determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to establish whether the presence of smoke necessarily means that the car is on fire. In this case, since there are other explanations for smoke coming from a race car, it's not guaranteed that the car is on fire. Conclusion: The hypothesis \\"The race car is on fire\\" is not necessarily entailed by the premise \\"A race car is smoking on the track.\\" The presence of smoke indicates that there may be a problem with the car, but it doesn't automatically mean that the car is on fire. More information would be needed to confirm or refute the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"Two men outside one working with a pole in hand.\\" can we conclude that \\"Two men work outside one with a pole in hand and the other carefully measuring their work.\\"?

Options: - corrupt - abandon - endanger - get hurt - bind A: endanger Explain how we arrive at this answer:","output":"We arrive at the answer \\"endanger\\" by considering the context and meaning of each option in relation to a precarious rescue situation: 1. \\"Corrupt\\": In the context of a rescue, corrupt doesn't make much sense as it generally refers to dishonest or fraudulent conduct. It is not directly relevant to the potential outcomes of a precarious rescue. 2. \\"Abandon\\": Although someone might be abandoned during a precarious rescue, it is not a direct consequence of being involved in the rescue itself. The act of abandonment would be a separate decision made by other people involved. 3. \\"Endanger\\": This option is the most relevant to a precarious rescue because a precarious situation generally involves significant risk or danger. Anyone involved in such a rescue would be at risk themselves or potentially contribute to the risk faced by others, depending on the circumstances. 4. \\"Get hurt\\": While it is possible that someone involved in a precarious rescue could get hurt, this option is not definitive. Although getting hurt may be a potential risk, it is not an inevitable outcome. 5. \\"Bind\\": In the context of a rescue, bind is not directly relevant as it typically refers to tying or restraining something.

The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand. contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who turned to musical journalism after a failed student career in Oxford and London?, what is it ?

Question: what is considered the ultimate expression of compassion?

The practice of taking refuge on behalf of young or even unborn children is mentioned in the Majjhima Nikaya, recognized by most scholars as an early text (cf. Infant baptism). Tibetan Buddhism sometimes adds a fourth refuge, in the lama. In Mahayana, the person who chooses the bodhisattva path makes a vow or pledge, considered the ultimate expression of compassion.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? + no; + yes;","output":"The phrase 'IR recovers only 57% of cost of travel on an average' on the IRCTC website booking page refers to the idea that the Indian Railways (IR) recoup just around 57% of the total expenses incurred in providing transportation services to passengers. This means that the revenue generated from ticket fares is not sufficient enough to cover the complete costs of operating the train service, including factors like maintenance, staffing, fuel, and other necessary expenditures. As a result, the Indian Railways continues to provide its services with a certain degree of subsidy and financial support from the government. The primary reason for the under-recovery of costs is to make train travel more affordable and accessible to the majority of the Indian population, specifically those who may not be able to afford the full cost of the service. By doing so, the Indian Railways can ensure that more people have access to transportation, promoting growth and connectivity throughout the nation. Regarding the average cost of a book, it is not directly related to the context of the IRCTC statement. The cost of a book is influenced by multiple factors like the size, genre, the number of pages, the quality of the paper, author royalties, and the publisher's expenditures on production, marketing, and distribution. The average cost of a book greatly varies based on these factors and the region or country it is being sold in.

For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again.

In order to keep up appearances, Chafuka has Barry, who is otherwise unable to speak, continue performing his news broadcasts by controlling him with a voodoo doll, while Dulcie continues to investigate the drug ring with the help of incompetent police detective Jordan Penrose. Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies. On seeing his zombified former henchmen, Nolan panics and takes refuge with the station's owner, Alex Cavanaugh, who it turns out is the mastermind behind the drug ring. He takes Dulcie and Jordan hostage and has Nolan drive them to safety, while Barry, Chafuka and the zombie henchmen give chase. During the course of the chase Dulcie and Jordan are rescued, and then Nolan loses control of the car, with both he and Cavanaugh being killed in the resulting crash. Chafuka turns Cavanaugh and Nolan into zombies and then takes full control of the station, with Barry continuing as lead anchor after his original personality fully returns, and Jordan quitting the police to become the station's head of security, with the zombie Nolan and his henchmen becoming security guards.

Article: Two Chinese farmers who became an overnight hit when their heart-rending version of a famous pop song appeared on the Internet took to the stage in front of thousands of fans in Shanghai last Saturday. Wang Xu, 44,and Liu Gang, 29, sang \\"In the Spring\\" alongside the song's star composer Wang Feng, in front of about 80,000 people at the Shanghai Stadium. The audience buzzed with excitement and let out deafening cheers, the moment as they were introduced on the stage and then when Liu started the first sentence of their parts of the song. The two migrant workers became stars after singing the tearjerker song during an evening drinking session in a 6-square-meter rented room in a late August evening. A friend recorded the performance on a cell phone and posted it on the Internet. \\"If someday I am dead, please bury me in the spring,\\" they sing. Wang's penetrating chorus, delivered with his eyes closed, has moved thousands to tears. Wang and Liu consider the song a true portrait of lower-class groups like themselves. \\"With no credit card, no girlfriend, or a home with hot water, but only a guitar, I am singing happily, on streets, under bridges or in wild country, though nobody pays attention to the music,\\" they sing. To support his wife and two sons, Wang came to Beijing in 2000 from the countryside and has worked as a boiler man, and street peddler, before becoming a medical warehouse keeper, with a monthly pay of around 1,500 yuan. Little is left after he pays 600 yuan for rent and buys food. Liu came to Beijing in 2002. \\"I wanted to try my luck in the big city, \\" he said. He had worked as a guard, roadside peddler, and porter, but never had a stable job. Street performing was his main income, even after he married and became a father three years ago. Wang and Liu are still uncertain where their fame will lead. Wang has started learning to use a computer. They even have a micro blog account to communicate with fans.

Having raised the money for this film on his own, Lloyd wrote this script together with Theodore Gershuni in 1970 and in hindsight regrets having listened to advice to have Gershuni else direct the film instead of doing it himself. But back then he was still inexperienced in the business and it is probably because of decisions like these that he takes no nonsense from anyone anymore. Indeed it would have been interesting to see Lloyd's version of his own script - as one of the world's most original, daring, experimental and non-compromising directors he probably would have given it even more edge than it already has. But as it is we have the Gershuni-directed film. And weather it is due to the strong script, or the fact that he too is indeed quite a director of his own, SUGAR COOKIES is a very intelligent, highly suspenseful and well-crafted motion picture that deserves a lot more attention than it receives. The shoestring budget the small studio (this was even before Kaufman and his friend and partner for over 30 years now, Michael Herz, formed Troma) had to work with is so well handled that the film looks a lot more expensive, indeed does not have a \\"low budget\\" look at all. The story revolves around lesbian Camilla Stone (played by enigmatic Mary Woronow) and her lover who winds up dead through circumstances I won't reveal not to spoil a delightful story. This leads to a succession of plot-twists, mind games and personality reform that is loosely inspired by Hitchcock's Vertigo and at least as inventive. The atmosphere is a lot grimmer, though, and some comparisons to Nicholas Roeg's and Donald Cammell's PERFORMANCE come to mind. In this mix is a very original and inventive erotic laden thriller that keeps it quite unclear as to how it is all going to end, which, along with a splendidly interwoven sub-plot with a nod to Kaufman's earlier and unfortunately unavailable BIG GUSS WHAT'S THE FUSS, makes for a very exciting one-and-a-half-hour. Certainly one of the best films in Troma's library, and yet again one of those films that defy the curious fantasy that their catalog is one of bad taste. The DVD includes some recent interviews Kaufman conducts with Woronov and the other leading lady Lynn Lowry (later seen in George Romero's THE CRAZIES), thus giving some interesting insight in what went on during the making of this cult-favorite and a few hints of what would be different had Lloyd directed it himself.

He is frequently ridiculed by everyone around him, except for his Jack Russell Terrier Milo, and his co-worker and best friend Charlie Schumaker. Meanwhile, gangster Dorian Tyrell, owner of the Coco Bongo nightclub, plots to overthrow his boss Niko. One day, Tyrell sends his singer girlfriend Tina Carlyle into Stanley's bank to record its layout, in preparation to rob the bank. Stanley is attracted to Tina, and she seems to reciprocate. After being denied entrance to the Coco Bongo, he finds a wooden mask near the city's harbor. Placing it on his face transforms him into a zoot-suited, green-faced, bizarre trickster known as the Mask, who is able to cartoonishly alter himself and his surroundings at will. Stanley scares off a street gang that attempts to rob him by turning a balloon into a Tommy gun, and then he exacts revenge on his tormentors; he scares his grouchy landlady, and injures the con-artist repairmen who did unnecessary work on his car and charged him for it. The next morning, Stanley encounters detective Lieutenant Kellaway and newspaper reporter Peggy Brandt investigating the Mask's activity of the previous night. To attend Tina's performance, he again becomes the Mask to raid the bank, inadvertently foiling Tyrell's plan in the process.

Following a confrontation with Tyrell for disrupting the bank robbery, Stanley flees leaving behind a scrap of cloth from his suit that transforms back into his pajamas, while Tyrell is arrested by the police as a suspect for the bank robbery.

A tropical storm warning was issued for parts of North Carolina as the first named storm of the season was expected to strengthen to a hurricane and skim the Outer Banks, a string of narrow barrier islands prone to flooding but popular for beachgoers, as a category one hurricane Friday. Wednesday's warning stretched across the entire North Carolina coast, from Little River Inlet near South Carolina north to the Virginia border. A tropical storm watch for Florida's east coast was canceled. The worst of the storm should occur at Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, around dawn on Friday, with 3 to 5 inches of rain and sustained winds up to 85 mph, said Tony Saavedra, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, prompting officials to order a mandatory evacuation of the Island. Home to the famous Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, the island is a narrow spit of land, and the two-lane North Carolina highway 12 is the only way to the mainland other than ferries to the south. Twice in recent years, storm-driven waves have closed the highway. A voluntary evacuation was announced earlier for the Outer Banks' Ocracoke Island, which is accessible only by ferry. The storm should then move through quickly and be off the coast of New England later in the day, perhaps making landfall in Canada's maritime provinces as a tropical storm, he said. The motel Shutters on the Banks in Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, was completely booked for the holiday weekend, general manager John Zeller said on Tuesday, but he was considering waiving cancellation fees if the storm continued to track toward the area. \\"We have received some cancellations but not too many,\\" he said. \\"Basically we are telling people to kind of wait and see what happens. ... I think everybody is kind of watching the weather.\\" Late Wednesday morning, Arthur was about 105 miles (165km) east-northeast of Cape Canaveral and about 260 miles (420km) south-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. It was moving north about 7 mph (11kph) with maximum sustained winds of 6 mph (95 kph). About an hour north of Cape Canaveral, the Hilton Daytona Beach Oceanfront Resort's holiday reservations were unaffected by the storm, general manager Tom Manno said. \\"In fact we're sold out right through Sunday,\\" he said. \\"So we haven't experienced any cancellations at all.\\" But some precautions were taken at the hotel. \\"We've gone through all the emergency procedures, the staff is confident, and everything is in place,\\" Manno said. \\"Right now the weather is good, the winds are pretty calm, and we're hoping it will remain that way.\\" On Florida's Gulf Coast, the National Weather Service says dry air rotating around Arthur reduced rain chances in the Tampa Bay area. But as the storm moves north, the rain chances will return — just in time for the holiday weekend. On Hilton Head Island, on South Carolina's southern tip, there was little concern about Arthur — the storm was forecast to pass the island on Thursday well out at sea. \\"It's a very busy week on Hilton Head Island. ... It will be a sold-out weekend,\\" said Charlie Clark, a spokeswoman for the Hilton Head Island Chamber of Commerce. \\"We're expecting a strong weekend and we're not getting calls from visitors asking what's up with this storm.\\" Title:","output":"Tropical Storm Arthur Threatens Fourth of July Plans on East Coast"},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given two sentences in Persian separated with <sep>, and you have to determine whether the sentences are paraphrases or not.

Tak'alik Ab'aj (; Mayan pronunciation: [takˀaˈlik aˀ'ɓaχ] (listen); Spanish: [takaˈlik aˈβax]) is a pre-Columbian archaeological site in Guatemala. It was formerly known as Abaj Takalik; its ancient name may have been Kooja. It is one of several Mesoamerican sites with both Olmec and Maya features. The site flourished in the Preclassic and Classic periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD, and was an important centre of commerce, trading with Kaminaljuyu and Chocolá. Investigations have revealed that it is one of the largest sites with sculptured monuments on the Pacific coastal plain. Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, petroglyphs and others. The site has one of the greatest concentrations of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico.Takalik Abaj is representative of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions that are among the earliest from the Maya region. Excavation is continuing at the site; the monumental architecture and persistent tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was of some importance.Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico and imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that shifted over time but allowed the city to participate in a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador. Takalik Abaj was a sizeable city with the principal architecture clustered into four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural features, others were artificial constructions requiring an enormous investment in labour and materials. The site featured a sophisticated water drainage system and a wealth of sculptured monuments.","output":"The modern name of Kooja, as stated in the article, is Tak'alik Ab'aj. This is a pre-Columbian archaeological site located in Guatemala. It was formerly called Abaj Takalik and it is possible that its ancient name was Kooja. The site is particularly significant because it combines features of both Olmec and Maya cultures, making it one of several Mesoamerican locations possessing this unique mixture. Tak'alik Ab'aj thrived in the Preclassic and Classic periods, which span from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD. It served as an influential hub for commerce, establishing trade relations with places like Kaminaljuyu and Chocolá. Excavations revealed an extensive collection of sculptured monuments, making the site one of the largest of its kind on the Pacific coastal plain. Among these monuments are Olmec-style sculptures, a colossal head, petroglyphs and others, marking it as one of the locations having the highest concentration of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico. The site of Tak'alik Ab'aj not only carries historic value but also serves as an archaeological testament to the first flourishing of the Maya culture, which is presumed to have happened by around 400 BC. A Maya royal tomb and some of the earliest examples of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions are found here. Investigation is ongoing and the remarkable architectural monuments and persistent tradition of sculpture in various styles suggest the site held significant importance. Artifacts found on site also suggest that Tak'alik Ab'aj had contact with the distant city of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico and might have been conquered by it or its allies. The city had a system to participate in long-distance Maya trade routes, which, despite shifting over time, strongly connected this metropolis to a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador. Structurally, Tak'alik Ab'aj is a large city with four main groups of architectures spread across nine terraces. Some of these terraces are natural features while others are artificial constructions that would have required considerable investment in labor and materials. The site also featured a sophisticated water drainage system and a multitude of sculptured monuments, further underlining the cultural and historical significance of the city now known as Tak'alik Ab'aj, but possibly once called Kooja."},{"instruction":"Tällä en tarkoita vain taloudellista tukea.

Billy was all of these.\\" Context: Through the 1820s and the turn of the decade, American settlers kept up pressure on the US government to remove the Seminole from Florida to make way for their desired agricultural development. In 1832, a few Seminole chiefs signed the Treaty of Payne's Landing, by which they agreed to give up their Florida lands in exchange for lands west of the Mississippi River in Indian Territory. According to legend, Osceola stabbed the treaty with his knife, although there are no contemporary reports of this. Five of the most important Seminole chiefs, including Micanopy of the Alachua Seminole, did not agree to removal. In retaliation, the US Indian agent, Wiley Thompson, declared that those chiefs were deposed from their positions. As US relations with the Seminole deteriorated, Thompson forbade the sale of guns and ammunition to them. Osceola, a young warrior rising to prominence, resented this ban. He felt it equated the Seminole with slaves, who were forbidden to carry arms. Thompson considered Osceola to be a friend and gave him a rifle. Osceola had a habit of barging into Thompson's office and shouting complaints at him. On one occasion Osceola quarreled with Thompson who had the warrior locked up at Fort King for a two nights until he agreed to be more respectful. In order to secure his release, Osceola agreed to sign the Treaty of Payne's Landing and to bring his followers into the fort. After his humiliating imprisonment, Osceola secretly prepared vengeance against Thompson. On December 28, 1835, Osceola, with the same rifle Thompson gave him, killed Wiley Thompson. Osceola and his followers shot six others outside Fort King, while another group of Seminole ambushed and killed a column of US Army, over 100 troops, marching from Fort Brooke to Fort King, in what Americans called the Dade Massacre. These nearly simultaneous attacks began the Second Seminole War. Question: What attacks caused it? Answer:","output":"The attacks that caused the Second Seminole War were the killing of US Indian agent Wiley Thompson and six others by Osceola and his followers outside Fort King, and the ambush and killing of over 100 US Army troops marching from Fort Brooke to Fort King, in an event known as the Dade Massacre.

Together, they have provided football fans some of the most iconic moments and epic showdowns. Both teams have a rich history of championship success, fueled by their strong offensive prowess. In this article, we take a statistical dive to determine which of these two dominant teams have scored more offensive yards over the years. Historical Overview Before we delve into the data, it's crucial to note the defining periods for each team: 1. Dallas Cowboys: The Cowboys joined the NFL in 1960 as an expansion team. They quickly grew into a dominant force during the 1970s, with Hall of Fame coach Tom Landry leading the team. The Cowboys' most successful years came in the 1990s, under the leadership of coach Jimmy Johnson and players such as Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irvin. 2. San Francisco 49ers: The 49ers were established in 1946 as a member of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and joined the NFL in 1950. The team saw immense success in the 1980s and 1990s, primarily under the fantastic guidance of Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh and iconic players such as Joe Montana, Steve Young, and Jerry Rice. Comparing Offensive Yards In order to determine which team, the Cowboys or the 49ers, has scored more offensive yards, we will look at historical data. Due to the regular fluctuations in the NFL's scheduled games, ranging from 12-game seasons in the early years to the current 17-game schedule, it is necessary to break the data into intervals and then make comparisons. 1. Total Offensive Yards: When analyzing the entire history of both franchises, the Dallas Cowboys have gained a total of 637,375 offensive yards, averaging 5.57 yards per play. The San Francisco 49ers, on the other hand, have accumulated 653,990 offensive yards, averaging 5.40 yards per play. Thus, the 49ers hold a slight advantage in total offensive yards. 2. Offensive Performance in Specific Periods: To offer a more comprehensive comparison, we should also evaluate each franchise's performances during their respective golden eras. By doing so, we can better understand each team's offensive dominance in relation to their contemporaries. - 1970s and 1990s (Cowboys' Dominant Era): In these two decades, the Cowboys gained a remarkable 107,835 offensive yards in the 1970s and 59,731 yards in the 1990s. - 1980s and 1990s (49ers' Dominant Era): As for the 49ers, their most prolific offensive period occurred during the 1980s, when the team racked up 92,081 offensive yards. In the 1990s, they gained an impressive 60,722 yards. In analyzing these decades, the Cowboys enjoyed overall higher offensive yardage compared to the 49ers during their most successful years. Conclusion When considering the entire history of both franchises, the San Francisco 49ers have recorded more offensive yards. However, during the Cowboys' and 49ers' periods of dominance, it is the Cowboys who enjoyed superior offensive numbers. This analysis provides just a glimpse into the accomplishments of these outstanding franchises; both the Dallas Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers boast exceptional offensive achievements. As the NFL continues to evolve, fans can eagerly await to see whether these storied teams can surge ahead and once again reach the pinnacle of offensive excellence."},{"instruction":"Multi-choice question: Same meaning?

Valuable artwork from Stevens's private collection is also on board the jetliner, to be eventually displayed in his new museum. Such a collection motivates a group of thieves led by co-pilot Bob Chambers to hijack the aircraft. Once Captain Don Gallagher leaves the cockpit and is knocked unconscious, the hijackers' plans go into action. A sleeping gas, which one of the hijackers secretly installed before the flight, is released into the cabin and the passengers lose consciousness. Knocking out the flight engineer, Chambers moves forward with the hijacking, and Stevens' Flight 23 \\"disappears\\" into the Bermuda Triangle. Descending to virtual wave-top altitude, Flight 23 heads into a fog bank, reducing visibility to less than a mile. Minutes later, a large offshore drilling platform emerges from the haze, Flight 23 heading straight for it at nearly 600 knots. Chambers pulls back on the yoke in a banking left turn, but an engine clips the derrick and catches fire. Chambers immediately hits the fire extinguishing button, and the flames are momentarily extinguished. Because the aircraft is at such a low altitude, the sudden loss of airspeed threatens to stall the airplane. As the engine reignites, Chambers is forced to use another fire suppression bottle. But by this time, the aircraft stall alarm is activated and the aircraft's tail hits the water. All the passengers wake up, and realizing what is happening, most panic. Chambers is able to pull up, but the plane's right wing hits the water again. The plane lifts into the air for a moment, then hits the water. Because of the hard impact, the plane becomes grounded in the ocean and begins to sink. The ocean floor is above the crush depth of the fuselage. Many of the passengers are injured, some seriously.

The research team have discovered that subordinate fish voluntarily diet to avoid challenging their larger competitors.\\"In studying gobies we noticed that only the largest two individuals,a male and female,had breeding rights within the group,\\" explains Marian Wong.\\"All other group members are nonbreeding females,each being 5-10% smaller than its next largest competitor.We wanted to find out how they maintain this precise size separation.\\" The reason for the size difference was easy to see.Once a subordinate fish grows to within 5-10% of the size of its larger competitor,it causes a fight which usually ends in the smaller goby being driven away from the group.More often than not, _ is then eaten up. It appeared that the smaller fish were keeping themselves small in order to avoid challenging the boss fish.Whether they did so voluntarily,by restraining how much they ate,was not clear.The research team decided to do an experiment.They tried to fatten up some of the subordinate gobies to see what happened.To their surprise,the gobies simply refused the extra food they were offered,clearly preferring to remain small and avoid fights,over having a feast. The discovery challenges the traditional scientific view of how boss individuals keep their position in a group.Previously it was thought that large individuals simply used their weight and size to threaten their subordinates and take more of the food for themselves,so keeping their competitors small. While the habits of gobies may seem a little mysterious,Dr.Wong explains that understanding the relationships between boss and subordinate animals is important to understand how hierarchical societies remain stable.

Q: Article: Isn't it astonishing how much time we spend talking about food? \\"Have you ever eaten ...?\\" \\"What did you have for lunch?\\" and so on. And yet when you travel from one country to another, you will find that people have quite different feelings about food. People often feel that what they eat is normal and that what other people eat is strange or silly. In most parts of Asia, for example, no meal is complete without rice. In England, people eat potatoes every day. In the Middle East, bread is the main part of every meal. Eating like so many things we do, becomes a habit which is difficult to change. Americans like to drink a lot of orange juice and coffee. The English drink tea four or five times every day. Australians drink a great deal of beer, and the French drink wine every day. The sort of meat people like to eat also differs from one country to another. Horse meat is thought to be delicious in France. In Hong Kong, some people enjoy eating snakes. New Zealanders eat sheep, but they never eat goat meat. The Japanese don't like to eat sheep meat because of its smell, but they enjoy eating raw fish .

No, but foolish regulators are\\"","output":"Title: Is Cheese Aged on Wood Boards Unsafe? No, But Foolish Regulators Are Step 1: Introduce the issue of cheese aging on wood boards. Purpose: To present the topic of the article and attract readers' attention, as well as establish why it is important. Introduction: Cheese, a beloved staple in many households around the world, has been produced for thousands of years through various methods, including the process of aging on wood boards. Recently, however, concerns have been raised regarding the safety of this traditional practice, with some regulators going so far as to deem such cheeses \\"unsafe\\" for consumption. Step 2: Present evidence that supports the safety of aging cheese on wood boards. Purpose: To debunk the claim that cheese aged on wood boards is unsafe and provide readers with a well-rounded perspective. Contrary to the concerns of some regulators, numerous studies have demonstrated that aging cheese on wood boards is a perfectly safe practice, as long as proper maintenance and sanitation procedures are followed. Wood, by its very nature, has antimicrobial properties that can actually help to keep harmful bacteria at bay. Moreover, traditional cheesemakers worldwide have been using wooden boards for centuries, resulting in high-quality, delicious, and most importantly, safe cheeses. Step 3: Detail the issues with current regulation and how it hinders the cheese industry. Purpose: To highlight the impact of misguided regulations on cheese production and expose the real issue at hand. The misplaced fear surrounding wooden boards for cheese aging has led some regulators to impose strict and unnecessary measures on cheesemakers. Such overburdensome regulations not only hinder an artisanal craft that has stood the test of time but can also negatively impact small businesses, forcing them to bear the financial burden of conforming to these baseless regulations. Furthermore, less experienced regulators may fail to differentiate between harmful bacteria and beneficial microorganisms involved in cheese production, leading to the destruction of essential elements in the cheese-aging process. Step 4: Explain the need for a more balanced and informed approach to cheese safety. Purpose: To offer a solution to the issue at hand and emphasize the need for collaboration between regulators and industry professionals. Rather than giving in to fear and advocating for the outright ban of cheese aged on wood boards, it is essential for regulators and industry professionals to work together and have a well-informed discussion on the subject. By fostering a mutually respectful dialogue, both sides can recognize the need for a balanced approach to cheese production, which weighs the preservation of traditional methods against any valid safety concerns. Step 5: Conclude the article with a reaffirmation of the key message. Purpose: To reiterate the main argument and leave a lasting impression on readers. In conclusion, it is evident that cheese aged on wood boards is not inherently unsafe, and misguided regulators should not allow their fears to determine the fate of an age-old tradition. Instead, embracing collaboration and open discussion between regulators and industry experts will ensure that the love of cheese carries on safely for generations to come."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: A text is given in Malayalam.

Given these facts, what makes temperature vary among the following options: - it's state - voltage - wind - seasons - fever - Summer - sweating - sun's heat The answer is:","output":"Temperature varies among the following options primarily due to sun's heat, wind, and seasons. 1. Sun's heat: The sun is the primary source of heat for the Earth, and its energy impacts the temperature in various ways. The angle of the sun's rays determines how much heat is received in a particular area; the more direct the sunlight, the warmer the area becomes. The distribution of sunlight across the planet leads to temperature variations. 2. Wind: Wind can impact temperature by moving warmer or cooler air masses into an area. For example, when warmer air from lower altitudes rises, it can cause the temperature to increase in higher altitudes. Similarly, winds can bring colder air from higher altitudes down to lower altitudes, causing the temperature to decrease. Wind can also impact the perceived temperature or \\"wind chill\\" by increasing the rate at which heat is lost from the human body. 3. Seasons: Seasons are determined by the Earth's tilt on its axis and its orbit around the sun. During summer months, the Earth is tilted towards the sun, allowing sunlight to directly strike a particular hemisphere, leading to an increase in temperature. In winter months, the Earth is tilted away from the sun, causing sunlight to strike the hemisphere at a more indirect angle, leading to colder temperatures. Spring and autumn are transition periods between the warm and cold seasons. The other options in the list are not primary factors causing temperature to vary, but rather are reactions to or consequences of temperature changes. - State: It is not a factor causing temperature variations but refers to physical states of matter, such as solid, liquid, or gas, which can be affected by temperature changes. - Voltage: It is an electrical potential difference and does not directly impact temperature variations. - Fever: A fever is a symptom of an illness and a higher-than-normal body temperature, not a cause of environmental temperature variation. - Summer: Summer is a season and is included in the explanation above. - Sweating: Sweating is a physiological response to regulate body temperature and does not affect the environmental temperature. Overall, temperature variations are mainly caused by the sun's heat, wind, and seasons."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"A young person diving to make a catch during a game of ultimate frisbee.\\" can we conclude that \\"The person is sleep without her earrings.\\"?

In light of the escalating tensions and possibility of a war in Iraq, the ICRC is taking necessary measures to address and mitigate the adversities caused by terrorism and armed conflicts. Step 1: Assess the situation To get a better understanding of the current security landscape, the ICRC is closely monitoring the political developments and the emergence of new terrorism threats. By staying informed and working in collaboration with local and international agencies, the organization is taking an evidence-based approach to evaluate the potential risk factors concerning armed conflicts and terrorist attacks around the world. Step 2: Adapt to change As the nature of conflicts evolves, the ICRC adapts its tactics and strategies to face these new challenges more effectively. With changes in warfare tactics, geopolitics, and emerging threats, the ICRC is developing new programs and protocols to respond to the evolving needs of the affected populations quickly. Step 3: Strengthen capacity To better serve the communities most threatened by terrorism, the ICRC is investing in expanding its network of skilled professionals and volunteers. By providing proper training and resources to its staff, the organization aims to equip them for rapid response in crisis situations while ensuring the safety and security of affected individuals. Step 4: Enhance partnerships Collaboration and partnership are vital to the ICRC’s mission in addressing complex humanitarian challenges. The organization is actively seeking and building partnerships with governments, NGOs, and other key stakeholders to share knowledge, resources, and expertise. These partnerships will help the ICRC effectively respond to looming threats of terrorism and escalating tensions in Iraq and beyond. Step 5: Communicate and advocate Raising awareness about the underlying causes and consequences of terrorism and armed conflicts is crucial. The ICRC continuously communicates its concerns to the public and relevant authorities to advocate for preventive measures and humane responses in crisis situations. This advocacy work creates a strong push for adopting a more proactive and responsible approach to security and humanitarian issues across the globe. As the potential implications of terrorism and a possible war in Iraq continue to grow, the ICRC remains committed to fulfilling its humanitarian mission and reducing the devastating impact of armed conflicts on innocent lives. Through systematic planning, constant monitoring, and adaptable measures, the organization hopes to contribute positively to the prevailing measures against terrorism and to ultimately save lives."},{"instruction":"Q: Which of the following two sentences does not make sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"The lion has hunted the zebra in the jungle.\\" - Sentence B: \\"The shark has hunted the zebra in the jungle.\\" Let's solve this gradually.","output":"To determine which sentence does not make sense, we need to analyze the elements of each sentence. Let's break down the two sentences. In Sentence A: \\"The lion has hunted the zebra in the jungle.\\" - The lion is an animal known to live in the jungle. - The zebra is an animal found in savannas or grasslands, but it's plausible that it could wander into a jungle. - Hunting behaviors are consistent with the lion's nature. In Sentence B: \\"The shark has hunted the zebra in the jungle.\\" - The shark is an aquatic animal and does not live in the jungle. - The zebra lives in savannas or grasslands, as stated before. - Sharks do hunt, but they typically hunt sea creatures, not land animals like zebras. Now comparing the two sentences, we can conclude that Sentence B: \\"The shark has hunted the zebra in the jungle.\\" does not make sense. The shark cannot hunt in the jungle as it is an aquatic animal and not a terrestrial one."},{"instruction":"CHAPTER NINE.

Maria was going to visit Patricia in Florida, but the humidity did not bother","output":"Maria; instead, it was the combination of several factors that made her reconsider her decision. Maria was going to visit Patricia in Florida, but the humidity did not bother her as much as the various other challenges she had to face and weigh against the anticipation of their reunion. First and foremost, Maria was anxious about the financial aspect of the trip, as airfare and accommodation prices were soaring during the peak travel season. She was also concerned about the costs that might incur while visiting popular tourist attractions or indulging in leisure activities, which Patricia had meticulously planned. Furthermore, Maria took into account the weather conditions in Florida, as hurricanes and torrential rainfall were not uncommon in those parts during certain times of the year. She worried about the potential disruption of her travel plans and the possibility of being stranded at the airport or indoors during her precious vacation days. These concerns ultimately fueled her apprehensions about the trip, significantly overshadowing the mere inconvenience of humidity. Another aspect that weighed heavily on Maria's decision-making process was her recent workload increase at her job. Taking time off had become increasingly difficult, and she worried that a week-long absence could impact her performance and potentially jeopardize her career growth. She dreaded the thought of being buried under a mountain of tasks and responsibilities upon her return from Florida, which could further stress her already strained work-life balance. Adding to her concerns was the ongoing global health situation, which brought with it additional travel restrictions and safety measures. Maria was not sure if all the necessary precautions would be implemented at airports, hotels, restaurants, and other public places during her stay in Florida. The risk of getting sick during or after the trip severely dampened her enthusiasm for the journey and made her question the wisdom of traveling under such circumstances. Lastly, Maria started to reevaluate her priorities and wondered if spending her vacation days visiting Patricia was the best use of her limited time off. She had family members she had not seen in a while and a list of dream destinations she was itching to explore. The thought of putting off her long-awaited adventures and family gatherings to visit Patricia began to feel more burdensome than appealing. In conclusion, while the humidity in Florida did not bother Maria, it was the culmination of financial concerns, unpredictable weather conditions, work-related challenges, health and safety risks, and shifting personal priorities that ultimately made her reconsider her decision to visit Patricia. Even though Maria was looking forward to spending time with her friend, the reality of the situation outweighed the initial excitement, compelling her to rethink her travel plans and explore alternative options for their reunion."},{"instruction":"Oh God,what an idiotic movie!Incredibly cheap with fake special effects(the creature is played by one guy in lame costume)and stupid plot.All dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors(HA!HA!HA!)...they're simply ludicrous.For example I have never seen so annoying characters like in this junk(these dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many more).All in all,this is a great entertainment if you're drunk.Avoid it like the plague.Am I drunk?I don't think so...

The novels include \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" (1865) and \\"Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There\\" (1871). Johnny Depp brought to life the whimsical, unpredictable, and enigmatic character of the Mad Hatter through a blend of striking visual transformations and his imaginative acting skills. His costume featured vibrant colors, mismatched patterns, and oversized accessories. Depp's performance blended zany humor with moments of emotion and vulnerability, as he explored the Hatter's complex background and relationships with other characters, particularly Alice (played by Mia Wasikowska).

A: The Somali flag is an ethnic flag conceived to represent ethnic Somalis. Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: While the initial response somewhat addresses the question, a detailed and long answer is as follows: The Somali flag was designed by Mohammed Awale Liban, an insightful Somali scholar and talented artist. The conception of the flag was linked to the Somali people's struggle for independence and the need for a symbol that would represent their culture, aspirations, and identity. The Somali flag was officially adopted on October 12, 1954, just a few years before Somalia gained independence from colonial rule on July 1, 1960. Mohammed Awale Liban was born in 1921 in the city of Taleh, situated in the Sool region of Somaliland, which is a self-declared autonomous region in northwestern Somalia. He was a man of outstanding vision and dedication, taking up the cause of the Somali people and their search for national identity. His training in artistic and scholarly pursuits enabled him to combine his creative vision with the political aspirations of the Somali people, culminating in the creation of the Somali flag. The design of the Somali flag features a single white, five-pointed star (the Star of Unity) centered on a light blue background. The five points of the star represent the five regions where ethnic Somalis reside: Djibouti, the Ogaden region in Ethiopia, the North East Province in Kenya, and the former British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland, which are now united as Somalia. The light blue background was chosen to symbolize the United Nations, which played a crucial role in assisting Somalia in its struggle for independence from colonial rule. The blue color also evokes the sky and the Indian Ocean, a significant source of sustenance and trade for the Somali people. The white color of the star symbolizes peace and the rebirth of Somalia after gaining its independence. In summary, the Somali flag was devised by Mohammed Awale Liban, a distinguished Somali scholar and artist who combined his creative talents with his political consciousness to create a visual symbol that could represent the aspirations, cultural identity, and unity of ethnic Somalis. The flag was officially adopted on October 12, 1954, and continues to be a potent symbol of unity, resilience, and hope for the Somali people."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: \\"Turn to Me\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. Ben and Andy were two old friends. They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless. Which friend started taking statins for his disease? A:","output":"Ben is the friend who started taking statins for his high cholesterol levels. He was prescribed cholesterol medication by his doctor to address the issue. On the other hand, Andy did not go to the doctor due to carelessness, and therefore did not receive any prescription medication or statins for his high cholesterol. The difference in their individual response to statins could be a result of their unique genetic background, which is characterized by different single nucleotide polymorphisms. These genetic variations can sometimes cause the statins to work differently in individuals - it may lower cholesterol significantly in some, moderately in others, or have no significant effect at all. Pharmacogenomics, a field that studies the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, aims to understand these differences and possibly optimize the use of medications like statins based on each person's genetic profile."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Article: Drinking a lot of water does not do any good to the body, according to two experts in the United States. In fact, they warn, drinking too much water could be, in certain cases, harmful. In a study, Dr Stanly Goldfarb and Dr Dan Negoianu, both of the Renal, Electrolyte and Hypertension Division at the University of Pensylvania, the United States, have denied the popular belief that drinking a lot of water clears body toxins better, improves skin, and helps reduce weight. Dr Goldfarb and Dr Negoianu say that they found little proof to back the public opinion that drinking 8 glasses of water every day benefits health. At the same time, they fond little proof of harm in drinking 8 glasses of water every day. It is widely believed that in some cases-such as athletes, people who live in hot, dry environments, and those with certain medical conditions-drinking a lot of water indeed helps, but no studies have been done to prove the benefits of this practice in average, healthy people, the website medheadlines.com reports.

He played his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He entered the NBA directly from high school and won five NBA championships with the Lakers. Bryant is an 18-time All-Star, 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, and 12-time member of the All-Defensive team. Bryant earned national recognition during a spectacular high school career at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, which was located in the Philadelphia suburb of Lower Merion. He played on the varsity basketball team as a freshman. He became the first freshman in decades to start for Lower Merion's varsity team, but the team finished with a 4-20 record. The following three years, the Aces compiled a 77-13 record, with Bryant playing all five positions. During his junior year, he averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 5.2 assists and was named Pennsylvania Player of the Year, attracting attention from college recruiters in the process. Duke, Michigan, North Carolina and Villanova were at the top of his list; however, when Kevin Garnett went in the first round of the 1995 NBA draft, he began considering going directly to the pros. At Adidas ABCD camp, Bryant earned the 1995 senior MVP award while playing alongside future NBA teammate Lamar Odom. While in high school, then 76ers coach John Lucas invited Bryant to work out and scrimmage with the team, where he played one-on-one with Jerry Stackhouse. In his senior year of high school, Bryant led the Aces to their first state championship in 53 years. During the run, he averaged 30.8 points, 12 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 4 steals, and 3.8 blocked shots in leading the Aces to a 31-3 record. Bryant ended his high school career as Southeastern Pennsylvania's all-time leading scorer at 2,883 points, surpassing both Wilt Chamberlain and Lionel Simmons. Bryant received several awards for his outstanding performance during his senior year at Lower Merion. The awards included being named Naismith High School Player of the Year, Gatorade Men's National Basketball Player of the Year, a McDonald's All-American, and a USA Today All-USA First Team player. Bryant's varsity coach, Greg Downer, commented that he was \\"a complete player who dominates\\" and praised his work ethic, even as the team's top player. In 1996, Bryant took R&B singer Brandy to his senior prom, though the two were, and remain, just friends. Ultimately, however, the 17-year-old Bryant made the decision to go directly into the NBA, only the sixth player in NBA history to do so. Bryant's news was met with a lot of publicity at a time when prep-to-pro NBA players were not very common (Garnett being the only exception in 20 years). His basketball skills and SAT score of 1080 would have ensured admission to any college he chose, but he did not officially visit any campuses. In 2012, Bryant was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald's All-Americans. In the 2002-03 season, Bryant set an NBA record for three-pointers in a game on January 7, 2003, when he made 12 against the Seattle SuperSonics. He averaged 30 points per game and embarked on a historic run, posting 40 or more points in nine consecutive games while averaging 40.6 in the entire month of February. In addition, he averaged 6.9 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, all career highs to that point. Bryant was once again voted to both the All-NBA and All-Defensive 1st teams, and came in third place in voting for the MVP award. After finishing 50-32 in the regular season, the Lakers floundered in the playoffs and lost in the Western Conference semi-finals in six games to the eventual NBA champions San Antonio Spurs. In the following 2003-04 season, the Lakers were able to acquire NBA All-Stars Karl Malone, and Gary Payton to make another push at the NBA Championship. Bryant was arrested for sexual assault before the season began. This caused Bryant to miss some games due to court appearances or attend court earlier in the day and travel to play games later in same day. In the final game of the regular season, the Lakers played the Portland Trail Blazers. Bryant made two buzzer beaters to win the game and the Pacific Division title. At the end of the fourth quarter, Bryant made a 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left to send it into overtime. The game eventually went to a second overtime, in which Bryant made another 3-pointer as time expired to lift the Lakers past the Blazers, 105-104. With a starting lineup of O'Neal, Malone, Payton, and Bryant, the Lakers were able to reach the NBA Finals. However, they were upset in five games by the Detroit Pistons, who won their first championship since 1990. In that series, Bryant averaged 22.6 points per game and 4.4 assists. He shot 35.1% from the field. Jackson's contract as coach was not renewed, and Rudy Tomjanovich took over. O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Caron Butler, and Brian Grant. The following day, Bryant declined an offer to sign with the Los Angeles Clippers and re-signed a seven-year contract with the Lakers. Bryant declined to play in the 2000 Olympics because he was getting married in the off-season. He also decided not to play in the 2002 FIBA World Championship. Bryant was originally selected for the FIBA Americas Championship in 2003, but withdrew after undergoing arthroscopic shoulder and knee surgeries. In the following summer, he had to withdraw from the Olympic team because of his sexual assault case. Along with LeBron James, he was one of the first two players to publicly named to the 2006-2008 U.S. preliminary roster in 2006 by Jerry Colangelo. However, he was once again sidelined after knee surgery and didn't participate in the 2006 FIBA World Championship. Bryant's United States national team career finally began in 2007.

If your normal doctor is not trained in this area, they may refer you to a specialist who will examine your condition to determine if it is lipedema or another similar fat disorder. The symptoms of this disorder make some people feel embarrassed to discuss the matter with their doctor. Try to remember that there is nothing to be embarrassed about, and if it is lipedema, the earlier you catch the disorder, the more treatable it will be. As with many disorders and diseases, lipedema is often more treatable in the earlier stages than in the later stages. There are four stages of lipedema. In stage 1, the skin will still be smooth, and swelling may increase during the day, but disappear with rest. During this stage, the disorder responds well to treatment. In stage 2, there may be indentations in the skin, and lipomas (fatty lumps) may develop. You may experience eczema or skin infections known as erysipelas. Swelling may still appear during the day, but likely doesn’t go away completely, even with rest and elevation of the legs. At this stage, your body may still respond well to treatment. During stage 3, you may experience a hardening of the connective tissues. At this stage, the swelling is unlikely to go down regardless of whether you are resting or elevating your legs. You might also experience overhanging skin. It is still possible to treat the disorder, but you may be less responsive to various treatments. In stage 4 you will likely experience a worsening of the symptoms present in stage 3. At this stage, the disorder is referred to by some experts as lipo-lymphedema. As with stage 3, treatment is still worth trying, but you may not respond to some treatments. The best way to diagnose the disorder is through visual inspection of the affected area. The doctor may feel the area to check for nodules that characterize this disorder. Additionally, your doctor will likely ask you about whether or not you are experiencing any pain, and to describe when/if the swelling increases or decreases. Currently, there is no blood test that will allow a doctor to determine if you have lipedema. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses lipedema, a fat disorder that can only be diagnosed by a doctor or specialist. It highlights the importance of seeking medical advice even if one feels embarrassed, as early diagnosis increases the chances of effective treatment.

The trumpet 's wail filled the hall, but was silent in the auditorium, as the a). hall was exposed to the noise.. b). auditorium was exposed to the noise..","output":"The trumpet's wail filled the hall, but was silent in the auditorium, as the hall was exposed to the noise while the auditorium remained insulated from the penetrating sounds of the trumpet. This phenomenon can be attributed to the unique acoustics and the structural design of both spaces. To better understand how this occurred, we can delve deeper into the specific features that affected the way sound traveled within and between the two locations. Firstly, the hall, where the trumpet's wail was clearly audible, is characterized by high ceilings, large windows, and open spaces. These architectural features contribute to the natural amplification and resonance of sound, allowing it to travel freely and reverberate within the area. Additionally, the surfaces within the hall– such as walls, ceilings, and floors – are most likely made of hard and reflective materials like wood, glass, or stone. These materials enhance the sound's ability to bounce and create a full-bodied resonance that can engulf the space. In contrast, the auditorium is designed with a primary focus on controlling and optimizing sound quality. This means that the space is equipped with various sound-absorbing materials and structures to either enhance or dampen certain frequencies, thereby creating a balanced, high-quality audio experience. Consequently, the auditorium may feature acoustical paneling on the walls and floors or specially-designed curved surfaces that help to scatter sound and prevent unwanted noise from easily penetrating into the space. Additionally, it may also include plush seating and other soft surfaces that absorb sound waves, further reducing its presence within the auditorium. Furthermore, the layout of the two spaces plays a significant role in the disparity of noise levels between them. The hall and auditorium may be connected by large doors or openings that are usually left open during events, concerts, or performances in the hall, allowing sounds to seep in. However, during this specific instance, the doors or openings connecting the two may have been closed, thus effectively reducing the transfer of noise between them. Another factor to consider is that the spaces might be separated by a significant distance or several architectural elements, such as hallways or courtyards. This separation can result in the sound from the trumpet dissipating or reducing in intensity before it reaches the auditorium, allowing sound waves to travel no further than their immediate environment. Lastly, it is also possible that the trumpet's wail was overpowered by other sounds within the auditorium, such as conversations or the hum of air-conditioning or heating systems. This could have served to further muffle the trumpet's sound, making it inaudible to the listeners inside the auditorium. In summary, the trumpet's wail filled the hall but remained silent in the auditorium due to a combination of factors: the design and acoustics of the two spaces, the materials and surfaces present within them, the physical layout and separation between the hall and auditorium, and the presence of other noise sources within the auditorium that could have drowned out the sound of the trumpet."},{"instruction":"Translate to Finnish: This is in contradiction of the Indian Government's responsibilities under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.","output":"Tämä on ristiriidassa Intian hallituksen vastuun kanssa, joka liittyy kansainvälisen kansalais- ja poliittisia oikeuksia koskevan sopimuksen artiklan 19 alle.

Tilt the shoe downward, so that the baking soda goes down into the toe area. Let the shoes sit for several hours. Dump the baking soda into the trash or sink. Repeat as necessary.","output":"Title: How to Freshen Up Your Shoes with Baking Soda and Essential Oils Introduction Shoes can quickly become a breeding ground for unpleasant odors, especially after a long day of walking, running or sweating in them. One of the most practical and cost-effective ways to eliminate shoe odors is by using a simple yet potent combination of baking soda and essential oils. Baking soda gently absorbs odors, while essential oils add a refreshing and pleasant fragrance to your shoes. In this article, we'll explain the step-by-step process of freshening up your shoes using baking soda and essential oils. Supplies Needed: - 2 tablespoons of baking soda - 5 drops of essential oil (of your choice) - A small bowl - A fork - A measuring spoon (1 tablespoon) Procedure: 1. Prepare the mixture To begin, pour 2 tablespoons of baking soda into a small bowl. This will be the base of your deodorizing mixture. Next, add 5 drops of your chosen essential oil for fragrance. You can use any essential oil you prefer, such as lavender, lemon, eucalyptus or tea tree oil. Each of these oils offers a distinct and pleasing scent that will help eliminate the unpleasant odors coming from your shoes. Combine the baking soda and essential oil by stirring them together with a fork until the mixture is evenly blended. 2. Apply the mixture to your shoes Using a measuring spoon, scoop up 1 tablespoon of the baking soda mixture, and pour it into the heel of each shoe. Make sure the mixture is evenly distributed by gently tapping the heel against a hard surface or shaking the shoe. This will help send the baking soda into the toe area of the shoe, covering more of the internal surface. 3. Allow the shoes to sit Let the shoes sit with the baking soda mixture inside for several hours or preferably overnight. The longer you leave the mixture in the shoes, the more time it will have to absorb the odors and freshen your shoes with the pleasing fragrance of the essential oils. You can leave your shoes in a well-ventilated area or outside during this process to further help eliminate shoe odors. 4. Dispose of the baking soda mixture After several hours or the following day, take the shoes and tilt them downward, allowing the excess baking soda to fall out into a trash can or sink. Gently tap the shoes against a hard surface to help remove any remaining baking soda from inside. Make sure not to inhale the baking soda dust while doing this step. 5. Repeat as necessary If your shoes still have a lingering odor or if you have multiple pairs to treat, simply repeat steps 1-4 as needed. It's important to note that this method works best on shoes made of fabric or canvas material. For leather shoes, it's advisable to use a specialized leather cleaner and conditioner instead to avoid damaging the shoes. Conclusion Freshening up your shoes with baking soda and essential oils is a simple and cost-effective solution for eliminating shoe odors. It not only helps remove unpleasant smells, but it also leaves your shoes smelling fresh and clean, improving the overall feel and comfort of wearing them. By incorporating this routine into your shoe care regimen, you can extend the life of your shoes while maintaining a pleasant and welcoming aroma."},{"instruction":"Definition: Given a simple high-school level math question, you are required to solve it and provide the final answer.

Input: Three letters picked without replacement from hhoohhhhohhhooooooh. What is prob of sequence ooh? Output:","output":"To find the probability of the sequence \\"ooh\\", we need to calculate the probability of picking each letter in the specific order. First, let's determine the total number of letters: h: 9 o: 8 The total is 17 letters. The probability of picking an 'o' on the first pick is the number of 'o' divides by the total number of letters: P(o)= o's/total = 8/17 Once an 'o' is picked, there are now 7 o's and 16 total letters left. The probability of picking an 'o' on the second pick is now: P(o)= 7/16 Once an 'o' is picked again, there are now 9 h's and 15 total letters left. The probability of picking an 'h' on the third pick is: P(h)= 9/15 Now we can calculate the total probability of the sequence \\"ooh\\" by multiplying the probabilities of picking each letter in order: P(ooh)= P(o) * P(o) * P(h) = (8/17) * (7/16) * (9/15) Let's now simply the multiplication of the fractions: P(ooh)= (8 * 7 * 9) / (17 * 16 * 15) = 504 / 4080 To reduce the fraction to its simplest form, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 504 and 4080 is 72.

Question: A glass mirror is smoother than a stone slab. This means that running a razor blade over the _____ will create more heat (A) glass mirror or the (B) stone slab Answer:","output":"The question at hand is whether running a razor blade over a glass mirror or a stone slab will result in more heat generation. To provide a detailed explanation, we can analyze the factors that influence heat generation during the interaction between the razor blade and each of the two surfaces under scrutiny: the smooth glass mirror and the rougher stone slab. 1. Friction: When two surfaces slide or rub against each other, friction is created. The friction results in a resistance force that opposes the motion, and this force generates heat energy. 2. Surface properties: The properties of the materials in contact play a significant role in determining the amount of friction and subsequent heat generation. The texture and roughness of the surfaces are important factors to consider. Now, let's apply these factors to the glass mirror and the stone slab scenarios. A) Glass Mirror: Smooth glass mirrors have polished, flat surfaces. When a razor blades glides over a glass mirror, the area of contact between the razor and the glass surface is uniform and minimized due to the absence of bumps, irregularities and rough patches. As a result, there is less friction generated when the razor blade moves across the glass mirror. B) Stone Slab: In the case of a stone slab, the surface is rough, uneven, and filled with bumps, grooves, and irregularities. When the razor blade interacts with the stone slab, more resistance is experienced due to the irregularities and increased surface area that comes into contact with the razor blade. Consequently, there is more friction generated between the razor blade and the stone slab. As we can see, running a razor blade over a smooth glass mirror will create less friction in comparison to running the same razor blade over the rough surface of a stone slab. Since friction is directly related to heat generation, the increased friction between the razor blade and the stone slab will generate more heat. Therefore, running a razor blade over the (B) stone slab will create more heat compared to running it over a (A) glass mirror."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Process: - Bats fly through an area - The bat makes sounds with their mouth or nose - The sound waves travel away from the bat - The sound waves hit objects - The sound waves bounce off the objects back towards the bat - The bat hears the sound waves echoing off the objects - The bat knows where the objects are because of where the sound echoed from - The bat doesn't hurt itself by hitting the objects.

Penny is told she must leave them before New York, where Russell's ex-wife/girlfriend Leslie will... The answer is:","output":"William's emotional journey in the movie \\"Almost Famous\\" is shaped by several key factors: 1. Family dynamics: William's strict upbringing by his widowed mother, Elaine, left him feeling somewhat out of place in the world. His mother's lies about his age and strict control over his life create a sense of confusion and insecurity for him. His older sister, Anita, is also a significant influence, as her defiance against their mother's rules and her love for rock music shape William's interests and aspirations. 2. Aspirations to be a rock journalist: William's passion for rock music, fueled by his sister's influence, leads him to pursue a career as a rock journalist. This pursuit becomes an emotional journey in itself, as he faces challenges in gaining access to the world of rock music, forging connections with musicians, and eventually losing his objectivity. 3. Association with Lester Bangs: Lester Bangs, a prominent rock journalist, takes an interest in William's writing and gives him opportunities to write for a wider audience, which in turn boosts his confidence and propels him forward in his career. 4. Relationships with Stillwater and Penny Lane: William forms strong emotional bonds with the members of the band Stillwater, particularly with lead guitarist Russell Hammond. Additionally, his relationship with Penny Lane, a veteran groupie, adds emotional depth and complexity to his journey as they both navigate the difficulties of getting close to the people they care about while maintaining professional boundaries. 5. Internal conflict: William's growing attachment to the band and Penny Lane creates inner turmoil, as he struggles to balance his journalistic integrity with his desire to belong in this world he has grown so fond of. This tension is further exacerbated by the power struggles within the band and the challenges they face in their professional lives. In summary, William's emotional journey in \\"Almost Famous\\" is driven by his family dynamics, aspirations as a rock journalist, relationships with influential figures in the music industry, and internal conflict in balancing his professional and personal lives. These factors combine to create a compelling and authentic coming-of-age story."},{"instruction":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Jesse boarded the bus and was harassed by someone on the bus. Given the question \\"How would Jesse feel afterwards?\\", is \\"targeted and at risk on the bus\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"Yes, \\"targeted and at risk on the bus\\" can indeed be considered a valid answer to the question \\"How would Jesse feel afterwards?\\". This question is asking about the emotional or psychological aftermath that Jesse might experience after being harassed on the bus. Therefore, the feelings of being targeted and feeling at risk are plausible responses. Feeling targeted may stem from the fact that Jesse was singled out and harassed amidst other passengers, this can create a perception in Jesse's mind, a sentiment that he was the specific target of the harasser's actions. Feeling 'at risk' on the bus could arise from the concern Jesse may have about the prospect of such an incident happening again. It suggests that Jesse might now perceive the bus as an unsafe environment, creating a sense of potential continuous threat. This feeling of vulnerability or insecurity may persist not only on that particular bus but could also extend to similar public spaces or means of transport. Every individual responds to harassment differently. While it's not universally true that everyone who experiences harassment will feel \\"targeted\\" or \\"at risk,\\" it's certainly a valid possibility that many people might feel this way. People who have been harassed often report feelings of being singled out, vulnerable and unsafe, which aligns with feelings of being targeted and at risk. Regardless of if it's common or not, these feelings are valid and are to be taken seriously. Bad experiences can often lead to fear, anxiety or a sense of insecurity. Repeated exposure to such conditions could potentially lead to the development of a wide range of mental health issues, like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, among others. Therefore, given this scenario, the answer \\"targeted and at risk on the bus\\" can indeed be considered a valid response to how Jesse might feel after the ordeal."},{"instruction":"Determine the sentiment: Carlos Saura's Carmen is one of the finest achievements in world, let alone Spanish, cinema.

On the third Sunday in June, fathers all across the United States are given presents, treated to dinner or otherwise made to feel special. However, the idea for creating a day for children to honor their fathers began in Spokane, Washington. A woman by the name of Sonora Smart Dodd thought of the idea for Father's Day while listening to a Mother's Day sermon in 1909. Having been raised by her father, Henry Jackson Smart, after her mother died, Sonora wanted her father to know how special he was to her. It was her father that made all the parental sacrifices and was, in the eyes of his daughter, a selfless and loving man. Sonora's father was born in June, so she chose to hold the first Father's Day celebration in Spokane, Washington on the 19th of June, 1910. In 1924 President Calvin Coolidge declared the third Sunday in June as Father's Day. Roses are the Father's Day flowers: red to be worn for a living father and white if the father has died. When children can't visit their fathers or take them out to dinner, they send a greeting card. Traditionally, fathers prefer greeting cards that are not too sentimental(, ). Most greeting cards are too special so fathers laugh when they open them. Some give heartfelt thanks for being there whenever the child needed Dad.

Today, he wants to make curds out of milk and see how it differs from plain milk. For his experiment he collected three bottles of milk, bottle A, bottle B, and bottle C. Bottle A and bottle B milk are pasteurized, but bottle C milk is just raw milk. He kept the bottle A milk intact, but made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk. and a hint : Curds are a dairy product obtained by coagulating milk in a process called curdling. The coagulation can be caused by adding rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to coagulate. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid masses, or curds. Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheeses are produced this way. Producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey proteins, is the whey. In cow's milk, 90 percent of the proteins are caseins. Please answer this question : Would bottle B milk need or not need added lactic acid bacteria to produce curd?","output":"Bottle B milk, which is pasteurized, would likely need added lactic acid bacteria to produce curd. This is because pasteurization involves heating the milk to a high temperature to eliminate unwanted bacteria and microorganisms. This process also tends to kill off the naturally occurring lactic acid bacteria present in raw milk, which are responsible for the fermentation process that leads to curdling. Therefore, to produce curd from pasteurized milk (such as bottle B milk), you would typically need to reintroduce lactic acid bacteria by adding a starter culture, like yogurt containing live cultures or a specific curdling agent, to initiate the coagulation process and form curds."},{"instruction":"The 2016 MBC Entertainment Awards () presented by Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), took place on December 29, 2016 at MBC Public Hall in Sangam-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul.

This storm has resulted in a cyclone. The radius of outermost closed isobar is measured to be 1.5 degrees of latitude. Given the cyclone increases in size will the measurement of its outermost isobar have increased or decreased? Hint: There are a variety of metrics commonly used to measure storm size. The most common metrics include the radius of maximum wind, the radius of 34-knot wind (i.e. gale force), the radius of outermost closed isobar (ROCI), and the radius of vanishing wind. An additional metric is the radius at which the cyclone's relative vorticity field decreases to 1×10−5 s−1.On Earth, tropical cyclones span a large range of sizes, from 100–2,000 kilometres (62–1,243 mi) as measured by the radius of vanishing wind. They are largest on average in the northwest Pacific Ocean basin and smallest in the northeastern Pacific Ocean basin. If the radius of outermost closed isobar is less than two degrees of latitude (222 km (138 mi)), then the cyclone is \\"very small\\" or a \\"midget\\". A radius of 3–6 latitude degrees (333–670 km (207–416 mi)) is considered \\"average sized\\". \\"Very large\\" tropical cyclones have a radius of greater than 8 degrees (888 km (552 mi)). Observations indicate that size is only weakly correlated to variables such as storm intensity (i.e. maximum wind speed), radius of maximum wind, latitude, and maximum potential intensity.Size plays an important role in modulating damage caused by a storm. All else equal, a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time. Additionally, a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher storm surge due to the combination of longer wind fetch, longer duration, and enhanced wave setup.The upper circulation of strong hurricanes extends into the tropopause of the atmosphere, which at low latitudes is 15,000–18,000 metres (50,000–60,000 ft).","output":"Given that the storm is brewing in the northeastern Pacific basin where tropical cyclones are generally smaller and the radius of outermost closed isobar (ROCI) is measured to be 1.5 degrees of latitude, which is considered a \\"very small\\" or \\"midget\\" cyclone, we can analyze if the measurement of the ROCI will increase or decrease as the cyclone increases in size. Step 1: Understand the cyclone characteristics - Tropical cyclones can range from 100-2000 kilometers in size as the radius of vanishing wind; largest in the northwest Pacific Ocean basin and smallest in the northeastern Pacific Ocean basin. - Size is weakly correlated to intensity, radius of maximum wind, latitude, and maximum potential intensity. - Larger tropical cyclones have a more significant impact on a region due to the larger area affected, longer wind fetch and duration, as well as higher storm surges. Step 2: Monitor the growth of the cyclone - As the cyclone increases in size, it is likely that its wind field, intensity, and duration will grow as well. This will result in an expansion of the cyclone's coverage and reach. Step 3: Determine the change in ROCI measurement - As the cyclone grows, given that larger cyclones will impact more extensive areas, the ROCI measurement would also be expected to increase. - An increase in ROCI indicates that the cyclone's outer boundary, defined by the outermost closed isobar, is expanding due to the growth of the cyclone's size. Therefore, as the cyclone increases in size, the measurement of its radius of outermost closed isobar (ROCI) is expected to increase. This is because larger cyclones generally expand their wind field and impact broader areas, resulting in an expansion of their outer boundary as captured by the ROCI metric."},{"instruction":"Select your answer: Which is this about?

In spite of the name, it is not a true drum but an idiophone, usually carved or constructed from bamboo or wood into a box with one or more slits in the top. Most slit drums have one slit, though two and three slits (cut into the shape of an \\"H\\") occur. If the resultant tongues are different width or thicknesses, the drum will produce two different pitches. It is used throughout Africa, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. In Africa such drums, strategically situated for optimal acoustic transmission (e.g., along a river or valley), have been used for long-distance communication. - The Agung a Tamlang is a type of Philippine slit drum made of hollowed out bamboo in imitation of the real agung . Pitch is determined by the length and depth of the slit . The agung a tamlang is used as practice for the real agung : players either use either one agung a tamlang ( hold it with one hand and using the other to strike it with a beater ) or using two agung a tamlangs where the other agung is held with one 's feet . - The agung is a set of two wide-rimmed, vertically suspended gongs used by the Maguindanao, Maranao, Sama-Bajau and Tausug people of the Philippines as a supportive instrument in kulintang ensembles.

There is usually a \\"resonance head\\" on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years. - Mindanao is the second largest and southernmost major island in the Philippines.

You may think people in such an attractive and exciting, fun-filled place are happier than others. If so, you have some mistaken ideas about the nature of happiness. Many intelligent people still consider happiness equal to fun. The truth is that fun and happiness have little or nothing in common. Fun is what we experience during an act. Happiness is what we experience after an act. It is a deeper, more lasting emotion. Going to an amusement park or ball game, watching a movie or television, are fun activities that help us relax, temporarily forget our problems and maybe even laugh. But they do not bring happiness, because their positive effects end when the fun ends. I have often thought that if Hollywood stars have a role to play, it is to teach us that happiness has nothing to do with fun. These rich, beautiful people have constant access to glamorous parties, fancy cars, expensive homes, everything that brings \\"happiness\\". But in memoir after memoir, famous people expose the unhappiness hidden beneath all their fun -- depression, alcoholism, drug addiction, broken marriages, troubled children and extreme loneliness. Ask an unmarried man why he refuses to get married even though he finds dating to be less and less satisfying. If he's honest, he will tell you that he is afraid of making a commitment. For commitment is in fact quite painful. The single life is filled with fun, adventure and excitement. Marriage has such moments, but they are not its most distinguishing features. Similarly, couples that choose not to have children are deciding in favor of painless fun over painful happiness. They can dine out whenever they want and sleep as late as they want. Couples with babies are lucky to get a whole night's sleep or a three-day vacation. I don't know any parent who would choose the word fun to describe raising children. The way people stick to the belief that a fun-filled, pain-free life equals happiness actually reduces their chances of ever achieving real...

Unfortunately, little did I know that my excitement would be short-lived and soon replaced by utter dissatisfaction. First impressions are everything, and the entrance to the Gardens was nothing short of appalling. With a poorly maintained entrance gate, no clear signage, and neglected ticket booth, I had a sinking feeling that this trip was taking a turn for the worse.

Navigating the Gardens proved to be a treacherous endeavor. The pathways were uneven, with cracked cobblestones and improperly maintained walkways that posed a danger to all visitors. Furthermore, the map provided by the Gardens was woefully inadequate with countless inaccuracies, making it near impossible to find any landmarks or specific attractions we had in mind. Emerald Gardens is known for boasting a diverse range of flora and fauna, which was supposed to be the highlight of our visit. Sadly, the reality was a depressing contrast to this claim. The flower beds were in a state of neglect, with a large percentage of the plants wilting and dying. The water features – which were once touted as breathtaking – now lay stagnant, murky, and littered with debris. It's no wonder that we saw only a few despondent animals during our entire visit, which only contributed to the overall bleak atmosphere. The Emerald Gardens Cafe, where we had hoped to enjoy a leisurely lunch, was nothing short of an unhygienic disaster. The outdoor seating area was filthy, with bird droppings on chairs and tables, making it impossible for us to even consider dining there. To add insult to injury, the menu was extremely limited, with prices that were shockingly exorbitant for the low-quality food served. The restroom facilities were also far below par. Not only were we forced to wait in an excessively long line to access them, but upon finally entering, we were met with a nauseating smell, no toilet paper, and a complete lack of soap or hand sanitizer in a pandemic-stricken world. Finally, to round off an already dismaying experience, the exit of the Gardens led us to a crammed, poorly organized parking area that left me worrying for the safety of my vehicle. In conclusion, I am still reeling from the abysmal experience that was Emerald Gardens. It is evident that a severe lack of care, investment, proper management, and attention to detail has allowed this once-celebrated establishment to fall into a state of utter decay. I would not recommend wasting precious time or money on this lackluster attraction and would advise people to explore the many other beautiful destinations in the area. Emerald Gardens has turned out to be a monumental disappointment, and it is high time the management takes drastic measures to rectify these glaring issues.

Context: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. Question: Why did Manny slow down? Options: - not enough information - the food cart owner stepped forward - the boy stepped off the sidewalk - tourists were on the road Answer:","output":"Manny slowed down because tourists were on the road."},{"instruction":"Q:Information: - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies.

Noah researched the climate of Antarctica, while Frank researched the climate changes of Madagascar and the Southern tip of Africa. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which researcher observed a large amount of surface warming? The answer to this question is:","output":"It is not explicitly stated in the given paragraph which researcher observed a large amount of surface warming. However, we can deduce some information based on the geographic locations of their respective research areas and the general trends of climate change. Noah researched the climate of Antarctica. Antarctica is Earth's southernmost continent, containing the geographic South Pole, and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere. The continent is largely surrounded by the Southern Ocean, comprised mostly of ice, and the climate is characterized by its immense coldness. Climate change has been causing increased surface warming and ice melting in Antarctica. The region has experienced significant changes over the past decades due to the warming of the planet. Of particular note, the Antarctic Peninsula is one of the fastest warming regions in the world. According to some studies, the region has warmed by approximately 2.5°C over the past 50 years, resulting in widespread ice loss and the destabilization of ice shelves. Frank, on the other hand, researched the climate changes of Madagascar and the Southern tip of Africa. Madagascar is a large island nation that is located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa. The country has a diverse climate that encompasses tropical rainforests, highlands, and arid lands. However, it has also been facing climate challenges, such as shifting rainfall patterns and an overall increase in average temperatures. The Southern tip of Africa, which includes the country of South Africa, has also experienced changes in climate. South Africa's coastal regions are generally temperate, while inland temperatures can range from extremely hot to very cold. Climate change is expected to further exacerbate South Africa's regional climate disparities, with the Western Cape experiencing increased winter rainfall and the Eastern Cape experiencing hotter and drier conditions. Based on general climate change trends, it is likely that both researchers have observed some degree of surface warming in their respective study areas. However, the rapid warming of the Antarctic Peninsula could potentially indicate that Noah encountered a larger amount of surface warming during his research in Antarctica. It is still important to note that the given paragraph does not specifically mention which researcher observed a larger amount of surface warming, so any conclusions drawn here are based on inferences made from general knowledge about the world's climate trends."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

Water is used as the vehicle for the pigment to merge with the plaster, and with the setting of the plaster, the painting becomes an integral part of the wall. The word fresco is derived from the Italian adjective \\"fresco\\" meaning \\"fresh\\", and may thus be contrasted with fresco-secco or secco mural painting techniques, which are applied to dried plaster, to supplement painting in fresco. The fresco technique has been employed since antiquity and is closely associated with Italian Renaissance painting. - Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt (14 November 1668 16 November 1745) was an Austrian baroque architect and military engineer who designed stately buildings and churches and whose work had a profound influence on the architecture of the Habsburg Empire in the eighteenth century. After studying in Rome under Carlo Fontana, he constructed fortresses for Prince Eugene of Savoy during his Italian campaigns, becoming his favorite architect. In 1700 he became court engineer in Vienna, and in 1711 was named head of the court department of building. He became court architect in 1723. His designs for palaces, estates, gardens, churches, chapels, and villas were widely imitated, and his architectural principles spread throughout central and southeast Europe.

They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - A microcomputer is a small, relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU). It includes a microprocessor, memory, and minimal input/output (I/O) circuitry mounted on a single printed circuit board. Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense). - Stephen Glicker is a video game designer , programmer and blogger .

It was designed and hand-built by Steve Wozniak. Wozniak's friend Steve Jobs had the idea of selling the computer. The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a VW Microbus, for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for 500; however, Wozniak said that Jobs planned to use his bicycle if necessary. It was demonstrated in July 1976 at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California. - The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time. - The Apple II is an 8-bit home computer, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products, designed primarily by Steve Wozniak (Steve Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II's foam-molded plastic case and Rod Holt developed the switching power supply). It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire by Jobs and was the first consumer product sold by Apple Computer. It is the first model in a series of computers which were produced until Apple IIe production ceased in November 1993. The Apple II marks Apple's first launch of a personal computer aimed at a consumer market branded towards American households rather than businessmen or computer hobbyists. - Stephen (or Stephan) Gary \\"Steve\\" Wozniak (born August 11, 1950), nicknamed \\"Woz\\", is an American inventor, electronics engineer, programmer, and technology entrepreneur who co-founded Apple Inc. He is known as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. - The West Coast Computer Faire was an annual computer industry conference and exposition most often associated with San Francisco, its first and most frequent venue. The first fair was held in 1977 and was organized by Jim Warren and Bob Reiling. At the time, it was the biggest computer show in the world, intended to popularize the personal computer in the home. The West Coast PC Faire was formed to provide a more specialized show. However, Apple stopped exhibiting at the West Coast Computer Faire, refusing to exhibit at any show other than COMDEX that also had PC-based exhibits. In 1983, Warren sold the rights to the Faire for US3 million to Prentice Hall, who later sold it to Sheldon Adelson, the owner of Interface Group and COMDEX. In total, sixteen shows were held, with the last in 1991. After Warren sold the show, it had a few more good years, and then declined rapidly. - Steven Paul \\"Steve\\" Jobs (February 24, 1955 October 5, 2011) was an American businessman, inventor, and industrial designer.

Dad gets to a corral, commandeers two fresh horses practically at gunpoint, but he has second thoughts.One way back goes to the hilltop, sure to be taken by the Rurales, and in the opposite direction is a treeline behind which are the border and safety. One way lies danger and a poor chance at surviving with half the booty, the other lies a virtual certainty with all of the stolen gold. Upon brief reflection, Longworth leaves his friend to be captured by the Rurales.After Rio is captured, the posse stops at the corral to ask where Longworth might be, and Rio hears that Longworth took only one horse and sped off in a direction away from where he was waiting.After almost five years in a...

Today, we are going to talk about a book with a really interesting title. The book is called \\"How Pleasure Works\\" and it is written by a clever man named Paul Bloom. He is a professor at Yale University, a place where very smart people teach and learn. The book tells us about what makes us happy and why we like the things we like. Paul Bloom says that it's not just because of how the things look, feel, or taste, but what we think about them. He calls this idea \\"essentialism.\\" That might sound like a big word, but it's just a fancy way of saying that we believe certain things have \\"essences\\" or special traits that make them what they are. In \\"How Pleasure Works,\\" Paul Bloom talks about different things that give us pleasure or make us happy. Some of these things are simple, like eating our favorite candy or watching a funny show. Others are more complicated, like falling in love or enjoying a beautiful painting. Paul Bloom gives many examples of how essentialism works in our lives. One example is about a little boy who loves his teddy bear. Even if there are other teddy bears that look the same, the boy loves his teddy bear the most because it's special to him. This is because the boy believes that his teddy bear has a unique essence, or a special something that other teddy bears don't have. That's essentialism! And guess what? Adults are like this, too! People might love a painting because the artist who made it is famous, or they might think a piece of clothing is more valuable because it's a designer brand. These are examples of how essentialism makes things more pleasurable for us. Paul Bloom also talks about how the things we believe about pleasure can change our feelings. For example, if we learn that a person we admire did something bad, we might not like them as much anymore. This shows how our knowledge of something can affect our feelings about it. This book is important because it teaches us that the way we think about things affects how much we enjoy them. It helps us understand why we like some things more than others and why different people have different tastes. In conclusion, \\"How Pleasure Works\\" is a fascinating book that explores the reasons behind why we find certain things enjoyable. Paul Bloom's idea of essentialism helps explain how our thoughts and beliefs can shape our feelings of pleasure. The book is full of interesting examples and stories that make it a fun and educational read for both kids and grown-ups! So, if you're curious about why you love your favorite toy, snack, or TV show, you might want to ask someone to read this book to you!"},{"instruction":"Q:Ash loved Jordan well enough and they both went to the movies to see a good movie.

This significant historical event marks a critical turning point in the course of the war. World War II began in September 1939 when Germany, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. As a result, France and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. Germany's Blitzkrieg tactic, involving rapid, coordinated attacks using air and ground forces, proved highly effective, and by May 1940, German forces invaded France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. France's military forces were unable to counter the German onslaught, and the French government sought a way to end the hostilities. On June 10, 1940, the French government declared Paris an open city, allowing German forces to enter without resistance. Meanwhile, the French government retreated to Tours, and later to Bordeaux, where it continued to seek a solution for the ongoing conflict. French Marshal Philippe Pétain, who was appointed as Prime Minister on June 16, 1940, began negotiations with Germany almost immediately. Pétain believed that the only way to salvage France and end the bloodshed was through an armistice–a temporary cessation of hostilities–allowing Germany to occupy a portion of France. Hitler, who had long seen France as a bitter enemy, was eager to sign an armistice to deal a blow to French morale and further solidify German control in Europe. The armistice negotiations were held in Compiègne, France, in the same railway carriage where the 1918 Armistice that ended World War I had been signed. This site was symbolic, as it served as a reminder of Germany's surrender in WWI and added a sense of humiliation to France. The negotiations began on June 21, 1940, and the armistice agreement was signed the next day, on June 22, 1940, at 18:36. Under the terms of the armistice, France was divided into two zones: an occupied zone, which comprised the northern and western parts of France, including Paris, and an unoccupied, \\"free\\" zone, which included the southern portion of France, with Vichy serving as the new capital. This division allowed for the establishment of the Vichy Regime, a puppet government led by Marshal Pétain, which collaborated with the German occupying forces. The French military was reduced and disarmed, and French POWs remained in German custody. The French-German Armistice remained in effect until November 11, 1942, when Germany violated its terms and occupied the \\"free\\" zone in response to the Allied invasion of North Africa. This event led to the dissolution of the Vichy Regime, and an increased French involvement in the resistance against German occupation until the liberation of France in August 1944."},{"instruction":"Continue the following story.

One sunny day, I was walking in a beautiful park full of pretty flowers and tall trees. The birds were singing their happy songs, and the butterflies danced around me. It was a perfect day to have a picnic! As I sat down on the soft, green grass, I noticed a little squirrel running up and down a tree. The squirrel was having so much fun hiding nuts in the tree. He was storing them for the winter when the weather gets cold, and there are no more nuts to find. Suddenly, I saw a playful dog chasing a bright, round ball that his owner threw for him. The dog was very happy to catch the ball in his mouth and bring it back to his owner. They were playing a game called \\"fetch.\\" Nearby, a group of children laughed and played together on a colorful playground. They slid down the slides, swung on the swings, and climbed the jungle gym. They were having a great time making new friends and trying out all the fun equipment.

Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"The fish demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man\\" correctly answer the question \\"How has the character \\"Madame White Snake\\" evolved over time?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"The fish demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"How has the character \\"Madame White Snake\\" evolved over time?\\" The given paragraph explains that Madame White Snake evolved from a villainous demon to a more complex and sympathetic character, even taking on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, such as being a loving wife, a caring mother, and a general benefactor of man."},{"instruction":"This text is missing some spaces, please add them: IfyourfriendsspeakBelarusian,learningBelarusianwillgiveyouabetterunderstandingoftheircultureandwayofthinking.IfyouhavefriendswhospeakBelarusian,learningBelarusianwillhelpyoutocommunicatewiththem.","output":"To correct the spaces in this text, I will go through it and find words that are squished together.

The concept of the city contracting implies that it is shrinking in size, either due to a decrease in population, consolidation of buildings and infrastructure, or some other factors.

However, it is essential to keep in mind that this is not the same phenomenon as the expansion of the Universe. The expansion of the Universe alludes to the increasing distances between galaxies due to the stretching of the fabric of spacetime.

As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert.

Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007. He was the \\"R\\" in K&R C, and commonly known by his username dmr. - IMAGE (from Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration), or Explorer 78, was a NASA MIDEX mission that studied the global response of the Earth's magnetosphere to changes in the solar wind. It was launched March 25, 2000 by a Delta II rocket from Vandenberg AFB and ceased operations in December 2005. - Unix (trademarked as UNIX) is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, developed starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. - Kenneth Lane \\"Ken\\" Thompson (born February 4, 1943), commonly referred to as ken in hacker circles, is an American pioneer of computer science. Having worked at Bell Labs for most of his career, Thompson designed and implemented the original Unix operating system. He also invented the B programming language, the direct predecessor to the C programming language, and was one of the creators and early developers of the Plan 9 operating systems. Since 2006, Thompson has worked at Google, where he co-invented the Go programming language. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - Generic programming is a style of computer programming in which algorithms are written in terms of types \\"to-be-specified-later\\" that are then \\"instantiated\\" when needed for specific types provided as parameters. This approach, pioneered by ML in 1973, permits writing common functions or types that differ only in the set of types on which they operate when used, thus reducing duplication. Such software entities are known as \\"generics\\" in Ada, Delphi, Eiffel, Java, C#, F#, Objective-C, Swift, and Visual Basic .NET; \\"parametric polymorphism\\" in ML, Scala, Haskell (the Haskell community also uses the term \\"generic\\" for a related but somewhat different concept) and Julia; \\"templates\\" in C++ and D; and \\"parameterized types\\" in the influential 1994 book \\"Design Patterns\\". The authors of \\"Design Patterns\\" note that this technique, especially when combined with delegation, is very powerful but also quote the following - Kenneth Cutts Richard Cabot Arnold is an American computer programmer well known as one of the developers of the 1980s dungeon - crawling video game Rogue , for his contributions to the original Berkeley ( BSD ) distribution of Unix , for his books and articles about C and C++ ( e.g. his 1980s -- 1990s Unix Review column , \`\` The C Advisor '' ) , and his high - profile work on the Java platform .

In the middle of the day, he chases a young woman into the surf at a beach and drowns her. At night, he kills a prostitute in a car while pedestrians stroll by, all of them assuming the pair are lovers sharing an intimate moment.

They had three daughters, Catherine Grace (b. 1856), Edith Marcon Vergence (b. 1859), and Helen Beatruc (b. 1861).In 1855 Felice Beato and Robertson travelled to Balaklava, Crimea, where they took over reportage of the Crimean War following Roger Fenton's departure. Beato was ostensibly Robertson's assistant, however the unpredictable conditions of a war-zone forced Beato to assume a more active role. In contrast to Fenton's depiction of the dignified aspects of war, Beato and Robertson showed the destruction and death. They photographed the fall of Sevastopol in September 1855, producing about 60 images. Their Crimean images dramatically changed the way that war was reported and depicted.In February 1858 Beato arrived in Calcutta and began travelling throughout Northern India to document the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses. It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact (see events at Taku Forts). He was also in the cities of Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore. Beato was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio, who later left India, probably for health reasons, in December 1859.

A devestated Clara commits suicide.Unfortunately for the Wilherns, Clara's mother happens to be a witch. To avenge her daughter, the old woman curses the wealthy Wilherns, promising that the next girl born into the family will have the face of a pig, until she is accepted and loved by \\"one of her own kind.\\" For generations, only sons were born to Wilherns, and the curse was nearly forgotten. But finally, Jessica and Franklin Wilhern produced a baby girl, Penelope, born with the nose and ears of a pig.Penelope's parents attempt to have the nose surgically removed, but the placement of a certain artery makes it impossible. They resort to hiding ther daughter in their lavish mansion, with Jessica banning anything pig-related (such as bacon) from the household.

Warner to grant clemency (the identity of Warner is clearly stated as the governor in this sentence). c) The governor (Warner) declined to intervene in the case, meaning he opted not to grant clemency. The similarities between the two sentences are that they both refer to an event that happened last week, where lawyers requested clemency for their client from Warner. In the second sentence, it is explicitly mentioned that Warner is the governor. The main difference between the two sentences lies in the conditions related to the clemency request. In the first sentence, granting clemency would lead to a new sentencing hearing. The second sentence doesn't mention any conditions or the outcome of granting the clemency. Furthermore, it explicitly states that the governor declined to intervene in the case, effectively denying the clemency request. This information is not present in the first sentence.

Choices: - migratory and logistic - exponential and economical - organic and inorganic - exponential and logistic A: Answer:","output":"The two common growth patterns of population are exponential and logistic. Exponential growth is a pattern of population increase where the growth rate is proportional to the population size. In simple terms, as the population grows, the growth rate also increases, leading to a rapid acceleration in the population size. This pattern of growth can be observed in populations when individuals have a very high reproductive potential, and there are limitless resources with few limitations. It follows a J-shaped curve. This means that the growth of the population starts slowly, then accelerates, and finally reaches an extremely high rate. Exponential growth can be represented by the equation: dN/dt = rN where dN/dt represents the change in population size over time, 'N' is the population size, and 'r' is the intrinsic rate of increase (per capita growth rate). However, no population can grow infinitely due to external factors such as limited resources and space. As a result, exponential growth often occurs only for a limited period in natural populations. Logistic growth, on the other hand, is shaped by environmental factors and the carrying capacity of a given environment. The carrying capacity (K) refers to the maximum number of individuals that can be supported in a specific environment with the available resources. When a population approaches its carrying capacity, growth slows down and eventually stabilizes. This pattern of growth is characterized by an S-shaped curve. Logistic growth can be represented by the equation: dN/dt = rN(1 - N/K) where 'N' is the population size, 'r' is the intrinsic rate of increase, 'K' is the carrying capacity, and the term (1 - N/K) decreases as the population size approaches the carrying capacity. Logistic growth takes into account the effects of density-dependent factors such as resource competition, predation, and disease, which limit population growth. The logistic growth model provides a more realistic depiction of population growth, considering that resources are finite and populations cannot grow indefinitely. In summary, exponential and logistic growth patterns are the two common patterns of population growth. Exponential growth occurs when a population experiences rapid, unrestricted growth based on its reproductive potential, while logistic growth takes into account the limitations posed by the environment and available resources. Both growth patterns help us understand how populations expand and adapt over time."},{"instruction":"If so i just at an opportune time i got one that that suited my needs and i've just stuck with it the only thing i've done to it is just add a uh add a mouse and a hard drive, can we conclude that \\"It did not cost me much to buy a mouse and hard drive.\\"?

On April 5, 1946, the entire cast, including Stafford and Perry Como, participated in the first commercial radio broadcast from an airplane. The initial plan was to use the stand-held microphones used in studios but when these proved to be problematic, the cast switched to hand-held microphones, which because of the plane's cabin pressure became difficult to hold. Three flights were made that day; a rehearsal in the afternoon, then two in the evening—one for the initial 6:00 pm broadcast and another at 10:00 pm for the West Coast broadcast.Stafford moved from New York to California in November 1946, continuing to host Chesterfield Supper Club from Hollywood. In 1948, she restricted her appearances on the show to Tuesdays, and Peggy Lee hosted the Thursday broadcasts. Stafford left the show when it was expanded to 30 minutes, making her final appearance on September 2, 1949. She returned to the program in 1954; it ended its run on NBC Radio the following year. During her time with Chesterfield Supper Club, Stafford revisited some of the folk music she had enjoyed as a child. Weston, her conductor on the programme, suggested using some of the folk music for the show. With her renewed interest in folk tunes came an interest in folklore; Stafford established a contest to award a prize to the best collection of American folklore submitted by a college student. The annual Jo Stafford Prize for American Folklore was handled by the American Folklore Society, with the first prize of 250 awarded in 1949. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that restricted her appearance on the show to only Tuesdays?, what is it ?

Pushkin was born into Russian nobility in Moscow. His matrilineal great grandfather was Abram Gannibal, who was brought over as a slave from what is now Cameroon. Pushkin published his first poem at the age of fifteen, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. While under the strict surveillance of the Tsar's political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, the drama Boris Godunov. His novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, was serialized between 1825 and 1832. Notoriously touchy about his honour, Pushkin fought as many as twenty-nine duels, and was fatally wounded in such an encounter with Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthes.

Robert is livid, both at the news and the method that he found out about the news. There is a second story on the teletype: Maxâs wife, the famous novelist Paula Wharton (Irene Dunne) (whom Max calls Paulie), is in Hollywood adapting her latest book into a movie screenplay. Max wants to do his duty as a citizen and responsible journalist to be close to the war (World War II). Robertâs view is that without Max, the newspaper will fold because Max *is* the newspaper. From Hollywood, Paulie telephones Max and congratulates him on his decision. After Max informs her of the plan of basic training then possibly officerâs candidate school, Paulie decides that she will move to where ever that school is to be close to him.

In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B. and a hint : Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Please answer this question : Which fruits would not develop unfavorable osmotic pressure, bowl A or bowl B? A:","output":"The fruits in bowl A, containing the glace fruits, would develop an unfavorable osmotic pressure for the growth of spoilage microorganisms.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What occurs on the windward side of a mountain range?\\" with the following options: - fronts - storms - rainfall - growth - air cools - rain - Summer - Winter Answer:","output":"On the windward side of a mountain range, several key occurrences can be observed based on the provided facts. These phenomena contribute to unique microclimates, weather patterns, and ecological systems, which result in distinct natural processes taking place on this side of the mountain range. Firstly, precipitation, including rainfall, is most prevalent on the windward side of a mountain range. As moist air from the lower elevation moves upward and faces the barrier of the mountain range, it is forced to rise. This process is known as orographic lift. As the air ascends, it cools and loses its capacity to retain moisture, resulting in condensation and clouds formation. This leads to precipitation, in the form of rainfall, snow or even hail, which falls predominantly on the windward side of the mountain range. Secondly, as mentioned in Fact 2, ample precipitation, including fog, is essential for growth. On the windward side of a mountain range, where higher amounts of precipitation occur, this creates an environment conducive to the growth of various forms of flora and fauna. The increased moisture levels contribute to the development of thriving ecosystems, including dense forests or lush alpine meadows, depending on altitude and temperature conditions. The presence of fog can also create unique habitats, such as cloud forests, where vegetation relies on the moisture provided by the fog in addition to rainfall. In conclusion, the windward side of a mountain range experiences several critical phenomena due to the combination of orographic lift and prevailing weather patterns. These phenomena include air cooling, rainfall or other forms of precipitation, and growth promotion in terms of flora and fauna. Thus, the answer to the question \\"What occurs on the windward side of a mountain range?\\" can be summarized as: air cools, rainfall, and growth."},{"instruction":"Here is an email: Reviewed by Mark Williams, SVP Risk Management, Citizens Power The long awaited second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk has finally arrived. It has been four years since the first edition was published. During this hiatus, a lot has happened as risk management within the rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as a respected discipline. The second edition is a rich compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative group of industry leaders, practitioners and academics. The books strength is that it reinforces the fact that risk management principles initially applied to a narrow band of energy commodities can and should be applied across a wide array of energy commodities including electricity. As expected the book does a solid job in capturing an international perspective on the various challenges, which are not isolated to any one continent but are global in scope. It includes a lengthy introduction that effectively frames risk management progress, advancements and innovations that started in the oil markets in the 1970's and migrated to the natural gas and most recently expanding to the electricity industry. Managing Energy Price Risk is comprised of 15 chapters, all of which include an introduction, which minimises the disjointedness that you may expect from a book written by a large number of authors. Other improvements in this second edition include expanded graphics, highlighted panels, detailed appendices and a separate glossary, which provides the reader with additional reference material. In particular the chapter on energy options written by Michael Hampton is a useful primer and provides the reader with a concise explanation of option theory, pricing, basis risk, delta hedging as well as practical guidelines for distinguishing between hedging and pure speculation. For the more advanced reader, the chapter on Energy Exotic Options, written by Vince Kaminski, Stinson Gibner and Krishnarao Pinnamaneni is particularly strong as it outlines the challenges associated with the exotics and effectively documents the latest methods used by leading practitioners in pricing such instruments. Additionally, the chapter on Accounting for Derivative Contracts in the Energy Environment by three consultants from Arthur Anderson, is a well written summary which addresses the numerous tax related issues including a timely discussion on the US Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement 133 (see EPRM October 1999, page 22). Having this tax information housed in one concise chapter is of great value. The second edition however is not without flaws. In particular, it would have been useful to have more information on the current challenges risk managers are confronted with in the power industry including latest advancements in volatility and correlation estimation techniques. Additional attention could have also been placed on the shortcomings of the current market structure and methods in finding and applying appropriate hedging strategies and instruments. In the fledgling power market, this continues to be one of the primary challenges. In summary, this second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in the prior edition and is a valuable reference book for the new recruit or seasoned veteran.

Translate to English","output":"Our goal was to improve the visibility and effectiveness of the union in the current global landscape. In order to provide a detailed explanation for this statement, it is important to understand the context and the objectives behind the statement. The reference to \\"union\\" may pertain to the European Union, or any other form of alliance or organization that aims to increase its presence and impact on a global scale. In general, unions or organizations are formed to strengthen the bond and collaboration between its members, and to work collectively toward common goals and interests. In this case, the primary goal is to enhance the visibility and effectiveness of the union worldwide. Firstly, to improve the visibility of the union globally, it is essential to invest in strategic communication and public diplomacy efforts. This involves raising awareness about the union's goals, values, and achievements, and showcasing its projects and success stories. Consistent and transparent messaging through various channels such as social media, websites, and press releases will contribute to raising the union's public profile and attracting international interest. Engaging with key stakeholders, including policymakers, business leaders, media, and the general public, will further strengthen the union's position and credibility in the international community. Secondly, increasing the union's effectiveness on the global stage requires solid cooperation and coordination among its member states. This can be achieved by developing common policies and frameworks, investing in joint projects, and sharing best practices and expertise. Working as a collective enables the union to pool its resources, in terms of knowledge, experience, finances, and technical capabilities, to tackle global challenges more efficiently.

Its capital was the city of Soba, located near modern-day Khartoum at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers. Founded sometime after the ancient kingdom of Kush fell, in around 350 AD, Alodia is first mentioned in historical records in 569. It was the last of the three Nubian kingdoms to convert to Christianity in 580 following Nobadia and Makuria. It possibly reached its peak during the 9th–12th centuries when records show that it exceeded its northern neighbor, Makuria, with which it maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity. Being a large, multicultural state, Alodia was administered by a powerful king and provincial governors appointed by him. The capital Soba, described as a town of \\"extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens\\", prospered as a trading hub. Goods arrived from Makuria, the Middle East, western Africa, India and even China. Literacy in both Nubian and Greek flourished. From the 12th, and especially the 13th century, Alodia was declining, possibly because of invasions from the south, droughts and a shift of trade routes. In the 14th century, the country might have been ravaged by the plague, while Arab tribes began to migrate into the Upper Nile valley. By around 1500 Soba had fallen to either Arabs or the Funj. This likely marked the end of Alodia, although some Sudanese oral traditions claimed that it survived in the form of the kingdom of Fazughli within the Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands. After the destruction of Soba, the Funj established the Sultanate of Sennar, ushering in a period of Islamization and Arabization., what would be the answer ?

Context: Voters in Pennsylvania head to the polls Tuesday in a special congressional election with national implications for President Donald Trump and opposition Democrats. The election is taking place in a congressional district that Trump won by 19 points in 2016, but where Democrats now hope for an upset that could be a preview of the midterm congressional elections in November. The race pits Democrat Conor Lamb against Republican Rick Saccone. Saccone got some high-profile help on Saturday when Trump spoke on his behalf at a rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. \\"We need him. We need Republicans. We need the votes. Otherwise, they are going to take away your tax cuts. They are going to take away your Second Amendment rights,\\" Trump warned the crowd. Though Trump easily won the district in 2016, Lamb appears to be competitive in part because he is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who personally opposes abortion and any new gun control measures. Lamb is hoping to pull off an upset with help from former Vice President Joe Biden. \\"Passion and commitment rules in politics. Passion and commitment generates grass-roots support,\\" Biden told a recent Lamb rally. Republicans have poured money into the race, including millions of dollars in television advertisements in the final days before the election. Trump is trying to help Republicans avoid another setback on the way to the November midterm elections, where Democrats are favored to make gains. In making his pitch to voters this election year, the president remains focused on his tax cut bill, new tariffs on steel and aluminum, and a diplomatic opening to North Korea. But Trump remains stuck at about 40 percent approval in the polls, historically low for a second-year president, and a potential drag for Republican candidates in November. \\"He's doing nothing to expand his base,\\" said Jim Kessler of Third Way, a centrist Democrat advocacy group. \\"And also, political damage is kind of like sunburn.

It's apparent that the sentence compares the crane's ability to raise a ship and a boat. Given the situation that the crane can raise a boat but not a ship, it is reasonable to conclude that this difference in ability must be due to a divergence in the weights or sizes of the two vessels. Option i says, \\"the ship was heavy for its size.\\" This completes the sentence in a way that provides an explanation for why the crane could not raise the ship - it was too heavy relative to its size. Option ii says, \\"the boat was heavy for its size.\\" This option, while it could be a valid detail in some cases, does not make logical sense in this context. The sentence states that the crane could, indeed, raise the boat. As such, the boat being heavy for its size does not provide a valid explanation for the crane's ability to raise the boat but inability to raise the ship. So based on this analysis, the sentence should end with option i: \\"The crane could not raise the ship, but could bring up the boat, as the ship was heavy for its size.\\" This option provides a logical and coherent reason for the crane's inability to raise the ship but ability to raise the boat, showing that the task is rooted in the comparative weights and capacities involved."},{"instruction":"The cleaning process of the area involves hosing down whereby the cheese gets carried away into the company's drainage system, which increases the pollution load.

Little is known, however, about the techniques and materials the French artist used to create his unusual and complex graphic works. Now a team of US scientists and artists have used a light bulb, an SLR camera and a laptop to uncover new remarkable new details of Gauguin's printmaking process. Scroll down for video. The technique was originally revealed by peeling back layers of the 3D surface of the print 'Nativity (Mother and Child Surrounded by Five Figures),' made by Gauguin in 1902. The scientists used multiple wavelengths of light shining from different directions onto Gauguin's prints. The technique allowed the researchers to separate colour from surface shape, providing a much clearer view of the paper's topography. For the study of an artwork, the piece was fixed in place, as was an SLR camera. A light bulb was moved to 20 different locations and a photo taken of the artwork for each light bulb position. The digital data for each pixel of each image then was run through Cossairt's software. Essentially, the researchers were measuring only the response of an artwork's surface to changing lighting. For each image, they knew the angle of the lighting and the brightness of each pixel and from that they could can calculate the unknown - the surface structure. Researchers at Northwestern University say Gauguin formed, layered and re-used imagery to make 19 unique graphic works. The technique was originally revealed by peeling back layers of the 3D surface of the print 'Nativity (Mother and Child Surrounded by Five Figures),' made by Gauguin in 1902. Gauguin created the print using a layering of images created on paper by drawings, transfer of images and two different inks. The 'Nativity' findings overturn an earlier theory as to how Gauguin might have produced the print. Oliver Cossairt, who led the research, was 'blown away' by the scientific results, so the his team reproduced what they believed to be Gauguin's process. The printmaking process produced a piece of art very similar to Gauguin's original. 'To measure the 3-D surface of the prints, we used some very accessible techniques that can be used by art conservators and historians around the world to analyse artworks,' said Cossairt, who developed the software to analyse the imaging data. 'In applying these techniques to Gauguin's work, we came up with some interesting answers to questions about what his printing process was.' As well as 'Nativity', the team studied 18 other Gauguin monoprints in the Art Institute's collection. They used multiple wavelengths of light shining from different directions onto the prints to investigate the surface of the paper and re-evaluate how Gauguin created his works. The technique allowed the researchers to separate colour from surface shape, providing a much clearer view of the paper's topography.

'For each image, we know the angle of the lighting and the brightness of each pixel and from that we can calculate the unknown - the surface structure.' The surface structure of 'Nativity' revealed white lines, in which there is an absence of ink. This indicates those lines were created using a transfer process, where Gauguin drew on an inked surface, removing ink, and those empty lines were transferred to his print. Using a simple light bulb, an SLR camera, and computer software, researchers have uncovered new details of French artist Paul Gauguin’s printmaking method. The ink of the black lines sits atop ridges in the paper. Gauguin would have placed his paper on an inked surface and then drawn on the back of the paper, causing ink to be transferred to the paper where pressure from the artist's pencil was applied. 'Gauguin died more than a century ago, but there is still something to say, something new to find out, in large part due to this teamwork,' said Harriet Stratis, senior research conservator at the Art Institute and the museum's lead collaborator on the Gauguin project. 'Gauguin probably was doing these kinds of prints for five years, so this research puts a whole body of work together,' she said. 'The evidence points to a completely different artistic approach by Gauguin.' Casadio says that information such as this can be included in augmented reality apps to help art lovers learn more about prints just by pointing your phone at them.

Today, we are going to learn about two different types of households and find out which one is smaller in number. A \\"household\\" is a term we use to talk about the people who live in the same house or place together. There are many ways a household can be made. Some are made up of families, or friends, or people who just happen to live together. Today, we will look at two specific types of households: households with married couples living together and households made up of individuals living alone. First, let's talk about married couples living together. This is when a husband (a man) and wife (a woman) who are married, live in the same house. They may also have children or other family members living with them. Married couple households used to be the most common type in the past. The second type is households made up of individuals living alone. This means a person lives by themselves in a house and doesn't share it with anyone else. These individuals might be single adults who are not married, divorced, or older people who might have lost their partner. Now, let's see which type of household group is smaller. Over time, the number of individuals living alone has grown, while the number of married couples living together has gone down. This is because people are choosing to live alone or waiting longer to get married. However, there are still more households of married couples living together than households made up of individuals living alone. In conclusion, households made up of individuals living alone are a smaller group when compared to married couples living together. Although the number of people living alone is increasing, married couple households are still more common. I hope this helps you understand the difference between these two types of households, and how their sizes compare!"},{"instruction":"WASHINGTON — Legal experts cast doubt Tuesday on a list of questions the special counsel purportedly wants to ask President Donald Trump, saying they would expect the veteran prosecutor to ask more and more pointed questions. The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller — or any prosecutor for that matter — would ask an interview subject. \\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\\" Jaso said.

The figures were released by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). They show in 2015-16, 24% of students at Queen's University in Belfast and 21% at Ulster University got firsts. The proportion of firsts awarded has almost trebled since 20 years ago, when only 8% of students at Queen's University and Ulster University achieved them. The 2015-16 academic year was also the first in which it was more common for Northern Ireland students to be awarded a first-class degree than a lower second (2:2) grade. Meanwhile, 60 out of 210 graduates at St Mary's University College (29%) and 65 out of 270 graduates at Stranmillis University College (24%), both in Belfast, were awarded firsts. That equated to 23% of graduates overall, a sharp rise since five years ago (2011-12), when only 15% of students in Northern Ireland achieved firsts. By contrast, just over one in five students was awarded a lower second (2:2) degree in Northern Ireland in 2015-16. The most common degree, however, is still an upper second (2:1). About half of graduates - 4720 out of 9475 - in Northern Ireland achieved that grade in 2015-16. According to a UK-wide survey of the HESA data carried out by the Press Association, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of firsts awarded at some universities. The University of Surrey awarded a first-class degree to 41% of students last year, more than doubling the proportion five years ago. And firsts awarded at the University of East Anglia almost trebled to 37%. Overall, 24% of students at the 148 UK universities were awarded first-class degrees in 2015-16. Some critics, such as professor of education at Buckingham University Alan Smithers, have called it \\"chronic grade inflation\\". However, there have also been arguments that rising degree grades reflect the improved A-level grades of those entering university and a more focused attention to studying. The figures from HESA go back only as far as 1994, when only 7% of all UK graduates were awarded first-class degrees. They show the proportion of firsts at UK universities has more than trebled in the past two decades. Universities are their own degree-awarding bodies, so can decide their own levels of degree grades. First-class degrees will be an advantage for future job opportunities and some companies recruit only from graduates with an upper second or above. Some graduate employers have previously called for more detailed degree grades. What is a summary of this text?","output":"This is talking about how some schools and universities give students grades called \\"first-class degrees,\\" which are really good grades. In 2015-16, 23% of students got these great grades, compared to only 8% who got them 20 years ago. A first-class degree is better than a lower second grade (2:2), and the most common grade students get is an upper second (2:1). Some people think more students are getting first-class degrees because they're really smart, while others think it's because the schools are giving them easier grades. These good grades can help students get better jobs in the future."},{"instruction":"Premise: It must have been done since yesterday, otherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with blotting-paper and a hot iron.

Infamous Director Demofilo Fidani, however, is rightly known for some of the cheapest, trashiest, and, well, worst contributions to the genre. The plots of Fidani's movies were usually very weak, and since his talent was quite limited, he usually tried to sell the movies by adding famous Spaghetti Western names like \\"Django\\" of \\"Sartana\\" to the titles. I the particular case of \\"Giù La Testa... Hombre\\" of 1971 he just took the title of Sergio Leone's \\"Giù La Testa\\" (aka. \\"Duck You Sucker\\") and added 'Hombre'. The movie can be found under various titles (\\"Fistful Of Death\\", \\"Western Story\\"...), I personally bought it under the name \\"Adios Companeros\\", which this movie shares with another Fidani film with almost the same cast, \\"Per Una Bara Piena Di Dollari\\", which is also entitled \\"Adios Companeros\\" in the German language version. The plot is rather weak, it basically follows a guy named Macho Callaghan (Jeff Cameron) and his involvement with two rivaling outlaw gangs lead by Butch Cassidy (Jack Betts) and Ironhead (Gordon Mitchell). The leading performance by Jeff Cameron is, kindly stated, not very convincing. Neither did I find Jack Betts very good as 'Butch Cassidy'. B-movie legend Gordon Mitchell, however, is always worth a try, and although he probably wasn't a very good actor, I always found his performances in the Spaghetti Westerns quite funny and original, and he actually saved some of Fidani's movies (such as the rather crappy \\"Django And Sartana... Showdown in the West\\"). There is one very funny and original thing about \\"Giù La Testa... Hombre\\" - the great Klaus Kinski is playing a priest! I could have imagined Kinski in any role, but before seeing this movie I would never have guessed that anybody would cast him as a priest. Kinski is, once again, great, although he has only little screen time, and one scene, where he breaks up a fight, is probably the only good scene in this. One more interesting thing about this film is that the legendary director and king of sleaze Joe D'Amato did the cinematography. \\"Giù La Testa... Hombre\\" is a cheap, crappy film, but nevertheless, it has some funny moments. Being a Spaghetti Western enthusiast, I found it fun to watch, but if you're not, never mind this movie, or watch it only for the purpose of seeing Kinski play a priest. 3/10 Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)?

If you can take a plot and put animals as the main actors you will usually win me over. Homeward Bound did just this. They took a plot that has been as old as time and put a new spin to it.

Backed by nearly 60% of Labour members and supporters and presiding over a growing party, Jeremy Corbyn's position should be unassailable. It isn't, of course, because overwhelmingly his MPs still don't believe he will lead Labour to success at the general election. The expected wave of criticism after the English local elections was in the end a mere trickle, as a lacklustre performance in many areas was overshadowed by victory in London, and in some councils in southern England. The need to refocus on the referendum also stemmed the flow of denunciations. Talk of leadership challenges hasn't evaporated, though. Mr Corbyn has moved swiftly following the local elections to deprive critics of a stick with which to beat him - failure to campaign with any vigour to stay in the EU. Jeremy Corbyn wins Labour leadership Who's who: Labour's Shadow Cabinet He has featured in a glossy pro-EU Labour leaflet and delivered speeches around the country on the \\"progressive case\\" for continued membership. Sotto voce critics in the shadow cabinet believe now isn't the time to try to depose him, and that many new members attracted to Labour by his anti-austerity platform would see this as a parliamentary coup and rally to his defence. Some senior shadow cabinet members had been keen to commission polling to see if new members were becoming any more sceptical about Corbyn's leadership - and last month the Times obliged. A YouGov survey suggested that nearly two-thirds of party members would either definitely or probably vote for him again - confirming the cautious approach taken by some of his critics to an early attempt to oust him. So the assumption is that, if challenged, Mr Corbyn would get enough MPs to re-nominate him and enough party members would support him - so why strengthen his position? That's not to say others outside the shadow cabinet won't move to try to undermine him. They fear Mr Corbyn's supporters will change Labour's rules at this autumn's annual conference to make a challenge more difficult, and to make it easier to nominate another left-winger should he stand down before the next election. But at the grass-roots level there has been plenty of activity in the undergrowth. Self-styled moderates say activists from Momentum - the organisation set up to keep alive the spirit of the Corbyn leadership campaign - tend to be concentrated in certain areas. There have been battles to win delegates to Labour's annual conference and some on the centre and right are confident they will win enough positions to see off any rule changes beneficial to the leadership. That would give them longer to think and plan a leadership challenge. Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn has been doing what he can to avoid further open division. Jeremy Corbyn is nothing if not consistent. In the mid-1980s he campaigned against what he saw as a \\"witch hunt\\" against members of the Militant Tendency, as Neil Kinnock denounced them and had them purged from his party. These members, though, were indeed \\"witches\\" in the sense that they actually belonged to a different political party, the Revolutionary Socialist League - a Trotskyite organisation which aimed (with some success) to infiltrate Labour. Mr Corbyn was never a member of any such group, but he always favoured keeping the door on the left of Labour's broad church open. More than that - unlike some of his close allies - he isn't a natural knife-wielder. When he was selected as the candidate for Islington North, his local Labour party was bitterly divided. What helped gain him the nomination wasn't a purge of those to his right, it was the departure of \\"self-purging\\" members who left to join the new SDP. But Mr Corbyn to this day believes that it was the division of the left - rather than Labour's pro-CND, anti-EU, pro-nationalisation manifesto - which cost his party the subsequent 1983 election and he isn't keen to cause a formal split again. So while he hasn't compromised on his views - hence the review of his party's defence policy - he has signalled he wants to lead a broad movement from the left rather than a narrower but purer sect. By putting the mainstream chief whip Rosie Winterton in charge of Labour's response to the boundary reviews - which some on the left wanted to use as a means of deselecting MPs whose views they didn't like - he has signalled he isn't ready to launch an all-out assault on internal critics. This despite calls from delegates at the GMB union conference this week to unseat disloyal members of the parliamentary party. He also spoke recently at the annual conference of Progress, the modernising group in the party set up by, among others, Peter Mandelson - an organisation which, according to shadow chancellor John McDonnell has a \\"hard-right\\" agenda. Even Mr Corbyn's much-trailed \\"revenge reshuffle\\" at the start of the year left in place shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn, who had publicly dissented from his line on Syria. That was nonetheless seen as a sign of weakness, not magnanimity, as Benn's departure would probably have been followed by others. There is little doubt, however, Mr Corbyn has a greater interest in defending those to his left from expulsion. During the leadership contest last summer, various people suspected of not sharing Labour's aims and values were weeded out of participating. But those who suffered most from what was a relatively modest political purge were members, or recent members, of the Green Party. It was fairly easy to establish if they had previously stood as candidates against Labour. But many Trotskyist groupings don't often stand candidates against official Labour representatives, and relatively few - with some high-profile exceptions - were stopped from signing up as supporters and voting for the man who became party leader. Mr Corbyn certainly wouldn't favour throwing out those who might have to come to his aid in another contest. Nonetheless, beneath the surface, Labour's HQ-based Compliance Unit has diligently gone about its work of implementing and overseeing adherence to the party's rules - much to the chagrin, for example, of Trotskyite group Socialist Appeal. They have circulated a draft motion to supporters in Labour Party branches which states: \\"This branch notes that there has been a wave of expulsions across the country of Jeremy supporters and socialist activists... carried through by the shadowy and unaccountable Compliance Unit. \\"We call for the abolition of the Compliance Unit, which is acting in the manner of a vigilante as a law unto itself.\\" Note that they say the unit is \\"a law unto itself\\" - that is, this is not being done at the beck and call of the leader. But what has bolstered the spirits of some of Mr Corbyn's internal opponents has been his response to the recent spate of allegations of anti-Semitism among a small number of party members. He was initially criticised for acting too slowly but in the end, defended the use of the party machinery to suspend, investigate, and ultimately expel members who were alleged to have made anti-Semitic pronouncements - long-standing ally Ken Livingstone among them. The row has made it likely that the Compliance Unit will, if anything, be beefed up and not abolished. And all this, in turn, is beginning - just beginning - to draw criticism from the left. The Trotskyist Socialist Worker opined recently: \\"It's essential to defend the right of socialists to criticise Israel and oppose Zionism. \\"There's a real danger that, in their seemingly endless adjustments to pressure from the right, Mr Corbyn - and especially John McDonnell - may lose sight of this.\\" And a Labour-supporting contributor to the Morning Star - once the organ of the Communist Party - called for the Labour leadership to do more to face down its critics and make clear: \\"Anti-Zionism has nothing to do with anti-Semitism.\\" Those on the left are also pushing for the rules in selecting Labour mayoral candidates to be brought in to line with the rules for selecting a Labour leader - giving newer members a say. There will be disappointment if the leadership isn't able to bring this about. The hope of some long-standing Labour members and MPs is that many of the newer members from the far left get disillusioned with either Mr Corbyn or with what the party machine is apparently doing to him and simply clear off, leaving behind those on the soft-left who will genuinely worry whether he is the right person to lead Labour to victory. They take heart from that recent Times poll which suggested that while around two-thirds of members would back Mr Corbyn now, fewer than half (45%) regarded him as competent. With more time, they hope more people will come to the view that his leadership is a lost cause. But that's for the future. While some MPs report little activity at election time from the more recent members there is little evidence to suggest these armchair radicals won't still be in the driving seat when the next leadership contest comes.","output":"Despite securing the backing of 60% of Labour members and supporters, Jeremy Corbyn's position as party leader is still not entirely secure with critics fearing he will not be able to secure victory for Labour in the General Election."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Researchers named the wide, shallow bay the most likely landing spot for the Roman fleet after excavators found the remains of a defensive base dating to the first century BC in the nearby hamlet of Ebbsfleet, near Ramsgate. We came, we saw, we detected: relics from Caesar era among amateur finds Read more The ancient base covered more than 20 hectares and would have been ideally placed to protect the 800 ships the Roman army had to haul ashore when they were battered by a storm soon after they arrived from France in 54BC. “This is the first archaeological evidence we have for Julius Caesar’s invasion of Britain,” said Andrew Fitzpatrick, a researcher at the University of Leicester. “It’s a large defended site that dates to the first century BC.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Excavations at Ebbsfleet, with Pegwell Bay in the background. Photograph: Dean Barkley/University of Leice/PA Archaeologists got their first glimpse of the Roman base while excavating land ahead of a new road project. They uncovered a deep defensive ditch that looks similar to Roman defences found at Alesia in France, site of the decisive battle in the 52BC Gallic war. Further excavations uncovered bones that appear to have been damaged in fights and iron weapons, including a Roman pilum or javelin. The archaeologists believe the site included a Roman fort and served to protect Caesar’s ships from attackers coming from the north. “The main purpose of the site is to defend the fleet,” Fitzpatrick said. The Roman general’s own account of the invasion describes how the fleet set off from France on the night of 4 July but got swept eastwards by currents when the wind failed. Early the next morning, the crew spotted England and rowed west to reach land at about noon. The fleet was left at anchor at an even and open shore, Caesar wrote, but a high tide combined with a storm to wreak havoc on the ships, which broke anchor and smashed into one another. The general had the ships drawn onto the beach and set thousands of craftsmen to repair the damage. Pegwell Bay had not been considered a viable landing site before because it lies on the Isle of Thanet, which was separated from mainland England until the middle ages by the Wantsum Channel. But the discovery of the Roman base makes the bay the most likely landing spot, Fitzpatrick said. “The Wantsum Channel wouldn’t have been a barrier to such accomplished engineers as the Roman army,” he said. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The point of a Roman pilum found in the defensive ditch at Ebbsfleet. Photograph: University of Leicester/PA Pegwell Bay is the only large bay on the east coast of Kent with an open sandy shore that could accommodate the vast fleet, the archaeologists believe. With at least 20,000 men and two thousand horses to disembark, the ships would have taken up more than a kilometre of beach when they arrived. The British originally opposed the landing but on seeing the size of the fleet, retreated to higher ground, in positions that are now thought to be on the Isle of Thanet around Ramsgate. While the Roman general returned to France without leaving an occupying army, the treaties Caesar set up between Rome and British royal families led to rulers of the south east of England becoming client kings of Rome. Those allegiances may have aided the invasion by the emperor Claudius nearly 100 years later in AD43. “This was the beginning of the permanent Roman occupation of Britain, which included Wales and some of Scotland, and lasted for almost 400 years, suggesting that Claudius later exploited Caesar’s legacy,” said Colin Haselgrove at the University of Leicester. The findings will be explored as part of BBC Four’s Digging for Britain on Wednesday 29 November. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Archaeologists have identified Pegwell Bay as the place they believe the Romans landed Archaeologists believe they may have uncovered the first evidence of Julius Caesar's invasion of Britain in 54BC. The discovery of a defensive ditch and weapons led them to identify Pegwell Bay in Thanet, Kent, as the place they believe the Romans landed. The ditch, in the nearby hamlet of Ebbsfleet, was part of a large fort, the University of Leicester team says. Its location was consistent with clues provided by Caesar's own account of the invasion, the team said. Image copyright University of Leicester Image caption Archaeologists from the University of Leicester believe the ditch was part of a large fort in Kent Image copyright University of Leicester Image caption The team found part of a Roman pilum - a type of javelin Caesar's 54BC invasion, which ultimately ended in retreat, came almost 100 years before Claudius's conquest in AD43. The 5m-wide ditch was discovered during an excavation ahead of a new road being built. The university said its shape was very similar to Roman defences found in France. It is thought it formed part of a large fort protecting Caesar's ships on the nearby beach. Who was Julius Caesar? Image copyright Getty Images Born into a prestigious patrician family in 100BC, he became one of the key figures in 1st Century BC Roman politics. He formed a political pact, known as the First Triumvirate, with Pompey and Crassus. After successful military campaigns against the Gauls he invaded Britain, where he was eventually forced into retreat. He defeated Pompey in a civil war and declared himself dictator, but was famously assassinated by Brutus, Cassius and other senators in 44BC. His adopted son Octavian became Augustus, the first Roman Emperor. Image caption Julius Caesar's invasion of Britain came almost 100 years before Claudius's successful conquest in AD43 Pottery found at the site was consistent with the 54BC arrival date and the team also found iron weapons, including a Roman javelin. Archaeologist Dr Andrew Fitzpatrick said descriptions from Caesar's account of the invasion - which describes him leading a force of about 800 ships, 20,000 soldiers and 2,000 cavalry - suggested it was the correct landing site. \\"The presence of cliffs, the existence of a large open bay, and the presence of higher ground nearby, are consistent with the 54BC landing having been in Pegwell Bay,\\" he said. \\"It's a big force, and you need a big landing place, because simply to land that number of vessels you need a big front. \\"We think that the location of the site fits very closely with what Julius Caesar gives in a series of clues - he doesn't tell us in detail, but he gives some snippets, and by piecing those snippets together we think it fits very well.\\" Dr Fitzpatrick said the low-lying, coastal nature of the site was \\"defending the coast rather than looking inland\\", which led them to believe it could be Caesar's base. Image copyright University of Leicester Image caption The defensive ditch is about two metres deep Prof Colin Haselgrove, who led the investigation, said it was likely treaties set up in the wake of Caesar's invasion made it easier for the Romans to conquer parts of Britain almost 100 years later. He said: \\"The conquest of south-east England seems to have been rapid, probably because the kings in the region were already allied to Rome. \\"This was the beginning of the permanent Roman occupation of Britain, which included Wales and some of Scotland and lasted for almost 400 years.\\" The findings will be explored further as part of Digging For Britain, on BBC Four at 21:00 GMT and afterwards on BBC iPlayer. ||||| The first Roman invasion of Britain by Julius Caesar in 55BC is a historical fact, with vivid accounts passed down by Tacitus, Cicero and Caesar himself. Yet, despite a huge landing force of legionaries from 800 ships, no archaeological evidence for the attack or any physical remains of encampments have ever been found. But now a chance excavation carried out ahead of a road building project in Kent has uncovered what is thought to be the first solid proof for the invasion. Archaeologists from the University of Leicester and Kent County Council have found a defensive ditch and javelin spear at Ebbsfleet, a hamlet on the Isle of Thanet. The shape of the ditch at Ebbsfleet, is similar to Roman defences at Alésia in France, where a decisive battle in the Gallic War took place in 52 BC. Experts also discovered that nearby Pegwell Bay is one of the only bays in the vicinity which could have provided harbour for such a huge fleet of ships. And its topography echoes Caesar’s own observations of the landing site. Dr Andrew Fitzpatrick, Research Associate from the University of Leicester’s School of Archaeology and Ancient History said: “Caesar describes how the ships were left at anchor at an even and open shore and how they were damaged by a great storm. This description is consistent with Pegwell Bay, which today is the largest bay on the east Kent coast and is open and flat. |||||","output":"Archaeological excavations in Pegwell Bay on the eastern tip of Kent may have revealed the ancient landing spot of Julius Caesar’s invasion of Britain in 54BC.

Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic.

I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why. Maybe it was because my brother died in the same manner? He was certainly a character, an absolute nutter and ruthless bully who had everyone fearing him.

Options: - selling out - hitting the jackpot - receiving money - happy - getting paid Explain why a human would choose \\"receiving money\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"receiving money\\" as the answer to the question above because it best aligns with the context provided and accurately reflects the outcome of a legal judgment involving compensation after an accident. Let's analyze each option to see why \\"receiving money\\" is the most suitable choice. 1. Selling out: This phrase refers to compromising one's integrity, principles, or ideals in exchange for personal gain or success. It does not relate to the context of a judge's ruling or receiving money after an accident. Therefore, this option can be eliminated from consideration. 2. Hitting the jackpot: This expression is often used when referring to winning a large sum of money, usually in a game of chance, such as lottery or gambling. Although it might suggest receiving a large monetary award, it does not accurately depict the legal context and the specificity of a judge's ruling in the given question. Thus, it is not the best choice. 3. Receiving money: The phrase \\"receiving money\\" directly relates to the concept of obtaining monetary compensation. In the context of the question, the judge's ruling implies that the person involved in the accident would be granted financial compensation. Therefore, this is the most fitting answer, as it accurately represents the outcome of the legal judgment and aligns with the context provided in the question. 4. Happy: While being happy could be a potential emotional state experienced by the individual after the accident (as a result of the judge's ruling), it doesn't specifically address the question of what the individual would be receiving in full. As such, this option does not provide a direct answer to the query and can be dismissed. 5. Getting paid: Though \\"getting paid\\" may seem closely related to \\"receiving money,\\" it implies a regular income or compensation typically associated with employment or providing a service. In the context of a legal judgment following an accident, \\"receiving money\\" is a more appropriate term to describe the compensatory payment that the person would be awarded. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"receiving money\\" as the answer because it directly relates to the question's context, accurately reflects the outcome of a legal judgment, and adheres to the specific situation of monetary compensation being awarded after an accident."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"\\"Die Schönheit der Natur offenbart sich in den leuchtenden Farben eines blühenden Gartens, im melodischen Gesang der Vögel und in der sanften Brise, die durch die Bäume weht.\\" In English: \\"The beauty of nature reveals itself in the vibrant colors of a blooming garden, in the melodic song of birds, and in the gentle breeze that wafts through the trees.\\" This German sentence captures the elegance and sensory experience of appreciating nature's beauty in everyday life."},{"instruction":"Information: - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - A newt is a salamander in the subfamily Pleurodelinae, also called eft during its terrestrial juvenile phase. Unlike other members of the family Salamandridae, newts are semiaquatic, alternating between aquatic and terrestrial habitats over the year, sometimes even staying in the water full-time. Not all aquatic salamanders are considered newts, however. The more than 100 known species of newts are found in North America, Europe, North Africa and Asia. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental life stages: aquatic larva, terrestrial juvenile (eft), and adult. Adult newts have lizard-like bodies and return to the water every year to breed, otherwise living in humid, cover-rich land habitats. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Tylototriton is a genus of newts known as crocodile newts or knobby newts .

These factors include the customer's perception of the restaurant being overpriced, issues with the servers, and apparent disappointment with the overall quality of the establishment compared to other restaurants. Firstly, the reviewer explicitly describes the restaurant as \\"overpriced.\\" This indicates that they did not think the quality of the food or the experience was worth the amount they paid. An overpriced tag contributes to a negative review since customers expect to receive value for their money. Moreover, the comparison to Olive Garden seems to be a negative point in the reviewer's opinion. The reviewer suggests that if Olive Garden is considered the best in a person's hometown, then that person would probably find this restaurant to be superior. However, this implies that the reviewer does not think highly of Olive Garden and therefore does not view this as a favorable aspect of the restaurant under review. Next, the reviewer even highlighted an issue they had with the staff, particularly \\"off the boat Italian servers\\" who provided bad service and complained in front of the customers after receiving a 20% tip. This kind of behavior can be frustrating for customers and would contribute to an overall negative impression of the restaurant.

Unfortunately, the word discipline has come to have other less constructive meanings. Far too often discipline is thought of as punishment. To many people, to discipline a child means to spank him or use some other method of punishment. Such people consider discipline a way of either keeping a child from doing something or of forcing him to do something. It is the task of parents to build within themselves and within the children with whom they live this capacity for self-direction, based upon an understanding of what is required of individuals in a democratic society. This means learning to act in those ways known to be necessary for the \\"good life\\", not for one's self alone but also for others. Developing the capacity for self-discipline in a child is a long, slow process. Much patience is required on the part of the parents. During this development, it is important that the child's self- confidence and comfortable acceptance of himself should never be sacrificed in a disciplinary battle; instead it should be increased through the ways in which his parents meet disciplinary situations. Many parents show a good deal of impatience if the little child does not rapidly learn how to keep clean, eat well, be orderly, and do what he is told. They are so eager for him to achieve these things that they seem to try to push him rapidly through his baby period. They seem also to think that learning to do these things... Question: According to the passage, disciplining a child means _ for many parents. - developing his capacity for self-direction - helping him understand social requirement - setting various limitations to his behavior - punishing him with one method or another The answer to this question is:","output":"- punishing him with one method or another"},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more. They key is to cut it off at the pass.

He’s joining the ranks of big names like Johnny Carson, Conan O’Brien and Jay Leno who’ve said goodbye to their shows. Here are the biggest laughs and most emotional moments from late-night finales. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) On Wednesday night, David Letterman — the longest-reigning late-night host in television history — officially ended his run on “The Late Show” with a historic final episode. The 80-minute episode was packed with celebrity guests, video montages, flashbacks of famous sketches and much gratitude from the host, who thanked a long list of people who helped build his historic career. Here’s a complete recap, starting with four presidents and ending with an emotional performance by Letterman’s favorite band, the Foo Fighters. [David Letterman taught us to ward off celebrity stupidity. But stupidity won.] 11:35 p.m.: “Our long national nightmare is over.” Those are the words that kick off the episode, with previously filmed lines from George H.W. Bush; George W. Bush; Bill Clinton and President Obama. “Letterman is retiring,” Obama adds. All of a sudden, Letterman appeared next to him: “You’re just kidding, right?” he asked. Cue faux-serious looks to the camera. 11:37 p.m.: Letterman walks out on stage to massive applause — of course, he can’t settle down the audience, chanting “Dave! Dave! Dave!” “Stop right there,” Letterman commanded. “See, now what happens? We don’t have time for ‘giving gifts to the audience’ segment.” 11:39 p.m.: “I’ll be honest … it’s beginning to look like I’m not going to get ‘The Tonight Show,'” Letterman says. (Who had first “Tonight Show” reference at four minutes into the monologue? Collect your winnings.) Lots of retirement jokes: When did Letterman know it was time to retire? When Todd, the cue card kid, “came up to me and said ‘For the love of God, Dave, I can’t write the words any bigger.'” 11:41 p.m.: A new segment: “Comedy We Would Have Done Tomorrow” includes jokes about Hillary Clinton and “Mad Max,” of course. One downside to not having your own show anymore, Letterman adds: When he messes up, he’s going to have to go on someone else’s show to apologize. 11:44 p.m.: The hottest show when Letterman first started in late-night? “Keeping Up with the Gabors,” of course! (See, he really loves Zsa Zsa Gabor.) Letterman also finds it suspicious that Elian Gonzales now decides he wants to come back to America — should Dave be offended? 11:46 p.m.: Paul Shaffer gets a shout-out: “My good friend Paul, more than a guy who’s on television with me every night, a great friend, best friend and a wonderful guy.” Letterman claims he and Paul are taking their show to Vegas with their white tigers. Throw in a “Wheel of Fortune” sight gag, and that concludes the monologue: I'd like to solve the puzzle. pic.twitter.com/b7RxanEGy5 — Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) May 21, 2015 11:53: Before we go any further, Letterman has a quick word to his replacement, Stephen Colbert: “I’m very excited, I think he’s going to do a wonderful job, and I wish Stephen and his staff and crew nothing but the best.” Flashback time: Letterman over the years chatting with kids. He’s got a natural rapport, especially when making fun of their science projects. “The kids love me, ladies and gentleman,” he says. 12:04 a.m.: Final Top 10 list — the category is “Top 10 Things I’ve Always Wanted to Say to Dave.” It’s a celebrity-studded presentation: “I appreciate their time, their talents and their generosity,” Letterman says as the line-up began. 10) Alec Baldwin: “Of all the talk shows, yours is most geographically convenient to my home.” 9) Barbara Walters: “Did you know that you wear the same cologne as Muammar Qaddafi?” 8) Steve Martin: “Your extensive plastic surgery was a necessity and a mistake.” 7) Jerry Seinfeld: “I have no idea what I’ll do when you go off the air. You know, I just thought something — I’ll be fine.” 6) Jim Carrey: “Honestly, Dave, I’ve always found you to be a bit of an over-actor.” 5) Chris Rock: “I’m just glad your show is being given to another white guy.” (“You know, I had nothing to do with that,” Letterman shot back.) 4) Julia Louis-Dreyfus: “Thanks for letting me take part in another hugely disappointing series finale.” (Naturally, the camera panned to Seinfeld looking distraught. Letterman: “I had nothing to do with that either!”) 3) Peyton Manning: “You are to comedy what I am to comedy.” 2) Tina Fey: “Thanks for finally proving men can be funny.” 1) Bill Murray: “I’ll never have the money I owe you.” Letterman goes down the line and thanks every single one of them — and seems most excited about Peyton Manning. 12:15 a.m.: “Tremendous to see those people,” Letterman says of his Top 10 crew. “What a thrill, and I can’t begin to articulate my feelings for each and everyone of them over the years.” He continues to gush about Manning. “Did you notice me standing next to Peyton Manning, it’s like we’re twins?” 12:17 a.m.: Flashback to one of Letterman’s most famous bits from June 1996: The time he took over the drive-thru window at Taco Bell. 12:27 a.m.: A taped bit about a day in the life of Dave — here’s what he does on a typical workday: Rolls up to the Ed Sullivan Theater in a chauffeured SUV wearing cargo pants and carrying a duffle bag. Meets with executive producer Barbara Gaines, who chats about the guests coming up for the night. Lots of meetings and ringing phones. Apparently goes to the gym, then sits back and throws peanuts into a glass of water in his office. “You know what I’m going to devote the rest of my life to?” he asks the person behind the camera. “Social media.” Monologue rehearsal. “How come when Bieber crashes the high school prom it’s cool, when I do it, it’s creepy?” More show prep: Letterman watches White House correspondents’ dinner footage to get ideas for jokes. Quick rundown of the show in a conference room — Paul Shaffer briefly crashes. Dave runs on stage for the show. David Letterman saying goodbye. (Jeffrey R. Staab/CBS) 12:37 a.m.: Letterman gets serious and runs down his list of thank-yous. “The last six weeks, it’s been crazy. People have been saying lovely things about us and it’s really been over the top. I can’t tell you how flattering, embarrassing and gratifying it has all been,” he says. “We’ve done over 6,000 shows,” he continues. “I was here for most of them — and I can tell you a pretty high percentage of those shows just absolutely sucked. And also in light of all of this praise, merited or not, do me a favor: Save a little for my funeral.” He recalls visiting the Ed Sullivan Theater when he came to CBS, which was a total dump — it was crawling with rats and not fit for human consumption, Letterman swears. He thanks everyone who turned it into the beautiful theater it is now. To CBS Corporation CEO Les Moonves: “This man, over the years, has been a friend to the show, he’s been very supportive of the show and he’s been more than patient with me. And if this was a printed sheet of paper, you could underline ‘patient’ several dozen times. So I would like to thank Mr. Moonves for that support.” Outside the theater on Wednesday. (Andrew Burton/Getty Images) He thanks all the behind-the-scenes people: Props, audio cameras, wardrobe, makeup, etc. “These people, night after night, have put up with my nonsense and taken care of not just me but everybody on the show.” More gratitude: The staff, the researchers, the talent coordinators, segment producers, producers, people in the control room. (He asks them to keep it to just three drinks for the last night.) The writers: “I have been blessed and lucky to work with men and women who are smarter than I am and funnier than I am and I have always been interested in doing the show that the writers have given me. These people that I collectively have just now mentioned and introduced, believe me, this is absolutely the truth, deserve more credit for this show than I ever will. Thank you to all of those people.” Even more thanks: Announcer Alan Kalter; Biff Henderson; the band; and his good friend, “as good a friend as you can have in life,” band leader Paul Shaffer. “It’s so obvious every night and again tonight that they are so much better at their job than I am at my job.” 12:42 a.m.: Letterman thanks his beloved mom, a frequent guest. His mom’s response when he invited her on the show for the first time: “You have a show?” He thanks his wife, Regina, and 11-year-old son, Harry. They’re in the audience, a rare scene — the audience gives them both a standing ovation. “Look at that kid!” Letterman beams. “Thank you for being my family. I love you both. And really, nothing else matters, does it?” 12:44 a.m.: Now, time for the fans: “The people who watch this show, there’s nothing I can do to ever repay you. Thank you for everything. You’ve given me everything. Thank you again.” The Foo Fighters perform (Jeffrey R. Staab/CBS( 12:45 a.m.: Foo Fighters time. “These people saved my life,” Letterman says of the band, recalling the days of his open-heart surgery. He requested the band on his first episode back to play a song that was especially meaningful to him during his recovery (“Everlong”), but it turned out they were on tour in South America. But then they canceled the tour — and made it back in time to play the song. “Happily, ever since, we’ve been joined at the hip. God bless you gentlemen,” he says, gesturing to Dave Grohl and the band. “Alright, that’s pretty much all I got,” Letterman concludes. “The only thing I have left to do, for the last time on a television program: Thank you. And good night.” With that, the band launches into “Everlong,” while a montage of Letterman scenes from the last 33 years plays on the screen. David Letterman gets a standing ovation from the audience. (Jeffrey R. Staab/CBS) On May 20, David Letterman hosted his last show, ending a 33-year career on late-night television.

(Associated Press) The show ran 17 minutes over the usual hour, much of it because Letterman took the time to thank the people who worked for him. As the tuxedoed Foo Fighters performed \\"Everlong\\"— a song they first played on the \\"Late Show\\" when Letterman returned after heart surgery in 2000 — a long montage of photographs from three decades of television history zipped past on the screen. \\"The only thing I have left to do for the last time on a television program (is say) thank you and good night,\\" he said. Letterman presided over 6,028 broadcasts on CBS and NBC, the transplanted Hoosier making Top 10 lists and ironic humor staples of television comedy and an influence to a generation of performers. True to his self-deprecating style, he said Stephen Hawking estimated that tenure delivered \\"about eight minutes of laughter.\\" Letterman will be replaced in September by Stephen Colbert, who he endorsed by saying, \\"I think he'll do a wonderful job.\\" The taped intro of President Barack Obama and former Presidents George Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush referenced President Gerald Ford's declaration to the country when he took office following the 1974 resignation of Richard Nixon. Letterman sidled up to Obama to say, \\"you're just kidding, right?\\" Ten stars from Steve Martin to Tina Fey delivered the final Top 10 list of \\"things I've always wanted to say to Dave.\\" Julia Louis-Dreyfus, with Jerry Seinfeld standing nearby, said, \\"Thanks for letting me take part in another hugely disappointing series finale.\\" No. 1 was Bill Murray: \\"Dave, I'll never have the money I owe you.\\" Letterman joked in his monologue that he's been on the air for so long that the hot show when he started was \\"Keeping Up with the Gabors.\\" \\"You want to know what I'm going to do now that I'm retired?\\" he said. \\"By God, I hope to become the new face of Scientology.\\" From his start on NBC's \\"Late Night\\" in February 1982, Letterman's comedy was about more than telling jokes. He attached a camera to a monkey's back, tossed watermelons off a roof and wore a suit of Alka-Seltzer to plunge into a tank of water. Celebrities used to being fawned over either clicked with his prickly personality or didn't, and when Cher called him a more profane version of \\"jerk,\\" it became a memorable moment. He shifted to CBS in 1993 when NBC gave the \\"Tonight\\" show to Jay Leno instead of Letterman, a slight he never forgot or forgave. Letterman even began his final monologue Wednesday by joking, \\"It's beginning to look like I'm not going to get the 'Tonight' show.\\" The tricks subsided as Letterman mellowed with age and fatherhood. His audience welcomed him back after a heart bypass, listened as he became the first late-night host back on the air after the 2001 terrorist attacks and saw him acknowledge to inappropriately having sex with a subordinate. \\"When I screw up now, and Lord knows I'll be screwing up, I'll have to go on somebody else's show to apologize,\\" Letterman said. With his monologue and Top 10 list, the final show kept the same format of thousands before them, although he gave no one the pressure of being a guest on the final show. Murray played that part Tuesday night. His last few weeks have been warmly nostalgic, with Letterman entertaining old friends like Tom Hanks, George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Oprah Winfrey. Anticipating the end, viewers sent Letterman to the top of the late-night ratings the week before last for the first time since Jimmy Fallon took over at \\"Tonight\\" and they competed with original telecasts. Letterman, before saying goodbye, thanked virtually everyone involved with the show from CBS Corp. Chairman Leslie Moonves to his researchers and crew members. \\"It's so obvious every night and again tonight that they were so much better at their jobs than I am at my job,\\" he said. Letterman remained dry-eyed throughout the broadcast, but several audience members who filed out of the Ed Sullivan Theater had tears in their eyes. \\"He was guarded but you could tell it was really hard for him,\\" said John Bernstein, who flew in from Los Angeles to attend the final taping. \\"You could see his emotion. But I think he's feeling a lot more than he's showing.\\" Rival Jimmy Kimmel paid tribute to Letterman by not making a fresh ABC show on Wednesday, when he usually competes in the same time slot. Fallon opened his Wednesday monologue by saying: \\"I want to thank you for watching this on your DVR after you watched Letterman.\\" ___ Online: http://www.cbs.com/shows/late_show/ ||||| After 22 seasons, 4,262 episodes and tens of thousands of celebrity guests, it's no surprise David Letterman's departure from the Late Show is hitting a lot of stars pretty hard.

Hypothesis: The wheel is spun and then the ball lands in a spot that tells you what the winner is. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"To determine whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, let’s first break down and analyze both the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: The wheel is spun, the ball drops, and where it lands determines the outcome. In this premise, we are given a description of a process in which: 1. A wheel is spun. 2. A ball is dropped into the spinning wheel. 3. The position where the ball eventually lands will determine the outcome of the event, i.e., the result or winner. Hypothesis: The wheel is spun and then the ball lands in a spot that tells you what the winner is. The hypothesis presents a similar scenario: 1. A wheel is spun. 2. A ball lands in a particular spot (presumably after being dropped into the spinning wheel). 3. The spot where the ball lands indicates the winner of the event. Now, let's examine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, i.e., if the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. Both the premise and the hypothesis involve a spinning wheel, a ball being dropped, and a final position of the ball that determines an outcome. The main difference between these two lies in the wording. The premise presents a more general situation by referring to \\"the outcome,\\" while the hypothesis is more specific, stating that the position where the ball lands \\"tells you what the winner is.\\" However, the hypothesis is still a valid interpretation and a possible scenario of the premise. In the premise, when it states that \\"where it lands determines the outcome,\\" it implies that the landing spot somehow reflects the final result, which could also mean determining the winner in certain contexts. Since the hypothesis is a specific instance that fits within the broader description provided by the premise, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. So, yes, the hypothesis \\"The wheel is spun and then the ball lands in a spot that tells you what the winner is,\\" is entailed by the premise \\"The wheel is spun, the ball drops, and where it lands determines the outcome.\\" The hypothesis is a specific instance of the premise, and the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Warsaw Pact In April 1954 Adenauer made his first visit to the USA meeting Nixon, Eisenhower and Dulles.

His furniture designs were considered Scandinavian Modern. What is typical for his entire career, however, is a concern for design as a Gesamtkunstwerk, a \\"total work of art\\"; whereby he together with his first wife Aino Aalto would design not just the building, but give special treatments to the interior surfaces and design furniture, lamps, and furnishings and glassware.

Article: Bill and his family has been living in the six-family building for years. All the neighbors got along fairly well with each other until recently. An old man and his wife used to live on the second floor. Bill's mother and the old lady were good friends. Unfortunately the lady died last month. Her husband could not live alone, so he had his grandson move over and live with him. The grandson has become a problem to all the neighbors, especially to Bill's family. The walls of the building are thin and he is noisy. Bill is used to peace and quiet but the young man likes to listen to the radio late at night. Sometimes friends of his visit and they make a lot of noise. That is too much for Bill's family. Bill's mother once asked the old man politely if he was able to sleep well at night, but obviously the man didn't understand what she meant. If he did and spoke to his grandson, the young man obviously didn't listen, since things haven't changed any. Everyone in Bill's family agrees that something must be done though they don't want to hurt the kind old man. Question: The grandson makes a lot of noise as _ . Options: A: he never thinks other people might not be happy with so much noise around B: the walls of the building are thin C: he likes to listen to the radio at night D: friends of his visit Answer:","output":"The grandson makes a lot of noise as a combination of factors: he likes to listen to the radio at night, the walls of the building are thin, and friends of his visit, which contribute to the overall noise levels. However, option A - \\"he never thinks other people might not be happy with so much noise around\\" - could also be a possible reason, as it indicates that he might be inconsiderate or unaware of the impact of his actions on his neighbors. To fully analyze the situation, let us break down each option: A: He never thinks other people might not be happy with so much noise around. This could be true, as the grandson might be either inconsiderate or simply not aware of the inconvenience he is causing to his neighbors. This could be a primary reason why the noise issue has not been resolved despite Bill's mother's attempt to address it indirectly. B: The walls of the building are thin. This is an important factor contributing to the noise problem, as it makes it easier for sounds to travel through the walls and disturb neighboring apartments. However, it is not the sole reason for the noise, as the grandson's behavior is also causing excessive noise. C: He likes to listen to the radio at night. The article specifically mentions that the grandson enjoys listening to the radio late at night. This behavior is one of the primary sources of the noise problem and therefore is a valid reason. D: Friends of his visit. The friends' visits are another source of noise disturbance, as they contribute to the overall noise level experienced by Bill's family and eventually create discomfort among the neighbors. In conclusion, the grandson makes a lot of noise as a combination of factors, with his seemingly inconsiderate behavior being a significant contributing factor. Options C and D are specific examples of the noise sources, and option B indicates a structural issue with the building that exacerbates the problem. However, it is essential to note that a lack of consideration for others' comfort, as mentioned in option A, is also a key aspect of the situation."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Sentence 1: Josh promised himself he would start a business after college. Sentence 2: He needed money right after college so he got a job instead. Sentence 3: Ten years later he was still working at a job and was miserable. Sentence 4: Josh finally got frustrated and quit his job. A:","output":"What this task is asking you to do is to use the given title and first four sentences to create a cohesive story. However, the twist is that the last sentence you will write should not directly connect to the previous sentences. While it still needs to make sense within the story's context, it shouldn't continue the narrative you've established so far. Let's break this down into clear steps: Step 1: Understand the Story Firstly, look at the provided content closely. You have a title, 'New beginnings', and four subsequent sentences. From these, you can deduce that the story is about a man named Josh who dreams of starting a business but finds himself stuck in a job he hates. Step 2: Determine the General Direction Use the title and sentences to formulate a general direction for your story. In this case, it seems likely that the story should lead to Josh starting over somehow, representing the 'new beginning' from the title. Step 3: Create the Last Sentence Now comes the tricky part: writing a final sentence that does not directly follow the previous narrative. This means you can't continue what you've set up so far. For example, a sentence about Josh starting his business would be too closely connected. Instead, you might consider introducing a new element or twist that makes sense within the context but stands separate from Josh's business or job-related thoughts. Remember, even though the last sentence does not directly connect with the rest of the story, it should be contextually relevant. This could involve Josh's personal life, a moment of realization or even a completely unexpected event. For instance: \\"One morning, Josh noticed a strange stray cat that followed him everywhere.\\". This sentence introduces something new, is contextually relevant (it's about Josh), but does not directly continue the established narrative about his job or business ambitions."},{"instruction":"Paragraph: For thousands of years, people have found fossils.

Since Atom L is the larger atom, it is likely to have a bigger atomic radius and lower effective nuclear charge compared to Atom S. When a valence electron is removed from each atom, the remaining electrons will experience a lower repulsion and are drawn closer to the nucleus due to the positive charge of protons. In this case, since Atom S has a higher effective nuclear charge and a smaller atomic radius, its remaining valence electrons are expected to be drawn closer towards the nucleus compared to Atom L's valence electrons. Therefore, the removed valence electron of Atom S is closer to its own nucleus compared to the removed valence electron of Atom L."},{"instruction":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person whose mother works at the chicken shack? The film is set in the early 1980s in small town Virginia. Aurelie is the new girl in town, having recently relocated from Washington D.C. with her parents Jim (a former steward for Air Force One) and Jeanne. Jim is attending college on a scholarship to become a physician while Jeanne, now the breadwinner, works at the local chicken shack. Aurelie asks her parents if she can have a permanent to fit in with the \\"Farrah Fawcett\\" types in town. Her parents finally relent and take her to a local beauty school to get her hair processed at a discount. The result is disastrous, making Aurelie look more like orphan Annie than Farrah. She starts school and is immediately teased by everyone. She tries to befriend the only black girl in school, Lydia, but is rebuffed. Aurelie furthers her unpopularity by overly participating in class and is frequently bullied by a group of popular girls. Aurelie reluctantly takes a karate class in order to defend herself. She sees a sign on another beauty shop in town that advertises permanent fixes for 60 and resolves to make the money. Eventually the school holds a poetry reading contest, with a top prize of 75.

Paddon defeated Crocker 2009 again and took his third victory against Emma Gilmour in 2010 . Crocker defeated Paddon again in 2009 and took his third victory in 2010 over Emma Gilmour . Options: a). no b). yes","output":"a). no Although both sentences discuss victories that occurred in 2009 and 2010, they convey different information. Let's examine the sentences separately and break them down: Sentence 1: \\"Paddon defeated Crocker in 2009 again and took his third victory against Emma Gilmour in 2010.\\" In this sentence, Paddon is described as defeating Crocker in 2009, implying that Paddon had defeated Crocker at least once before (hence the use of \\"again\\"). Additionally, Paddon is said to have achieved a third victory against Emma Gilmour in 2010. Sentence 2: \\"Crocker defeated Paddon again in 2009 and took his third victory in 2010 over Emma Gilmour.\\" Here, the winner of the 2009 matchup between Paddon and Crocker is switched, describing Crocker as the victor. Similar to the first sentence, it is implied that Crocker has defeated Paddon at least once before. In 2010, Crocker is also depicted as achieving a third victory, but this time, it is specified that the victory came against Emma Gilmour. To summarize, these key differences are evident between the two sentences: 1. The victor of the 2009 matchup is different: Paddon in Sentence 1 versus Crocker in Sentence 2. 2. The third victory against Emma Gilmour is attributed to different individuals: Paddon in Sentence 1 and Crocker in Sentence 2.

The perfection of the music literally stole Grace's breath. She was no stranger to beautiful music, having experienced the spine-chilling excellence of grand orchestras and esteemed vocalists, but this... this was different. This felt unnatural, otherworldly even. It transcended the limits of human talent and skill, tapping into a realm she had never known possible. She realized with horror that she was no longer inhaling. Each haunting note of the melody seemed to claw at her insides, demanding her undivided attention and control. Grace gasped desperately, her body rebelling against itself, her mind willing her to breathe but her lungs refusing to expand. Her chest and head were in agony. The lack of oxygen caused her vision to blur, and she felt as if her pounding heart was seconds away from bursting.

She grimaced, mustering every ounce of her strength, and gasped, inhaling a desperate yet triumphant breath. Despite her success in defying the ominous music, Grace knew that it wouldn't let her escape unscathed, its deceptively sweet tune shifting into a menacing crescendo that grew louder with each step she took.

In Malaysia, Powell met with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has led the country since 1981. The Malaysian foreign minister, Syed Hamid Albar, later told local reporters that Powell had proposed that American and Malaysian officials review the idea of forming a regional training center in Malaysia to coordinate antiterrorism activities. His brief stop in Malaysia also highlighted the moral ambiguities of the effort to prevent terrorism and its emphasis on cooperation with governments that the United States has often criticized. The United States once distanced itself from Mahathir for strong-arm tactics with political rivals, and human rights groups criticize him for arresting and jailing scores of suspected militants, including some who may be linked to al-Qaida, without trial. Powell said his discussions with Mahathir \\"touched on the case\\" of his former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who is serving a 15-year sentence on charges of sodomy and abuse of power after trials that Powell said the United States had \\"always felt\\" were flawed.

He was the offspring of the monsters Echidna and Typhon, and the brother of Cerberus, who was also a multi-headed guard dog.","output":"The sentence \\"Orthus was a guard\\" is true based on the text provided. In Greek mythology, Orthrus (also spelled as Orthus) was, as characterized by the mythographer Apollodorus, a two-headed dog who had the responsibility of protecting, or guarding, Geryon's cattle. Therefore, his role was indeed that of a guard. In Greek mythology, the term 'guard' doesn't always refer to a human figure as in common understanding, but can also refer to creatures like Orthus assigned to protect a particular entity, object or place. His task was similar to a guard's job of securing an area or property from unwanted intruders, ensuring the safety of what they are tasked to protect. Furthermore, not only does the text explicitly mention that Orthus had the job of a guard, it also indicates that this is a recurring role within his family. His brother, Cerberus, was also a multi-headed guard dog, implying that guard duty is a familiar role within his lineage. Adding to that, his parents, the monsters Echidna and Typhon, were notorious figures in the mythological world, probably indicating the source of Orthrus' formidable protective abilities. Ultimately, considering Orthus' duty to safeguard Geryon's cattle and his familial line of other mythological creatures known for their protective roles, it's evident that the role of a 'guard' aptly fits the characterisation of Orthrus in Greek mythology. Hence, the sentence \\"Orthus was a guard\\" is accurate as per the text provided."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Turkish: Late last year, the government undertook ten measures to protect the economy from the world's financial disarray.

Answer the above question based on the context below: College student Sarah Foster is found by the police, as she is sleepwalking in her nightgown on the road. Since the suicide of her husband Jonathon, who worked as a novelist, she is suffering from sleep disorder. A few days later, she talks to Dr Cooper, whose student she was, about the sleepwalking and a recurring nightmare, in which she is attacked by an unknown man. Cooper sends her to a therapy in a sleep laboratory. During a walk on a cemetery, Sarah talks about it with her room mate Dawn, who shows a personal interest in her professor Owen. Then an attractive man gets out of a black car and Sarah imagines him being a single. At the evening in the sleep laboratory, Dr. Koslov explains to her that her neuronal activity will be observed during the night. He also introduces her to Dr. Scott White, the director of the lab. It is the man whom Sarah has seen at the cemetery. He tells her, that a student was buried and he was there with a colleague.

Although her works on coal and viruses were appreciated in her lifetime, her contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA were largely recognised posthumously. Born to a prominent British Jewish family, Franklin was educated at a private day school at Norland Place in West London, Lindores School for Young Ladies in Sussex, and St Paul's Girls' School, London. Then she studied the Natural Sciences Tripos at Newnham College, Cambridge, from which she graduated in 1941. Upon the completion of their model, Crick and Watson had invited Wilkins to be a co-author of their paper describing the structure. Wilkins turned down this offer, as he had taken no part in building the model. He later expressed regret that greater discussion of co-authorship had not taken place as this might have helped to clarify the contribution the work at King's had made to the discovery. There is no doubt that Franklin's experimental data were used by Crick and Watson to build their model of DNA in 1953. Some, including Maddox, have explained this citation omission by suggesting that it may be a question of circumstance, because it would have been very difficult to cite the unpublished work from the MRC report they had seen. Indeed, a clear timely acknowledgment would have been awkward, given the unorthodox manner in which data were transferred from King's to Cambridge. However, methods were available. Watson and Crick could have cited the MRC report as a personal communication or else cited the Acta articles in press, or most easily, the third Nature paper that they knew was in press. One of the most important accomplishments of Maddox's widely acclaimed biography is that Maddox made a well-received case for inadequate acknowledgement. \\"Such acknowledgement as they gave her was very muted and always coupled with the name of Wilkins\\". Fifteen years after the fact, the first clear recitation of Franklin's contribution appeared as it permeated Watson's account, The Double Helix, although it was buried under descriptions of Watson's (often quite negative) regard towards Franklin during the period of their work on DNA. This attitude is epitomized in the confrontation between Watson and Franklin over a preprint of Pauling's mistaken DNA manuscript. Watson's words impelled Sayre to write her rebuttal, in which the entire chapter nine, \\"Winner Take All\\" has the structure of a legal brief dissecting and analyzing the topic of acknowledgement. Sayre's early analysis was often ignored because of perceived feminist overtones in her book. Watson and Crick did not cite the X-ray diffraction work of Wilkins and Franklin in their original paper, though they admit having \\"been stimulated by a knowledge of the general nature of the unpublished experimental results and ideas of Dr. M. H. F. Wilkins, Dr. R. E. Franklin and their co-workers at King's College, London\\". In fact, Watson and Crick cited no experimental data at all in support of their model. Franklin and Gosling's publication of the DNA X-ray image, in the same issue of Nature, served as the principal evidence: Thus our general ideas are not inconsistent with the model proposed by Watson and Crick in the preceding communication. Ask a question about this article.","output":"What was the significance of Rosalind Franklin's contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA and how did her work influence the research of Watson and Crick?"},{"instruction":"News article: Aspiring to Nothing Tina Beebe, an architectural colorist, painter and landscape designer, and Buzz Yudell, an award-winning architect, have a sneaky way of making everything they touch look easy and inviting. But transitions can be difficult even for those who are accomplished in the art of living well in homes of their own invention. The couple, who have been together since their days at Yale and are now both 66, have been collaborating at work and play for most of their lives. Still, moving on from their most celebrated residence, a cascading ocean-view villa on the outskirts of Malibu, to a more constrained lot in Santa Monica hasn’t been altogether smooth. She misses her garden and the stars and seeing storms approaching on the horizon. He misses the rugged landscape and that sense of openness. And it goes without saying that Zephyr and Phoebe, their golden retrievers, miss their old leash-free life. “Buzz has always been more urban than I am,” said Ms. Beebe, who grew up in Oregon. “I cry when I see my old garden; we could eat from it.” What they don’t miss is all the upkeep, or the constant worry about fires. Or the crazy drivers and the erratic commute along Pacific Coast Highway 1 to the Moore Ruble Yudell offices in Santa Monica, where they work during the week. As Mr. Yudell said, “We found that the distance to Malibu was a little too remote as we got older.” There is nothing remote or hidden about the airy modern confection he designed to maximize every bit of sunlight and space on the 60-by-150-foot lot they now occupy in a neighborhood of multimillion-dollar homes here. They tore down the 1924 Tudor they bought for 2.75 million in 2007, which was in bad shape, replacing it with a 4,500-square-foot house that cost roughly 500 a square foot to build — a considerable sum, to be sure, but then again, it is nearly net zero, meaning it produces almost all the energy it consumes. One solar-powered energy system heats the radiant floors, household water and pool; another supplies all the energy for the home’s electrical needs, sending excess back into the communal grid. And there is no need for air-conditioning because Mr. Yudell incorporated many of the features of a passive house, so the home stays a livable 79 to 81 degrees even when the temperature outside reaches the mid-90s. The interior is spare and uncluttered, thanks in part to cabinetry from Henrybuilt in Seattle. Ms. Beebe likes to tease her husband about all the fossil fuel it took to get those cabinets to Southern California. “It’s a good thing that you saved all that CO2,” she said. Out of view, there is a closet with the few mechanicals the house needs, as well as a two-story cavity, in case they ever need an elevator, Mr. Yudell said. (For now, it’s being used as closet space.) Trevor Tondro for The New York Times “These are things,” he added, that “as a young architect, you don’t think about.” The aging dogs have been taken into consideration too, with shallow steps into the pool, so they can continue to swim. About the only contingency that hasn’t been provided for is overnight guests. Apart from a convertible couch tucked away in a library alcove, which Ms. Beebe calls the “we-hope-you-don’t-stay guest room,” there is a notable lack of bedrooms other than the master suite. On a recent sparkling December day, as a visitor savored the ever-changing light, the food, the conversation, the art and design, it became obvious why guests may need to be discouraged from overstaying their welcome. Of course, the neighborhood is noisier than Malibu was, and that takes some getting used to. That particular day, there was construction going on in the house behind them and jackhammers on the street in front, where workers were upgrading the gas lines. Then, all of a sudden, a SWAT team descended on the vacant house next door. Nothing to worry about, the ranking officer told the couple. It was just a city training exercise based on a hypothetical set of circumstances: An officer responding to a domestic-violence call was down, and a hostage had been taken. “We never had this in Malibu,” Mr. Yudell said. Ms. Beebe added, “Just forest fires.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article is about Tina Beebe and Buzz Yudell, a couple who are good at designing homes, and their transition from a beautiful house in Malibu to a new house in Santa Monica.

The last voyage of the Karluk, flagship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship in the Arctic seas, and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement of 25. In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, 80 miles (130 km) away. Conditions were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued. Historians have divided views on Stefansson's decision to leave the ship. Some of the... Answer:","output":"Out of the original 25 crew members on the ship Karluk, which sank in January 1914, 14 were eventually rescued. The ship got stuck in the ice during a voyage as part of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913-16. Over the months following the ship's sinking, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, initially on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. A few crew members, including the ship's captain Robert Bartlett, journeyed across the ice to Wrangel Island, from which point Bartlett and an Inuk companion traveled across the frozen sea seeking help. However, due to sea ice conditions, they were not able to immediately rescue the stranded party. The rest of the crew, meanwhile, survived on Wrangel Island primarily by hunting game, though they were short on food and faced internal disputes. Three more crew members died on the island before the rest were rescued in September 1914."},{"instruction":"New York, Illinois, and California are the most significant states that have not adopted the FRCP.

She loves to trick the popular kids at school and her younger brother Max (Alex Winzenread). On the way to a library, Cassie finds a mysterious Halloween store in an alley and goes inside. The store owner (Tobin Bell) insists on selling her an old book titled The Evil Thing, which contains a warning not to read it aloud or think about its monster called \\"The Evil Thing\\", a two-headed creature that sucks blood while the other head eats meat. That night, Cassie ignores the warning in the book and reads it to Max as revenge for him unplugging her computer in the middle of a report she was writing. Priscilla Wright (Brittany Curran), a school bully who stole The Evil Thing from Cassie's bag in school, films her jumping in fear, after using a CD player to play monster sounds outside in order to make the monster appear to have come to life. After Cassie's parents leave for a Halloween party and later that night, The Evil Thing is brought to life by Max's thoughts, and captures him, Priscilla and a Papa John's Pizza delivery man.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If there is less detergent available than needed for a dishwasher cycle, it might lead to a reduced cleaning performance for the dishes. The dishwasher relies on a sufficient amount of detergent to break down and remove food particles, grease, and grime from the surfaces of the dishes. When there is a lack of detergent, the dishwasher may be less efficient in removing these residues, which could result in dishes not being as clean as they should be. The perturbation of having less detergent available does have an effect on the second effect mentioned, which is the need for more detergent to clean the dishes properly. With less detergent available for effective cleaning, it is likely that the dishes would require either an additional cycle with more detergent, manual washing, or the need to purchase and use more detergent for future dishwasher cycles. In conclusion, the effect of having less detergent available would lead to needing more detergent to achieve the desired level of cleanliness for the dishes."},{"instruction":"Question: how does the e coli bacteria cause death? Would \\"Cells are able to survive outside the body for a limited amount of time, which makes them ideal indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination .\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"The E. coli bacteria can cause death primarily through the production of Shiga toxins, which are harmful to human cells. These toxins can damage the lining of the intestines and lead to severe diarrhea and complications like Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), a condition that affects kidney function and may result in acute kidney failure. In some cases, these complications can be fatal, particularly in young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems. The statement \\"Cells are able to survive outside the body for a limited amount of time, which makes them ideal indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination\\" is not directly related to how E. coli causes death. It is, however, a reasonable explanation for the use of E. coli bacteria as an indicator of fecal contamination in environmental samples, since the presence of E. coli can indicate the possible presence of harmful pathogens.

Given just six months to live, Maynard and her husband, Dan Diaz, made the difficult decision to move from San Francisco to Oregon, one of the few states in the United States with death-with-dignity laws. In the face of her own mortality, Maynard bravely embarked on a mission to lobby lawmakers in other states to pass legislation allowing individuals to choose how they want to die. 1. The Diagnosis and Decision to Move: Upon receiving her terminal diagnosis of Stage 4 glioblastoma, Brittany Maynard knew her time was limited. She and her husband researched states with death-with-dignity laws, finally setting on Oregon as their new home. This move represented their commitment to giving Brittany the opportunity to pass away on her own terms, surrounded by her loved ones in a comfortable and familiar environment. 2. Advocacy for Death with Dignity: Brittany Maynard's advocacy for death with dignity has been nothing short of inspiring. Despite her failing health, she has been vocal in her fight for legislation supporting the right to die.

Passage Translation: Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac (8th August 1902 in Bristol, England - 20th October 1984 in Tallahassee, Florida) was a prominent British physicist and mathematician and one of the founders of quantum mechanics. He won the Nobel Prize in 1933. Some considered Dirac the only serious competitor of Einstein in terms of mathematical literacy and theoretical foundations. Others, like Stephen Hawking, considered Dirac the greatest theoretical physicist since Isaac Newton. Dirac's biography refers to him as \\"The Atom's Sufi.\\" Paul Dirac's father, Charles Dirac, was a French-speaking Swiss and a university teacher. His mother, Florence Holten, was the daughter of a sailor from Cornwall. Paul had a sister named Betty and a brother named Felix. Felix's suicide in his youth greatly affected Paul. Dirac had an emotionally distant relationship with his father and hated him all his life. Instead, he had great fatherly respect for Albert Einstein. According to his wife, he only cried once in his life when he received the news of Albert Einstein's death.

The reason for this is the strong negative language and the context of the phrase. 1. \\"Appalling\\": The word \\"appalling\\" is an extreme adjective that is commonly understood to mean extremely bad, shocking, or terrible. It indicates that the subject being described is of very poor quality or is offensive in some way. This adjective itself sets a negative tone for the rest of the phrase. 2. Comparison to other comedies: By stating that the subject is \\"as appalling as any \`comedy'\\", it suggests that the subject is being compared to other comedies that are also considered terrible or offensive. This comparison further reinforces the derogatory sentiment expressed in the phrase. 3. \\"Spill from a projector's lens\\": The choice of words in this part of the phrase further adds to the negativity. The verb \\"spill\\" implies that the content is pouring or flowing out uncontrollably, potentially in a careless or disorderly manner. In this context, it creates an image of a messy, unwanted flow of poor-quality comedy, suggesting that the subject is far from enjoyable or well-crafted. 4. Use of quotation marks around \\"comedy\\": The use of single quotation marks around the word comedy indicates that the speaker may be questioning the subject's status as a comedy. It implies skepticism or sarcasm, suggesting that the subject is considered not only a bad comedy but perhaps not even worthy of being labeled as such. This further emphasizes the negative sentiment of the phrase. Considering these factors, it is apparent that the phrase \\"is as appalling as any \`comedy' to ever spill from a projector's lens\\" conveys a strong negative opinion about the subject being described, indicating that it is of low quality, offensive, or not worthy of being considered a comedy."},{"instruction":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.
