Research shows that the Arctic may become ice free in the summer for the first time in human history within by 2040. Estimates vary for when the last time the Arctic was ice free: 65 million years ago when fossils indicate that plants existed there to as few as 5,500 years ago; ice and ocean cores going back 8000 years to the last warm period or 125,000 during the last intraglacial period.Warming temperatures in the Arctic may cause large amounts of fresh meltwater to enter the north Atlantic, possibly disrupting global ocean current patterns. Potentially severe changes in the Earth's climate might then ensue.As the extent of sea ice diminishes and sea level rises, the effect of storms such as the Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012 on open water increases, as does possible salt-water damage to vegetation on shore at locations such as the Mackenzie's river delta as stronger storm surges become more likely.Global warming has increased encounters between polar bears and humans. Reduced sea ice due to melting is causing polar bears to search for new sources of food. Beginning in December 2018 and coming to an apex in February 2019, a mass invasion of polar bears into the archipelago of Novaya Zemlya caused local authorities to declare a state of emergency. Dozens of polar bears were seen entering homes and public buildings and inhabited areas. Now, I have a new situation: Mike was reading about climate change.

Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere. I am facing a new situation today: John is an automotive enthusiast. He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which car would emit less unburned hydrocarbons, car A or car B?","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article about the function of catalytic converters, car A with the catalytic converter will emit less unburned hydrocarbons compared to car B, which does not have a catalytic converter. Catalytic converters work by increasing the rate of several important chemical reactions in the exhaust gases, which reduces the emission of harmful pollutants. Unburned hydrocarbons are one such pollutant that gets released during the combustion of fuel in a car engine. When exhaust gases from the combustion process pass through a catalytic converter, the unburned hydrocarbons present in these gases react with the catalyst to form less harmful compounds, such as carbon dioxide and water. In the case of car A with the catalytic converter, the harmful unburned hydrocarbons will undergo this conversion, thus reducing the amount of unburned hydrocarbons released into the atmosphere. Conversely, car B without a catalytic converter will not have this process taking place, and the exhaust gases from its engine will still contain unburned hydrocarbons, which will be released directly into the environment. While John may find the design of the older car, car B, more attractive, its lack of a catalytic converter means that it will emit higher levels of unburned hydrocarbons. In terms of emissions and environmental impact, car A with the catalytic converter would be a better choice as it releases fewer unburned hydrocarbons, contributing to a cleaner atmosphere and reduced air pollution."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: Loch Fyne eatType restaurant; Loch Fyne food Fast food; Loch Fyne familyFriendly yes Sentence:","output":"The Loch Fyne eatType restaurant, known for its delicious fast food offerings, is a family-friendly dining destination where people of all ages can enjoy a scrumptious meal in a warm and welcoming atmosphere."},{"instruction":"Article: In his Harvard \\"Lectures on Pragmatism\\" (1903), Peirce enumerated what he called the \\"three cotary propositions of pragmatism\\" (L: cos, cotis whetstone), saying that they \\"put the edge on the maxim of pragmatism\\". First among these he listed the peripatetic-thomist observation mentioned above, but he further observed that this link between sensory perception and intellectual conception is a two-way street. That is, it can be taken to say that whatever we find in the intellect is also incipiently in the senses. Hence, if theories are theory-laden then so are the senses, and perception itself can be seen as a species of abductive inference, its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique – in a word, incorrigible. This in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts, since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or \\"thisness\\" – what the Scholastics called its haecceity – that stands beyond control and correction. Scientific concepts, on the other hand, are general in nature, and transient sensations do in another sense find correction within them.

Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all. He eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and as a result he consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol. and a hint : Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis. Please answer this question : Who is less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Ronaldo is less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight compared to Jeff. There are several reasons behind this, which are primarily rooted in their differing dietary habits. As a nutrition enthusiast, Ronaldo consumes a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. By doing so, he ensures that he is obtaining the essential lipids needed for proper body functioning while avoiding the risks associated with high-fat diets. In contrast, Jeff's diet consists of an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol due to his unrestricted eating habits. Consuming too many lipids may lead to unhealthy weight gain, as lipids are very high in energy. A high-fat diet has several consequences, including an increased likelihood of weight gain and increased lipid levels in the blood. Elevated blood lipid levels can contribute to various health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. Cholesterol is the lipid primarily responsible for narrowing arteries, leading to atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by plaque buildup in the arterial walls. Atherosclerosis can ultimately result in serious cardiovascular issues such as heart attacks and strokes. Given this information, it is clear that Ronaldo's balanced nutritional approach, which includes a diet with appropriate amounts of fat and cholesterol, makes him less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight compared to Jeff. Furthermore, by maintaining a well-rounded diet, Ronaldo also minimizes the potential risks associated with consuming excessive lipids, such as cardiovascular diseases, making his lifestyle a more health-conscious one.

For instance, some mites consume plant materials, while others are parasitic and feed on animals' blood or skin tissues. In contrast, some mites are predators and prey on much smaller organisms, such as other mites or insects. Regarding the statement about spiders, it is not directly related to the eating habits of Acarina but rather focuses on the symbolic meaning of spiders in art and mythology. Spiders are indeed often used to symbolize patience, cruelty, and creative powers; however, this symbolism is unconnected to the dietary habits of Acarina (mites and ticks).

Step 2: Create a shallow pond or water feature Justification: Since frogs need both land and water environments, a shallow pond or water feature will provide the necessary aquatic habitat and allow them to easily move between the two zones. Step 3: Introduce native aquatic plants Justification: Adding native aquatic plants like water lilies, pondweed, and rushes to the pond will not only provide cover and a breeding ground but also help maintain water quality by absorbing excess nutrients. Step 4: Design a suitable land habitat Justification: Ensure there is a variety of well-drained but damp hiding places, such as rocks, logs, and leaf litter around the pond, as they serve as shelter and breeding sites, protecting against predators. Step 5: Attract beneficial insects Justification: Planting a variety of native flowers and plants around the frog home will bring in beneficial insects, offering both a food source for the frogs and improving the overall biodiversity of the garden. Step 6: Implement non-chemical pest control methods Justification: Using non-chemical pest control methods, such as using natural predators, will protect frogs from harmful chemicals, ensuring a healthy and safe environment for them to live and reproduce. Step 7: Monitor and maintain the frog home Justification: Regular monitoring and maintenance can help keep the frog home in optimal conditions and provide insights into the health and well-being of the resident frogs and their offspring.

Archie notices someone spying on the goings-on at the television set in the bushes, but he isn't sure who it is. However, he begins to believe Biscane is evil. He and the other babies sneak into Stan's office and decide to check out Biscane, but are spammed. When they hear some of Biscane's cronies approaching, Rosita, Alex and Finkelman run away, leaving Archie by himself.

A:","output":"In the movie \\"SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2\\", the super baby in question is Kahuna, who is a legendary baby with extraordinary abilities. He is the main hero who assists the four baby geniuses in combating the antagonist Bill Biscane, later revealed as Kane. The baby geniuses, Archie, Finkelman, Alex, and Rosita, have the ability to communicate using 'baby talk' and possess knowledge about numerous secrets. They become entangled in a scheme orchestrated by media mogul Bill Biscane, who intends to kidnap children all over the world. Biscane's evil plan involves employing a state-of-the-art satellite system to control the global population by brainwashing them and forcing them to watch television incessantly, subsequently leading to a life of inactivity. Kahuna plays a significant role in thwarting Biscane's malicious pursuits and rescuing children from being kidnapped. His heroic deeds include stopping Biscane's plots and saving children from various perils due to his extraordinary abilities. Kahuna teams up with the group of baby geniuses in their mission to hinder Biscane, with whom he shares a nemesis-like relationship. The movie begins at a daycare center, where Archie recounts the story of the super baby, Kahuna. He describes Kahuna's feats of rescuing kids around the world, including children from an orphanage run by the evil Kane. As the story unfolds, Archie's father Stan, who owns the daycare center, permits Biscane to use the facility as a television set for his new TV channel. Archie catches sight of somebody spying on the television set's activities and starts suspecting Biscane's ill intentions. Archie, along with the other babies, infiltrates Stan's office to seek information on Biscane. However, they are disrupted by Biscane's accomplices; while Rosita, Alex, and Finkelman flee, Archie remains behind. He eavesdrops on the cronies discussing Biscane's plan but struggles to comprehend it. Archie accidentally draws their attention but is saved by Kahuna, who continues to stand against Biscane and safeguard the welfare of children across the globe. In summary, the super baby in \\"SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2\\" is Kahuna, a legendary baby with extraordinary powers who collaborates with the baby geniuses to prevent Bill Biscane from executing his sinister intentions of brainwashing the world's population and promoting a sedentary lifestyle."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Pick one category for the following text.

Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars.

On a bright, sunny afternoon, Claire decided to venture outside on her brand-new bicycle that she had been excited to try out for weeks now. Living in a quiet neighborhood with beautiful, tree-lined streets, Claire thought it would be the perfect place to practice and hone her bike-riding skills. The first thing that caught her eye on her adventure was the combination of a brick sidewalk and a poured concrete driveway in front of a charming, picturesque house. Claire had always been fascinated by different textures and surfaces, an attribute that contributed to her passion for architecture and design. Intrigued by the contrasting materials, she decided to test both surfaces to compare which was smoother to ride her bike on. She began with the brick sidewalk, pedaling gently and cautiously. Soon, she noticed little bumps and grooves in the bricks that made the ride slightly rough but had a kind of rhythmic pattern to it. Despite the unevenness, the bricks were well-aligned and gave her a sense of stability. As she continued pedaling down the sidewalk, Claire started to feel more confident and decided to transition onto the poured concrete driveway. To her surprise, this surface proved to be much more intriguing and challenging. At first glance, the driveway appeared smooth and uniform, but as she began to ride across it, she quickly realized that it was far more bumpy than the brick sidewalk. The driveway had small, dried undulations from the pouring process and a few cracks here and there, each causing the bike to jolt unpredictably. Although the ride felt harsher, it also provided a somewhat exhilarating sensation as it demanded Claire's full concentration, making her feel as if she was navigating through a rugged terrain. After a while, Claire decided to take a break and park her bike against a nearby tree. Leaning against its sturdy trunk, she contemplated her recent biking experience. She found herself pondering the beauty in the imperfections of both the brick sidewalk and the poured concrete driveway, as well as the symbolism behind them. To Claire, the brick sidewalk symbolized a structured, organized life - planned and well thought out, with clear expectations and guidelines. Each bump and groove contributed to its character, making it reliable and familiar. On the other hand, the poured concrete driveway symbolized a life that was more unpredictable and thrilling. Its bumps and cracks were proof of the myriad of experiences it encountered, forcing her to stay alert and learn how to adapt to these challenges. In that moment, Claire smiled as she realized that both surfaces were essential and meaningful in their own ways. They reminded her that life is an ongoing journey with obstacles, choices, and moments of joy. It's not just about the destination, but also about how you choose to navigate the bumpy road along the way.

Article:","output":"Title: Election on 8 June: A Convenient Side-Effect for Theresa May and the Conservative Party Introduction The snap election called by UK Prime Minister Theresa May for 8 June 2021, is proving to be more than just an opportunity to secure a mandate for the Brexit negotiations. As it turns out, the election might provide the perfect opportunity for the Conservative Party to leave the lingering embarrassment of the 2015 general election expenses scandal in the past once and for all. The 2015 General Election Expenses Affair: A Brief Overview To understand the significance of this side-effect, it is necessary to revisit the 2015 general election expenses scandal. The Conservative Party faced accusations of overspending and misreporting of election expenses during the 2015 general election campaign, which led to a significant amount of unfavorable media coverage and put the party's credibility at risk. The scandal involved several local candidates and officials, including MPs, who allegedly failed to declare the expenses related to battle bus tours and accommodation costs. If proven guilty, the Conservative Party could have faced a significant financial penalty, an unfavorable verdict that might have contributed to its declining support among the electorate. However, many of the accused were ultimately cleared in May 2017, lifting some of the burden off the party's shoulders. The Snap Election: A Fresh Start for the Conservative Party With the snap election just around the corner, the Conservative Party now has the chance to move on from the expenses scandal that once threatened to derail its success. The election offers a convenient opportunity to shift focus from past shortcomings to a strong and stable leadership, as well as policies that support economic growth, national security, and a successful Brexit negotiation. Additionally, the Conservative Party, currently enjoying a considerable lead in the polls, has a golden chance to increase its majority in the House of Commons. A larger majority would enable Prime Minister Theresa May to move forward with her Brexit plans without facing unnecessary obstacles from opposition parties. Conclusion By seeking an election on 8 June, Prime Minister Theresa May has not only created a chance to solidify her position on Brexit but has also inadvertently provided a much-needed opportunity for the Conservative Party to move past the election expenses scandal. As the election campaign progresses, it is expected that the party will be able to distance itself from the scandal further, focusing on policies aimed at securing a successful future for the United Kingdom."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

While it is challenging to pinpoint the exact individual due to the limited information available, there is a particular lightweight fighter who fits the description: Mark Magsayo, a boxer who competed in the Lightweight division and was involved in an all-action and highly competitive slugfest in the late 2000s. Born on June 22, 1995, Mark Magsayo is a Filipino professional boxer, who initially started his boxing career in the Philippines before eventually transitioning to international competitions. In the span of his professional boxing career, Magsayo has been involved in many pulse-pounding matches.

Following his boxing career, Mark Magsayo chose to attend a university to pursue higher education.

Founded in 1595 as the Colegio de San Ildefonso by Spanish Jesuits, it is the oldest existing school in Asia. The university offers various undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate programs in diverse fields such as business, medicine, engineering, and arts. With its rich history and academic excellence, the University of San Carlos became the ideal choice for someone like Magsayo to further his education. In conclusion, although it is difficult to confirm with absolute certainty the specific lightweight fighter involved in a memorable 2009 slugfest, Mark Magsayo fits the outlined description. After being involved in numerous hard-fought battles in the boxing ring, Magsayo chose to attend the University of San Carlos in Cebu, Philippines, where he pursued a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration. This decision reflects Magsayo's dedication to not only his boxing career but also his personal and academic growth."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: and be a mother for awhile and then once they've gotten to school age maybe she could go back to work so she's kind of got that option if if they wait till later they've saved up some money that it's not as difficult for her to stay at home with the kids and live off one income or something Sentence 2: She will have to continue working everyday until the child is an adult.

Movie title: Lost and Delirious Movie plot: When shy and introspective Mary arrives as a new freshman student at an all-girls boarding school, she shares a dorm room with two seniors, Pauline (nicknamed Paulie) and Victoria (nicknamed Tori). In contrast to the timid Mary, Paulie is full of life. For example, at Mary's very first day at the school during a quiet afternoon party on the campus thrown by the staff as a welcome back gathering, Paulie turns the events into a loud music-blasting dance party and spikes the punch with hard liquor. In an effort to break Mary out of her shell, Paulie and Tori involve her in their activities, such as running in the morning. When Mary's roommates learn that her mother recently died, Paulie nicknames her \\"Mary Brave\\". Mary observes the intimacy between her two roommates. Peering out a window at night, she sees them kissing on a roof. At first, she thinks that they are practicing kissing in order to prepare themselves for kissing men, but she soon realises the nature of their romance. This also manifests itself in Paulie coming to Tori's rescue. For example, Paulie defends Victoria from a frustrated math teacher who unintentionally humiliates her when she does not understand a mathematical equation. When the three are jogging one day, Paulie comes across a hurt falcon, which she befriends. After reading up on falcons, she trains the animal and becomes obsessed with caring for it as she believes that something untoward has happened to its parents. While Paulie tends to the orphaned falcon, Mary and Tori meet some boys from the nearby boys' school. One of the boys, Jake Hollander (Luke Kirby), flirts with Tori, asking if she will be attending her brother's 18th birthday party and making it clear that he is interested in her. When Mary and Tori are alone, Tori expresses disgust at the boy's interest in her, saying, \\"He liked my tits.\\" When Mary asks if she'll go to the party, Tori says, \\"And have all those gross guys groping me? No, thanks. I'd rather stay home and do math.\\" Over time, Paulie and Tori become more... The answer to this question is:","output":"Mary is the one who is shy about sharing a room initially, as she is a timid and introspective person. As the plot unfolds, she gets to know her roommates Paulie and Tori better and becomes more comfortable."},{"instruction":"FINAL EXAM Question 1. What product does QST and Entrepreneur supply?

Which pack was preying more upon herds? Two packs of lions were hunting large herbivores. The Simba pack was ambushing wounded individual prey animals, while the Mobutu pack followed large groups of zebras and other grazers. Hint: Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator. The answer to this question is:","output":"The Mobutu pack was preying more upon herds. Although the paragraph does not explicitly state which pack was preying more upon herds, we can deduce this based on the information provided. It mentions that the Simba pack was focusing on ambushing wounded individual prey animals, while the Mobutu pack was following large groups of zebras and other grazers. The hint provided explains that individuals living in large groups, such as zebras, may be safer from attack because their group size can confuse predators, making it difficult for them to target a single prey animal. Since the Mobutu pack was following these large groups of grazers, it implies that they were preying more upon herds as compared to the Simba pack, which focused on wounded individual animals."},{"instruction":"What concepts are described in the following sentence? \\"The fourth place was Petter Solberg with 5 points.\\" Return the answer as pairs of triples.","output":"1.

A spaceship is traveling to another planet. The spaceship travels at a consistent speed its entire journey unless it is stopped for the crew’s break. After launch, the spaceship traveled for 10 hours then stopped for 3 hours. It then traveled for another 10 hours then stopped for 1 hour. After this, the spaceship would take an hour’s break after every 11 hours of traveling and maintained this routine until the end of its journey. If the entire journey took 3 days then how long, in hours, was the spaceship not moving?","output":"Step 1: Determine the duration of the journey in hours. There are 24 hours in a day. Since the entire journey took 3 days, we need to multiply the number of days by the number of hours per day to find the total duration in hours. Total duration = 3 days × 24 hours/day = 72 hours Step 2: Determine the hours when the spaceship was not moving during the first two breaks. The spaceship stopped for the crew's break after 10 hours of travel, stopped for 3 hours, traveled another 10 hours, and then stopped for 1 hour. This accounts for 10 + 3 + 10 + 1 = 24 hours so far. Step 3: Calculate the remaining duration of the journey. Subtract the duration covered in Step 2 from the total journey duration. Remaining duration = 72 hours - 24 hours = 48 hours Step 4: Determine how many 11-hour travel cycles are there in the remaining time. Each 11-hour travel cycle is followed by a 1-hour break. So, 48 remaining hours / (11 hours of travel + 1 hour of rest) = 48 hours / 12 hours = 4 cycles. Step 5: Calculate the total hours spent resting during these 11-hour travel cycles. There are 4 cycles, so the total hours spent resting would be 4 cycles × 1 hour of rest = 4 hours. Step 6: Sum the hours spent resting during the first two breaks and during the 11-hour travel cycles. Total hours resting = 3 hours (first break) + 1 hour (second break) + 4 hours (from 11-hour travel cycles) = 8 hours Final answer: The spaceship was not moving for a total of 8 hours during its journey."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: What is the nationality of the voice actress who sang \\"Do the Bartman\\"?

Barbarella crashes on the 16th planet of Tau Ceti and is soon knocked unconscious by two mysterious girls, who take Barbarella to the wreckage of a spaceship. Inside the wreckage, she is tied up and several children emerge from within the ship. They set out several dolls which have razor-sharp teeth. As the dolls begin to bite her, Barbarella faints but is rescued by Mark Hand, the Catchman, who patrols the ice looking for errant children. While Hand takes her back to her ship, Barbarella offers to reward Mark and he suggests sex. She says that people on Earth no longer have penetrative intercourse but consume exaltation-transference pills and press their palms together when their \\"psychocardiograms are in perfect harmony\\".

This movie was not intended to be a \\"deep thought\\" movie, which is what the vast majority of the reviewers seem to think it should be. In fact, it would appear that if ANY movie doesn't produce a life altering insight, and a deep, twisted, mind boggling plot, they would rate it a 1 or 2. Don't trash a movie because you don't like the genre, people. This movie was an Action/Comedy flick, and that's all it was intended to be. And for an Action/Comedy, it was very well done. I was actually rather surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did, having never really been a Jamie Foxx fan, and having the over-used plot that it has. The plot was nothing spectacular, using the typical criminal gets out of prison, and is thrown into bad-guy plot while trying to clean up his act (See Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk, 48 Hours, etc. etc. etc.) but it was warmed over with a bit of a technological twist. Now the \\"bad guys\\" are actually the \\"good guys\\" and the REAL \\"bad guy\\" is an uber-geek. Jamie Foxx actually plays a convincingly humorous, while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character, and didn't try to overdo the humor side of the film. If you're looking for a deep underlying plot such as in \\"The Matrix\\" or a drama such as \\"Of Mice and Men\\" then this movie isn't for you. But if you enjoy the raw action, excellent fast-paced filming, and an occasional twist of humor tossed in, this movie won't disappoint you.

He was a scientist who liked to study animals and plants. He is famous for his ideas about how living things change slowly over a long time, which is called evolution. When Charles Darwin was alive, people sent messages to each other by writing letters. They didn't have phones or computers like we do today. Darwin wrote lots and lots of letters to his friends and other scientists to share his ideas and discoveries. He also got many letters from other people, too! Now, some clever people decided to collect all of the letters that Charles Darwin wrote and received. They wanted to put them all together in a big book so everyone can read them and learn more about his life and work. This is called a project. But, making a big book like this costs a lot of money. So, some other people decided to give the clever people £5 million. That's a LOT of money, enough to buy a lot of ice cream! This extra money will help the clever people finish the project and make sure that all of Charles Darwin's letters are published in the big book. With the £5 million, the clever people can now continue their work and find all the letters that Charles Darwin wrote and received.

The best-selling single of his solo career, its lyrics encourage the listener to imagine a world at peace without the barriers of borders or the divisions of religion and nationality and to consider the possibility that the whole of humanity would live unattached to material possessions. Shortly before his death, Lennon said that much of the song's \\"lyric and content\\" came from his wife Yoko Ono, and in 2017, she received a co-writing credit.Lennon and Ono co-produced the song and album of the same name with Phil Spector. Recording began at Lennon's home studio at Tittenhurst Park, England, in May 1971, with final overdubs taking place at the Record Plant, in New York City, during July. One month after the September release of the LP, Lennon released \\"Imagine\\" as a single in the United States; the song peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and the LP reached number one on the UK chart in November, later becoming the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career. Although not originally released as a single in the United Kingdom, it was released in 1975 to promote Shaved Fish, a compilation LP and it reached number six on the chart that year. The photograph on the cover was taken by May Pang in 1974. The song has since sold more than 1.6 million copies in the UK; it reached number one following Lennon's murder in December 1980.

Given the question \\"How would office workers feel as a result?\\", is \\"excited to see Jan\\" a valid answer? OPTIONS: 1). Yes; 2). No;","output":"2). No; It is unlikely that the office workers would feel excited to see Jan if she constantly engages in conflicts and arguments with everyone in the office. In that case, the appropriate response would be a mix of emotions which would most likely lean towards negative feelings. The office environment is ideally meant to foster collaboration, productivity, and positive relationships among co-workers. When a person like Jan continuously locks horns with others, it could result in the following effects on her colleagues: 1. Anxiety: Office workers might feel anxious about interacting with Jan, as they may be worried about potential confrontations with her. This anxiety could make it difficult for them to focus on their tasks, impacting overall productivity and effectiveness. 2. Avoidance: Co-workers may try to avoid Jan in order to bypass any potential conflicts. This can lead to a breakdown in communication and teamwork, as people may hesitate to share ideas or collaborate on projects. 3. Resentment: Repeated confrontations and negative interactions can lead to resentment among office workers. This could strain relationships and might lead to a toxic work environment where trust and cooperation deteriorate. 4. Decreased job satisfaction: Working in an environment where conflicts are frequent and difficult to resolve can seriously affect an individual's job satisfaction. Over time, this may make employees less committed to their jobs and the organization as a whole. 5. Stress: Frequent stresses can significantly impact physical and mental well-being of office workers, which can manifest in absenteeism, reduced productivity, and even increased turnover. In conclusion, based on the given scenario, it would not be valid to suggest that office workers would feel excited to see Jan. Instead, her behavior would likely contribute to a range of negative emotions among her colleagues, such as anxiety, avoidance, resentment, decreased job satisfaction, and increased stress. In order to create a healthier and more harmonious work environment, it would be important for Jan to work on her interpersonal skills and adopt more collaborative and constructive communication styles."},{"instruction":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

At the court in Ferrara, a collection of ladies skilled in music inspired the composer Luzzasco Luzzaschi and caught the Duke's interest. This group, which led to the formation of the concerto delle donne, performed within the context of the Duke's musica secreta, a regular series of chamber music concerts performed for an exclusive audience. This preliminary group was originally made up of talented but amateur members of the court: the sisters Lucrezia and Isabella Bendidio, Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. They were joined by bass Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, who was specifically brought to the court in 1577 for his singing ability. The preliminary ensemble was active throughout the 1570s, and its membership solidified in 1577. Only later did professionals replace these original singers. The Duke did not announce the creation of a professional, all-female ensemble; instead, the group infiltrated and gradually dominated the musica secreta, so that after the dismissal of Brancaccio for insubordination in 1583, no more male members of the musica secreta were hired. Even when Brancaccio was performing with the consort it was referred to as a ladies' ensemble, because women singing together was the most exciting aspect of the group. This new ensemble, the concerto delle donne, was created by Alfonso in part to amuse his young new wife, Margherita Gonzaga d'Este (she was only fourteen when they wed in 1579), and in part to help the Duke achieve his artistic goals for the court. According to Grana, a contemporary correspondent, \\"Signora Machiavella [Lucrezia], Signora Isabella, and Signora Vittoria have abandoned the field, having lost the backing of Luzzaschi\\". The first recorded performance by the professional ladies was on November 20, 1580; by carnival season in 1581, they were performing together regularly.This new \\"consort of ladies\\" was viewed as an extraordinary and novel phenomenon; most witnesses did not connect the second period of the concerto delle donne with the group of ladies who sang in...

The Syriac equivalent is (ܩܪܝܢܐ) qeryānā, which refers to \\"scripture reading\\" or \\"lesson\\". While some Western scholars consider the word to be derived from the Syriac, the majority of Muslim authorities hold the origin of the word is qaraʼa itself.

Both sides had fortified their principal towns, the French at Plaisance on the western side of the Avalon Peninsula, the English at St. John's on Conception Bay. During King William's War, d'Iberville had destroyed most of the English communities in 1696-97, and the island again became a battleground in 1702. In August of that year, an English fleet under the command of Commodore John Leake descended on the outlying French communities but made no attempts on Plaisance. During the winter of 1705, Plaisance's French governor Daniel d'Auger de Subercase retaliated, leading a combined French and Mi'kmaq expedition that destroyed several English settlements and unsuccessfully besieged Fort William at St. John's. The French and their Indian allies continued to harry the English throughout the summer and did damages to the English establishments claimed at £188,000. The English sent a fleet in 1706 that destroyed French fishing outposts on the island's northern coasts. In December 1708, a combined force of French, Canadian, and Mi'kmaq volunteers captured St. John's and destroyed the fortifications. They lacked the resources to hold the prize, however, so they abandoned it, and St. John's was reoccupied and refortified by the English in 1709.

The crane remained standing Wednesday,","output":"its charred and blackened support beams a stark reminder of the harrowing incident that unfolded just a day earlier. Officials are now investigating the cause of the fire that led to the dramatic rescue, while praising the quick and efficient response from the Canadian Forces crew. As the fire rapidly spread through the construction site, it became apparent that traditional rescue efforts would not be possible. Instead, the rescuers had to devise an unconventional plan to save the trapped operator. The most logical approach was to use a helicopter for the rescue, given the height of the crane and the difficulty in accessing the stranded worker. Navigating a helicopter into position near the crane requires immense skill and precision, especially given the gusts of smoke and potential debris from the fire. The pilot and crew members were able to successfully position the helicopter close enough for the terrified crane operator to climb aboard, a feat that underscores their expertise and training. Once onboard, the crane operator was given medical care and emotional support to help him recover from the traumatic experience. Authorities are now looking into possible safety measures that can be put in place to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, ensuring that construction workers are better equipped to handle emergencies. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete this passage is to provide a contextual summary of the rescue efforts and an outline of the ensuing investigation, with a focus on the vital role played by the Canadian Forces crew. This serves to highlight both the heroism of the rescuers and the importance of effective emergency protocols in ensuring the safety of those working in dangerous conditions."},{"instruction":"Article: The drug store was closing for the night.

Sometimes, a little good advice is the best thing for a boy at certain times in his life and it often takes the youth a long time to grow up.\\" And he warmly shook Mrs. Higgins's hand. Back home, without even looking at Alfred, she said, \\"You are a burden. Your trouble came one after another, always! Why do you stand there so stupidly? Go to bed.\\" In his bedroom, Alfred heard his mother in the kitchen. Getting to the kitchen, he saw his mother drinking a cup of tea. His mother's face was a frightened, broken one, totally different from the earlier cool, bright face. She lifted the tea cup, her hands shaking, the lips moving nervously. He watched his mother quietly, without making a sound. The picture of his mother nearly made him cry. Realizing all the troubles he brought his mother in her shaking hands and the deep lines of worry in her grey face, he felt he shouldn't have done such a shameful theft to hurt his mother so deeply. He determined to grow up like a true man and protect his mother rather than hurt her again. Question: After the incident, young Alfred would probably _ .

No Lee gave nobody a bonus at christmas time that year. Given the question \\"What will happen to Others?\\", is \\"quite elated\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"Answer: [B]. No The phrase \\"quite elated\\" implies that the individuals involved are experiencing strong feelings of happiness, exhilaration, or excitement. However, given the context that Lee did not provide any bonuses during Christmas time that year and the question is related to the reaction of \\"Others\\" in this scenario, \\"quite elated\\" would not be a valid answer. The lack of bonuses given during Christmas time, which is generally considered a time for festivities, and an opportunity for people to share their appreciation and gratitude, might result in varying emotional responses among the \\"Others\\" in this situation. These reactions could range from disappointment, sadness, anger, or even indifference depending on each individual's personal preferences, expectations, or financial situations. It is important to note that the emotions and reactions of people in such a scenario can be complex, influenced by numerous factors including their interpersonal relationships with Lee, the company culture and communication, or their personal level of satisfaction with their job. Moreover, reactions to the lack of Christmas bonuses could be shaped by broader economic contexts, such as industry trends or national economic conditions that might affect employee remuneration strategies. In conclusion, as \\"quite elated\\" suggests an overwhelmingly positive response which does not seem appropriate given the context that no bonuses were provided during Christmas time, it cannot be considered as a valid answer for the question \\"What will happen to Others?\\" under these circumstances. Instead, exploring in-depth the different emotions and reactions of each individual involved would provide a richer understanding of the potential outcomes."},{"instruction":"Sentence: William Anders retired on September 1st, 1969.

Mrs Mc and I had just watched another live instalment of Broadchurch, murder mystery extraordinaire, particularly since in the second series there is no actual fresh murder to investigate. The verdict is about to be given on the accused killer from Series 1 when the inevitable happens... Cue title music.

Can you imagine falling into a big pool and not knowing how to get out? That's what happened to this little bear.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation 339y = 309y - 570 for y, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the variable (y) on one side of the equation First, we want to get all the terms with 'y' on one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 309y from both sides. 339y - 309y = 309y - 570 - 309y This simplifies to: 30y = -570 Step 2: Solve for y Now we need to solve for y. To do this, we will divide both sides by 30. 30y / 30 = -570 / 30 This simplifies to: y = -19 So the solution to the equation 339y = 309y - 570 is y = -19."},{"instruction":"Q:I can use this background: The Hawaiian Islands ( Figure above ) are in the central Pacific Ocean.

Process: 1. Sugar enters the body (through food). 2. Absorbed sugar enters the bloodstream. 3. The pancreas detects high blood sugar levels and releases insulin. 4. Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by helping cells take in glucose. 5. Blood sugar levels return to normal. Now let's consider macrophages. Macrophages are a type of white blood cell that plays a role in the immune response by ingesting foreign substances or pathogens. Given the information, macrophages are not directly involved in the process of regulating blood sugar levels. However, it is important to note that if a person has an infection or inflammation, macrophages may release various cytokines, which can have an indirect impact on insulin signaling and, therefore, blood sugar regulation.

How many 1L cartons of milk does Brian need to buy if each person is expected to eat 2 servings? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"Let's first calculate how many servings of lasagna Brian needs to make for everyone. There are a total of 8 people (2 adults, 2 kids, and 4 parents) - and each of them is expected to eat two servings. 8 people * 2 servings = 16 servings Now, let's figure out how much milk is needed for 16 servings. The recipe requires 1/2 a cup of milk per serving. 1/2 cup * 16 servings = 8 cups But we know that 1 US cup equals 250ml. Therefore: 8 cups * 250ml = 2000ml Since 1L is equal to 1000ml, we can represent this as: 2000ml = 2L Thus, Brian needs 2L of milk for the lasagna.

Let's solve this math problem together. Our equation is 0 = 19*x - 10*x - 63. 1. First, we need to combine the x terms. We have 19*x and -10*x. So 19*x - 10*x = (19-10)*x = 9*x. 2. Now, our equation looks like this: 0 = 9*x - 63. 3. Next, we need to move the -63 to the other side of the equals sign. To do this, we'll add 63 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 63 = 9*x - 63 + 63. 4. This simplifies to: 63 = 9*x. 5. Now, we need to find out what x is. To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 9: 63 / 9 = 9*x / 9. 6. After dividing, we get: 7 = x. So, the answer is x = 7!

Hands: The term \\"hands\\" is a key component in this sentence as it specifies the body part being used to create the gesture. It is important to understand that the emphasis here is on \\"hands\\" and not any other part of the body to create the mentioned gesture. 2. Thumbs up: \\"Thumbs up\\" is another essential part of the sentence since it identifies the specific gesture being made by the hands. A \\"thumbs up\\" is a very common and universally understood gesture that symbolizes approval, encouragement, or agreement. This indicates that the context of the sentence is about a positive sign or emotion being conveyed. 3. Gesture: The word \\"gesture\\" plays a crucial role in tying the entire sentence together. Gesture is a term used to describe an expressive movement made by the body or body parts to communicate emotions, opinions, or thoughts nonverbally. In this case, \\"gesture\\" acts as a general term which is then specified by the detailed description of \\"thumbs up\\" made by \\"hands\\".

Hill village is located on a mountain and gets lots of rain, and Low village is situated in a valley, and has more sunny days. But I can use this background: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] What is an answer for this question: Which village has more dangerous cycling conditions? Answer:","output":"Hill village has more dangerous cycling conditions due to its location on a mountain and the frequent rain, which can cause slippery roads. These conditions increase the risk of loss of control for cyclists, especially those riding brakeless or using fixed gear bicycles. In contrast, Low village has more sunny days and is located in a valley, making it less prone to such cycling hazards."},{"instruction":"Energy secretary Ed Davey claimed the green business interests of energy watchdog chief John Gummer were not conflict of interest.

The committee’s stringent, binding targets are the main reason why the Grid is set to spend £25 billion on its network by 2020 – a big factor in soaring household energy bills. This newspaper’s disclosure about Veolia Water UK triggered a long correspondence – published last week after a Freedom of Information Act request – between MPs, Lord Deben and Mr Davey. The latter said in a letter in May that he knew about Veolia’s energy business, but there was no conflict of interest because the firm was ‘mainly involved in infrastructure projects’. Labour MP Graham Stringer, a prominent climate sceptic, was scathing about Mr Davey’s role: ‘The whole of our energy policy has been distorted by green lobbyists. To say there is no conflict because Veolia is only involved in energy infrastructure is patently absurd.’ Last night The Mail on Sunday asked Lord Deben how much Veolia is paying him and how he could avoid making Climate Committee decisions that might benefit the firm. He did not respond. Mr Gummer, pictured second from left with David Cameron, Wetlands Trust chief executive Martin Spray and MP Zac Goldsmith, is the chairman of Veolia Water UK, which connects wind farms to the National Grid. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"In this article, Ed Davey, the Energy Secretary, said that John Selwyn Gummer, also known as Lord Deben, was chosen to lead an important government group that makes rules for renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions. Some people think that Lord Deben's involvement in green businesses might make it difficult for him to do his job fairly. However, Ed Davey believes there is no issue because those businesses focus on infrastructure and not directly on renewable power generation. Some people disagree with Ed Davey's view and think it isn't fair for Lord Deben to have a role in both his business and the government group."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise \\"compost pile i haven't been very successful i'm on my third year now and i still have a a pile in the back yard and it it doesn't decompose i guess i got\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"I have been super successful\\" is true (see options)? 1). yes; 2). it is not possible to tell; 3). no;","output":"3). no The hypothesis \\"I have been super successful\\" is not true because the person said they haven't been very successful with their compost pile.

Senators want to load up a routine spending bill with provisions to reopen the White House to tours, shield meat inspectors from furloughs and keep air traffic control towers staffed, among other changes that would rearrange the across-the-board cuts. Nearly 100 amendments have been filed by senators on both sides of the political aisle, stalling the measure that is needed to keep the government running after March 27. Without approval, the government would shut down, a prospect lawmakers and President Obama have said they want to avoid. “I have to say, I’m disappointed,” said an exasperated Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid last week as he assigned staff from both parties to work through the weekend to narrow the list. Any changes to the bill would need approval in the House, which has already passed the bill. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) has warned against wholesale adjustments. Reid scolded the senators for their “if he gets his, I want mine” attitude and warned them not to provoke “the ire of the speaker.” By Monday, the scope had been trimmed some, but not enough to produce a consensus from both parties. And Reid threatened to keep the Senate in session beyond next week’s scheduled spring recess if senators do not finish their work. “We’ll stay as long as it takes,” the Nevada Democrat said. Senators, though, are not known for easily letting go of the power they wield over legislation. They frequently use their ability to tie the chamber in procedural knots until they get their way. Not all of the proposed changes are limited to reinstating cuts made when the 85 billion in reductions began March 1 after Congress failed to reach a deal to avert them. Some deal with thorny domestic and foreign policy issues. One amendment, already defeated, would have delayed money needed for the new healthcare law. Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), a top deficit hawk, has filed a half-dozen amendments, including to freeze federal hiring and restrict the ability of federal employees to travel to conferences. Other amendments, though, go to the heart of the sequester cuts and seek to reshuffle the reductions in a way that their sponsors find more politically acceptable. Ten senators from both parties want to shift 50 million to keep air traffic control towers open, taking the money away from the Federal Aviation Administration’s research and capital accounts. “The president is playing politics with public safety by closing contract air traffic control towers across the nation — six in my state of Oklahoma,” Republican Sen. James Inhofe said in a statement. Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) led another bipartisan group that has proposed restoring money for a tuition assistance program for military service members. “Denying educational opportunities to our service members is the wrong way to find savings,” Hagan wrote in a letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. An amendment from Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) would transfer 55 million within the Agriculture Department to keep meat inspectors on the job. Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) wants to shift money from a Pentagon biofuels account to shore up defense operations and maintenance, as an Army depot in his state announced layoffs. Perhaps the most crowd-pleasing amendment is from Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) to reopen the White House to public tours. The cancellations have brought scorn from Republicans and others. Moran said the cuts should be made “in ways that do not intentionally and unnecessarily inflict hardship and aggravation upon the American people.” He proposes shifting 2.5 million from the Transportation Security Administration to the Secret Service to cover the 2.14 million needed to keep the White House doors open. Not all of the amendments will come to a vote. To do so would take more time than Senate leaders from both sides appear willing to give the bill. So far, only a few have been approved, including a proposal from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) to cut spending for proposed civilian military infrastructure on Guam. In fact, if the Senate amendments cannot be winnowed, as Reid has asked, the leader has threatened to force a vote on the overall spending bill without any amendments, which would certainly draw protests from senators. Boehner is keeping an eye on the action. Any changes would have to be approved by his restive Republican majority. “Our goal here is to cut spending,” he said. “It's not to shut down the government.” Follow Politics Now on Twitter and Facebook What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1.

An angry elephant took exception to having his picture taken - nonchalantly destroying thousands of pounds worth of camera equipment. The seven-tonne bull elephant casually threw the gear into a mud hole after discovering it near his watering hole. Photographer Paul Souders was trying to take close-ups of a herd of males in Chobe National Park, Botswana, when the giant mammal struck. Whoa Nelly! The camera goers flying after the elephant takes offence to its presence. Hope they were waterproof: Mr Souders went through a number of cameras getting the shots. But the costly lesson did not deter the American as he went through several expensive cameras, ranging between £395 to £3,945. He said: 'Elephants are intelligent and curious creatures so I wasn't surprised that he inspected the camera with his trunk, sniffing at it delicately. 'But the utter contempt and disdain when he picked it up and gave it a toss, that hurt my feelings a little.'

For a time the leader of the National Synarchist Union ( UNS ) , Abascal represented the orthodox Catholic tendency within the movement . - Falangism was the political ideology of the Falange Española de las JONS and, afterwards, of the Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista (both known simply as the \\"Falange\\"), as well as derivatives of it in other countries. Falangism is widely considered a fascist ideology. Under the leadership of Francisco Franco, many of the radical elements of Falangism considered to be fascist were diluted and it largely became an authoritarian, conservative ideology connected with Francoist Spain. Opponents of Franco's changes to the party include former Falange leader Manuel Hedilla. Falangism places a strong emphasis on Catholic religious identity, though it has held some secular views on the Church's direct influence in society, as it believed that the state should have the supreme authority over the nation. Falangism emphasized the need for authority, hierarchy, and order in society. Falangism is anti-communist, anti-capitalist, anti-democratic, and anti-liberal, although under Franco, the Falange abandoned its original anti-capitalist tendencies, declaring the ideology to be fully compatible with capitalism. - The National Synarchist Union is a Mexican political organization. It was historically a movement of the Roman Catholic extreme right, in some ways akin to clerical fascism and falangism, violently opposed to the left wing and secularist policies of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and its predecessor the National Revolutionary Party that governed Mexico from 1929 to 2000 and since 2012.

In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - The River Torrens is the most significant river of the Adelaide Plains and was one of the reasons for the siting of the city of Adelaide, capital of South Australia. It flows from its source in the Adelaide Hills near Mount Pleasant, across the Adelaide Plains, past the city centre and empties into Gulf St Vincent between Henley Beach South and West Beach. The upper stretches of the river and the reservoirs in its watershed supply a significant part of the city's water supply. The river's long linear parks and a constructed lake in the lower stretch are iconic of the city. - Adelaide city centre is the innermost locality of Greater Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia. It is known by locals simply as \\"\\"The City\\"\\" or \\"\\"Town\\"\\" to distinguish it from Greater Adelaide and from the City of Adelaide (which also includes North Adelaide and the parklands). The locality is split into two key geographical distinctions: the city \\"square mile\\", bordered by North, East, South and West Terraces; and the section of the Adelaide Parklands south of the River Torrens which separates the built up part of the city from the surrounding suburbs and North Adelaide. - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - The Onkaparinga River is a river located in South Australia south of the Adelaide city centre . It runs from its source between Mount Torrens and Charleston in the Mount Lofty Ranges , and flows south westerly to an estuary at Port Noarlunga . The catchment is over 500 square kilometres ( 190 sq mi ) in area , and in part includes the following protected areas - the Encounter Marine Park , the Onkaparinga River National Park , the Onkaparinga River Recreation Park and the Port Noarlunga Reef Aquatic Reserve . The Onkaparinga River is the second major river within the Adelaide metropolitan area , after the River Torrens . The name derives from the Indigenous Kaurna name Ngangiparri which translates as \`\` The Women 's River '' . In 1837 Surveyor General Col William Light named it Field 's River , or the Field River , after Lieut William George Field RN ( 1804 - 1850 ) of the brig Rapid , who carried out the first surveys in the vicinity of its estuary , but subsequent Governor George Gawler soon reinstated the Indigenous name . The first Europeans to explore its sources and the Onkaparinga Valley were the party of Dr. George Imlay and John Hill in January 1838 . It is a source of fresh water for Adelaide . Mount Bold Reservoir was constructed between 1932 and 1938 along a section of its path approximately 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) inland . Much of its flow is diverted via a tunnel from the Clarendon Weir to the Happy Valley Reservoir , that in turn supplies some 40 per cent of Adelaide 's water supply . Most years the flow to the reservoir is supplemented by water pumped from the River Murray via a pipeline from Murray Bridge . Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'mouth of the watercourse' with the subject 'onkaparinga river'.

The program impresses a grad recruiter for Dell at a career fair, and it appears that Clayton's future is on track.Later that night, Clayton meets Walter Burke (Al Pacino), who he had previously noticed hanging around at the career fair. The two begin talking, during which time Burke reveals that he is a CIA recruiter. Clayton, however, is not interested and Burke walks away, casually revealing to James a familiarity with his father. Clayton becomes intrigued and decides to attend the interview and selection process for the CIA's clandestine service.Upon arriving at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Clayton takes part in numerous assessments including psychometric, numerical reasoning, psychological, psychoanalytical, aptitude, as well as a polygraph test. During the testing he meets fellow recruit Layla Moore (Bridget Moynahan). Having been apparently successful in the selection process, he and the other successful candidates, including Moore, are driven by bus to the CIA training facility, The Farm, where Burke then briefs the candidates on the training regimen and various issues of espionage.Clayton and the other candidates then begin their training in covert ops and intelligence gathering. Throughout the various stages of the training, the instructors become increasingly impressed by Clayton's natural ability in the \\"black arts\\" of espionage such as weapons, classroom exercises, and his ingenuity and fast thinking when he manages to escape from a botched training drill by dramatically jumping through a glass window.One night, Burke takes the recruits present (all males) to a nearby bar to conduct a training exercise with one simple objective: to pick up a girl.

This requirement was intended to protect the nation from foreign influence. Is this statement correct \\"can someone not born in us be president\\"?","output":"The statement \\"can someone not born in the US be president\\" is mostly correct, but it requires further clarification of the term \\"natural-born citizen\\". The natural-born-citizen clause is found in Article II, Section 1 of the United States Constitution. It states: \\"No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.\\" As the statement suggests, the Constitution requires that only a \\"natural-born citizen\\" of the United States can serve as President or Vice President. To understand who qualifies as a natural-born citizen, we need to examine the historical context and legal interpretations of the term. The concept of natural-born citizenship finds its roots in English common law. According to this principle, any person born within the territory of a sovereign was considered a natural-born subject. When drafting the Constitution, several founding fathers were concerned about foreign influence taking hold in the highest offices of the US. As a result, the natural-born-citizen clause was incorporated to ensure loyalty to the nation. However, the US Constitution does not explicitly define the term \\"natural-born citizen.\\" The Supreme Court has not provided direct clarification on the matter either, leading to ongoing debates and varying opinions on the topic. There are three main interpretations of the term: 1. Birthright citizenship: Individuals born within the territory of the United States are considered natural-born citizens, regardless of their parents' citizenship status. This interpretation is based on the 14th Amendment, which states: \\"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\\" 2. Citizenship through parentage: In this interpretation, a person born abroad to at least one US citizen parent is considered a natural-born citizen. This is based on the various naturalization acts and statutes passed by Congress, which have stipulated the conditions for a child born abroad to acquire US citizenship through their parents. 3. A combination of the two previous interpretations: This view argues that both birthright citizenship and citizenship through parentage can qualify as a natural-born citizen status. Returning to the initial statement, it is possible for someone not born in the US to be considered a natural-born citizen and be eligible for the presidency if they fulfill the conditions outlined in the second and third interpretations. For example, if an individual is born abroad to at least one US citizen parent who meets specific residency requirements, they could still be considered a natural-born citizen and eligible to run for the office of President or Vice President. In conclusion, the statement \\"can someone not born in the US be president\\" is mostly correct, as long as the individual in question meets the criteria under one of the recognized interpretations of the natural-born-citizen clause. However, the issue remains open to interpretation and could potentially be clarified through future legal challenges or amendments to the Constitution."},{"instruction":"Does the anatomy of a camel lend itself to jokes on Wednesdays? Hmmm, my chain of thoughts:","output":"The connection between camel anatomy and jokes on Wednesdays seems to be based on a cultural concept rather than an inherent relationship. Let me explain your possible chain of thoughts behind associating the two: 1. Camels are known for their unique anatomical features, such as their humps, which store fat that the animal can utilize as a source of nourishment and hydration in desert environments. These humps, along with the camel's ability to travel long distances, make camels resilient creatures. 2. In popular culture, the day Wednesday is sometimes referred to as \\"Hump Day\\" because it is considered the middle of the workweek, suggesting the point at which people have made it halfway through the week and are now moving closer to the weekend. The term \\"Hump Day\\" is likely a reference to the idea of \\"getting over the hump,\\" or overcoming an obstacle. 3. Jokes involving camels on Wednesdays can also be connected to a famous internet meme that contains an image of a camel with the caption, \\"Guess what day it is? Hump Day!\\" This meme became popular because the hump of the camel is associated with the expression \\"Hump Day,\\" and hence, it serves as a reminder to people that Wednesday is the middle of the week. 4. The association of camel anatomy with jokes on Wednesdays is primarily based on the wordplay created by linking the camel's hump to the concept of \\"Hump Day.\\" Therefore, the connection is more of a tongue-in-cheek cultural reference than a genuine consequence of the camel's biological makeup. In summary, while the anatomy of a camel does not inherently lend itself to jokes specifically on Wednesdays, it has become tied to humorous references as a result of cultural associations, particularly the idea of \\"Hump Day\\" being the middle of the workweek."},{"instruction":"Remove the spaces from the following sentence: The place table is formed by 3 pieces:","output":"To remove the spaces from the given sentence, I will go through the sentence character by character, and if it's a space, I will exclude it from the new sentence.

This event, known as the \\"Grande Semaine d'Aviation de la Champagne\\" or the \\"Grande Semaine de l'Aviation,\\" was held between August 22 and August 29, 1909. The air show took place in the French town of Reims, located in the Champagne region, not far from Paris. The event was organized to promote and celebrate the advancements in the aviation industry during its early years. It brought together aviators, aircraft manufacturers, inventors, and enthusiasts from across the globe who showcased their flying machines, shared technical knowledge, and competed in various flying competitions. The 1909 International Air Show featured many famous aviators of the time, such as Louis Blériot, who was the first to fly across the English Channel, and Glenn Curtiss, an American aviation pioneer. Competition categories included speed, distance, altitude, and duration, with several world records being broken throughout the week. One of the most memorable moments of the event took place when Louis Blériot achieved the world speed record in his Blériot XI monoplane, reaching a remarkable speed of 76.9 kilometers per hour (47.8 miles per hour). Another notable event was the victory of Glenn Curtiss, who won the overall event and received the prestigious Gordon Bennett Trophy for his achievements in aviation. The success of the 1909 International Air Show established it as an important event in the aviation world, paving the way for the future Salon International de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace, commonly known as the Paris Air Show. Today, the Paris Air Show continues to be a leading event in the industry, held every two years at Le Bourget Airport and featuring the latest innovations and advancements in aviation technology."},{"instruction":"Article: Eminent domain is the power of the state to take private property away from someone for use by the state for the public good.

Woldson can still challenge the ruling in court. [Source] See today's most shared stories on Facebook. ||||| SEATTLE — The city is forcing a 103-year-old Spokane woman to sell her parking lot in Seattle to make way for, well, a parking lot. The Seattle City Council voted Monday to take the lot near the waterfront by eminent domain, using a portion of the 30 million provided by the state to take care of parking issues around the waterfront. Hundreds of public parking spaces will be lost when the state begins dismantling the Alaskan Way Viaduct for the digging of the tunnel. The construction will last until 2020. The lot is owned by Spokane resident Myrtle Woldson. She doesn’t want to sell, so the City Council voted unanimously to use it’s power of eminent domain to take it after paying Woldson “fair market value.” None of the City Council members would speak about their vote, but property rights advocates call it ridiculous. “In this case, the city of Seattle is using eminent domain to seize a parking lot, so they can use it as a parking lot,” said Glen Morgan of the Freedom Foundation, which is an Olympia-based, conservative, free-market think tank. “There’s no public good in that at all.” Morgan said there are several bills in the Legislature that would revamp eminent domain and give Washington property owners more rights. “Eminent domain was originally intended for stuff like roadways, expanding roads, schools,” said Morgan. “Situations that are for the public good.” Woldson can still challenge the move in court. She can also challenge the eventual selling price that the city decides on. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The Seattle City Council voted to use eminent domain to seize a parking lot owned by 103-year-old Myrtle Woldson, in order to turn it into a public parking lot.

In the world of musical effects, feedback plays an interesting role in enhancing the quality of sound. The feedback loop, specifically, is essential in the operation of various audio processors, such as delay effects, distortions, and filters. One major benefit of adjusting the feedback in audio effects is to provide more depth and clarity to the sounds produced. When using a pedal, these feedback adjustments can be controlled manually under different names that represent the specific effect being altered. Some of these names include \\"Notch\\", \\"Peak\\", \\"Depth\\", and \\"Crunch\\". By interacting with these settings, the user can enhance the peaks (or \\"mountains\\") and phase-outs (or \\"valleys\\") that are already present in the audio signal. As the pedal adjustments take place, the peaks of the sound wave become more pronounced, making the individual components of the audio more distinguished and clear. This tweak also serves to deepen the valleys between the peaks, which can help create more space and dimension to the overall sound. In addition, creating more depth and clarity in the audio through these adjustments can improve the listener's experience and make the final output seem more polished and professional. Ultimately, the effective use of feedback adjustments can be paramount when working with audio effects devices, such as pedals. By fine-tuning the settings of different effects under names like \\"Notch\\", \\"Peak\\", \\"Depth\\", and \\"Crunch\\", users can create a balanced and clear sound that truly resonates. Emphasizing the unique aspects of the audio through the manipulation of the peaks and valleys can lead to a more dynamic and rich auditory experience for both the performer and the listener."},{"instruction":"According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \\"we have some planes.\\" Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \\"nationwide ground stop.\\" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25. The Command Center kept looking for American 77. At 9:21, it advised the Dulles terminal control facility, and Dulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets. At 9:32, they found one. Several of the Dulles controllers \\"observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed\\" and notified Reagan National Airport. FAA personnel at both Reagan National and Dulles airports notified the Secret Service. Question: \\"What target crossed into Washington Center's airspace at 9:10?\\" Response: \\"American Flight 77\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question.

As a pioneering journalist, he is often referred to as the \\"Father of Modern War Reporting.\\" He is best known for his work with the British newspaper The Times, where his vivid and detailed reporting significantly influenced public opinion and prompted major reforms in the British military. Russell was born in 1820 in Tallaght, Ireland, and began his career as a journalist in the late 1830s, initially working for various local newspapers. However, it was during the Crimean War that he made his mark as a war correspondent. The conflict, which involved an alliance of British, French, and Ottoman forces against the Russian Empire, was one of the first major wars to be extensively covered by the media. When The Times sent Russell to the region, his role was a novelty – war correspondence was not yet an established profession. He was tasked with reporting from the frontline and providing British citizens with a detailed account of war events, including the experiences of military personnel and living conditions in the field. Russell's reports were instrumental in exposing the squalid conditions troops faced, as well as the ineptitude of British military leaders. His dispatches were unflinchingly honest, often criticizing the lack of proper resources, clothing, food, and medical care provided to soldiers. One of Russell's most famous reports came in the wake of the Battle of Balaclava, where he described the infamous Charge of the Light Brigade. This disastrous cavalry charge quickly became a symbol of the wider failures of British leadership in the Crimean War. Russell's reporting on the charge and its devastating consequences stirred outrage in the British public, and it is often cited as a turning point in the perception of the war. As a result of Russell's reporting, the British government faced immense pressure to address the numerous issues plaguing its military. This led to the appointment of Florence Nightingale and her team of nurses to provide much-needed medical assistance and improve hygiene in military hospitals. Additionally, Russell's exposure of supply-chain problems sparked significant logistical reforms. The pressure exerted by his reporting ultimately led to the fall of Lord Aberdeen's government. William Howard Russell's revolutionary work during the Crimean War set the tone for modern war correspondence. His insistence on accurate and candid reporting, even at the expense of angering military leaders and the government, paved the way for future generations of journalists to report on conflicts with integrity and honesty. Today, his legacy as the \\"Father of Modern War Reporting\\" serves as a reminder of the critical role the media plays in holding powerful institutions to account and bringing the realities of war to the public's attention."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? force you to scratch a hole in your head","output":"The sentiment expressed in the movie review sentence \\"force you to scratch a hole in your head\\" is predominantly negative.

Options: - feeling refreshed - becoming tired - restlessness - leg cramps - sweating Explain why a human would choose \\"feeling refreshed\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"When a human chooses \\"feeling refreshed\\" as the answer to the question regarding what happens when you take a shower after going for a run, it is because taking a shower after a physical activity, like running, provides multiple benefits that contribute to an overall feeling of refreshment. This response encompasses several physiological and psychological aspects, which will be discussed in detail below. 1. Temperature regulation: Running raises the body's core temperature due to increased physical exertion. Sweating is one method the body utilizes to dissipate heat and maintain a safe internal temperature. A shower after running can help lower the body's core temperature, especially when using cool or lukewarm water. This rapid decline in body heat promotes a feeling of refreshment. 2. Cleansing and hygiene: During a run, the body produces sweat, which can mix with dirt, oils, and bacteria on the skin's surface, potentially causing skin irritation or breakouts. Taking a shower helps cleanse the skin, removing sweat, dirt, and bacteria. This leaves the skin feeling fresh and clean, contributing to the overall refreshed sensation. 3. Relaxation and stress relief: Running can release endorphins, which naturally reduce stress and promote feelings of wellbeing. A shower also provides a relaxing experience, as the warm water can soothe aching muscles and the calming environment helps to clear the mind. Combining these two activities can amplify the sense of relaxation and rejuvenation, leading to a more refreshed state. 4. Muscle recovery: A post-run shower can also aid in muscle recovery. Warm or hot water can help increase blood flow to the muscles, which can alleviate muscle tension and reduce feelings of soreness and stiffness. Additionally, contrast showers, where one alternates between hot and cold water, can help reduce inflammation in the muscles and speed up recovery after exercise, further contributing to feeling refreshed. 5. Mental association: Many people have developed a habit or routine of taking a shower after physical exercise. This repetition has formed a strong mental association between showers and the end of the workout, signifying a transition from a state of exertion to relaxation. Thus, taking a shower after a run serves as a powerful psychological cue that the body is shifting towards a state of refreshment and rejuvenation. In summary, the choice of \\"feeling refreshed\\" as the answer to the question stems from various physiological and psychological factors associated with taking a shower after a run. These aspects include temperature regulation, cleansing and hygiene, relaxation and stress relief, muscle recovery, and mental association. Combined, they contribute to an overall sense of well-being and refreshment, making this an ideal response."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

Nick assures me that his scene is self-contained and needs no context. A fight scene plays. Nick pauses and asks, “What did you think?” I look confused and Nick says, “Did you miss me? Let's play it again.” I watch the scene again, but still can't make out Nick. Nick rewinds, plays and pauses. “There I am,” he says, gazing fondly at the screen. Except the screen was gray. No actors. No landscape. Nothing, but gray snow. “What do you think,” he asked, his eyes never leaving the empty screen. At that point, I realized Nick was crazy. “That's great!,” I said. “But look at the time. Time sure flies when you're having fun.” Nick was still staring at the screen with a strange little smile.

Both sentences mention three requirements (sun, water, and soil) for something to flourish. 2. Sentence A refers to a basil plant, while Sentence B refers to an infant. 3. A basil plant is a living organism that grows in soil, and it requires sunlight for photosynthesis and water for hydration. Therefore, it makes sense that a basil plant would need sun, water, and soil to flourish. 4. On the other hand, an infant is a young human who needs proper care and a nurturing environment for growth and development. 5. While sunlight and water are essential for an infant's health (sunlight for vitamin D synthesis and water for hydration), soil is not necessary for infants' growth and wellbeing. Instead, infants need food, a safe environment, and human interaction for their development. 6. Therefore, Sentence B contradicts common sense, as it mistakenly includes soil as a requirement for an infant to flourish."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Long after its introduction into the New World, American English was still considered non-standard English. According to some people of the 1780s American English was a peasant's language that a \\"gentleman\\" will not speak. Considered in a bilingual point of view, British English was the dominant language linked to prestige and language purism . The belief in the authority or say in the superior of British English, has remained to the twentieth century, especially in the former British Empire or in the fields of British influence. Thus, it is reported that in prefix = st1 /China, teachers and school textbooks refer to and recommend Received Pronunciation as the model, as well as standard British sentence structures, spelling and words. British English is also encouraged and accepted as the criteria of some major official examinations, for example, College English Test and Test for English Majors which are conducted by government. Similar situations could be found in countries, for example, in Africa, the West African Examination Council and Joint Admission accepts the British English as the standard English. Report can also be found that inCairosome university students received lower grades if they used American spellings instead of British English. In Europe, we find teachers, British people as well as natives of the country in which they work, who follow the British English standard, and laugh at the American English. However, the above attitudes are nothing but the last influence of a long-gone period of British supermacy . The beginning of a clear lead of American English can be traced to the decades after World War II. This coincides with the simultaneous rise of the US as a military and technological power and the decline of the British Empire, which drove many to American English. And from then on, American English has continuously sent its influence to every corner of the planet.

The passage discusses the initial view of American English as a non-standard and inferior form of English compared to the prestigious British English. It then traces the shift in attitude towards American English and its rise to prominence, coinciding with the rise of the United States as a global power and the decline of the British Empire after World War II.

It pulled in its head and legs, and closed its shell tightly. He touched it again but the tortoise didn't move at all. Jack became angry. He used a stick and tried to make it open.

Here's a step-by-step process with justification for each step: 1. Identify the components: Understanding the individual parts (shelves, frame, screws, etc.) involved in the assembly is crucial for a streamlined process. This helps in determining what goes where, and in what order they should be combined. 2. Read the instructions: Usually, furniture comes with assembly instructions or diagrams. Studying these carefully ensures that we follow the correct method for putting the object together, and use the right tools for doing so. 3. Gather required tools: Common tools needed for assembling furniture include a screwdriver, hammer, and a wrench. These tools help secure and reinforce the connections between the different components. 4. Lay out all parts and hardware: Organizing and laying out the pieces can greatly facilitate the assembly process by making it easier to find the correct parts when needed. 5. Assemble the frame: Start by putting together the main structure - in this case, the bookshelf's frame. Secure it using screws and brackets as indicated in the instructions. Ensuring the frame is sturdy and stable lays a strong foundation for the entire structure. 6. Attach the shelves: Once the frame is assembled, attach the shelves to it, one by one. Follow the recommended order and spacing as detailed in the instructions. By doing this, we ensure that the bookshelf’s support system and design remain intact, allowing it to function optimally. 7. Double-check connections and fastenings: After everything is assembled, review all connections, brackets, and screws to make certain everything is secure and tightened properly. This step is essential for avoiding any potential instability or safety hazards. 8. Final adjustments: If necessary, make minor adjustments like leveling the bookshelf or attaching additional safety features as per the instructions. Regular maintenance and inspection of the physical connections help prolong the furniture's lifecycle. Knowledge of physical objects (dimensions, weight, materials, etc.) is essential throughout the various stages of this task for effective planning, execution, and adjustments."},{"instruction":"Given the stream of consciousness rationale, provide a reasonable question and answer.

The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation. Humanitarian assistance has been exempted from the economic sanctions, but Beasely said import restrictions has made it more complicated to bring in aid, and made...

Katrina makes very tasty roast recipes while Cynthia doesn't, so","output":"Katrina has become the go-to person for any special occasion or family gathering where a delicious roast is desired, leaving everyone looking forward to her culinary creations. Over the years, her expertise in choosing the best cuts of meat, pairing them with complementary flavors, and mastering various cooking techniques has only continued to grow. Katrina's secret, however, is not just about the ingredients or the cooking process, but also her dedication to learning and experimenting to achieve the perfect roast. On the other hand, Cynthia, despite her best efforts, struggles with making roast recipes that can live up to the expectations set by her friend Katrina's exceptional dishes. While her determination to improve is commendable, her lack of experience and aptitude in the art of roasting has held her back. It's not that she completely lacks skills in the kitchen – in fact, she has been known to whip up some delicious appetizers and desserts – but when it comes to roasting, it just doesn't come as naturally to her as it does for Katrina. This divergence in culinary prowess has inevitably led to a dynamic where Katrina takes the spotlight during gatherings and special occasions. She is often asked to prepare main courses while Cynthia focuses on other aspects of the event, such as table arrangements and decorations. Despite this seemingly unbalanced division of labor, they have been able to maintain a strong friendship and truly appreciate each other's unique talents. They even use this dynamic to their advantage, collaborating on dinner parties and potlucks where they can showcase their individual strengths as well-rounded hosts. Katrina's remarkable roasts can be attributed to her meticulous attention to detail and the care with which she prepares each dish. She always starts by selecting the finest, freshest ingredients, ensuring that her roast recipes have the best possible foundation. From there, she carefully considers elements such as seasoning, marinating, and cooking temperature, resulting in perfectly cooked, succulent meats that are always bursting with flavor. Additionally, she never forgets the importance of side dishes and sauces, knowing that those delicious accompaniments can elevate an already delectable roast to new heights. One cannot overlook the impact of experience when comparing Katrina and Cynthia's roast recipes. While Katrina has spent countless hours refining her craft, experimenting with flavors, and perfecting her skills, Cynthia has not yet had the opportunity to dedicate the same amount of time and effort to this particular culinary area. As a result, there remains a noticeable difference in the outcome of their dishes – a fact that can be discouraging for Cynthia, but also serves as motivation to continue working on improving her own roast-making abilities. In conclusion, Katrina's scrumptious roast recipes continue to be the talk of the town and the highlight of many gatherings, mainly because of her dedication to honing her skills and her keen understanding of the finer nuances of roasting techniques. Meanwhile, Cynthia's inability to achieve the same level of success in this area does not deter her from contributing to events in other ways, nor does it dishearten her from continuing her journey to one day be able to prepare a roast that could rival Katrina's. As they continue to celebrate their unique talents and support each other's growth, their friendship remains a testament to the power of shared passions and mutual respect in spite of differing skill levels."},{"instruction":"who said the line i'll have what she's having??","output":"In order to find out who said the line \\"I'll have what she's having,\\" I will perform the following steps: Step 1: Identify the source This line is from the movie \\"When Harry Met Sally,\\" which was released in 1989.

The ship, which is carrying 1500 passenger, was sailing around Fiordland National Park when the virus was detected and is currently on-route to Melbourne. The ship is on a 13-day cruise around New Zealand and is returning to Melbourne today, which will be it's last stop. 200 passengers on-board the Dawn Princess cruise ship have been confined to their cabins after an outbreak of the norovirus struck the ship while it was travelling around New Zealand. The norovirus is a gastrointestinal illness, which typically lasts one to three days. It causes stomach pain, nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. The virus can be contracted by food contamination, person-to-person contact or by the contamination of surfaces. Local authorities in New Zealand carried out tests on-board and confirmed that it was an outbreak of the highly contagious virus. In a statement, a Princess Cruises spokesman said that most passengers on the cruise have been unaffected by the bug and that it is under control. 'Some passengers on Dawn Princess' current cruise to New Zealand destinations reported gastrointestinal symptoms confirmed as norovirus, commonly referred to in the community as a 'stomach bug'.' the spokesman said. The norovirus is a gastrointestinal illness, which typically lasts one to three days.It causes stomach pain, nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. 'It takes relatively few cases to be reported on-board for even more stringent sanitation levels to be implemented. 'The containment response was timely and effective and the number of new cases has declined significantly.' He said that every effort has been made to limit any new cases of the bug. Staff have been disinfecting surfaces such as rails, door handles and elevator buttons,. The ship, which is carrying 1500 passenger, was sailing around Fiordland National Park when the virus was detected and is currently on-route to Melbourne. He also confirmed that infected passengers have been confined to their cabins, until they can be deemed non-contagious. Passengers have been urged to use their private toilet facilities and use sanitising gels located throughout the ship. All self-service in food areas has been closed off on the ship. Dr Alistair Humphrey, Canterbury Medical Officer of Health told the New Zealand Herald that the Dawn Princess was confident it could contain the bug and has it's own doctor on-board. 'The number of cases is declining. They're still seeing a few coming in but not as many,' Dr Humphrey said. 'They stand at a little over 200 people altogether.' According to other news outlets, a Dunedin tour operator has slammed the crew of the Dawn Princess for failing to reveal the true extent of the virus. According to the operator, they only learnt about the quarantine of passengers after it was reported on social media. Local authorities in New Zealand carried out tests on-board and confirmed that it was an outbreak of the highly contagious virus. Dr Humphreys said it may take days for a person's symptoms to become obvious and supported the isolation of infected passengers. 'Generally speaking [patients] are most infectious when they're symptomatic, which is why it's important to keep people isolated in their cabins...' he said. The latest outbreak is the second norovirus outbreak on the Dawn Princess this year alone, with a 75 day cruise through Asia and Alaska also affected. A similar outbreak of the strain also occurred on the ship two years ago. 114 passengers and 11 crew fell ill. The ship has a guest capacity of 1,999 and was last refurbished in June 2009.","output":"So there is this big boat called the Dawn Princess, and it was on a fun cruise with lots of people around New Zealand. But some of the people on the boat got sick with something called norovirus. This sickness makes your tummy feel bad and might make you throw up. The people who got sick had to stay in their rooms so that they wouldn't spread the icky stuff to others. The people in charge of the boat tried really hard to clean everything and make sure everyone else was okay.

Recorded history can be contrasted with other narratives of the past, such as mythological, oral or archeological traditions. - \`\` What Was I Thinkin ' '' is a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Dierks Bentley . It was released in April 2003 as the first single from his self - titled debut album . The song became his first number one hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs charts in September 2003 . - The word Dobro is, in popular usage, the generic term for a wood-bodied, single cone resonator guitar. It is also an American brand of resonator guitar, currently owned by the Gibson Guitar Corporation. The Dobro was originally made by the Dopyera brothers when they formed the Dobro Manufacturing Company. Their design, with a single inverted resonator, was introduced in competition to the patented Tricone and biscuit designs produced by the National String Instrument Corporation. The Dobro name appeared on other instruments, notably electric lap steel guitars and solid body electric guitars and on other resonator instruments such as Safari resonator mandolins. - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - Modern Day Drifter is the second album of country music singer Dierks Bentley, released on May 10, 2005 by Capitol Records Nashville.

There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Fiddle is another name for the bowed string musical instrument more often called a violin. It is also a colloquial term for the instrument used by players in all genres, including classical music. Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music.

Attaching radio devices to it is difficult and visual sightings are too unreliable to give real insight into its behavior. So biologists were delighted early this year when, with the help of the US Navy, they are able to track a particular blue whale for 43 days recording its sounds. This was possible because of the Navy's former top secret system of underwater listening devices across the oceans. Tracking whales is but one example of an exciting new world just opening to civilian scientists after the cold war as the Navy starts to share and partly uncover its global network of underwater listening system built over the decades to track the ships of potential enemies. Earth scientists announced at a news conference recently that they had used the system for closely observing a deep-sea volcanic eruption for the first time and that they planned similar studies. Other scientists have proposed to use the network for tracking ocean currents and measuring changes in the ocean and global temperatures. Different layers of ocean water can act as channels for sounds focusing them in the same way a stethoscope does when it carries faint noises from a patient's chest to a doctor's ear. This focusing is the main reason that even relatively weak sounds in the ocean, especially low-frequency ones, can often travel thousands of miles.

The study examined hotel housekeepers over a period of four weeks. Some of the housekeepers were told that their work duties gave them enough activity to meet the Surgeon General's health guidelines . Another group of housekeepers were told nothing. After four weeks, the housekeepers who believed their work activity counted as exercise lost weight and body fat, and their blood pressure went down. The results of this study suggest that it's important to understand and believe in the positive benefits of your activity. So here are a few things to think about the next time you exercise: Just thirty minutes of quick walking each day can greatly reduce your risk of a heart attack. Even your housework -- like yard work and house cleaning -- can help you burn calories and increase your fitness levels. Weight bearing activity just a few times a week can build bone density and reduce your chances of developing osteoporosis . Three 10-minute workouts throughout the day are just as good to your health as one long workout. Moderate amounts of exercise have been linked to lower rates of heart disease, stroke and even cancer. Strength training can help make daily activities like carrying bags or laundry feel easier. Regular exercise will reduce stress, keep you in a good mood and improve the quality of your sleep. The housekeepers who were told their work would keep them fit _ . A) found it hard to finish their work on time B) lost weight and enjoyed better health C) had little sense of humor D) gained weight after the work A:","output":"The power of positive thinking has long been touted as a key factor in achieving goals and improving overall well-being. A study mentioned in a Reuters Health article further supports this belief, demonstrating that when individuals think they are getting fit through their daily activities, they actually reap more benefits from those activities. In the study, hotel housekeepers were observed over a four-week period. One group was informed that their daily work activities were sufficient to meet the Surgeon General's health guidelines, while the other group received no such information. After four weeks, the housekeepers who believed their work counted as exercise experienced weight loss, reduced body fat, and lower blood pressure. These results highlight the significance of understanding and believing in the positive impacts of the activities we partake in. The following points should be considered when engaging in physical activities to harness the power of positive thinking: 1. Just thirty minutes of brisk walking each day can significantly decrease the risk of heart attacks. Incorporating this simple activity into your daily routine can contribute to better cardiovascular health. 2. Household chores, such as yard work and cleaning, can also help burn calories and enhance fitness levels. Believing that these tasks contribute to better health can encourage people to approach chores with a more positive attitude. 3. Engaging in weight-bearing activities a few times a week can increase bone density and lessen the likelihood of developing osteoporosis. Recognizing and embracing the long-term benefits associated with these types of exercises might motivate individuals to persist in their efforts. 4. Three 10-minute workouts throughout the day can be just as beneficial as one extended exercise session. This flexibility allows for those with busy schedules to still maintain a healthy lifestyle. 5. Moderate amounts of exercise have been linked to lower incidences of heart disease, stroke, and even cancer. Understanding these long-term benefits can provide the motivation needed to maintain a consistent exercise routine. 6. Strength training has everyday applications, as it can make activities like carrying bags or laundry feel easier. As individuals see the impact of their exercise on daily tasks, they are more likely to continue pursuing a fitness regimen. 7. Regular exercise reduces stress, elevates mood, and improves sleep quality. These mental health benefits will further reinforce the positivity associated with physical activity. In conclusion, the housekeepers who were told their work would keep them fit (B) lost weight and enjoyed better health.

His father was a heroin addict, and Odom's mother died of colon cancer when he was twelve years old. At her deathbed, Odom's mom told him: \\"Be nice to everybody\\". Afterwards, he was raised by his maternal grandmother, Mildred Mercer. Context: On December 11, 2011, Odom was traded to the Dallas Mavericks, the defending NBA champions, for a first-round draft pick and an 8.9 million trade exception after NBA Commissioner David Stern vetoed a proposed three-team trade that would have sent Odom and Houston Rockets teammates Kevin Martin, Luis Scola, and Goran Dragic to the New Orleans Hornets; Chris Paul to the Lakers; and Pau Gasol to the Houston Rockets. Odom felt \\"disrespected\\" after he learned of the Hornets trade publicly, and he requested a trade from the Lakers to another contending team. The Lakers were also concerned that Odom's contract was pricey since he was not needed to initiate the triangle offense with Mike Brown replacing Phil Jackson as Lakers coach. In January 2012, Sports Illustrated reported that \\"Odom [had] yet to find his niche in Dallas. His struggles [made] him a frequent target of [Mavericks coach Rick] Carlisle, who [harped] on Odom's need to understand the coverages, be more alert, communicate and get in better shape... Team sources say Odom...appeared stressed by what they believe [was] the mental burden of an overwhelming offseason.\\" On March 2, 2012, Odom was assigned to the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League. He had missed the prior three games due to personal reasons. His stint with the Legends was canceled on March 3, 2012, and he returned to the Mavs' active roster. On March 24, Odom did not play in a 104-87 loss to the San Antonio Spurs; this was the first time he could remember not playing due to a coach's decision. On April 9, 2012, it was announced that Odom had parted ways with the Mavericks. Instead of releasing him, the team listed Odom as inactive for the remainder of the season. The move allowed the Mavericks to trade him at the end of the season. In a statement to ESPN, Odom said, \\"I'm sorry that things didn't work out better for both of us, but I wish the Mavs' organization, my teammates and Dallas fans nothing but continued success in the defense of their championship.\\" Mavericks owner Mark Cuban admitted that a clash between the two during halftime in a game against the Memphis Grizzlies on April 7 was the last straw. Odom reportedly responded angrily when Cuban questioned his commitment, asking if he was \\"in or out.\\" Odom averaged only 6.6 points in 20.5 minutes along with career lows in shooting percentage (35.2), rebounds (4.2) and assists (1.7) . Question: When did Odom join the Mavericks? Answer:","output":"Odom joined the Mavericks on December 11, 2011."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

The book is set in the American South in 1964, during the Civil Rights Movement, and tells the story of a 14-year-old white girl, named Lily Owens, and her journey to understand the truth about her mother's past and her own identity. Throughout her journey, Lily finds solace in the company of three African-American beekeeping sisters, who provide her with the wisdom and love she seeks. Sue Monk Kidd began writing \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" in 1997, after attending a writer's workshop at the University of South Carolina. During that workshop, she received an image of a young girl lying in bed, anxious and surrounded by bees. This picture became the starting point for the novel. The writing process, which involved intensive research on bees, beekeeping, and the Civil Rights Movement, took Kidd about four and a half years to complete before the book was finally published in 2003. Upon its publication, \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" became a critical and commercial success. The novel has been translated into 36 languages and has sold over 8 million copies worldwide. It remained on the New York Times Bestseller List for over two years, which is a testament to its popularity and resonant themes of love, family, and racial equality.

Here is a list of some of the people Jason Segel has dated: 1. Linda Cardellini (2001-2007): Jason Segel's most significant relationship was with actress Linda Cardellini, who he dated for six years. They met on the set of \\"Freaks and Geeks\\" and were together from 2001 until 2007. Although they ultimately split, Cardellini served as inspiration for Segel's \\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\\" screenplay. 2.

Read more US-Russian ties have been frigid following sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine crisis and support for Syrian rebels fighting Russia’s ally Bashar al-Assad. But Trump has praised Putin’s leadership saying it would be “nice” to work with him to defeat the Islamic State, and in their first conversation after the election, Putin appeared to emphasise the potential for cooperation. Putin returned to the theme in his speech on Thursday: “Of course I am counting on joining forces with the United States in the fight with the real, not made-up, threat of international terrorism,” he said. He added that thanks to the bombing campaign in Syria, where Russia and Assad’s forces are engaged in a bloody push to take Aleppo, “terrorists have been dealt a palpable blow”. A Russian diplomat said on Wednesday that Moscow has been in contact with Trump’s transition team about Syria. Putin made a few jibes at his opponents in the west, saying that “unlike some foreign colleagues”, Russia was looking for friends rather than enemies. But he was less strident in his criticism than in past addresses. In 2014, he accused the west of trying to contain and weaken Russia for decades. In 2015, he lashed out at western meddling and regime change in the Middle East. In this year’s speech, Putin said the United States and Russia had a “shared responsibility” to ensure international security and nuclear nonproliferation, noting that “attempts to break strategic parity are extremely dangerous”. During his campaign, Trump suggested Japan and South Korea should develop nuclear weapons, although he later appeared to backtrack on that statement. Putin also stressed Russia’s growing ties with China, holding them up as a model for a “world order built not on the idea of domination by one country, no matter how strong, but on harmonious consideration of all states’ interests”. Ahead of the hundredth anniversary of the October Revolution next year, Putin warned against similar actions to create “schisms, animosity, resentments” in the national unity. He said Russia cannot grow with a “weak government and a pliant regime directed from outside”. The lion’s share of the speech was dedicated to domestic issues, with Putin arguing that the economy was gradually emerging from recession and sectors like agriculture and IT were growing. He touched on the traditional topic of corruption and said the ruling United Russia party had a “special responsibility” to represent constituents after winning a constitutional majority in parliament in September. Discussing healthcare, Putin did not mention Russia’s growing HIV epidemic though Thursday was World Aids Day. According to popular blogger Ilya Varlamov, the audience burst into applause 15 times during the 69-minute speech, the lowest amount of clapping at the state of the nation address since 2005. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"In his annual state-of-the-nation speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin softened his rhetoric towards the United States, expressing a willingness to cooperate with President-Elect Donald Trump's administration on an equal and mutually beneficial basis.

Herod Answer:","output":"Title: The Shadow of Herod Genre: Historical-Drama Plot Summary: In the heart of ancient Jerusalem, the birth of a child called Jesus threatens to change the course of history and challenge the reign of the ruthless King Herod (played by a renowned Hollywood actor). As prophecy speaks of the child's potential to become the new King of the Jews, Herod sees his own power endangered, forging a paranoia that turns him against his own advisors and people. Act I: The story begins with the citizens of Jerusalem living under King Herod's tyranny. Amongst the people, whispers of prophecy about a child destined to save and lead them have been circulating. But, it's when the arrival of three mysterious Magi from the East reaches Herod's ears that his suspicion heightens, leading him to question his trusted advisors about the prophecy. Act II: Herod, feeling threatened by the birth of Jesus, orders his soldiers to find and kill the child, setting in motion a chain of events that would deeply affect the lives of everyone involved. As the manhunt ensues, Mary and Joseph, the parents of Jesus, decide to flee to Egypt with their child to protect him from harm. Joseph, played by another notable actor, is portrayed as a man driven by love and devotion for his family, willing to do whatever it takes to ensure their safety. Mary, on the other hand, struggles with her faith and the responsibility of being the mother of a prophesied savior. Act III: The climax of the story takes place when Herod's head guard, conflicted by his orders and struck by remorse, decides to betray Herod and help the Holy family escape. This leads to a series of intense battles and confrontations as the family, with the help of locals and the Magi, try to escape Herod's grasp. At the height of the climax, Herod faces off with the head guard in a heated confrontation which exposes the King's corruption and fear. Act IV: The movie concludes with the death of King Herod, unfulfilled in his quest to kill Jesus. The Holy family, now protected by the people, return to Jerusalem despite the challenges they faced, solidifying their faith and symbolizing hope in a brighter future for all. The story of Jesus and his miraculous escape starts spreading, laying the foundation for a legacy that will change the world forever. \\"The Shadow of Herod\\" is a grand epic that combines historical events with gripping human drama, delving deep into the struggles and sacrifices made by those who risked their lives for the safety of a child prophesied to change the world.

If the company were located in Portland, it could potentially provide a stronger indication of Hooper's citizenship, but we still would not be able to conclude this without further evidence. 3. Citizenship vs. residence: Even if Hooper were a resident of Portland, it would not necessarily mean that they are a citizen. Citizenship generally refers to the legal status of a person, while residence refers to the physical location where someone lives. It is possible to be a resident of a city or town without being a citizen of the country in which it is located or vice versa. In summary, while the information provided gives us some insight into Hooper's work-related activities in the Portland and Kittery region, it does not provide enough evidence to definitively conclude that Hooper is a citizen of Portland. To arrive at a more accurate conclusion, additional information such as their place of residence, the location of the company they worked for, or their specific citizenship status would be necessary."},{"instruction":"This is a test of commonsense with single/multi-choices.

To start advancing toward level nine, tap on \\"goals\\" and complete the list of required goals, such as feeding your monsters or buying breeding structures for islands. Verify that a breeding structure exists on cold island or shugabush island. Breeding a Deedge in My Singing Monsters is possible once you have achieved level nine in the game. This means you need to focus on leveling up and accomplishing the goals provided within the game. As you progress in My Singing Monsters, various in-game tasks will help you to level up more quickly. These tasks can involve feeding your monsters, purchasing or upgrading structures, and expanding your islands. Once you have reached level nine, ensure that a breeding structure is available on either Cold Island or Shugabush Island. These are the two islands where the Deedge monster can be bred. Monsters in My Singing Monsters are element-based, and the Deedge is composed of the Cold, Earth, Water, and Plant elements. You need to have two monsters with the appropriate combined elements in order to breed a Deedge. To breed a Deedge, go to the breeding structure on Cold Island or Shugabush Island and choose the two monsters you will use to breed the Deedge. Select a monster with Cold and Earth elements, and another with Water and Plant elements. For example, you could breed a Thumpies (Cold and Earth elements) with a Shellbeat (Water and Plant elements). The breeding process will take some time to complete, so be patient. Once the breeding is finished, you will have the possibility to hatch your newly-bred Deedge into an incubator. After the incubation period is over, you can collect your Deedge and add it to your collection of singing monsters. In conclusion, reaching level nine and having the appropriate breeding structures on Cold Island or Shugabush Island are the main prerequisites to breed a Deedge in My Singing Monsters. Once these conditions are met, you can combine the elements of Cold, Earth, Water, and Plant through monsters with complementary elements to successfully breed a Deedge. Happy breeding!"},{"instruction":"I have a new situation: In the ant world a war has been waged. Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity. But I can use this background: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. What is an answer for this question: Which would be a better day for group B to attack group A, battle day one or battle day two? A:","output":"Based on the given information, it would be a better day for group B to attack group A on battle day two. On battle day two, the temperature in group A's territory is 22 °C, which falls within the range of 20–30 °C. As mentioned, Acromyrmex heyeri workers create more openings in the nest thatch at temperatures in this range for temperature regulation. This would provide more opportunities for group B to attack and infiltrate group A's nest. On battle day one, the temperature is only 5 °C, so there would likely be fewer openings in the nest thatch, making it a less favorable day for attack."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: Ride with me, senor , and try that gift on the wild ones!\\" Sentence 2: I'll go many places, senor but, do not ride with me.

Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.

At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant. The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information. They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\" Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age. \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said. Chief Justice John Roberts, who often sides with conservatives on the court, said the central question was whether the cellphone information should be accessible to the government \\"without a warrant.\\" Question: After the amendment, Wessler probably is Options: A. indifferent B. not enough information C. in favor of the warrant D. against the warrant Answer:","output":"C. in favor of the warrant"},{"instruction":"FINAL EXAM Question 1.

More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. John was studying about the history of Sahara desert. He was amazed to find that ten thousand years ago there were plenty of rainfall in that region. He labeled that era as era A. Then he found that rainfall deceased in the region about eight thousand years ago. He labeled that era as era B. He was wondering how that change in rainfall might have helped emerge the Egyptian civilization. Would era B see less or more rocks with chemical reactions than era A?

Enter the Fist Movie plot: A man, called The Chosen One by the narrator, wanders from town to town to search for the man who killed his family and tried to kill him when he was a baby. In one town, he meets Master Tang, a very ill and slightly deranged sifu, and asks Tang to help him improve his already impressive martial arts ability. Master Tang is skeptical at first, but after seeing The Chosen One's mark (his sentient tongue, which he names Tonguey), he allows him to train at his dojo. The Chosen One is introduced to two other students: Wimp Lo, a young man who was deliberately trained incorrectly as a joke, and Ling, who has feelings for him. While training, The Chosen One shows cartoon-like feats of strength, and Wimp Lo deems him an enemy out of jealousy. Upon learning that Master Pain, the man who killed his parents, has just arrived in town, The Chosen One prepares to confront him. Master Pain draws a crowd and demonstrates his skills. He lets his henchmen kick him repeatedly in the groin, then subdues them all in one move. Impressed by Master Pain's skills, the town's mayor hires him, and he randomly changes his name to Betty. The Chosen One attempts to train himself by letting people kick him in the groin, but is knocked out after being hit.

The person struggles desperately but is trapped. There is no escape. Slowly the person sinks deeper and at last is gone. The solid ground was solid only in appearance. It was actually quicksand, which is a deep mass of fine sand mixed with water. How is quicksand formed? Water pushes up from below the surface and is held by the sand. The grains of sand are forced apart by the water. They cannot hold any weight. The subsurface water may have come from a spring, a river, or a stream. Sometimes pools of water near beaches become filled with sand. When the soil under these pools does not allow for good drainage , the sand can become stretches of quicksand. Is it true that a person who steps into quicksand is doomed to die? No, for people have fought their way from quicksand to firm land again. It is panic that creates the condition that can result in death, for the more a person struggles, the worse matters become. Quick movements will make the sand yield for a time, but then it rushes back and settles solidly around the body. People trapped in quicksand should either lie back with arms outstretched, or not move at all. When the weight of the sand around his body has displaced equals that person's weight, the victim will stop sinking. With feet held still, and with slow movements of the arms, as in the backstroke in swimming, people have managed to roll to safety and reach firm ground. The answer to this question is:","output":"Based on the article, which of the following is NOT true about quicksand? A. Quicksand is a mix of fine sand with water that appears solid, but can't hold weight. B. Quicksand is formed when water from springs, rivers, or streams pushes up from below the surface and is held by sand. C. Quick movements in quicksand will make matters worse and result in the individual sinking deeper. D. According to the article, an individual stepping into quicksand has no chance of survival. The correct answer is D. While quicksand is potentially dangerous, the article states that individuals can survive by either lying back with arms outstretched or staying still until they can safely move without triggering further sinking."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

The global vaccine market is diverse while facing a plethora of novel developments. Genetic modification (GM) techniques facilitate the design of 'smarter' vaccines. For many of the major infectious diseases of humans, like AIDS and malaria, but also for most human neoplastic disorders, still no vaccines are available. It may be speculated that novel GM technologies will significantly contribute to their development. While a promising number of studies is conducted on GM vaccines and GM vaccine technologies, the contribution of GM technology to newly introduced vaccines on the market is disappointingly limited. In this study, the field of vector-based GM vaccines is explored. Data on currently available, actually applied, and newly developed vectors is retrieved from various sources, synthesised and analysed, in order to provide an overview on the use of vector-based technology in the field of GM vaccine development. While still there are only two vector-based vaccines on the human vaccine market, there is ample activity in the fields of patenting, preclinical research, and different stages of clinical research. Results of this study revealed that vector-based vaccines comprise a significant part of all GM vaccines in the pipeline. This study further highlights that poxviruses and adenoviruses are among the most prominent vectors in GM vaccine development. After the approval of the first vectored human vaccine, based on a flavivirus vector, vaccine vector technology, especially based on poxviruses and adenoviruses, holds great promise for future vaccine development.","output":"Title: \\"Exploring Vector-Based Genetic Modification Technologies for Future Vaccine Development: A Focus on Poxviruses and Adenoviruses\\""},{"instruction":"Add spaces between the words in the following text: Sometimesparentstopretendthattheydidnotseethechildmisconduct.","output":"Sometimes parents stop pretend that they did not see the child misconduct."},{"instruction":"Here are some concepts: bath, bathroom, include, shower What is a sentence about these concepts?","output":"Step 1: Identify the main concept.

There, you and your colleagues wait for a man to arrive from the capital, perhaps a thousand miles away, with a suitcase of cash. Few countries are as corrupt as Congo . Mobutu Sese Seko, a former strongman, used state funds to _ a Concorde to take him on shopping trips to Paris. By the time of his overthrow in 1997, graft was endemic. Government employees were not paid but rather expected to use their positions to make a living. Among the most prized government jobs was that of accountant: the people responsible for transporting bags of cash to the provinces to hand out to employees. In 2012, however, the Congolese government started helping civil servants to open bank accounts. Around three-quarters of them--some 670,000 people--now have one. In the process, the government has weeded out tens of thousands of ghost employees, since the embezzlers who invented them could not open accounts in their names without a matching ID. Yet in a vast country with fewer roads than Luxembourg, hardly anyone lives anywhere near a bank branch. So Congolese banks must now do the work the government accountants used to: shipping money to the remote area. Cash has to be transported to branches in regional capitals, and thence to account-holders on the backs of motorbikes, in canoes or by foot. Bank staff with suitcases of cash make easy targets, just as they did in the west of America in the 19th century. Though they usually travel with armed policemen, there have been at least ten armed robberies of bank employees since January. At the moment banks are little more than money-transfer companies, and not very sophisticated ones at that. The transfers tend to go only one way--out of Kinshasa--so cannot be netted against each other; instead cash almost always has to be moved physically.

The couple's bodies were found at Mr Snell's home in Cringleford, Norfolk, on 31 October 2009. Moody denied murder at Norwich Crown Court but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He will be sentenced on Friday. Moody and Ms Brown, who had been in a violent 12-year relationship which ended in 2008, used to run the sandwich shop Baguette Express near Norwich Market. Moody murdered Ms Brown and Mr Snell after being told of their relationship earlier that day, the court heard. The prosecution said their deaths were caused by \\"an angry and jealous man\\". But the defence urged jurors to accept Moody was suffering from an abnormality of the mind. The court heard that Moody \\"lost his self-control\\" and drove to Mr Snell's home armed with a hammer and knife. He smashed through the front door and attacked Ms Brown in the back garden with the weapons, while repeatedly shouting: \\"Why did you lie?\\" The jury was played recordings of the 999 calls made by Ms Brown and Mr Snell.

Paglia is critical of many aspects of modern culture, and is the author of Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson (1990) and other books. Paglia was born in Endicott, New York, the eldest child of Pasquale and Lydia Anne (nee Colapietro) Paglia. All four of her grandparents were born in Italy. Her mother immigrated to the United States at five years old from Ceccano, in the province of Frosinone, Lazio, Italy. Additionally, Paglia has stated that her father's side of the family were from the Campanian towns of Avellino, Benevento, and Caserta. Paglia attended primary school in rural Oxford, New York, where her family lived in a working farmhouse. Her father, a veteran of World War II, taught at the Oxford Academy high school, and exposed his young daughter to art through books he brought home about French art history. In 1957, her family moved to Syracuse, New York, so that her father could begin graduate school; he eventually became a professor of Romance languages at Le Moyne College. She attended the Edward Smith Elementary School, T. Aaron Levy Junior High and William Nottingham High School. In 1992 Carmelia Metosh, her Latin teacher for three years, said, \\"She always has been controversial. Whatever statements were being made (in class), she had to challenge them. She made good points then, as she does now.\\" Paglia thanked Metosh in the acknowledgements to Sexual Personae, later describing her as \\"the dragon lady of Latin studies, who breathed fire at principals and school boards\\". She took a variety of names when she was at Spruce Ridge Camp, including Anastasia (her confirmation name, inspired by the film Anastasia starring Ingrid Bergman), Stacy, and Stanley. A crucially significant event for her was when an outhouse exploded after she poured too much lime into the latrine. \\"That symbolized everything I would do with my life and work. Excess and extravagance and explosiveness. I would be someone who would look into the latrine of culture, into pornography and crime and psychopathology... and I would drop the bomb into it\\".

Article: It is the preferred choice of millions of health-conscious Britons. But eating organic food could make you fat, experts have warned. A studyhas shown that people tend to believe that organic foods contain fewer calories, so buy and eat more. But people who decide to \\"go organic\\" could soon find themselves piling on the pounds. The warning comes from American researchers who studied whether the sight of an organic label was enough to influence a person's choice. For example, if people believe organic foods, produced without using pesticides and artificial fertilizers , have fewer calories, they may end up eating far too much and spending less time on sports activities and put on weight. Cornell University researchers said: \\" Some people mistakenly think that these foods are more nutritious , just because they carry an organic label.\\" \\"The growing popularity of organic foods has led to some concern, as these foods may not necessarily be healthier than non-organic ones, but still may lead consumers to nutritional mis-judgments. If people feel a food to be more nutritious, they tend to let their guard down when it comes to counting calories---in the end leading them to overeat.\\" Although a small number of differences in nutrient content were found to exist between organically-produced crops and traditionally-produced ones, these are of little health importance. It shows that there is no proof to support the choice of organically over traditionally-produced foods because of nutritional advantage.

Dijon has a rich history dating back to the Roman times when it was first established as a settlement called Divio. Over the centuries, the city evolved and grew as an important center of trade and culture. It experienced a significant period of prosperity during the reign of the Dukes of Burgundy in the Middle Ages, which can be observed through the impressive architectural heritage that still stands today, such as the Palace of the Dukes of Burgundy and the Notre-Dame de Dijon church. When it comes to mustard, Dijon has a distinct and unparalleled reputation. Known as \\"Moutarde de Dijon,\\" this mustard is characterized by a strong, yet smooth flavor that is sharp and tangy. This classic French condiment originated in the 14th century, and its production method was unique because it used verjuice (the acidic juice extracted from unripe grapes) instead of vinegar. This ingredient gave Dijon mustard a creamier texture and less aggressive taste than other mustards of the time. Over the years, the production of Dijon mustard has evolved, and most modern versions are now made with white wine or wine vinegar rather than verjuice. The primary ingredients are still brown mustard seeds and wine or vinegar, which provide the distinctive flavor that has become a symbol of French gastronomy. Dijon mustard is often used as a base for salad dressings, sauces, and marinades or simply as a condiment to accompany various dishes, like sandwiches, meats, and cheeses. The city of Dijon not only celebrates its mustard but is also proud of its culinary traditions that showcase local ingredients, including another regional favorite, \\"Crème de Cassis,\\" which is a blackcurrant liqueur. The city hosts the International Gastronomy Fair every year, attracting visitors from all over the world to taste and discover the rich flavors that the region has to offer. In conclusion, Dijon, the capital city of the Côte-d'Or department in Eastern France, is renowned for its famous mustard, \\"Moutarde de Dijon.\\" The city's mustard production has a long history, and Dijon mustard has become a symbol of French gastronomy. In addition to its culinary heritage, Dijon possesses an impressive architectural and cultural legacy, making it a destination worth visiting."},{"instruction":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

On the first series of the game, the Jets drove to the Patriots' 13-yard line but the game remained scoreless after kicker Jay Feely missed a 31-yard field goal. Eleven plays later, the Patriots faced 3rd-and-goal from the Jets' 2-yard line, but a run for a loss by running back Laurence Maroney set up a 21-yard Gostkowski field goal to give the Patriots a 3-0 lead. After a Jets punt, the Patriots extended their lead to 6-0 on a 37-yard Gostkowski field goal early in the second quarter. The Jets responded with a 77-yard drive, highlighted by a 54-yard Laveranues Coles completion from quarterback Brett Favre, which brought them as close to the end zone as the Patriots' 1-yard line, but they again had to settle for a field goal; this time Feely completed the 21-yard attempt to cut the Patriots' lead to 6-3. The Patriots and Jets exchanged punts to end the first half. After a Patriots punt began the second half, the Jets started their next possession from their own 23-yard line. Three offensive penalties later, with the Jets at 2nd-and-25, defensive back Brandon Meriweather earned his first career interception on an errant Favre pass, giving the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 31-yard line. Despite a Kris Jenkins sack of Cassel to begin the drive, the Patriots moved into the red zone on a 22-yard completion to running back Kevin Faulk on a 3rd-and-9 play. Three plays later, Morris ran it in from the Jets' 1-yard-line for a touchdown, extending the Patriots' lead to 13-3. On an ensuing Jets punt, a 24-yard Faulk return set up the Patriots' next drive at the Jets' 39-yard line; nine plays later, a 28-yard Gostkowski field goal gave the Patriots a 16-3 lead and ended the third-quarter scoring. Beginning from their own 20-yard line for the sixth time in the game, the Jets drove into the Patriots' red zone and then cut the Patriots' lead to 16-10 on a 2-yard touchdown catch by wide receiver Chansi Stuckey. The Patriots' next drive went for 71 yards and ended on a 27-yard Gostkowski field goal to build the Patriots' lead to 19-10. This would be the final score, as the Jets' next drive, which included a 20-yard sack of Favre by Adalius Thomas, went three-and-out and the Patriots held the ball for the final 3:45 in the game. The win brought the Patriots' record to 2-0 and kept the team tied for first place in the AFC East. Gostkowski finished the day 4-for-4 on field goals and earned five touchbacks on six kickoffs. How many field goals were made in the first half?","output":"In the first half of the game, two field goals were made.

His last name was McGinity before he came to United States. He changed it by adding an \\"n\\" after he emigrated to the United States in 1861. Peter worked in coal mines and on the farm owned by John and Rebecca Denning, and they accepted him, allowing him to move in with them in their Henry County farm. While living in Decatur, McGinnity began playing baseball with other coal miners in their leisure time. The owner of the Decatur Coal Company founded the Decatur Baseball Association in 1886. An outfielder, McGinnity substituted for his team's pitcher in an 1888 game, which he won. He continued to pitch from that point on. He pitched for semi-professional teams based in Decatur in 1888 and 1889. His family headed west, stopping in the Indian Territory on their way to Montana, where Hannah's sister struck gold in their coal mine. McGinnity and his brothers worked in a coal mine in Krebs. There, he met his future wife, Mary Redpath, the oldest daughter of a fellow coal miner. McGinnity also played baseball for the local team. He increased baseball's popularity in the area, and was later referred to as \\"the father of Oklahoma baseball\\" by a sportswriter for The Oklahoman, as he organized, managed, and pitched for teams in Krebs. One of these teams began traveling to other towns along the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad to play against their local teams. He also pitched for teams in neighboring towns. John McCloskey, the manager of the minor league baseball Montgomery Colts of the Class-B Southern League, heard about McGinnity's pitching. McCloskey signed McGinnity, who made his professional debut with the Colts in 1893. McCloskey habitually baited umpires during games, a trait which McGinnity learned. The league folded as a result of financial troubles related to the Panic of 1893. Jimmie Manning, manager of the Southern League franchise in Savannah, Georgia, became manager of the Kansas City Blues of the Class-A Western League for the 1894 season, and signed McGinnity to pitch for the Blues. Combined for Montgomery and Kansas City, McGinnity had a 21-29 win-loss record, while walking more batters than he could strikeout, and allowing more than a hit per inning pitched. According to a Western League umpire, catcher Tim Donahue tipped McGinnity's pitches to opposing batters due to a personal feud. As McGinnity continued to struggle for Kansas City, he requested his release in June. McGinnity moved to Springfield, Illinois, where he worked as a coal miner, bartender, and operated a saloon. McGinnity also pitched locally for semi-professional teams in Springfield and Decatur, receiving a salary between 1 to 3 (between 28.28 to 88.25 in current dollar terms) for each game. During this time, McGinnity developed a sidearm pitch he nicknamed \\"Old Sal\\", described as a \\"slow curve\\", which became a feature of his later success. He also improved his fielding, as opponents attempted to bunt \\"Old Sal\\". While pitching for a semi-professional team, McGinnity defeated the National League's (NL) Baltimore Orioles in an exhibition game after he had already defeated a team from Chatham, Illinois earlier in the day. Pat Wright, who managed Springfield's semi-professional team, was named manager of the Peoria Distillers of the Class-B Western Association, and he signed McGinnity to Peoria for the 1898 season, marking his return to professional baseball. Armed with \\"Old Sal\\", McGinnity compiled a 9-4 record for Peoria, allowing only 118 hits and 60 walks while striking out 74 batters in 142 innings. He pitched a complete 21-inning game, believed to be the second longest professional baseball game to date. With low attendance and the distraction of the Spanish-American War, the Western Association folded in August.

He is the leader of the religious group Nation of Islam (NOI) and served as the minister of major mosques in Boston and Harlem, and was appointed by longtime NOI leader Elijah Muhammad as the National Representative of the Nation of Islam. After Warith Deen Muhammad disbanded the NOI and started the orthodox Islamic group American Society of Muslims, Farrakhan started rebuilding the NOI. Many, including Malcolm X's family, have accused Louis Farrakhan of being involved in the plot to assassinate Malcolm X. For many years, Betty Shabazz, the wife of Malcolm X, harbored resentment toward the Nation of Islam--and Farrakhan in particular--for what she felt was their role in the assassination of her husband. In a 1993 speech, Farrakhan seemed to acknowledge the possibility that the Nation of Islam was responsible for the assassination: We don't give a damn about no white man law if you attack what we love. And frankly, it ain't none of your business. What do you got to say about it? Did you teach Malcolm? Did you make Malcolm? Did you clean up Malcolm? Did you put Malcolm out before the world? Was Malcolm your traitor or ours? And if we dealt with him like a nation deals with a traitor, what the hell business is it of yours? You just shut your mouth, and stay out of it. Because in the future, we gonna become a nation. And a nation gotta be able to deal with traitors and cutthroats and turncoats. The white man deals with his. The Jews deal with theirs. During a 1994 interview, Gabe Pressman asked Shabazz whether Farrakhan \\"had anything to do\\" with Malcolm X's death. She replied: \\"Of course, yes. Nobody kept it a secret. It was a badge of honor. Everybody talked about it, yes.\\" In January 1995, Qubilah Shabazz, the daughter of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz, was charged with trying to hire an assassin to kill Farrakhan in retaliation for the murder of her father, for which she believed he was responsible. In a 60 Minutes interview that aired during May 2000, Farrakhan stated that some of the things he said may have led to the assassination of Malcolm X. \\"I may have been complicit in words that I spoke\\", he said. \\"I acknowledge that and regret that any word that I have said caused the loss of life of a human being.\\" A few days later Farrakhan denied that he \\"ordered the assassination\\" of Malcolm X, although he again acknowledged that he \\"created the atmosphere that ultimately led to Malcolm X's assassination.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: How else is Farrakhan connection to the death?","output":"Farrakhan's connection to the death of Malcolm X goes beyond his acknowledgement of the possibility that the Nation of Islam was responsible for the assassination. In a 60 Minutes interview that aired during May 2000, Farrakhan admitted that some of the things he said may have led to the assassination of Malcolm X. He stated, \\"I may have been complicit in words that I spoke\\", and expressed regret that any word he had said caused the loss of life of a human being. This shows that Farrakhan acknowledges his potential role in creating an atmosphere that ultimately led to Malcolm X's assassination."},{"instruction":"As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.

The group are regarded as 'founding fathers of Celtic rock' for their fusion of traditional Irish music with rock music and went on to inspire many local and international acts. They formed in 1970 and 'retired' in 1980 for an extended period. The name originated from a spoonerism on The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse which became \\"The Four Poxmen of The Horslypse\\". In March 2004, three Horslips enthusiasts, Jim Nelis, Stephen Ferris and Paul Callaghan, put on an exhibition of Horslips memorabilia in The Orchard Gallery in Derry. It was opened by the band, who played five songs acoustically. Buoyed by this first public appearance in 24 years, Horslips returned to the studio in Westmeath to produce a studio album, Roll Back, in the summer of 2004. Described as \\"Horslips Unplugged\\", the album contained acoustic reworkings of many of their best-known songs. The same exhibition moved to Drogheda in October 2005, courtesy of longtime fan Paddy Goodwin, and was formally opened on 6 October by a tribute band, Horslypse, composed of nine teenage musicians. Horslips did a version of \\"Furniture\\". The exhibition moved to Belfast in February and March 2006 and there were plans for a New York showing in 2007.

But that was before the postman delivered a catalogue of courses that were being offered at the local college. As I looked through it, I was attracted by a page that talked about the difficulties faced by deaf people in their everyday lives and how students could help by learning sign language. It went on to say that graduates of the course usually find work in different organizations, such as law companies, the Stock Exchange, insurance companies and banks. Then I saw something that really caught my eye: \\"Singer\\" are also needed for sporting events, concerts, theatrical performances and, believe it or not, circuses! By the time I got to the bottom of the page, I knew I had found the perfect occupation. I enrolled on the course, which to my parents' great delight was free of charge. The course was brilliant. My favourite part was the final lesson, when our teacher asked us to sign our favourite song.

The latter would as a consequence evolve with Allemanic into Old High German. At more or less the same time the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law led to the development of Old Saxon, Old Frisian (Anglo-Frisian) and Old English (Anglo-Saxon). Hardly influenced by either development, Old Dutch remained close to the original language of the Franks, the people that would rule Europe for centuries.

Lori learned more about fish, while Dan learned more about mammals. But I can use this background: The lungs of mammals are unique in having alveoli . These are tiny, sac-like structures. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels (see Figure below ). Because there are millions of alveoli in each lung, they greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet). That’s about as much surface area as one side of a volleyball court! What is an answer for this question: Which student learned less about gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream? A:","output":"The student who learned less about the gas exchange between the lungs and the bloodstream is Lori. The reason for this is based on the topic each student focused on. Lori's study was more focused on fish while Dan's study was more focused on mammals. In the background information given, it talks about the unique structure of the lungs in mammals - specifically, the presence of alveoli. Alveoli are fundamental to the process of gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream in mammals. They increase the surface area for this exchange and contribute significantly to the ability of mammals to take in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide, a process that is essential to maintain life. On the other hand, general knowledge about fish tells us that these creatures respire through gills, which function differently than lungs and alveoli. Even though fish gills also perform a similar role of exchanging gases - oxygen and carbon dioxide - between the fish's body and its aquatic environment, the specific structure and function of alveoli in the lung-based respiration system of mammals has no direct equivalent in fish. Therefore, Lori, who studied more about fish, would have learned less about the specific process of gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream that involves alveoli, as this system is particular to mammals. In contrast, Dan, who studied more about mammals, would have likely learned more about this respiratory process, given his subject of study and the unique role of alveoli in mammals' lungs."},{"instruction":"Itisaninterestingphenomenontowatchfromtheverybeginning,howtheworkofthisresearcherhasbeenexposedtoaconvenientnon-specificcriticism,becauseheisdissociatinghimselffromtheprevailing\\"politicalcorrectness\\"withincertaincomprehensionsbythetraditionalresearch.

This is necessary because adding punctuation clarifies the meaning of the sentence and makes it easier for the reader to understand. Below is my suggested version of the sentence: \\"One of his disputes was with Heaviside and Gibbs, whose vector methods he argued against vigorously over a long period.\\" Step by step process: 1. After \\"Heaviside and Gibbs\\", I have added a comma. This is because the phrase that follows \\"whose vector methods he argued against vigorously over a long period.\\" is a non-restrictive clause.

She manages to get away but the cops inform her that there is nothing they can do. She realizes, however, that Joe did get her wallet and knows where she lives. When her housemates Pat (Alfre Woodard) and Terry (Diana Scarwid) are off at work, Joe pays her a visit to finish what he started. After Joe humiliates and degrades her in a variety of ways, she gets a chance to strike back at him and imprisons him. Knowing full well she's in another \\"his word against yours\\" situation and that no rape technically took place, she has no intention of taking it easy on him until he confesses to Pat and Terry what his intentions were. The movie ultimately amounts to a showdown between its two opponents. As it goes on, Marjorie displays such ruthlessness that one has to wonder if she hasn't become as unhinged as her nemesis. Fawcett does a creditable enough job, while Russo is truly excellent as the depraved creep who does his best to manipulate the situation. With only two characters on screen for much of the running time, the film has an intimate nature that does suggest that it would work even better on stage. Director Robert M. Young doesn't shy away from the uglier and more exploitative elements of the situation; the film does become uncomfortable to watch at times. And by the time Marjorie has the upper hand, things change enough so that it no longer becomes quite so easy to encourage her to go for blood, and one hopes that Pat can make her see reason. \\"Extremities\\", I felt, was a pretty good movie that at least maintained interest and a fairly high level of intensity. Woodard and Scarwid are both fine in support (Scarwid has a great moment where Terry reveals herself to be a rape victim), and the pace is consistent.

However, it does not explicitly provide any indication about the purpose or destination of their walk, including a possible visit to a store. Therefore, it isn't possible to conclude with certainty if the person is walking to the store or not. They could be walking to any other destination, such as a friend's house, a park, or just taking a leisurely walk around the neighborhood. The initial statement does not provide any further information or context, so we cannot definitively pick a destination based on just a description of the person's environment. Even if the context might suggest that a store is nearby, there is still no guarantee that the person's intent is to walk to the store. Therefore, option (i) \\"yes\\" would not be a valid choice, as that would be a definite assumption without enough information available. Similarly, option (iii) \\"no\\" is not relevant either because it unnecessarily assumes that the person is surely not walking to a store, which we also cannot tell from the initial statement.

After putting him under, Lisa plants a post-hypnotic suggestion in Tom urging him to \\"be more open-minded\\". Tom then begins experiencing visions of a violent scuffle involving a girl who he later learns is Samantha Kozac, a 17-year-old that disappeared from the neighborhood six months prior. While Tom and Maggie attend a high school football game, Jake is overheard by his babysitter, Debbie Kozac, as he speaks with Samantha. Debbie gets upset and snatches Jake, running off with him in the night. Meanwhile, Tom senses Jake is in danger and rushes home but finds him gone. Tom then sees strange flashes of red light that eventually leads him to the 'L' station where Debbie is speaking with her mother about Jake. When Tom and Maggie confront her, Debbie angrily questions them about her sister Samantha, explaining that she had an intellectual disability: having the mental capacity of an 8-year-old and thus a child's tendency to trust strangers. Tom denies knowing her to Debbie but admits to Maggie that she is the girl in his visions. Tom becomes obsessed with Samantha and begins probing members of the community about her disappearance. This attracts the attention of his landlord Harry Damon, Tom's friend, Frank McCarthy and their respective sons Kurt Damon and Adam McCarthy, who all dismiss Samantha as a runaway teen.

He became a nationally renowned designer of war memorials following his work as an adviser to (and later one of the principal architects for) the Imperial War Graves Commission and his design for the Cenotaph on London's Whitehall. As well as dozens of public war memorials in towns and cities across Britain, Lutyens designed several private memorials to individual casualties, usually the sons of friends or clients. Many were heirs to the country houses Lutyens had built earlier in his career, as in Mells where he renovated the manor at the beginning of the 20th century. His work in Mells arose through his friend and collaborator Gertrude Jekyll, who introduced him to the Horners through a family connection. Lutyens established a friendship which led to multiple commissions in the village. In addition to his work on the manor, he redesigned its gardens and worked on several related buildings and structures, and after the war was responsible for a tribute to Raymond Asquith (Edward's brother-in-law), also located in St Andrew's Church, and the village war memorial. Lutyens designed two other memorials to Horner: a wooden board featuring a description of the events leading up to his death, which was placed on a wall in the family chapel in St Andrew's Church; and a stone tablet in Cambrai Cathedral.Alfred Munnings was a painter specialising in horses. He volunteered for military service at the outbreak of war but was deemed unfit due to lack of sight in one eye. He volunteered to tend to army horses and was later recruited as a civilian war artist attached to Canadian cavalry. In 1919, he was beginning to move into sculpture. The Horner memorial was his first public work of sculpture, for which Lutyens commissioned him based on a pre-existing friendship.

To do this, let's first find an equivalent expression for N in terms of 17. Using the given information about N, we can substitute: N % 17 = (221 * Q + 43) % 17 Now, we can use the property of modular arithmetic that states (a * b) % c = ((a % c) * (b % c)) % c: (221 * Q + 43) % 17 = ((221 % 17) * (Q % 17) + (43 % 17)) % 17 Now calculate the values: 221 % 17 = 3 43 % 17 = 9 Substituting these values back: (221 * Q + 43) % 17 = (3 * (Q % 17) + 9) % 17 Since we don't know the value of Q, we can't find an exact value for the remainder.

Private equity firms are raising vast sums of money to buy oil assets on the cheap. Blackstone Group (BX) alone launched a 4.5 billion energy fund on Monday. That gives the private equity giant a formidable war chest to deploy on distressed assets like beaten-down oil companies and drilling projects thrown in disarray by the oil meltdown. Given its history in the industry, Blackstone said it's well positioned to \\"take full advantage of the significant recent cyclical downturn in oil and gas prices.\\" Private equity pounces: They aren't alone. Warburg Pincus, the New York firm where former Treasury secretary Tim Geithner works, launched a 4 billion energy fund in October. These sophisticated investors realize traditional sources of capital like banks and the junk bond market are increasingly shutting oil companies out. Related: Cheap oil killed this CEO's 14M job \\"Private equity companies are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this. Not only do they have the deep pockets, but they can also take a long-term approach,\\" said Tamar Essner, an energy analyst at Nasdaq Advisory Services. Certain projects in the U.S. shale and Canadian oil sands no longer make economic sense with oil below 50 a barrel. Sophisticated investors are sensing desperation. Some companies in the oil industry are in a much weaker financial position, forcing them to slash drilling plans, lay off workers and scrap dividends. Other firms are unfairly seeing their stock prices decline because they are being lumped in with the weakest companies. Private equity may be their only lifeline. Of course, private equity firms aren't strangers to the oil industry, which until recently had been soaring thanks to the shale boom. Since 2013, private equity has raised a whopping 101 billion in energy-focused funds, according to data provider Preqin. In fact, many like KKR (KKR) and Carlyle Group (CG) have revealed steep drops in profits due partly to falling stock prices in the oil industry. They have been burned on the downside too. Related: Workers at largest US oil refinery join strike Buy signal for retail investors? While mom-and-pop investors don't have the luxury of raising billions of dollars to buy distressed assets, they do have the option to buy energy stocks, but the jury is still out on whether these stocks have bottomed out. On the one hand, recent filings reveal Warren Buffett dumped his holdings of ExxonMobil (XOM) and ConocoPhillips (COP) late last year. That's not exactly a vote of confidence in Big Oil. Then again, the S&P 500 energy sector has rallied more than 8% since mid-January as oil prices have rebounded back above 50 a barrel (at least until Monday when they dropped back below that level).

It also provided some liberation for those marginalized by Greek society: women, slaves and foreigners. In their final phase the Mysteries shifted their emphasis from a chthonic, underworld orientation to a transcendental, mystical one, with Dionysus changing his nature accordingly. By its nature as a mystery religion reserved for the initiated, many aspects of the Dionysian cult remain unknown and were lost with the decline of Greco-Roman polytheism; modern knowledge is derived from descriptions, imagery and cross-cultural studies. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - Plato ( also Plato Comicus ; Ancient Greek : ) was an Athenian comic poet and contemporary of Aristophanes . None of his plays survive intact , but the titles of thirty of them are known , including a Hyperbolus ( c. 420 - 416 BC ) , Victories ( after 421 ) , Cleophon ( in 405 ) , and Phaon ( probably in 391 ) . The titles suggest that his themes were often political . In 410 BC , one of his plays took first prize at the City Dionysia . Phaon included a scene ( quoted in the Deipnosophistae of Athenaeus ) in which a character sits down to study a poem about gastronomy ( in fact mostly about aphrodisiacs ) and reads some of it aloud . The poem is in hexameters , and therefore sounds like a lampoon of the work of Archestratus , although the speaker calls it \`\` a book by Philoxenus '' , meaning either the poet Philoxenus of Cythera , the glutton Philoxenus of Leucas , or both indiscriminately . - In Ancient Greece, a deme or demos was a suburb of Athens or a subdivision of Attica, the region of Greece surrounding Athens. Demes as simple subdivisions of land in the countryside seem to have existed in the 6th century BC and earlier, but did not acquire particular significance until the reforms of Cleisthenes in 508 BC. In those reforms, enrollment in the citizen-lists of a deme became the requirement for citizenship; prior to that time, citizenship had been based on membership in a phratry, or family group. At this same time, demes were established in the city of Athens itself, where they had not previously existed; in all, at the end of Cleisthenes' reforms, Attica was divided into 139 demes to which one should add Berenikidai, established in 224/223 BC, Apollonieis (201/200 BC) and Antinoeis (126/127). The establishment of demes as the fundamental units of the state weakened the gene, or aristocratic family groups, that had dominated the phratries. - Ancient Greece was a civilization belonging to a period of Greek history from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th-9th centuries BC to the end of antiquity (AD). Immediately following this period was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine era. Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the period of Archaic Greece and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was followed by the period of Classical Greece, an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars, lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedonia, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire. - Mycenaean Greek is the most ancient attested form of the Greek language, on the Greek mainland, Crete and Cyprus in Mycenaean Greece (16th to 12th centuries BCE), before the hypothesised Dorian invasion, often cited as the \\"terminus post quem\\" for the coming of the Greek language to Greece. The language is preserved in inscriptions in Linear B, a script first attested on Crete before the 14th century. Most inscriptions are on clay tablets found in Knossos, in central Crete, as well as in Pylos, in the southwest of the Peloponnese. Other tablets have been found at Mycenae itself, Tiryns and Thebes and at Chania, in Western Crete. The language is named after Mycenae, one of the major centres of Mycenaean Greece. - The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism. - The Dionysia was a large festival in ancient Athens in honor of the god Dionysus, the central events of which were the theatrical performances of dramatic tragedies and, from 487 BC, comedies. It was the second-most important festival after the Panathenaia. The Dionysia actually consisted of two related festivals, the Rural Dionysia and the City Dionysia, which took place in different parts of the year. They were also an essential part of the Dionysian Mysteries. - The Peloponnesian War (431404 BC) was an ancient Greek war fought by Athens and its empire against the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta. Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases. In the first phase, the Archidamian War, Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica, while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire. This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC, with the signing of the Peace of Nicias. That treaty, however, was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese. In 415 BC, Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily; the attack failed disastrously, with the destruction of the entire force, in 413 BC. This ushered in the final phase of the war, generally referred to either as the Decelean War, or the Ionian War. In this phase, Sparta, now receiving support from Persia, supported rebellions in Athens' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia, undermining Athens' empire, and, eventually, depriving the city of naval supremacy. The destruction of Athens' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war, and Athens surrendered in the following year. Corinth and Thebes demanded that Athens should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved, but Sparta refused. - Aristophanes (or ; c. 446 c. 386 BC), son of Philippus, of the deme Kydathenaion, was a comic playwright of ancient Athens. Eleven of his forty plays survive virtually complete. These, together with fragments of some of his other plays, provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy, and are used to define it. - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe. Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki. - Hyperbolus (\\"Hyperbolos\\") was an Athenian politician active during the first half of the Peloponnesian war, coming to particular prominence after the death of Cleon. - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - Old Comedy (\\"archaia\\") is the first period of the ancient Greek comedy, according to the canonical division by the Alexandrian grammarians. The most important Old Comic playwright is Aristophanes whose works, with their daring political commentary and abundance of sexual innuendo, effectively define the genre today. Aristophanes satirized and lampooned the most prominent personalities and institutions of his time, as can be seen, for example, in his scurrilous portrayal of Socrates in \\"The Clouds\\", and in his racy anti-war farce \\"Lysistrata\\". Aristophanes was only one of a large number of comic poets, however, working in Athens in the late 5th century BC; his biggest rivals were Hermippus and Eupolis. - Dionysus (\\"Dionysos\\") is the god of the grape harvest, winemaking and wine, of ritual madness, fertility, theatre and religious ecstasy in ancient Greek religion and myth. Wine played an important role in Greek culture, and the cult of Dionysus was the main religious focus for its unrestrained consumption. He may have been worshipped as early as c. 15001100 BC by Mycenean Greeks; traces of Dionysian-type cult have also been found in ancient Minoan Crete. His origins are uncertain, and his cults took many forms; some are described by ancient sources as Thracian, others as Greek. In some cults, he arrives from the east, as an Asiatic foreigner; in others, from Ethiopia in the South. He is a god of epiphany, \\"the god that comes\\", and his \\"foreignness\\" as an arriving outsider-god may be inherent and essential to his cults. He is a major, popular figure of Greek mythology and religion, becoming increasingly important over time, and included in some lists of the twelve Olympians, as the last of their number, and the only god born from a mortal mother. His festivals were the driving force behind the development of Greek theatre.

Article: There is a Web site called the \\"World Database of Happiness.\\" It combines and analyzes the results of hundreds of surveys from around the world that have been conducted on life satisfaction. Most of the findings are predictable, but a few are surprising. The database makes it clear that there is not a strong connection between material wealth and general contentment. It is a cliche to say that money can't buy happiness, but the old saying seems to be supported by research. Many people still cling to the belief that gaining riches will be the answer to all their problems, yet they are probably mistaken. Studies have been carried out on people who acquired sudden wealth, such as lottery winners. In most cases, after the initial joy had worn off, people were not left with a sense of lasting happiness. In fact, they tended to revert to the way they felt before they became rich. Previously contented people continue to be contented, while those who were miserable before sink back into misery. If material wealth does not bring happiness, then what does? Perhaps happiness has something to do with where you live. The authorities at the World Database on Happiness have surveyed levels of happiness in different countries. Apparently, people in America, Canada, and Singapore are very happy; people living in India and Russia, not surprisingly, are not happy. Other surveys consistently point to the importance of relationships. Family relationships in particular seem to be the key to long-term contentment. The Web site suggests that falling in love and having children are two of the situations that bring the greatest happiness. Nowadays people look to technology as an alternative source of satisfaction. People increasingly spend more time alone watching TV or surfing the Internet rather than spending time with family. Can technology truly make people happy? It is too difficult to tell, but one thing is sure: If the Web site's research is accurate, time spent with your family is a better investment than time spent making money. Question: Which factor can bring lasting happiness definitely according to the study? Answer: Answer:","output":"According to the study, family relationships and spending time with loved ones seem to be the key to long-term contentment and lasting happiness."},{"instruction":"Given the rationale, provide a reasonable question and answer.

They spent their money on the whistle, instead of the stop watch. The track coach needed a Available choices: + whistle .. + stop watch ..","output":"They spent their money on the whistle, instead of the stop watch. The track coach needed a whistle to efficiently manage the practices, games, and events for their athletes. The whistle provides a clear and powerful auditory signal that captures the attention of the athletes, making it an essential tool for the coach. In many running and athletic events, the starting and finishing moments are critical, and the coach needs to communicate with the athletes to ensure they are synchronized and prepared for the various segments of their training routine. Although a stop watch is also a useful tool in tracking time, measuring performance, and helping athletes improve their skills, the coach decided that acquiring a whistle was more important in this situation. The whistle serves as a useful instrument in maintaining discipline and control over the team, allowing the coach to convey crucial information, such as when to start and stop for drills or rest intervals, and when to switch exercises during workouts. Moreover, the whistle can also be used during competitive events to signal false starts, fouls, or finishes. Despite the usefulness of a stop watch in tracking time, the coach may have other alternatives to record time without having to purchase one. For instance, they could use their smartphone or rely on other team members who might own a stop watch. In contrast, the whistle is indispensable for a coach, particularly in managing large groups or in situations that require immediate attention or action. In conclusion, the track coach opted for the whistle, instead of the stop watch, as they considered it a more critical tool for efficiently managing practices, games, and events for their athletes. The whistle ensures that the coach can maintain discipline, control, and communication during training sessions, while timekeeping can still be managed through alternative means. This choice reflects the coach's priorities in ensuring smooth communication and athlete engagement at all times during the coaching process."},{"instruction":"Denny asked: Premise: \\"A man in a black hoodie is jumping over a log.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"A man in a white hoodie is taking a walk.\\" is true?

However, using human common sense and considering that the Pope is the leader of the Catholic Church and regularly conducts religious ceremonies at the Vatican, it is plausible to assume that the claim might be true.

Identify the main parts of the sentence: - \\"The Turkish invention\\" is the subject of the sentence and can be translated as \\"Türk icadı\\". - \\"was manufactured\\" is the verb in passive voice. In Turkish, the verb to manufacture is \\"üretmek\\" and its passive form for past tense is \\"üretildi\\". - \\"in Germany\\" is a prepositional phrase, indicating location. We can translate this as \\"Almanya'da\\". 2. Construct the sentence using the identified parts in the correct order according to Turkish grammar: - In Turkish, the verb typically comes at the end of the sentence. - The subject of the sentence comes before the verb. - Prepositional phrases usually follow the subject. 3.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote more than 70 plays, almost all of them successful, and none of them performed today. In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \\"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti. Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment. When Puccini once again became interested in Tosca, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini. One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand...

In this detailed description, we will explore each aspect to provide a better understanding of the information provided. 1. United States LANGUAGE English language: The official language of the United States is English. It is the most widely spoken language in the country and is used for communication, business, and education purposes. As a predominantly English-speaking nation, the United States has a vast variety of regional accents and dialects, influenced by the diverse range of immigrants who have arrived over the country's history. In addition to English, the United States recognizes several regional and minority languages, such as Spanish, Chinese, French, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and others, reflecting the diverse cultural heritage of its population. 2. A Severed Wasp COUNTRY United States: \\"A Severed Wasp\\" is a novel by the American author Madeleine L'Engle. Published in 1982, this book is the sequel to L'Engle's earlier novel, \\"The Small Rain.\\" Set in the United States, the story follows protagonist Katherine Forrester Vigneras, a retired concert pianist, who returns to the United States after living in Europe for many years. Throughout the novel, Vigneras encounters various people from her past, including her former music teacher and other characters she met during her time abroad. The book explores themes such as aging, forgiveness, prejudice, and the complexities of relationships, set against the backdrop of American society in the 1980s. 3. United States ETHNIC_GROUP Native Americans in the United States: Native Americans in the United States represent the Indigenous peoples who lived in the Americas prior to the arrival of Europeans in the 15th century. They are categorized into distinct tribes, such as the Cherokee, Navajo, Sioux, and many others, each with unique languages, cultures, and traditions. Historically, Native Americans have faced significant challenges, such as displacement, forced assimilation, and violence, as a result of European colonization and westward expansion by the United States. Today, Native Americans continue to make meaningful contributions to American society in various fields, including art, science, and politics, while also working towards preserving their diverse cultures, languages, and traditions. The United States government officially recognizes Native American tribes as sovereign nations, and efforts have been made to remedy some of the historical injustices through reparation and reservation policies. In summary, this data provides a snapshot of the United States' multifaceted aspects – the widespread use of the English language, an American novel that reflects the culture and values of the 1980s, and the rich history and ongoing challenges faced by Native Americans in the country. Each of these components contributes to the complex identity of the United States and its diverse population."},{"instruction":"What jobs do Leah Meyerhoff and Dee Rees share?

Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight.

The Fox Movie Channel has banned Charlie Chan . Charlie Chan is off the case for the Fox Movie Channel . Possible answers: i. no. ii. yes. The answer is:","output":"ii. yes. While the two sentences may have been constructed differently and employed slightly varying terminology, they ultimately convey the same meaning. To better understand the similarities in their implications, we must examine them more closely. Sentence 1: \\"The Fox Movie Channel has banned Charlie Chan.\\" This statement suggests that the Fox Movie Channel has decided to enact a ban or restriction on Charlie Chan. A ban can come in multiple forms, but in this context, it seems they are no longer allowing programs featuring Charlie Chan to be broadcasted on their network. This prohibition implies that the Fox Movie Channel has taken an active decision to exclude Charlie Chan from their programming lineup due to specific reasons. Sentence 2: \\"Charlie Chan is off the case for the Fox Movie Channel.\\" In this sentence, \\"off the case\\" is a metaphorical way of stating that the channel has excluded or removed Charlie Chan from its programming. This phrase is generally used when a detective or investigator has been taken off a case or assignment, but has been adapted here to fit the context of a movie channel's programming decisions. Both statements indicate that the Fox Movie Channel has made a conscious decision to exclude Charlie Chan from their network for one reason or another. Although the phrases \\"banned\\" and \\"off the case\\" may not be synonyms, they impart similar meanings when applied to this situation. In conclusion, the two sentences effectively communicate the same meaning: Charlie Chan has been removed from the Fox Movie Channel's programming. Therefore, the answer is ii. yes."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise \\"On the mountain crags to the west, far out from their trail, dark clouds swirled and surged.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The mountains were to the west of us.\\" is true (see options)?

Premise: \\"You have unlocked the impossible!\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"You unlocked the impossible!\\"? Choose from: --yes --it is not possible to tell --no","output":"If we consider the premise \\"You have unlocked the impossible!\\", it implies that something deemed \\"impossible\\" has been accomplished successfully. In the context of this statement, \\"impossible\\" refers to a task or an achievement that was previously thought to be unattainable or beyond the reach of our current abilities, knowledge, or resources. However, the premise declares that the seemingly unreachable task or achievement has been unlocked or attained. Now, let us examine the hypothesis \\"You unlocked the impossible!\\". From a purely linguistic standpoint, the hypothesis is practically synonymous with the given premise. Both statements convey the same message – the achievement of something that was considered impossible. Therefore, if we accept the premise as true, the hypothesis is essentially a restatement of the same assertion. In essence, the truth of one statement directly and explicitly entails the other. Therefore, given the stated premise \\"You have unlocked the impossible!\\", we can confidently choose \\"yes\\" as our answer, as it supports the fact that the premise entails the hypothesis \\"You unlocked the impossible!\\"."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

If the monthly bill increases by 10%, what will be her phone bill for the entire next year? Give me reasons, before answering the question","output":"To calculate the increase in Gillian's phone bill due to the 10% increase, we first need to find out how much the bill has increased. Reason 1: The 10% increase in the phone bill is given in the problem statement, so we will use this percentage to calculate the increased bill amount. To find the new monthly bill amount: New Monthly Bill = (Original Monthly Bill) + (10% of Original Monthly Bill) New Monthly Bill = 50 + (10% × 50) Reason 2: Multiply the original bill amount by the percentage increase to find the increase amount. 10% × 50 = 5 New Monthly Bill = 50 + 5 = 55 Now that we have the new monthly bill, we need to calculate the total cost for the entire year. Reason 3: There are 12 months in a year, which means Gillian will have 12 phone bills throughout the year. Total Annual Phone Bill = (New Monthly Bill) × 12 Total Annual Phone Bill = 55 × 12 Reason 4: Multiply the new monthly bill by the total number of months in a year to get the total annual phone bill. 55 × 12 = 660 So, the total cost of Gillian's phone bill for the entire next year, after the 10% increase, will be 660."},{"instruction":"Fact 1: Thick fur can be used for keeping warm.

The Hirshhorn is sited exactly halfway between the Washington Monument and the US Capitol , anchoring the southernmost end of the so - called LEnfant axis ( perpendicular to the Mall 's green carpet ) . The National Archives / National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden across the Mall , and the National Portrait Gallery / Smithsonian American Art building several blocks to the north , also mark this pivotal axis , a key element of both the 1791 city plan by Pierre LEnfant and the 1901 MacMillan Plan . The building itself is an attraction , likened by some to a large spacecraft parked on the National Mall . The building is an open cylinder elevated on four massive \`\` legs , '' with a large fountain occupying the central courtyard . Before architect Gordon Bunshaft designed the building , the Smithsonian staff reportedly told him that , if it did not provide a striking contrast to everything else in the city , then it would be unfit for housing a modern art collection . - The National Mall is a national park in downtown Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. The National Park Service (NPS) administers the National Mall, which is part of its National Mall and Memorial Parks unit. The term \\"National Mall\\" commonly includes areas that are officially part of West Potomac Park and Constitution Gardens to the west, and often is taken to refer to the entire area between the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol, with the Washington Monument dividing the area slightly west of its midpoint. A smaller designation, sometimes referred to as the \\"Mall proper\\", excludes both the Capitol grounds and the Washington Monument grounds, applying only to an area between them. The National Mall contains a number of museums and memorials and receives approximately 24 million visitors each year. - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - Gordon Bunshaft, FAIA (May 9, 1909 August 6, 1990), was an American architect, a leading proponent of modern design in the mid-twentieth century. A partner in the architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), Bunshaft joined in 1937 and remained for more than 40 years. The long list of his notable buildings includes Lever House in New York, the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., the National Commercial Bank in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 140 Broadway (Marine Midland Grace Trust Co.) and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Branch Bank in New York; the last was the first post-war \\"transparent\\" bank on the East Coast. - An art museum or art gallery is a building or space for the exhibition of art, usually visual art. Museums can be public or private, but what distinguishes a museum is the ownership of a collection. Paintings are the most commonly displayed art objects; however, sculptures, decorative arts, furniture, textiles, costumes, drawings, pastels, watercolors, collages, prints, artist's books, photographs, and installation art are also regularly shown. Although primarily concerned with providing a space to show works of visual art, art galleries are sometimes used to host other artistic activities, such as performance arts, music concerts, or poetry readings. - The Smithsonian Institution, established in 1846 \\"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge,\\" is a group of museums and research centers administered by the Government of the United States. Originally organized as the \\"United States National Museum,\\" that name ceased to exist as an administrative entity in 1967. Termed \\"the nation's attic\\" for its eclectic holdings of 138 million items, the Institution's nineteen museums, nine research centers, and zoo include historical and architectural landmarks, mostly located in the District of Columbia. Additional facilities are located in Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York City, Virginia, Texas, and Panama. More than 200 institutions and museums in 45 states, Puerto Rico, and Panama are Smithsonian Affiliates The Institution's thirty million annual visitors are admitted without charge. The institution's annual budget is around 1.2 billion with 2/3 coming from annual federal appropriations. Other funding comes from the Institution's endowment, private and corporate contributions, membership dues, and earned retail, concession, and licensing revenue. Institution publications include \\"Smithsonian\\" and \\"Air & Space\\" magazines. - The Lincoln Memorial is an American national monument built to honor the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. It is located on the western end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C., across from the Washington Monument. The architect was Henry Bacon; the designer of the primary statue \\"Abraham Lincoln\\", 1920 was Daniel Chester French; the Lincoln statue was carved by the Piccirilli Brothers; and the painter of the interior murals was Jules Guerin. Dedicated in 1922, it is one of several monuments built to honor an American president. It has always been a major tourist attraction and since the 1930s has been a symbolic center focused on race relations. - Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure. Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser, while construction typically takes place on location for a known client. Construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries. Construction starts with planning, design, and financing; and continues until the project is built and ready for use. - A narrative or story is any report of connected events, real or imaginary, presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, and/or still or moving images. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - Performance art is a performance presented to an audience within a fine art context, traditionally interdisciplinary. Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated; spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation. The performance can be live or via media; the performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.

It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources. The \\"continental shelf\\" is the natural prolongation of the land territory to the continental margin's outer edge, or 200 nautical miles from the coastal state's baseline, whichever is greater. Here the coastal nation has the exclusive right to harvest minerals and also living resources \\"attached\\" to the seabed. Answer:","output":"The \\"continental shelf\\" zone gives the coastal nation exclusive rights to harvest minerals."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What happened after the potential buyer found out about the murder? Options: - He decided not to buy the house - not enough information - He decided to go see the house - He asked his friend about the house The answer is:","output":"He decided not to buy the house."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Triglidae, commonly known as sea robins or gurnard, are a family of bottom-feeding scorpaeniform fish. They get their name (sea robin) from the orange ventral surface of the species in the Western Atlantic (\\"Prionotus carolinus\\") and from large pectoral fins, which, when swimming, open and close like a bird's wings in flight. The large surface area of the fins also permits the fish to glide short distances above the water surface, much like a flying fish. - The scaly gurnard , Lepidotrigla brachyoptera , is a searobin of the family Triglidae , found around New Zealand including the Kermadec Islands , at depths of between 35 and 300 m. Its length is up to 15 cm. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu. - The Exocoetidae are a family of marine fish in the order Beloniformes class Actinopterygii. Fish of this family are known as flying fish. About 64 species are grouped in seven to nine genera. Flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of water into air, where their long, wing-like fins enable gliding flight for considerable distances above the water's surface. This uncommon ability is a natural defense mechanism to evade predators. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'taxon rank'. Answer:","output":"Given the information, the subject entity is 'Triglidae' and the object entity is 'family of bottom-feeding scorpaeniform fish'. The relation of 'taxon rank' exists between these entities because the Triglidae, commonly known as sea robins or gurnard, are classified as a family within the order Scorpaeniformes."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Eight Men Out Movie plot: In 1919, the Chicago White Sox are considered the greatest team in baseball and, in fact, one of the greatest ever assembled to that point, behind their greatest star, Joe Jackson. However, the team's owner, Charles Comiskey, is a skinflint with little inclination to reward his players for a spectacular season. When gamblers \\"Sleepy\\" Bill Burns and Billy Maharg get wind of the players' discontent, they offer a select group of Sox â including star knuckleball pitcher Eddie Cicotte, who led the majors with a 29-7 win-loss record and has an earned run average of just 1.82 â more money to play badly than they would have earned by winning the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Cicotte's motivation for being involved was because Comiskey refused him a promised 10,000 should he win 30 games for the season. Cicotte was nearing the milestone until Comiskey ordered team manager Kid Gleason to bench him for 2 weeks (missing 5 starts) to rest the 35-year-old veteran's arm for the series. A number of players, including Chick Gandil, Swede Risberg, and Lefty Williams, go along with the scheme. Jackson is depicted as being not bright and not entirely sure what is going on. Buck Weaver, meanwhile, is included with the seven others but insists that he wants nothing to do with the fix. When the best-of-nine series begins, Cicotte (pitching in Game 1) deliberately hits Reds leadoff hitter Morrie Rath in the back with his second pitch in a prearranged signal to gangster Arnold Rothstein that the fix was on (Rothstein allegedly financed the fix). Cicotte then pitches poorly and gave up 5 runs in four inningsâfour of them in the 4th, including a triple given up to Reds pitcher Walter \\"Dutch\\" Ruether. He is then relieved by Gleason, though the Sox lose the first game 9â1. Williams also pitched poorly in Game 2, while Gandil, Risberg and Hap Felsch made glaring mistakes on the field. Several of the players become upset, however, when the various gamblers involved fail to pay their promised money up front. Chicago... My question: who is the sox star knuckleball pitcher?

What would happen if the Earth abruptly stopped spinning for 42 seconds? Do those questions have the same meaning? Pick from: [+] no; [+] yes;","output":"[+] no; These questions do not have the same meaning. Let me explain each question and their consequences separately. 1. If the sun stops giving light, considering gravity is not affected: Step 1: Determine the premise. The sun stops emitting light, but its gravity remains unchanged. Step 2: Understand the effect on Earth. Without the sun's light, Earth would become pitch dark. Step 3: Assess the impact on temperature. Earth's temperature would drop rapidly as we lose the source of heat and energy. Step 4: Determine consequences for life. Photosynthesis would cease, and the food chain would be disrupted, leading to the extinction of most, if not all, life forms. 2. If the Earth abruptly stopped spinning for 42 seconds: Step 1: Determine the premise. Earth's rotation comes to a sudden halt for 42 seconds. Step 2: Understand the effect on Earth. Earth's surface and the atmosphere have momentum due to rotation. An abrupt stop would cause everything on Earth to continue moving at high speeds (e.g., at the equator, approximately 1670 km/h). Step 3: Assess the impact on structures and life. Buildings, infrastructure, and living beings would experience severe destruction and loss of life due to the rapid motion. Step 4: Determine consequences for day and night patterns. After the 42 seconds, Earth would resume its spin, and the day and night cycle would be disrupted for a short period. The difference between these questions is that the first one addresses the effect of the sun's light suddenly vanishing, while the second one considers the implications of Earth's rotational motion stopping for a specific duration.

Which is the most likely result?","output":"The most likely result of placing a shallow container of salt water in sunlight for a day is that the water will undergo evaporation, potentially leaving behind a layer of salt at the bottom of the container. This process occurs due to the interaction between sunlight, water, and salt, as explained in detail below: 1. Sunlight: As the shallow container is exposed to sunlight, the energy from the sun in the form of solar radiation leads to an increase in the temperature of the water. This thermal energy causes the water molecules to gain kinetic energy, making them move faster. 2. Evaporation: With the gained energy from sunlight, the water molecules at the surface of the container will have enough energy to overcome the hydrogen bonds holding them together, allowing them to break free from the liquid state and become water vapor. This process, known as evaporation, results in a decrease in the volume of the liquid water in the container. The rate of evaporation will depend on various factors such as the intensity of sunlight, the surface area of the container, ambient temperature, humidity, and the presence of any barriers to the escape of water vapor. 3. Salt concentration: As the water evaporates, the salt in the solution becomes more concentrated because the salt ions remain in the liquid state and do not evaporate with the water molecules. The concentration of the salt will continue to increase as more and more water evaporates from the container. 4. Crystallization: Once the salt concentration within the container reaches a certain level called the saturation point, no more salt can dissolve in the remaining water. At this stage, any additional evaporation will cause the dissolved salt to start forming solid salt crystals. These crystals will grow in size as more water evaporates, eventually leading to a layer of salt at the bottom of the container. 5. Complete evaporation: If the shallow container is left in sunlight for an extended period and the environmental conditions are favorable, it is possible for almost all of the water to evaporate, leaving behind only the solid salt crystals. The appearance, size, and structure of the salt crystals will depend on factors such as the type of salt present in the water, the rate at which the water evaporated, and the presence of any impurities in the solution. In summary, placing a shallow container of salt water in sunlight for a day will most likely result in the evaporation of water and an increase in salt concentration. Depending on the specific conditions, this might lead to the formation of salt crystals at the bottom of the container by the end of the day."},{"instruction":"Here is a premise: These two palazzos house the Capitoline Museums , whose Greek and Roman collections provide an excellent introduction to the ancient Roman Forum that spreads below it.

As he investigates the origin of the phone, he uncovers a decades-old conspiracy involving a missing person, corporate espionage, and the truth about his own past. Act 1: Setting the Stage - Establish Raymond Erickson as a well-respected but unambitious insurance agent working for the national insurance corporation, Helios Insurance. He lives an ordinary, routine life and is satisfied with his job, but there is a sense that something is missing. - One day, Erickson is asked to review some old personnel files at his company as part of routine evaluations. As he sifts through the dusty files, he comes across his own personnel file. - Intrigued, Erickson opens the file and discovers an old-looking cell phone taped to the back of an obscure document. The phone, still working, has a single text message on it that reads: \\"Where did she go?\\" - As Erickson starts to exert more effort into finding the origin of the phone, he experiences a cold shoulder from colleagues and superiors alike, and is warned by his boss to stay focused on his job and not get distracted. Act 2: The Illustrious Investigation - Despite the warnings, Erickson becomes increasingly obsessed with the mysterious phone, and he starts to investigate the background of the text message. He visits the office archives, searching for clues, and stumbles upon a series of deleted internal memos that mention a woman named Abigail Turner, a former employee who went missing over a decade ago. - Erickson learns that Abigail was involved in the development of a top-secret software program that could potentially revolutionize the insurance industry and give Helios an unprecedented edge in the market. - As his search continues, Erickson finds more inconsistencies in the company's records and starts to suspect that Abigail's disappearance is linked to the mysterious cell phone and his own personal history. - Further, Erickson meets a mysterious stranger named Max, who claims to be a private detective investigating Abigail's case. Max reveals that Abigail had uncovered a conspiracy involving some high-ranking executives at Helios and had been on the verge of blowing the whistle. Act 3: Dangerous Discoveries - Erickson and Max team up to delve further into the mystery, but the stakes are raised as their lives are threatened by unknown forces seeking to keep the truth buried. - After narrowly escaping a series of life-threatening situations and with Max's investigative skills, they finally locate an encrypted file hidden in the depths of the company's servers, containing the missing software code and evidence implicating senior Helios executives in a cover-up. - As they begin to put the pieces together, they confront the company's CEO, who turns out to be the mastermind behind the conspiracy.

Liszt wanted to learn more about instrumentation and acknowledged Raff's greater expertise in this area. Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi—\\"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them.\\" Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of Prometheus, he told Bernhard Cossmann, who sat next to him, \\"Listen to the instrumentation. It is by me.\\"Raff continued making such claims about his role in Liszt's compositional process. Some of these accounts, published posthumously by Die Musik in 1902 and 1903, suggest that he was an equal collaborator with Liszt. Raff's assertions were supported by Joachim, who had been active in Weimar at approximately the same time as Raff. Walker writes that Joachim later recalled to Raff's widow \\"that he had seen Raff 'produce full orchestral scores from piano sketches.'\\" Joachim also told Raff's biographer Andreas Moser that \\"the E-flat-major Piano Concerto was orchestrated from beginning to end by Raff.\\" Raff's and Joachim's statements effectively questioned the authorship of Liszt's orchestral music, especially the symphonic poems. This speculation was debased when composer and Liszt scholar Peter Raabe carefully compared all sketches then known of Liszt's orchestral works with the published versions of the same works.

Hypothesis: The rainbow appears after the rain because sunlight shines through the raindrops, making pretty colors. Is there anything else you'd like me to explain?"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Because the gravitational field created by the Moon weakens with distance from the Moon, it exerts a slightly stronger than average force on the side of the Earth facing the Moon, and a slightly weaker force on the opposite side. The Moon thus tends to \\"stretch\\" the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, particularly horizontally. As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the Earth's surface change constantly; although the ocean never reaches equilibrium—there is never time for the fluid to \\"catch up\\" to the state it would eventually reach if the tidal force were constant—the changing tidal force nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height. Now, I have a new situation: Mike was reading about an instrument that could measure gravity, gravimeter. He then found how gravimeter was used to measure the gravitational field of the Moon. He read about two distinct cases where the Moon's gravitational field was measured on earth, side A and side B. In side A the Moon's gravity was measured from the side where the Earth was facing the Moon. And in side B the Moon's gravitational field was measured from the opposite side of the Earth. He found these two locations showed very different consequences of Moon's gravitational field. Answer this question please: Would side B see less or more deformed Earth than side A? A:","output":"Side B would see less deformed Earth than side A. This is because the gravitational force exerted by the Moon is stronger on side A (the side facing the Moon) than on side B (the side opposite the Moon). The stronger gravitational force on side A causes a greater deformation of the Earth's surface, leading to a more noticeable difference in tides compared to side B. The difference in the Moon's gravitational pull on the two sides of the Earth results in the stretching effect described in the background information, with Earth being \\"stretched\\" slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. As a result, side A experiences higher tidal bulges and a more deformed Earth, while side B experiences lower tidal bulges and a less deformed Earth. This difference can be observed through the variation in sea surface height and tide levels between these two sides of the Earth."},{"instruction":"Creatively image a question and justification for this answer: it is not possible to tell","output":"Question: Is it possible to determine the true meaning and intention behind a piece of abstract art created by an artist who never shared their thoughts or feelings about their work?

Investigate the US political system: The United States is a democratic republic with no monarchy or feudal traditions that would traditionally grant knighthoods. Titles of nobility are not part of the American political system. 3. Evaluate the US Constitution: The Constitution of the United States, the supreme law of the land, specifically prohibits the granting of titles of nobility by the US government in Article I, Section 9, Clause 8. This clause, known as the \\"Title of Nobility Clause,\\" states that \\"No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States.\\" 4. Consider the American cultural context: The United States has a diverse population with roots in many different cultures, including those in which knighthoods are granted (such as British, French, and various other European traditions). Although Americans can respect and appreciate the customs of other countries, the American identity is strong, and the idea of receiving or granting titles of nobility is not part of the broader American culture. Based on these steps, one can conclude that there are no official American knights. However, it is possible for American citizens to receive knighthood or other noble titles from other countries as honorary awards, but these titles hold no official status or recognition within the United States."},{"instruction":"Choose from: [1]. negative [2]. positive What would be an example of an [1]. review?","output":"1.

Notably, none of the words used in the sentence imply negative connotations or dissatisfaction with the movie. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the given movie review should be interpreted as a positive evaluation, reflecting that the reviewer had a pleasant and meaningful experience with the film."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the first name of the person who was responsible for introducing The Rite to Australia on 23 August 1946? , can you please find it? On 18 February 1914 The Rite received its first concert performance (the music without the ballet), in St Petersburg under Serge Koussevitzky. On 5 April that year, Stravinsky experienced for himself the popular success of The Rite as a concert work, at the Casino de Paris. After the performance, again under Monteux, the composer was carried in triumph from the hall on the shoulders of his admirers. The Rite had its first British concert performance on 7 June 1921, at the Queen's Hall in London under Eugene Goossens. Its American premiere occurred on 3 March 1922, when Stokowski included it in a Philadelphia Orchestra programme. Goossens was also responsible for introducing The Rite to Australia on 23 August 1946 at the Sydney Town Hall, as guest conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.Stravinsky first conducted the work in 1926, in a concert given by the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam; two years later he brought it to the Salle Pleyel in Paris for two performances under his baton. Of these occasions he later wrote that \\"thanks to the experience I had gained with all kinds of orchestras ... I had reached a point where I could obtain exactly what I wanted, as I wanted it\\". Commentators have broadly agreed that the work has had a greater impact in the concert hall than it has on the stage; many of Stravinsky's revisions to the music were made with the concert hall rather than the theatre in mind. The work has become a staple in the repertoires of all the leading orchestras, and has been cited by Leonard Bernstein as \\"the most important piece of music of the 20th century\\".In 1963, 50 years after the premiere, Monteux (then aged 88) agreed to conduct a commemorative performance at London's Royal Albert Hall. According to Isaiah Berlin, a close friend of the composer, Stravinsky informed him that he had no intention of hearing his music being \\"murdered by that frightful butcher\\". Instead he arranged tickets for that particular evening's performance of Mozart's opera The Marriage of Figaro, at Covent...

Article: Whether you admit it or not, music improves our daily life and makes us feel easy, especially the music of Beethoven and Mozart. But can you believe that a school in England is using classical music to cut down students' bad behavior? The head teacher Brian Walker at the West Park School in Derby asks some students to stay behind after school on Fridays. He forces his students to listen to Mozart and other classical music. He also makes them copy his favorite poems and they have to watch educational videos. Mr. Walker says his main aim is to stop noisy pupils causing trouble in class for students who want to study. He said the students staying behind were \\"not the smokers or drinkers, the truants or the people who are late for school...It's those who have slowed the learning and teaching in class for everyone\\". Mr. Walker said this was unacceptable, because it was making the rest of the students fail to focus their attention on their study. Mr. Walker believes what he does reminds students that education is something to value. \\"It helps them see they are part of something bigger that will improve their life chances,\\" he said. The head teacher thinks students in fact learn from being kept behind after school. \\"Hopefully, I open their ears to an experience they don't normally have and don't want to have again, so it's both educational and acts as a warning.\\" Music has had success elsewhere in reducing bad behavior. In 2004, it reduced crime on London's subway by 25 percent. Researchers from a Belfast university found it helped stop elephants' bad behavior. However, one West Park student called Kieran said, \\"An hour of Mr. Walker's music is a real killer.\\" Question: Why does Mr. Walker say some students' bad behavior is unacceptable?

Answer:","output":"Specialization When animals and plants evolve to environmental conditions, the process that best describes this phenomenon is specialization. In the context of evolution, specialization refers to the development of unique adaptations and characteristics that allow species to exploit specific resources or occupy a particular ecological niche. This process enables different species to coexist by reducing direct competition for limited resources. Through the process of natural selection, individuals that possess traits that better allow them to survive and reproduce in a specific environment have a higher probability of passing on their genes to offspring. Over many generations, this leads to the evolution of distinct adaptations suited to the prevailing environmental conditions. For instance, animals may develop specific feeding strategies, behavioral patterns, or physical characteristics that enable them to better acquire resources, avoid predators, or cope with their surroundings. Specialization often occurs when competing species share similar ecological niches. By evolving different adaptations, each species can mitigate direct competition for resources and more effectively coexist. This can lead to the diversification of species, as populations diverge and occupy unique niches within their environments. Moreover, the specialization of a species is not only an adaptation to its abiotic environment, such as temperature, precipitation, or altitude, but also to the biotic environment. This includes interactions with other organisms, such as competition, predation, or mutualism. Thus, animals and plants evolving together in a shared environment can result in a complex web of relationships, where each organism affects the evolution of the others. An example of specialization can be seen in Darwin's finches in the Galapagos Islands. The diverse species observed have developed a range of beak shapes and sizes to effectively exploit different food sources. This specialization enabled different finch species to minimize direct competition and coexist in the unique island habitat. To summarize, the best answer to the question of what happens when animals and plants evolve to environmental conditions is specialization, as it encapsulates the process of developing unique adaptations to specific surroundings, leading to a reduction in direct competition and the coexistence of species."},{"instruction":"What happens next in this paragraph?

The statement indicates that \\"Insofar as the social insurance program applies to employees of the United States government, the terms and conditions are generally the same as the program for private employees.\\" This suggests that, at least in regards to the social insurance program, the terms and conditions are quite similar for both government and private sector employees. Social insurance programs may include benefits such as Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance, and workers' compensation. The statement implies that both private sector employees and government employees have access to these programs under similar conditions. However, it is essential to note that the statement specifies only the social insurance aspect, implying that outside of this scope, some differences between private-sector and government employees might still exist. For example, government employees and private-sector employees might have differences in terms of salary, job stability, promotional opportunities, work hours, and other fringe benefits like health insurance, pension plans, and vacation time. Factors such as the size, funding, and specific goals of an organization could also contribute to different employment terms and conditions. Additionally, government contracts and private employment contracts may have variations in their legal provisions. It is also worth noting that the statement includes the word \\"generally,\\" which implies that there might be some exceptions to the similarities between government and private sector employee terms and conditions concerning social insurance programs. These exceptions could occur in special circumstances or be tied to specific government departments or roles. In conclusion, based on the given statement, we cannot infer that there is a considerable variation between the terms and conditions for government employees and private sector employees. The statement specifically mentions the similarity in terms of the social insurance program, but it does not provide information that would enable us to draw conclusions about other terms and conditions outside of this scope. Therefore, we must acknowledge that there may be differences in other aspects of employment, and the statement cannot be broadly applied to all aspects of government and private sector employment terms and conditions."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about the following things: patrol, soldier, vehicle","output":"During a brisk, moonlit night, a vigilant soldier, dressed in stealthy camouflage and armed with unyielding determination, skillfully navigated his rugged all-terrain vehicle through the treacherous, winding pathways of the dense forest, meticulously orchestrating a strategic patrol that would ultimately ensure the safety and security of his fellow comrades and the country they all valiantly swore to protect."},{"instruction":"How does the next paragraph end?

Options: - office supply store - classroom - typewriter - computer printer - artist's studio The answer is \\"computer printer\\" because A:","output":"The widespread use of computer printers has become an integral part of modern society, particularly in professional and educational settings. With advancements in technology, many people now rely on computer printers to print their reports, documents, and other important materials. The answer \\"computer printer\\" is correct because computer printers are the central means of transferring digital text and images to paper, which has largely replaced the traditional method of handwriting or typewriting reports. The gradual shift from handwriting or typewriting to computer printing can be attributed to several factors: 1. Efficiency: Computer printers significantly increase the efficiency of printing. With computers, people can create, edit, and format documents much faster than writing by hand or using a typewriter. This increase in efficiency enables the completion of tasks in a much shorter period, which is especially important in professional environments where time efficiency is highly valued. 2. Legibility: One of the key advantages of printed documents over handwritten ones is legibility. Computer-generated text is much easier to read than handwritten text, which helps to reduce the potential for errors and misinterpretations. Moreover, computer printers offer various font types and sizes that can be tailored to specific needs, making documents more visually appealing and easier to comprehend. 3. Customization and Editing: Using computer printers allows for greater flexibility in customizing and editing documents. Word processing software enables users to easily edit text, adjust formatting, and insert images without having to rewrite or retype entire pages, as was necessary with handwritten or typewritten documents. 4. Environmentally Friendly: In the era of environmental consciousness, using computer printers can help to save paper and reduce waste by allowing for the efficient use of resources. Digital editing and review processes often reduce the need for multiple drafts and printed copies, minimizing paper consumption. 5. Multiple Copies and Sharing: The digital nature of computer-generated documents makes it easy to create multiple printouts or share files electronically. This facilitates collaboration among individuals, streamlining processes, and enhancing communication. Due to these factors, computer printers have become the preferred method for producing and printing reports and documents. While some people may still use typewriters for nostalgic reasons or for specific applications, handwriting and typewriting have become increasingly uncommon in the digital age. Similarly, while paper may still be used in office supply stores, classrooms, and artists' studios, the primary means of transferring digital content to paper is through the use of computer printers. As a result, the answer to the question is \\"computer printer,\\" as it is the primary tool responsible for the modern shift from handwriting and typewriting to printing."},{"instruction":"Question: Who did an analysis of World Values Survey data?

The answer is:","output":"The last step in the process of launching a satellite is the successful deployment of the satellite into its designated orbit around the Earth, followed by the initiation of its operational phase and monitoring. To provide a detailed overview, let's break down this final step into several sub-steps: 1. Launch window determination: Before the satellite can be launched, the appropriate launch window needs to be chosen. This is the specific time frame during which the launch is most favorable in terms of orbital mechanics, weather conditions, and availability of launch resources. The launch window is determined through a combination of factors including target orbit, desired satellite position, and ground station availability. 2. Transportation of the rocket: Once the satellite capsule is loaded onto the rocket, it needs to be transported to the designated launch site. This can be done by land, sea, or air depending on the distance and requirements of the particular launch facility. Once the rocket arrives, it is carefully installed on the launch pad. 3. Countdown and launch sequence: As the scheduled launch time approaches, a series of pre-launch activities are conducted, ranging from final checks and verification of the rocket's systems and payload to establishing communication channels with mission control and ground support. A countdown is initiated, which culminates in the actual rocket ignition and lift-off. 4. Ascent and stage separations: During the rocket's ascent, various stages of the rocket are jettisoned as their fuel is depleted. This process makes the rocket lighter and allows it to continue gaining altitude and velocity efficiently. 5. Orbit insertion and stabilization: After the rocket has reached sufficient altitude and speed, the satellite is deployed from its capsule through a series of carefully orchestrated maneuvers. The satellite's onboard propulsion system is then used to stabilize its position and achieve the desired orbit. 6. Initiation of operations and communication: Once the satellite has been successfully deployed, it undergoes a series of tests and adjustments to ensure all its systems are functioning as intended. This includes establishing communication links with ground stations, activation of the onboard scientific instruments, and fine-tuning its attitude and position. The satellite then commences its operational phase, during which it fulfills its designated mission and need, such as Earth observation, communication, or navigation. 7. Ongoing monitoring and control: From this point forward, the satellite is constantly monitored by the ground team to ensure proper functioning and to make any required adjustments or corrections. In case of any unexpected issues, contingency plans are in place to address them and ensure the satellite can continue its mission. In summary, the last step in the process of launching a satellite includes a series of complex activities, starting from determining the optimal launch window and culminating in the successful deployment of the satellite, initiation of its operational phase, and continuous monitoring and control throughout its lifetime."},{"instruction":"Produce a detailed sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = Cotto, food = Japanese, near = Café Rouge","output":"Cotto, an exquisite Japanese food establishment located just a stone's throw away from the popular Café Rouge, offers a delightful culinary experience infused with a blend of traditional and contemporary flavors, attracting both locals and tourists alike who crave the authentic taste of Japan prepared with the refinement and presentation worthy of its prestigious name."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

A study found going without sleep for just one night causes changes in the brain similar to those that occur after a blow to the head. The researchers said the healthy young men examined in the study showed a sudden increase in the same chemicals which indicate brain damage. Professor Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, Sweden, explained that the chemicals NSE and S-100B are biomarkers for brain damage, such as concussion . He said, \\"What we found was their levels in the blood rose in the group that went without sleep for a night. This was not to the extent that would happen after a head injury, for instance, but it was still significant. During sleep, the brain cleans poisonous substances off itself.\\" Benedict also said previous studies which linked a lack of sleep with increased risk of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis could applaud his study. The rise of the chemicals in the blood after sleep loss may suggest not getting enough sleep contributes to a loss of brain tissue, he explained.

Keep a diary of how the injuries impact your life, including missed workdays, routine activities you cannot undertake, and changes to you family life. This will determine how much your company, or the other motorist's company if they were at fault, is willing to pay to replace or fix your car. If you think the number is too low, get your own independent estimates, and then discuss them with your adjuster. Certainly the other motorist’s company, and perhaps your own, may not have your best interests at heart. If the other motorist’s insurance company calls you, politely refuse to discuss the accident with them and mention the call to your own insurance company or lawyer. If your company offers you an early settlement, do not sign it until you are sure you will be compensated for all your injuries. Some injuries – particularly back and neck ones caused by whiplash – might not show up or reach their maximum level of pain until weeks or even months after the accident. Summary:","output":"Tell your insurance company about car accidents right away, give them information about the other driver, and don't lie, so they can fix your car quickly, and you can protect yourself in case the other driver changes their mind or someone gets hurt."},{"instruction":"Question: Given the following context: Zappa expressed opinions on censorship when he appeared on CNN's Crossfire TV series and debated issues with Washington Times commentator John Lofton in 1986. On September 19, 1985, Zappa testified before the United States Senate Commerce, Technology, and Transportation committee, attacking the Parents Music Resource Center or PMRC, a music organization co-founded by Tipper Gore, wife of then-senator Al Gore. The PMRC consisted of many wives of politicians, including the wives of five members of the committee, and was founded to address the issue of song lyrics with sexual or satanic content. During Zappa's testimony, he stated that there was a clear conflict of interest between the PMRC due to the relations of its founders to the politicians who were then trying to pass what he referred to as the \\"Blank Tape Tax.\\" Kandy Stroud, a spokeswoman for the PMRC, announced that Senator Gore (who co-founded the committee) was a co-sponsor of that legislation. Zappa suggested that record labels were trying to get the bill passed quickly through committees, one of which was chaired by Senator Strom Thurmond, who was also affiliated with the PMRC. Zappa further pointed out that this committee was being used as a distraction from that bill being passed, which would lead only to the benefit of a select few in the music industry.Zappa saw their activities as on a path towards censorship, and called their proposal for voluntary labelling of records with explicit content \\"extortion\\" of the music industry.In his prepared statement, he said: The PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretational and enforcemental problems inherent in the proposal's design. It is my understanding that, in law, First Amendment issues are decided with a preference for the least restrictive alternative.

What might be the first step of the process?","output":"The first step of the dishwasher's cleaning process is to fill the dishwasher tub with water. This is essential as it provides the necessary medium for the subsequent steps to take place. When the dishwasher is turned on, it draws water from the household water supply line through a hose connected to the dishwasher's water inlet valve. The water inlet valve controls the flow of water entering the appliance, ensuring that the dishwasher receives the correct volume of water. Once the water fills the base of the dishwasher tub, it comes into contact with the heating element, which heats the water to the desired temperature depending on the chosen wash cycle. Typically, the dishwasher heats the water to a temperature between 120°F and 150°F (49°C to 65°C). This optimal temperature range effectively removes food particles, grease, and oils from the dishes while also helping the detergent to dissolve and work effectively. Moreover, the hot water enhances the efficiency of the detergent for breaking down food debris and loosening grime on dishes, which is carried out in the next steps of the process. Covering all bases, the hot water also aids in killing bacteria and germs, fostering a hygienic environment within the dishwasher. In summary, the first step of the dishwasher's cleaning process is filling the dishwasher tub with water from the household water supply line before heating it according to the selected wash cycle. This heated water serves as the foundation for the dishwasher's cleaning system, enabling the detergent to dissolve, loosening grime, and providing the medium required for the subsequent steps in the process."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: A Kenyan punter who won a 2m (Â£1.6m) jackpot after correctly predicting the outcome of 17 football matches doubts he will ever bet again.","output":"Title: Kenyan Punter Wins 2 Million Jackpot in Football Betting, Uncertain About Betting Again Once upon a time, in the land of Kenya, there lived a person who loved to guess which football teams would win or lose.

The next step would be to compare the sizes of the books against each other. This again requires an understanding of physical properties, in this case size and comparative measurement. 3. The third step involves physically manipulating the objects based on the information gathered in the first two steps. You would arrange the books on the shelf, perhaps starting with the largest ones at one end and gradually descending to the smallest ones at the other end.

George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade.

In fact, food is an important part of French culture. Families and friends spend hours over the dinner table each night. It is the opposite of the fast-food habit common in other parts of the West. It's the reason why the French are very angry that a McDonald's is opening beneath Paris's most famous museum: the Louvre . The new restaurant will be the 1,142nd McDonald's in France, and will open in the underground approach to the museum. But many French people can't understand why this American chain is opening in the heart of French culture. However, McDonald's is paying no notice to the complaint. McDonald's now has 31,000 chains worldwide. Tourists are hungry, and opening chains in tourist spots pays well. There is another chain threatening France's heritage. This time it is coffee rather than burgers. As more and more Starbucks open in Paris, traditional French cafes are forced to close. The trouble with American companies opening chains throughout the world is the destructive effect they can have on a country's culture. How can a small, independent coffee shop compete with the multi-billion dollar chain? You can go to a Starbucks in any city in the world, but you can only go to a Parisian cafe in France. Responsibility is with the tourists. A McDonald's wouldn't open so near the Louvre if it weren't not going to make money.

Article: The drug store was closing for the night. Young Alfred Higgins, the shop-assistant, was ready to go home. Mr. Carr, the boss, stared at him and said: \\"Stop! Alfred. Maybe you'd be good enough to take the things out of your pockets and leave them here before you go.\\" Alfred's face got red. After a little hesitation , he took out what he had stolen. Mr. Carr said, \\"Maybe I should call you mother and let her know I'm going to have to put you in prison.\\" Alfred thought his mother would come rushing in, eyes burning with anger. But, to his surprise, she arrived wearing a smile. \\"Hello, I'm Alfred's mother. Is he in trouble?\\" she said. Mr. Carr was surprised, too. He had expected Alfred's mother to come in nervously, shaking with fear, asking with wet eyes for a mercy for her son. Yet, she was most calm, quiet, and pleasant, which made Mr. Carr feel guilty . Soon Mr. Carr was shaking his head in agreement with what she was saying. \\"Of course\\", he said, \\"I don't want to be cruel. You are right. Sometimes, a little good advice is the best thing for a boy at certain times in his life and it often takes the youth a long time to grow up.\\" And he warmly shook Mrs. Higgins's hand. Back home, without even looking at Alfred, she said, \\"You are a burden. Your trouble came one after another, always! Why do you stand there so stupidly? Go to bed.\\" In his bedroom, Alfred heard his mother in the kitchen. Getting to the kitchen, he saw his mother drinking a cup of tea. His mother's face was a frightened, broken one, totally different from the earlier cool, bright face. She lifted the tea cup, her hands shaking, the lips moving nervously. He watched his mother quietly, without making a sound. The picture of his mother nearly made him cry. Realizing all the troubles he brought his mother in her shaking hands and the deep lines of worry in her grey face, he felt he shouldn't have done such a shameful theft to hurt his mother so deeply. He determined to grow up like a true man and protect his mother rather than hurt her again. Question: After the incident, young Alfred would probably _ . Options: A: feel frightened at her mother B: change his attitudes towards life C: hate Mr. Carr for hurting her mother D: have an argument with his mother The answer to this question is:","output":"B: change his attitudes towards life"},{"instruction":"Article: As with most of Europe, prehistoric Britain and Ireland were covered with forest and swamp. Clearing began around 6000 BC and accelerated in medieval times. Despite this, Britain retained its primeval forests longer than most of Europe due to a small population and later development of trade and industry, and wood shortages were not a problem until the 17th century. By the 18th century, most of Britain's forests were consumed for shipbuilding or manufacturing charcoal and the nation was forced to import lumber from Scandinavia, North America, and the Baltic. Most forest land in Ireland is maintained by state forestation programmes. Almost all land outside urban areas is farmland. However, relatively large areas of forest remain in east and north Scotland and in southeast England. Oak, elm, ash and beech are amongst the most common trees in England. In Scotland, pine and birch are most common. Natural forests in Ireland are mainly oak, ash, wych elm, birch and pine. Beech and lime, though not native to Ireland, are also common there. Farmland hosts a variety of semi-natural vegetation of grasses and flowering plants. Woods, hedgerows, mountain slopes and marshes host heather, wild grasses, gorse and bracken.

Catch ya's later. No one really knows what McGregor means. He may have just announced his retirement at the age of 27, or perhaps McGregor is simply sharing that he doesn't plan to fight well into his 30s. As one of the biggest stars in sports, and at the height of his earning potential, it would seem crazy for McGregor to actually retire - but he would certainly have lucrative options outside of the octagon. McGregor's Irish compatriot Becky Lynch suggested on Twitter that the UFC superstar should make the jump to professional wrestling and join WWE. McGregor wouldn't be the first MMA star to transition to WWE. \\"The World's Most Dangerous Man\\" Ken Shamrock is the best example of a success story. Shamrock came to WWE in 1997 as a former UFC Superfight Champion and became a star over a short two-year span, winning the Intercontinental title and the 1998 King of the Ring. MMA legend Dan Severn held the UFC Superfight title and the NWA heavyweight title simultaneously in 1995, and had a short run in WWE in the late 90s. Alberto Del Rio and Shinsuke Nakamura each had short MMA careers before stepping into a WWE ring, while Brock Lesnar became the UFC heavyweight champion after his first stint as a pro wrestler. Would McGregor work for WWE? He'd certainly be a massive draw, but would also undoubtedly clash with everyone else on the roster. McGregor has trained as a boxer and a fighter, but not as a pro wrestler - and it would be interesting to see if WWE would have McGregor remain a fighter (think Floyd Mayweather vs. The Big Show at WrestleMania) or have him actually learn how to wrestle. There's also the challenge of his character. McGregor has one of the biggest personalities in sports, and it would almost be comical to see him in any storyline that doesn't revolve around the WWE title. McGregor's such a big star that he would have to be treated as such, but that limits who he could believably face in WWE. As a five-matches-per-year, Brock Lesnar-type of attraction, McGregor could make for some must-watch pay-per-views, but it's hard to see him working as a weekly Raw main eventer. Alternatively, WWE could bring back the Lion's Den. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about a very famous UFC fighter named Conor McGregor. He recently wrote a message on Twitter saying he might retire, or stop fighting, while he's still young. Some people aren't sure what he really means by that. Then, a lady named Becky Lynch, who also comes from Ireland like Conor, suggested that maybe Conor should join the WWE, which is another type of fighting but it's more like a show, kind of like superheroes battling in a ring. Before, some fighters who were part of UFC, like Conor, joined WWE and became successful, like Ken Shamrock and Dan Severn. If Conor joined, people think a lot of other people would want to watch him. But, there might be some problems, because Conor is used to real fighting, not like the show fighting in WWE. Also, Conor is always the main star, so it might be hard for him to work with other fighters in WWE. Lastly, they could bring back a special type of fight called the Lion's Den."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Think slowly and carefully, before giving your answer.","output":"Yes, spinach has been a source of power in a comic-related movie. The character who relies on spinach to gain strength is Popeye the Sailor. Popeye is a fictional cartoon character who first appeared in the comic strip Thimble Theatre in 1929, created by Elzie Crisler Segar. Popeye is known for eating spinach, which gives him extraordinary strength almost instantly. The character made his way to various forms of media, including animated films and later, a live-action movie. In 1980, a live-action film titled \\"Popeye\\" was released, directed by Robert Altman and starring Robin Williams as Popeye. In this movie, Popeye's consumption of spinach plays a significant role in his power as it boosts his strength, allowing him to overcome challenges and adversaries.

Step 1: Identify the elements in the premise - Carcassonne can be disappointing at first sight - The best overall view is from the autoroute - The town is perhaps most impressive when illuminated at night Step 2: Identify the main claim in the hypothesis - Carcassonne in the daytime is not nearly as impressive as it is at night Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis - The premise states that Carcassonne can be disappointing at first sight, but then goes further to talk about when it is most impressive: at night, when illuminated. - The hypothesis focuses on the comparison of Carcassonne's impressiveness between daytime and nighttime. Step 4: Analyze if the premise supports the hypothesis - The premise mentions that Carcassonne is most impressive when illuminated at night. This indirectly implies that it might be less impressive during the daytime. - The hypothesis states that Carcassonne in the daytime is not nearly as impressive as it is at night. Final Step: Determine if the premise leads to the conclusion of the hypothesis - Based on the premise, it is implied that Carcassonne is more impressive at night when illuminated. This can be considered as supportive evidence for the hypothesis. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is likely true as well, since the information provided in the premise supports the conclusion of the hypothesis.

Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.\\", answer the following question.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. They are addressing two different topics: 1. Ways to describe a smile 2. How to keep calm I'll provide detailed answers for both questions. 1. Good ways to describe a smile: There are various ways to describe a smile depending on the context and the emotion you wish to convey. Here are some examples: - Warm smile: This indicates a friendly, welcoming, and genuine smile. - Bright smile: This suggests a radiant and lively smile. - Contagious smile: This means that the person's smile is so infectious that it makes others around them smile as well. - Shy smile: This describes a reserved and slightly bashful smile, often from someone who may be introverted or uncertain. - Beaming smile: This refers to a smile that is full of happiness, enthusiasm, and joy. - Mischievous grin: This indicates a playful, teasing, or cheeky smile. - Soft smile: This punctuates a gentle, calm, and tender expression of happiness. - Bittersweet smile: This portrays a mix of emotions, often happiness tinged with sadness or nostalgia. - Tense smile: This conveys a sense of unease or awkwardness in the smile. - Forced smile: This hints at insincerity or hiding the true feelings, like when someone smiles to be polite but doesn't truly feel happy. These are just a few examples, and there are many other ways to describe a smile by using adjectives or similes. 2. How to keep calm: Keeping calm is an essential skill to master for coping with stress, anxiety, and difficult situations. Here are some tips on how to maintain your composure: - Practice deep breathing: Focus on taking slow, deep breaths. Inhale through your nose for a count of four, hold the breath for four counts, and then exhale through your mouth for four counts. - Mindfulness meditation: Regular mindfulness meditation can help you become more aware of your thoughts and emotions, allowing you to respond calmly rather than reacting impulsively. - Grounding techniques: Bring yourself back to the present moment by focusing on your physical senses, such as touching an object, listening to a sound, or noticing your breath. - Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR): Tense and then relax different muscle groups throughout your body to release stress and tension. - Cognitive reframing: Change your perspective on a situation or challenge by looking at it from a different angle, identifying the positives, or considering alternative explanations. - Break tasks into smaller steps: When faced with overwhelming tasks, break them into smaller, manageable steps to feel more in control and less stressed. - Limit exposure to stressors: Identify the sources of stress and anxiety in your life and either remove them or reduce your exposure to them. - Engage in physical activity: Exercise has been proven to help reduce stress levels, so engage in regular physical activity, such as walking, jogging, or yoga. - Develop a support network: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help in managing your emotions and maintaining your calm. - Practice self-care: Take time for yourself to recharge and refresh, whether that's through hobbies, relaxation, or getting enough sleep. By incorporating these techniques into your daily life, you can develop a more resilient and calm mindset. Remember that maintaining your composure takes practice, and it's essential to be patient and compassionate with yourself when learning how to keep calm."},{"instruction":"Given a set of five words, generate the word from the set that does not belong (i.e. is the least relevant) with the other words.

Words 1, 4, and 5 are synonymous in this sense, and word 3, level, shares some similarity with the theme, but not to the same extent.

The concept of \\"Separation of powers\\" refers to the political model in which the government's power is separated into different branches, typically legislative, executive, and judicial. This aims to prevent the concentration and abuse of power in a single entity, providing checks and balances. 2. Power companies relate to the supply of electricity, not political power. The separation of powers does not address the connection between homes and power companies. 3. The choice of power company for your home is generally determined by factors like geographical availability, market competition, and personal preferences.

She originally appeared in the Talkartoon and Betty Boop film series, which were produced by Fleischer Studios and released by Paramount Pictures. She has also been featured in comic strips and mass merchandising. A caricature of a Jazz Age flapper, Betty Boop was described in a 1934 court case as: \\"combin[ing] in appearance the childish with the sophisticated--a large round baby face with big eyes and a nose like a button, framed in a somewhat careful coiffure, with a very small body of which perhaps the leading characteristic is the most self-confident little bust imaginable\\". Context: Betty Boop's best appearances are considered to be in her first three years due to her \\"Jazz Baby\\" character and innocent sexuality, which was aimed at adults. However, the content of her films was affected by the National Legion of Decency and the Production Code of 1934. The Production Code of 1934 imposed guidelines on the Motion Picture Industry and placed specific restrictions on the content films could reference with sexual innuendos. This greatly affected the Betty Boop cartoons. No longer a carefree flapper from the date the code went into effect on July 1, 1934, Betty became a spinster housewife or a career girl who wore a fuller dress or skirt. Additionally, as time progressed, the curls in her hair gradually decreased. She also eventually stopped wearing her gold bracelets and hoop earrings, and she became more mature and wiser in personality, compared to her earlier years. Right from the start, Joseph Breen, the new head film censor, had numerous complaints. The Breen Office ordered the removal of the suggestive introduction which had started the cartoons because Betty Boop's winks and shaking hips were deemed \\"suggestive of immorality\\". For a few entries, Betty was given a new human boyfriend named Freddie, who was introduced in She Wronged Him Right (1934). Next, Betty was teamed with a puppy named Pudgy, beginning with Betty Boop's Little Pal (1934). The following year saw the addition of the eccentric inventor Grampy, who debuted in Betty Boop and Grampy (1935). While these cartoons were tame compared to her earlier appearances, their self-conscious wholesomeness was aimed at a more juvenile audience, which contributed to the decline of the series. Much of the decline was due to the lessening of Betty's role in the cartoons in favor of her co-stars. This was a similar problem experienced during the same period with Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, who was becoming eclipsed by the popularity of his co-stars Donald Duck, Goofy, and Pluto, not to mention Fleischer's biggest success, Popeye. Since she was largely a musical novelty character, the animators attempted to keep Betty's cartoons interesting by pairing her with popular comic strip characters such as Henry, The Little King and Little Jimmy, hoping to create an additional spin-off series with her pairing with Popeye in 1933. However, none of these films generated a new series. When the flapper/jazz era that Betty represented had been replaced by the big bands of the swing era, Fleischer Studios made an attempt to develop a replacement character in this style in the 1938 Betty Boop cartoon Betty Boop and Sally Swing, but it was not a success. The last Betty Boop cartoons were released in 1939, and a few made attempts to bring Betty into the swing era. In her last appearance, Rhythm on the Reservation (1939). Betty drives an open convertible, labeled \\"Betty Boop's Swing Band\\", through a Native American reservation, where she introduces the people to swing music and creates a \\"Swinging Sioux Band\\". The Betty Boop cartoon series officially ended with Yip Yip Yippy (1939). While \\"Yip Yip Yippy\\" appears at the end of the Betty Boop series, it is only a one-shot about a \\"Drug Store\\" mail-order cowboy \\"wannabe\\" without Betty. \\"Yip Yip Yipee\\" was written mainly to fill the release schedule and fulfill the contract. Question: So it censored betty boop?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, the introduction of the Production Code of 1934, led by the National Legion of Decency and Joseph Breen, resulted in the censorship of Betty Boop. Due to the stricter guidelines placed on the content of films, particularly those concerning sexual innuendos, the character of Betty Boop had to be altered significantly to comply with the new regulations. The earlier version of Betty Boop portrayed a carefree flapper with her \\"Jazz Baby\\" character and innocent sexuality aimed at adults. However, with the imposition of the Production Code, subtle changes were made to her character. She transitioned from a carefree flapper to a spinster housewife or career girl. Her attire became more conservative, with fuller dresses and skirts. Additionally, her signature curls reduced, and she stopped wearing her gold bracelets and hoop earrings. These alterations made her more mature and wiser, in stark contrast to her original portrayal. Furthermore, the animated character's suggestive introduction was ordered to be removed as it was deemed \\"suggestive of immorality.\\" While the cartoons continued, the content was notably more wholesome, aimed at a younger audience. These changes, combined with the lessening of Betty Boop's role in her own cartoons in favor of her co-stars, contributed to the decline of the series. Her transition to the swing era also failed to capture the interests of her audience. In conclusion, the Production Code of 1934 played a significant role in censoring and altering the character of Betty Boop. The character's decline in popularity can be attributed to the changes made in light of the strict guidelines imposed by the code, resulting in a gradual drift away from her original, adult-focused portrayal."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Context: I asked everyone if they could find my keys, but it was Kendall who found them.

I found the following answer on Google: The roe can be \\"fresh\\" (non-pasteurized) or pasteurized , with pasteurization reducing its culinary and economic value. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","output":"No, the answer provided does not accurately explain how caviar is harvested. While it gives information about the preservation process, it doesn't describe the harvesting process itself. Caviar is the processed, salted eggs (roe) of female sturgeon fish. The harvesting process typically involves the following steps: 1. Fish selection: Mature female sturgeon are selected for harvesting based on their age, species, and readiness to provide roe. This can be assessed through ultrasound technology. 2. Roe extraction: The most traditional method is surgically removing the roe sacs from the fish, but this can result in the death of the fish. To ensure sustainability, no-kill methods have been developed. One of these methods is called \\"stripping\\" or \\"milking,\\" which involves massaging the fish's abdomen to release the eggs without the need for surgery. 3. Cleaning and washing: The harvested eggs are washed in cold water to remove any impurities and membranes attached to them. 4. Sieving and draining: The washed eggs are carefully sieved to remove water and allow them to drain. 5. Salting: An appropriate amount of salt (within the range of 2.8-4% salt by weight) is added to the drained eggs. This is a crucial step, as it not only helps to preserve the caviar but also defines its taste and texture. 6. Packing: Once the caviar has been salted, it is weighed and packed into tins or glass jars to ensure minimal exposure to light and air. The containers are then sealed to maintain freshness. Caviar can be pasteurized to prolong its shelf life, but this process may compromise its flavor, texture, and economic value. Therefore, many connoisseurs and chefs prefer fresh, non-pasteurized caviar for its superior taste and quality."},{"instruction":"What has good eyesight? Options: - (A) humans - (B) fur seals - (C) athletes - (D) bears - (E) goats - (F) geckos - (G) elephants - (H) rabbit OK. Let's think hard:","output":"To determine which among the options has good eyesight, let us analyze them one by one: (A) Humans: Humans have relatively good eyesight, capable of seeing a wide range of colors and focusing on objects both near and far. (B) Fur seals: Fur seals, as marine mammals, have good eyesight in the water to help them navigate and hunt. Their vision may not be as sharp as that of humans, but it serves them well in their aquatic habitats. (C) Athletes: Athletes are humans, and as such, their eyesight would generally fall into the same category as other humans. Some athletes might have better-than-average vision, but one's athletic ability does not inherently correlate to eyesight. (D) Bears: Bears have decent eyesight, but it is not their strongest sense. Their sense of smell is incredibly powerful and is more significant in their daily activities. (E) Goats: Goats actually have quite good eyesight, thanks to their rectangular-shaped pupils. This unique adaptation allows them to have an extremely wide field of vision, which is useful for detecting predators and navigating rough terrain. (F) Geckos: Geckos also have good eyesight, as their large, sensitive eyes enable them to see well in low-light or nighttime conditions. This helps them navigate and hunt insects in the dark. (G) Elephants: Elephants have relatively poor eyesight compared to their large size. Their vision is considered to be somewhat blurred and is not their strongest sense. They primarily rely on their sense of smell, hearing, and touch. (H) Rabbits: Rabbits have good eyesight, particularly in detecting movement and seeing in low-light conditions. Their eyes are positioned on the sides of their head, giving them a wide field of vision for spotting predators. Based on this analysis, the options with the best eyesight are (A) humans, (E) goats, (F) geckos, and (H) rabbits. Among these four, the answer that stands out in terms of exceptional eyesight would be (F) geckos, due to their ability to see well in low-light and nighttime conditions."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Topalov scored nine victories and three draws in the two-hour demonstration, which marked the Day of St. Cyril and Methodius and the Day of Bulgarian Letters and Culture.\\" to Turkish?","output":"Tabii, işte bu cümle Türkçe olarak: \\"Topalov, iki saatlik gösteride dokuz galibiyet ve üç beraberlik aldı.

Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes.

The character first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #129 (January 1980) and was co-created by writer-artist John Byrne and Chris Claremont. A mutant, Pryde possesses a \\"phasing\\" ability that allows her, as well as objects or people she is in contact with, to become intangible. This power also disrupts any electrical field she passes through, and lets her simulate levitation. Kitty Pryde was introduced into the X-Men title as the result of an editorial dictate that the book was supposed to depict a school for mutants. Uncanny X-Men artist John Byrne named Kitty Pryde after a classmate he met in art school, Alberta College of Art and Design in Calgary in 1973. He had told Pryde he liked her name and asked for permission to use it, promising to name his first original comics character after her. Byrne drew the character to slightly resemble an adolescent Sigourney Weaver. The fictional Kitty Pryde first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #129 (January 1980), by writer Chris Claremont and artist Byrne, as a highly intelligent 13-year-old girl. Claremont said several elements of the character's personality were derived from those of X-Men editor Louise Simonson's daughter, Julie. Claremont and Byrne made the new character a full-fledged X-Man in issue #139, where she was codenamed \\"Sprite\\". She was the main character in issues #141-142, the \\"Days of Future Past\\" storyline, where she is possessed by her older self, whose consciousness time travels to the past to prevent a mass extermination of mutants. The six-issue miniseries Kitty Pryde and Wolverine (1984-1985), written by Claremont, is a coming-of-age storyline in which she matures from a girl to a young woman, adopting the new name \\"Shadowcat\\". In the late '80s, she joined the British-based super team, Excalibur, where she remained for roughly ten years before coming back to the X-Men. In the early 2000s, she disappeared from the spotlight after semi-retiring from superhero work. She was featured in the 2002 mini-series Mekanix and came back to the main X-Men books in 2004 under the pen of Joss Whedon in Astonishing X-Men. She remained a part of the X-Men books until 2008 when she left again for roughly 2 years. After coming back, she was featured in Jason Aaron's Wolverine and the X-Men and Brian Michael Bendis' All-New X-Men books. In early 2015, she joined the Guardians of the Galaxy. After the Secret Wars event, she adopted her new alias, Star-Lord (first believed to be Star-Lady). Shadowcat's popularity had a profound effect on the real-life Kitty Pryde: the latter became so overwhelmed by attention from Shadowcat fans, she abbreviated her name to K.D. Pryde to avoid association with her fictional counterpart. She has since stated she has mixed feelings about her fame, saying she values Byrne's comics for their entertainment and artistic value, but wishes more people would appreciate her as more than just Shadowcat's namesake. What else was interesting about this characters history?","output":"Alright kiddo, Kitty Pryde is a really interesting character from the Marvel Comics. She's a superhero with a special power called \\"phasing\\" that lets her and anything she touches become see-through, kind of like a ghost! She was created by two people, John Byrne and Chris Claremont, and first showed up in a comic book about the X-Men in January 1980. Kitty's power also let her walk through walls and float in the air, like magic! She joined the X-Men when she was only 13 years old because they were supposed to be like a school for people with special powers, called mutants. The people who made Kitty Pryde wanted her to look like a young woman named Sigourney Weaver, and her character was inspired by the daughter of one of the writers, named Julie. She had lots of adventures with the X-Men and even had a comic book all about her and her friend Wolverine. As Kitty grew up, she changed her superhero name to \\"Shadowcat\\" and joined other teams like Excalibur and the Guardians of the Galaxy. The real-life person who inspired Kitty Pryde's name, K.D. Pryde, had a lot of people want to know about her because of the character. She felt a bit strange about it but still liked the comics. So, Kitty Pryde, or Shadowcat, is a cool superhero with special powers who has been in lots of comic book stories and has even inspired real people!"},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.

There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive.

How to conduct a motor vehicle report review for prospective employees Make sure you are authorized to request the report. Each state has its own set of laws and regulations that control who may see a driver's motor vehicle report. The driver himself may, of course, request the report.","output":"Step 1: Obtain consent from the prospective employee Before proceeding with the motor vehicle report review, it is crucial to obtain written consent from the prospective employee. This ensures that their privacy is respected and that the process is conducted legally and ethically. Inform the candidate about the purpose of the report, how it may affect their employment, and that their consent is necessary for you to access their driving record. Step 2: Determine the relevant state laws Once consent has been obtained, research the specific laws and regulations related to motor vehicle report access in the candidate's residential state.

Here are possible answers to this question: - get to work - stress - use gas - speeding ticket - get depreciation I believe the correct choice is \\"use gas\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"When you're driving to work, multiple things can happen to your car. However, when considering the possible answers given: - get to work - stress - use gas - speeding ticket - get depreciation, we will analyze each option and determine the most fitting answer. 1. Get to work: This is a general outcome but does not describe what happens to the car. It talks about the purpose of driving your car to work, but doesn't address what changes the car experiences during this process. 2. Stress: This option seems to address the driver's emotional state rather than the car. While it is true that driving to work can cause stress for some people, it does not happen to the car itself. 3. Use gas: This is the most logical answer as cars consume fuel when they are being driven. If you are driving your car to work, it will use gas during the journey. The car's internal combustion engine generates power by burning gasoline, allowing the car to move. 4. Speeding ticket: This scenario may or may not occur during your drive. It indicates that the driver gets caught for driving over the speed limit, but receiving a speeding ticket is not a direct result of driving to work. It depends on how the driver operates the car. 5. Get depreciation: While cars do depreciate over time, it is not a direct result of driving to work. Depreciation occurs due to factors such as the car's age, mileage, and external factors (e.g., economic conditions). This option may be indirectly related to driving the car, but it is not as directly relevant as the \\"use gas\\" choice. In conclusion, considering the given options, the correct choice is \\"use gas,\\" as it directly reflects the action that impacts the car when you are driving to work.

He has come west to New Mexico from New York City, along the way having been fired from eleven newspapers for libel, adultery, and heavy drinking, among other charges. Now that his car has broken down and Tatum is broke, he talks his way into a reporting job for the Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin, a paper of little consequence. Tatum stays sober and works there uneventfully for a year. Then while unhappily on assignment to cover a rattlesnake hunt, he learns about Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict), a local man who has become trapped in a cave collapse while gathering ancient Indian artifacts. Sensing a golden opportunity, Tatum manipulates the rescue effort, convincing an unscrupulous sheriff to pressure the construction contractor charged with the rescue into drilling from above, rather than shoring up the existing passages, so that Tatum can prolong his stay on the front pages of newspapers nationwide. Lorraine (Jan Sterling), the victim's wife, goes along with the reporter's scheme. She is eager to leave Leo and their struggling business in the middle of nowhere, a combination trading post and restaurant. Thanks to the publicity Tatum generates, she experiences a financial windfall, particularly from thousands of tourists who come to witness the rescue. Herbie Cook (Robert Arthur), the newspaper's young photographer, slowly loses his idealism as he follows Tatum's lead and envisions himself selling pictures to Look or Life. The editor of the Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin tries to talk some sense into his employees, but Tatum quits on the spot, having sold the exclusive rights to his copy to a New York editor for a lot of money and, more importantly, his old job back. Thousands flock to the town. The rescue site literally becomes a carnival, with rides, entertainment, songs about Leo, even games of chance. Tatum begins drinking again.

Deena Marten is a 15-year-old who has become a rebel since dating Garret Lexau, another rebellious teen who was suspended from school for hitting a teacher. Deena no longer keeps any of her promises, skips school and leaves the family home whenever she pleases. Her newfound harsh attitude upsets her mother, Cynthia, who once enjoyed a close relationship with her daughter. Cynthia is frustrated because the lines of communication have broken down between mother and daughter. Cynthia's relationship with her own mother is not entirely pleasant. Although Cynthia's alcoholic mother advises her daughter to be stricter with Deena, Cynthia does not heed the advice. For example, she tidies Deena's bedroom, a chore which Cynthia has consistently and politely reminded her daughter to do. When Deena discovers what Cynthia has done, she is less than grateful and reacts violently and ends up pushing her mother. Adam, Deena's younger brother notices the impact that Deena's behavior has upon his mother and drinks alcohol in order to forget about the family problems. At one point, Cynthia and Deena's relationship seems to improve, until Cynthia finds out that she has been skipping school. Her confrontation leads to an argument, during which Deena slaps her.

In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War.

Librarian Jacob Meir Abdellak, who lives in east London, made the call eight minutes before his 5.47 a.m. Norwegian Air flight from Gatwick Airport was due to leave on May 11 because he was significantly late and airline staff had refused to allow him on board, a court heard. His hoax meant passengers had to be re-screened and take-off was delayed by 90 minutes. An investigation by Gatwick revealed that the hoax call had been made using the same number linked to his booking. When Abdellak returned to the airport to take another flight to the United States on May 22, he was arrested. He initially claimed he had lost his phone’s SIM card but on Tuesday pleaded guilty at Lewes Crown Court to communicating false information regarding a noxious substance likely to create serious risk to human health. He was sentenced to 10 months in prison. “This was a quite ridiculous decision made by Abdellak, who fabricated an extremely serious allegation purely for his own benefit,” said Gatwick Police Chief Inspector Marc Clothier on Thursday. “He was running late for his flight and thought it would be a good idea to call in a hoax bomb, however this turned out to be the worst decision he could have made.” ||||| An airline passenger made an anonymous hoax bomb threat to delay his flight because he was running late. Librarian Jacob Meir Abdellak called police at 5.46am on 11 May - just eight minutes before the plane was due to set off from London's Gatwick Airport to Los Angeles in the US. Officials were forced to postpone take-off for 90 minutes to carry out a full security screening. Abdellak arrived \\"significantly late\\" and became abusive when he was prevented from boarding by airline staff and told to rearrange his trip for another date. The Frenchman was arrested when he returned eleven days later on 22 May to catch another flight to the US. Investigators had discovered the phone number used to make the bomb threat was the same one used to make the flight booking with Norwegian Airlines. He admitted it was his number but claimed he had lost the SIM card a few days before the hoax call was made. Abdellak, of Amhurst Park, Hackney, was charged with communicating false information regarding a noxious substance likely to create serious risk to human health. He denied the offence until the day of his trial at Lewes Crown Court on Tuesday, when he changed his plea to guilty. Abdellak was jailed for 10 months and ordered to pay a £140 victim surcharge.

Many cultures have worshipped dogs as sacred beings or used canine symbols in their mythology, cementing the profound relationship that we, as humans, have shared with our four-legged companions throughout history. But is the bond between humans and dogs just emotional, or is there underlying scientific evidence that explains why we fall in love with our dogs? The answer, it seems, is embodied in a captivating combination of biology, evolution, and social behavior. One key piece of evidence originates from a field of science dubbed \\"evolutionary psychology\\". Multiple studies within this discipline propose that humans' natural affinity towards dogs is interlinked with our species' evolutionary history. Early humans who were capable of forming strong alliances with animals, particularly dogs, tended to survive longer, benefiting from dogs' hunting skills, protection, and company. This symbiotic relationship, sculpted over thousands of years, has deepened the affectionate connection between humans and dogs, shaping an emotional bond that we often associate with love. But how do we quantify love? To comprehend why we fall in love with our dogs, it is essential to understand the neurochemical processes that underlie these intensely powerful feelings. The hormone oxytocin, often labeled as the \\"love hormone,\\" significantly contributes to this bonding process. When humans interact with their dogs, levels of oxytocin increase in both species. This mutual biochemical interaction was discovered by a group of Japanese researchers in 2015. They found that dog owners and their pets, after gazing into each others' eyes, experienced a notable rise in their oxytocin levels, akin to the bond between a mother and her infant. Such findings illustrate a tangible neurochemical basis for humans' profound love for dogs. It is not just hormones and evolutionary history, though; a significant facet of this strong bond is also rooted in social behavior. Scientifically speaking, dogs are one of the few species that seek out eye contact with humans and can accurately read our emotions. This capacity to communicate non-verbally fosters a deep interpersonal connection, a hallmark of love in human relationships. Moreover, several psychologists argue that the attachment between humans and their pets parallels the bond between parents and their children. The term \\"secure base effect\\", coined by John Bowlby in his attachment theory, is often applied to explain this relationship. Dogs, like children, consider their caretakers as a secure base from which they can explore their environment. This significant role creates an emotionally enriched bond, further driving the loving relationship between humans and their dogs. Research also unveils the beneficial impact of this bond on human health. Petting a dog can lower blood pressure, reduce stress hormones, and increase serotonin and dopamine levels – the 'feel-good' chemicals. In this scientifically-backed framework of mutual attachment and wellness-boosting, the idea of humans 'falling in love' with their dogs becomes more than just a romanticized notion. In conclusion, from the perspectives of evolutionary psychology, neurochemistry, and social behavior, there is considerable scientific evidence supporting the profound bond - or rather, profound love - that humans share with their dogs. While the language of love can often seem unquantifiable and immeasurable, it is gratifying to note that the affection we share with our canine companions is deep-rooted in biology and science - a true testament to the thousands of years of our shared evolutionary journey. Therefore, the saying that a dog is a man's best friend may not just be a catchy phrase; it might be an anthrozoological fact."},{"instruction":"Greeks The Greeks of classical antiquity idealized their Mycenaean ancestors and the Mycenaean period as a glorious era of heroes, closeness of the gods and material wealth.

The abandoned hen-house was given a state-of-the-art £275,000 makeover, transforming it into a modern four-bedroom bungalow. Architect Martin Hall saw the cracking potential of the egg-laying shed, due to the stunning views of the Black Mountains on the Welsh border. As a result, the ramshackle wooden barn, which was left abandoned for decades, has been given a new lease of life after being converted it into a luxury holiday property, available to anyone who can shell out £175 a night. The rural holiday home, in Monmouth, South Wales, features floor to ceiling glass walls, allowing light to spill into the plush interior which can accommodate up to eight people. It has now been shortlisted for the Gold Medal for Architecture at Wales’ biggest arts festival, the National Eisteddfod. A spokesman for architects Hall and Bednarczyk said: “The former poultry barn was abandoned for several decades and in a rundown state. “We demonstrated how its utilitarian agricultural identity could be retained in a convincing and contemporary architectural form.” The Chepstow-based architects added: “The roof and flanking walls employ black corrugated sheeting and timber cladding in a refined and affectionate re-working of typical agricultural materials. “Polished concrete floors and boarded timber walls provide a sophisticated nod to the building’s humble origins.” The Gold Medal recognises architectural excellence and the winner will be announced during the festival in early August.

The Welsh government said a new curriculum could help \\"develop respect and understanding for other cultures\\". But what difference would the potential shake-up make to how Religious Education (RE) is taught in schools? The government is looking at a revamp of the curriculum for all subjects, in line with recommendations made by Professor Graham Donaldson in his Successful Futures report. Mr Lewis said the potential changes to RE could encourage pupils to also consider \\"ethics and citizenship\\" and \\"what it means to be a citizen of a free country\\". The move has been welcomed by the Humanist Society, which represents non-religious people. But faith groups have criticised the proposal with Rheinallt Thomas, former head of the national religious education centre, claiming there will be a campaign against it. Former Cardiff head teacher and Methodist lay preacher, David Kitchen, told BBC Radio Wales: \\"Some people will be appalled because they will see it as dilution\\". However, he said the repositioning of RE could be \\"interesting\\", pointing to the clear link between the big questions in philosophy and religion. \\"The problem will be there is an enormous territory,\\" he added. \\"You could have something that's woolly and flaccid and, frankly, a bit dull.\\" The education minister said schools needed to \\"rise to the challenge\\" of improving community cohesion, when outlining his vision to the Senedd in mid July. In response to a question about tackling extremism, Mr Lewis said: \\"My proposal...my contention would be that we rename the RE curriculum and transform it into the religion, philosophy and ethics element of the curriculum\\". He said there would be an \\"an explicit commitment to allowing children to ponder ideas around ethics and citizenship and what it means to be a citizen of a free country\\". But Saleem Kidwai, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Wales, said only effective RE teaching could create a \\"better understanding\\" of the \\"similarities and values\\" of different faiths. He said positioning RE alongside the other suggested subjects would not be helpful. \\"Ethics and philosophy are part of my religion. So, if religion is taught properly then it will encompass all of those things,\\" he added. \\"The same goes for the Jewish and Christian community and other faith communities.\\" The teaching of RE is currently a statutory curriculum requirement for pupils from reception onwards, as part of humanities.

He bumps into Sally, and they begin chatting. During their conversation, Sally notices the beer in Joe's hand, and remarks that a beer sounds like a good idea. She heads over to the refrigerator and grabs a nice cold one and pops it open. She takes a sip while the two continue their chat. But I can use this background: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C. What is an answer for this question: Which person's beer has molecules farther apart? A:","output":"A: Based on the given situations and the background information about the behavior of water (and by extension, the behavior of beer, which mainly consists of water), Joe's beer would have molecules farther apart compared to Sally's beer. Here's an explanation: - Joe has been carrying his beer around for a while, which means it has likely warmed up due to the room temperature and body heat from his hand. As the temperature of the beer increases, the molecular motion speeds up, and the molecules move farther apart. - Sally has just taken her beer from the refrigerator, meaning it is still cold and at a lower temperature than Joe's beer. The molecular motion in her beer is slower, and the molecules are closer to one another.

Question: suppose more pollution in the environment happens, how will it affect LESS forest formation. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: Less The various stages of forest formation outlined in the question are all part of a process known as ecological succession. This process is the gradual change in the species composition of an ecosystem over time as plants and other organisms slowly replace each other in an orderly sequence. However, an increase in pollution can negatively impact this process and lead to less forest formation. Here's a detailed explanation as to how more pollution can affect the different stages of the ecological succession process and result in less forest formation: 1. Grass and small plants grow in an area: High levels of air pollution, such as smog and particulates in the atmosphere, can reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface. Photosynthesis, which is the process by which plants create energy from sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water, becomes less efficient under these conditions. This can lead to slower growth rates and even the death of grass and small plants. Additionally, ground-level ozone, a common pollutant, harms plants by reducing photosynthesis, stunting growth and reducing plant biomass. 2. These plants die: Air pollution not only affects the growth of plants but can also weaken plants, making them more susceptible to pests, diseases, and other stressors. With more plants dying, there might not be enough organic material to help subsequent growth of other plants. 3. The soil gains organic material: As the dead plants decompose, they provide organic material to the soil. However, if an increase in pollution affects either the amount of plant biomass dying or the rate of decomposition, there will be less organic matter added to the soil. For example, acid rain, a form of pollution caused by airborne emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, can disrupt the soil pH balance, hindering the decomposition of organic matter and negatively affecting soil microorganisms. 4. The soil becomes more fertile: Soil fertility is closely linked to the balance of nutrients, organic matter, and the activity of soil microorganisms. Any imbalance in these factors due to pollution can reduce soil fertility. A less fertile soil might not be able to support the growth of larger plants and trees. 5. Larger plants are able to be supported: Under normal conditions, as soil fertility increases and grasses and small plants die, larger plants can take root and thrive. However, if pollution has affected soil fertility and the overall health of the ecosystem negatively, the process of supporting larger plants may be restricted, reducing the chances of successful growth and establishment of larger plants. 6. Trees eventually grow: In the final stage of ecological succession, trees grow and form a mature forest ecosystem. However, if the earlier stages are hindered by pollution, the formation of a mature forest ecosystem becomes less likely. Furthermore, some pollutants can have a direct influence on tree health, making them more susceptible to damage from pests, diseases, and extreme weather events. In summary, increased pollution levels can have a detrimental effect on the stages of ecological succession that lead to forest formation. Higher levels of pollutants can affect plant growth and health, soil fertility, and the balance of microorganisms, reducing the likelihood of successful forest formation. Hence, the correct answer is B: less forest formation."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"On difficult nuclear issues, such as North Korea and Iran, Bush has pursued multilateral consultation and coordination with other powers.\\" to Russian?","output":"По сложным ядерным вопросам, таким как Северная Корея и Иран, Буш проводил многосторонние консультации и координацию с другими державами.

The 38-year-old is accused of stealing the gallstones, which are prized in eastern medicine and can be worth 20,000 a kilogram, over six months from the Oakey slaughterhouse. The Toowoomba stock and rural crime investigation squad this week raided a property at Cranley and a 38-year-old man was charged. He will appear in the Toowoomba magistrates court on 23 June. “Having dealings with the industry … we know that in the abattoir game they do actually lock up and secure these gallstones, because of their value, but it’s definitely not something we’ve come across too often,” said Acting Detective Senior Sergeant Brendan Murphy of the Toowoomba stock and rural crime investigations squad. Murphy said police had to act fast because the small gallstones are easy to dispose of. “There was a good chance they were going to be in the fridge,” he said. “If they weren’t in the fridge we would have been looking all day.” Cattle gallstones are used in alternative medicine to treat hepatitis and other liver and gall bladder-related ailments. They form in a variety of shapes and sizes, and their value is determined by colour, texture, size and dryness. “It appears to me a bit like valuing gemstones - you have good ones and bad ones,” Murphy said. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Photo: Supplied A 38-year-old man has been charged with stealing cattle gallstones, which can apparently sell for as much as 20,000 a kilogram. The stones are used in traditional Chinese medicine under the belief they can treat hepatitis and other liver and heart-related diseases. Acting on a tip-off, officers from the Stock and Rural Crime Investigation Squad (SARCIS) raided a property in the Toowoomba suburb of Cranley on Thursday, uncovering a hoard of the stones. Police allege they were stolen from a nearby abattoir over six months and are believed to be of \\"considerable value\\". Advertisement Toowoomba SARCIS Senior Constable Glenn Evans said the stones had been valued but he wouldn't say how much they were worth. \\"It was less than half a kilo, of varying quality,\\" he said. \\"They certainly weren't all top-quality stones. \\"We don't want to blow it out of proportion. It was nowhere near the 20,000 mark.\\" He says gallstone theft does happen but it's not common. \\"I couldn't comment on how often but it isn't common because if you consider there aren't that many avenues for collecting them,\\" he said. Gallstones are small, hard masses that form in the gallbladder from a digestive fluid called bile and can be very painful. Griffith University traditional chinese medicine (TCM) expert Dr Yunjiang Feng said gallstones were a \\"very common\\" ingredient among practitioners. \\"It is believed however it formed should have some effect to cure where it is produced,\\" she said. \\"They believe the stone is formed in problems with cattle between heart and liver, therefore this can be used to treat diseases related to (those) organs. \\"So as a result it can be used for many different things related to heart and liver disease.\\" Dr Feng said although there were many TCM practitioners in Australia, she believed cattle gallstones would mostly be sent overseas to China and other Asian countries where the practice was more common. She said she imagined the stones would offer \\"some black market attractions\\" because they were in high demand. A SARCIS blog post said the value was determined by dryness, colour, texture, size and whole and broken pieces. \\"Whole, smooth, lustrous, golden specimens attract the highest price,\\" the post read. \\"Dark and pitted stones as well as stones with calcium inclusions (white) are of reduced value. \\"It is understood that quality stones may reach values of around 20,000 per kilogram.\\" Contrary to popular belief, gallstones were not an aphrodisiac, police said. Gold Coast-based cattle gallstone trader Jenny Murtagh told the ABC gallstones were used in Eastern medicine for heart, liver and general wellbeing. \\"It doesn't cure anything but it's a highly prized product,\\" she said.

Sentence B: \\"bridges are built to cross rivers\\" Bridges do indeed serve the purpose of providing a connection over rivers, making it easier for people to travel from one side to another. This sentence is logical. After the evaluation, we can conclude that Sentence A: \\"bridges are built to attract tourists\\" is the less logical option when compared to Sentence B."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Plot title: Snake Eyes Movie plot: On a dark and stormy night, corrupt, flamboyant Atlantic City police detective Rick Santoro (Nicolas Cage) attends a boxing match at Gilbert Powell's (John Heard) Atlantic City Arena between heavyweight champion Lincoln Tyler (Stan Shaw) and challenger Jose Pacifico Ruiz. He meets up with his best friend since childhood, Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise), who is a US Navy Commander working with the Department of Defense to escort Defense Secretary Charles Kirkland (Joel Fabiani) and Powell at the fight after a trip to Norfolk, Virginia. As the first round begins, Dunne is distracted by an attractive redhead named Serena (Jayne Heitmeyer) who wears a ruby ring, and leaves his seat, which is then taken by Julia Costello (Carla Gugino), a mysterious woman with platinum blonde hair and a white satin suit. When Tyler is unexpectedly knocked out by Ruiz, gunshots ring out, mortally wounding Kirkland and grazing Costello, who loses her glasses and blonde wig, revealing her naturally dark hair. Dunne kills the sniper and Santoro orders the arena to be locked down. Despite the lockdown, Costello escapes into the casino, covers her wounds in pieces of cloth from her blouse and after stealing a black satin jacket, disguises herself as a hooker. Santoro becomes suspicious when he notices that the 'knocked out' Tyler woke up instantly when the shots rang out, and after studying the fight tape, realizes the knockout punch didn't connect. In his dressing room, Tyler confesses that he threw the fight in order to pay gambling debts, but he was never told that anyone would be killed and reveals that he was paid to take a dive by Serena, the same red-headed woman who tricked Dunne into leaving his post.

The story begins when Peter is sent to Manhattan to retrieve his playboy cousin Keith (Ellison) and immediately falls in love with Francey. After a whirlwind one-day courtship, Peter and Francey get married, and they and Keith return to the Morgan family's home, where Peter teaches at the university run by his father Peter Morgan Sr. (Coburn).

While Peter decides how to approach his father with the news, Francey stays at a women-only hotel, and Peter and Keith introduce her as a new botany student.

A:","output":"The American Red Cross, a humanitarian organization providing emergency assistance, disaster relief, and education both domestically and internationally, owes its foundation to Clara Barton. Clara Harlowe Barton, born on December 25, 1821, in North Oxford, Massachusetts, was a pioneering nurse, teacher, and humanitarian who dedicated her life to helping others. The idea of establishing a branch of the international Red Cross movement in the United States stemmed from her experiences as a nurse during the American Civil War and as an independent relief provider during the Franco-Prussian War. During the Civil War, Barton gained the nickname \\"Angel of the Battlefield\\" for her relentless efforts to treat and care for wounded soldiers, often putting her own life at risk in the process. After the war ended, Barton worked for the War Department, helping reunite missing soldiers with their families. In 1869, Barton traveled to Europe to recover from exhaustion stemming from her wartime work. During her stay in Switzerland, she was introduced to the Red Cross movement, which had been established by Swiss humanitarian Jean-Henri Dunant in 1863. The movement sought to create international guidelines for the protection and care of wounded soldiers, as well as non-combatants, during times of armed conflict. This idea resonated strongly with Barton, who saw the potential impact this organization could have in the United States. In the 1870s, Barton provided aid to the victims of the Franco-Prussian War, working alongside members of the International Red Cross. Inspired by her experiences and the organization's mission, Barton decided to bring the Red Cross to the United States upon her return in 1873. Despite initial resistance from the U.S. government and public, Barton's persistence paid off. In May of 1881, the American Red Cross was founded, with Clara Barton serving as its first president. Under Barton's leadership, the American Red Cross expanded its mission to cover not just wartime aid but also peacetime disaster relief efforts. The organization played a significant role in responding to natural disasters such as floods, fires, and earthquakes, providing support and resources to those affected. Clara Barton's dedication, vision, and unrelenting efforts to help those in need laid the foundation for the American Red Cross, which now stands as one of the world's leading humanitarian organizations."},{"instruction":"What key details about antonio ungar can be extracted from the following bio?

He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.

Article: Smartphones, poor sight Look around and you'll see people busy on their smartphones. Smartphones do make our lives easier . But have you ever thought about what they mean to your eyes? According to a study, half of British people own smartphones and they spend an average of two hours a day using them. There has been a 35% increase in the number of people in the UK who suffer from shortsightedness since smartphones were introduced there in 1997. Staring at smartphones for long time gives you dry eyes. When looking at something in the distance, your eyes automatically blink a certain number of times. However, when you look at things closer to your face, the blinking slows down. This reduces the amount of tears and causes discomfort in your eyes. Another bad habit is using smartphones in dark rooms before going to sleep. If you look at a bright screen while your pupils become larger, too much light enters your eyes. This can do harm to the eyes and cause a disease called glaucoma . While you're probably not going to stop using to your _ , there are a few things you can do to protect your eyes. Hold your phone at least 30 centimeters away from your eyes when using it.

Here are possible answers to this question: - bag - desk - drawer - shirt pocket - car I believe the correct choice is \\"drawer\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"A good place in a home to keep an extra eyeglasses case is indeed in a \\"drawer\\", and here's why: 1. Accessibility: Keeping an extra eyeglasses case in a drawer, such as your nightstand or office desk, allows you easy access when you need it. You'll know exactly where it is and be able to locate it easily. 2. Protection: Storing an extra eyeglasses case in a drawer offers protection for both the case and your eyeglasses from potential damage. Drawers typically provide a stable, less exposed environment that keeps the case and your eyeglasses safe from dust, moisture, and accidental bumps or falls. 3. Organization: Drawers are ideal for keeping personal belongings and household items organized. By allocating a specific drawer for your extra eyeglasses case (possibly alongside other essential items and daily accessories), you maintain a clutter-free environment and minimize the chances of misplacing or losing the case. 4. Limited space: Most homes have limited space to store personal items. Since drawers are a common feature in bedrooms, living areas, and workspaces, it makes sense to utilize them for storing extra items such as an eyeglasses case. Designating a drawer for the case keeps it secure without sacrificing additional storage space or surface area. In comparison to the other options mentioned: - Bag: While a bag is portable and can be carried with you, it may not be a convenient choice for home storage, as the eyeglasses case can easily get lost in the bag's contents or become difficult to access quickly. - Desk: Placing an extra eyeglasses case on your desk might seem convenient, but it can contribute to clutter and the risk of damage due to accidental falls or spills. - Shirt pocket: A shirt pocket is not a stable or secure place for storing an extra eyeglasses case at home, as it is susceptible to being misplaced, dropped, or damaged. - Car: Storing an extra eyeglasses case in the car can be practical for on-the-go use but may not be helpful when you need it at home. Additionally, depending on the environment, the case or eyeglasses may be exposed to temperature fluctuations, which could cause damage. In summary, keeping an extra eyeglasses case in a designated drawer at home is an excellent choice for accessibility, protection, organization, and efficient use of space."},{"instruction":"Reconstruct a question, answer pair from this explanation: Coral reefs provide food and shelter to many ocean organisms.

The word \\"freedom\\" has been banned, and uttering it is a crime punishable by death. People are constantly monitored, and their words are censored. This society values stability and control over individual rights and expression. Step 2: Introduce conflict Wallace, a quiet but intelligent man, begins to question the government's oppressive stance on speech and freedom. He secretly starts researching the true meaning of freedom and the cultural history before the censorship began. In this process, he discovers an underground group called The Free Speakers, who are dedicated to spreading the message of freedom and ending the government's oppressive rule. Step 3: Develop the story Wallace gains the trust of The Free Speakers and joins their group, becoming more active in their clandestine efforts. They secretly print and distribute pamphlets to educate the public about the true meaning of freedom and the importance of individual expression. As Wallace becomes more involved, he becomes more dedicated to the cause and becomes a key member of the group. Step 4: Introduce tension and escalation As the movement starts gaining momentum, the government's surveillance and crackdown efforts intensify. Members of The Free Speakers are arrested, and their secret meetings are infiltrated by government spies. Despite the dangers, Wallace and his allies are determined to continue fighting for their cause. Step 5: Climactic confrontation The government's oppressive rule reaches a breaking point as they announce the public execution of several prominent members of The Free Speakers. Wallace, knowing that he cannot allow the execution, hatches a plan to save his fellow members. He infiltrates the execution site and waits for the perfect moment to strike.

The movement gains momentum and eventually leads to the downfall of the oppressive regime.

The band's album debut, Tin Machine (1989), was initially popular, though its politicised lyrics did not find universal approval: Bowie described one song as \\"a simplistic, naive, radical, laying-it-down about the emergence of Neo-Nazis\\"; in the view of biographer Christopher Sandford, \\"It took nerve to denounce drugs, fascism and TV ... in terms that reached the literary level of a comic book.\\" EMI complained of \\"lyrics that preach\\" as well as \\"repetitive tunes\\" and \\"minimalist or no production\\". The album nevertheless reached No. 3 and went gold in the UK.Tin Machine's first world tour was a commercial success, but there was growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member. A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label. Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band. Tin Machine began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work. Performing his early hits during the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, he found commercial success and acclaim once again.In October 1990, a decade after his divorce from Angie, Bowie and Somali-born supermodel Iman were introduced by a mutual friend. Bowie recalled, \\"I was naming the children the night we met ... it was absolutely immediate.\\" They married in 1992. Tin Machine resumed work the..., what would be the answer ?

Here we go: 1. \\"Whatever choice you make\\" is a dependent clause. Let's translate this first. In Czech, it can be translated as \\"Jakoukoli volbu, kterou uděláte\\". 2. \\"let it come from your heart\\" can be translated as \\"nechte ji přijít od vašeho srdce\\". Now, combining these translations while considering the nuances of the Czech language, the whole translated sentence should be: \\"Jakoukoli volbu, kterou uděláte, nechte ji přijít od vašeho srdce.\\" This translation accurately conveys the meaning and feeling of the original English sentence. It might not be a word-for-word translation, but it respects the context of the sentence, which is more important when translating between languages."},{"instruction":"What's the most logical way to complete this passage?

This option completes the partial sentence in the paragraph most cohesively. The context suggests that Mr. Lauder's generous donation to the Metropolitan Museum of Art is not only meant for the residents of New York but also for global audience who visit this esteemed institution. Hence, the phrase \\"New York and those from around the world who come to visit our great arts institutions\\" aptly captures the intended beneficiaries of this significant act of philanthropy. The reason why other options are less suitable is mostly because they either refer to specific works of art, artists, titles, or individuals, which would restrict the intended broadness of the audience that Mr Lauder is addressing. His statement is presumably not to give the donation to the people who live and work in 'a sculpture' or 'a company', or specific artists, as these options may imply, but rather to everyone in New York and incoming visitors from elsewhere who value art. Therefore, using \\"New York\\" best fits within the context of the statement made by Mr. Lauder about his generous donation. He wants to emphasize that his gesture is dedicated to the residents of the city where the museum is located as well as it's international visitors who would benefit from enjoying and learning from this rich collection of Cubist art."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Options: - relaxation - loud noises - compose music - making music - sadness Let's think now! Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"There could be several reasons for trying to stop someone from playing the violin, considering the options you have provided: 1. Loud noises: This is perhaps the most likely reason you might try to stop someone from playing the violin. If the violin is being played too loudly or in an inappropriate setting (e.g., indoors in a small apartment building or late at night), the loud noise may cause disturbance and annoyance to others, making it necessary to ask the person to stop playing for the moment. 2. Sadness: If the music being played on a violin evokes a strong emotional response in someone and causes them to feel sad or upset, you might try to stop the person from playing the instrument to prevent further emotional distress. However, it still depends on the context and the feelings of the people around the violinist. The other options, relaxation, compose music, and making music, seem like positive aspects of playing the violin and would not be valid reasons for trying to stop someone from playing.

Species in this subgenus are: - The tomato (see pronunciation) is the edible fruit of \\"Solanum lycopersicum\\", commonly known as a tomato plant, which belongs to the nightshade family, \\"Solanaceae\\". The species originated in Central and South America. The Nahuatl (Aztec language) word \\"tomatl\\" gave rise to the Spanish word \\"tomate\\", from which the English word tomato originates. Numerous varieties of tomato are widely grown in temperate climates across the world, with greenhouses allowing its production throughout the year and in cooler areas. The plants typically grow to in height and have a weak stem that often sprawls over the ground and vines over other plants. It is a perennial in its native habitat, and grown as an annual in temperate climates. An average common tomato weighs approximately . Its use as a food originated in Mexico, and spread throughout the world following the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Tomato is consumed in diverse ways, including raw, as an ingredient in many dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks. While tomatoes are botanically berry-type fruits, they are considered culinary vegetables, being ingredients of savory meals. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Microtus is a genus of voles found in North America, Europe, and northern Asia. The genus name refers to the small ears of these animals. About 62 species are placed in the genus. They are stout rodents with short ears, legs, and tails. They eat green vegetation such as grasses and sedges in summer, and grains, seeds, roots, and bark at other times. The genus is also called \\"meadow voles\\". (ITIS database) The species are: Subgenus \\"Microtus\\" Subgenus \\"Terricola\\" Subgenus \\"Mynomes\\" Subgenus \\"Alexandromys\\" Subgenus \\"Stenocranius\\" Subgenus \\"Pitymys\\" Subgenus \\"Pedomys\\" Subgenus \\"Hyrcanicola\\" - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - A vole is a small rodent; a relative of the mouse, with a stouter body, a shorter, hairy tail, a slightly rounder head, smaller ears and eyes, and differently formed molars (high-crowned and with angular cusps instead of low-crowned and with rounded cusps). There are approximately 155 species of voles. They are sometimes known as meadow mice or field mice in North America and Australia. Vole species form the subfamily Arvicolinae with the lemmings and the muskrats. - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - The water voles are large voles in the genus Arvicola . They are found in both aquatic and dry habitat through Europe and much of northern Asia . A water vole found in Western North America was historically considered a member of this genus , but has been shown to be more closely related to members of the genus Microtus ( Conroy and Cook , 2000 ; Musser and Carleton , 2005 ) . Head and body length are 12 -- 22 cm , tail length is 6.5 -- 12.5 cm , and the weight is 70 -- 250 g. The animals may exhibit indeterminate growth . They are thick - furred and have hairy fringe on feet that improves their swimming ability . - Alexandromys is a subgenus of voles in the genus \\"Microtus\\". Species in this subgenus are: - Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term \\"botany\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (\\"botan\\") meaning \\"pasture\\", \\"grass\\", or \\"fodder\\"; is in turn derived from (\\"boskein\\"), \\"to feed\\" or \\"to graze\\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants. - A mouse (plural: mice) is a small rodent characteristically having a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail and a high breeding rate. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (\\"Mus musculus\\"). It is also a popular pet. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter. - Mynomes is a North American subgenus of voles in the genus \\"Microtus\\". Species in this subgenus are: References. D.E. Wilson & D.M. Reeder, 2005: Mammal Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference. Third Edition. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore. - The Black Sea is a body of water between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It is supplied by a number of major rivers, such as the Danube, Dnieper, Rioni, Southern Bug, and Dniester. The Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of , and a volume of . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south and by the Caucasus Mountains to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about . - The Arvicolinae are a subfamily of rodents that includes the voles, lemmings, and muskrats. They are most closely related to the other subfamilies in the Cricetidae (comprising the hamsters and New World rats and mice). Some authorities place the subfamily Arvicolinae in the family Muridae along with all other members of the superfamily Muroidea. Some refer to the subfamily as the Microtinae or rank the taxon as a full family, the Arvicolidae. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - In biology and botany, indeterminate growth is growth that is not terminated in contrast to determinate growth that stops once a genetically pre-determined structure has completely formed. Thus, a plant that grows and produces flowers and fruit until killed by frost or some other external factor is called indeterminate. For example, the term is applied to tomato varieties that grow in a rather gangly fashion, producing fruit throughout the growing season, and in contrast to a determinate tomato plant, which grows in a more bushy shape and is most productive for a single, larger harvest, then either tapers off with minimal new growth/fruit, or dies. - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. - A lemming is a small rodent, usually found in or near the Arctic, in tundra biomes. Lemmings are subniveal animals and together with voles and muskrats, they make up the subfamily Arvicolinae (also known as Microtinae), which forms part of the largest mammal radiation by far, the superfamily Muroidea, which also includes rats, mice, hamsters, and gerbils. - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats. What entity does 'arvicola' has the relation 'parent taxon' with?

Movie title: Lemon Tree Context: Salma, a Palestinian widow - living there for decades - has to stand up against her new neighbor, the Israeli Defence Minister, when he moves into his new house opposite her lemon grove, on the green line border between Israel and the West Bank. The Israeli security forces are quick to declare that Salma's trees pose a threat to the Ministers safety and issue orders to uproot them. Together with Ziad Daud, a young Palestinian lawyer, Salma goes all the way to the Israeli Supreme Court to try and save her trees. Her struggle raises the interest of Mira Navon, the Defence Minister's wife, trapped in her new home and in an unhappy life. Despite their differences, and the borders between them, the two women develop an invisible bond, while forbidden ties grow stronger between Salma and Ziad. Salmas legal and personal journey lead her deep into the complex, dark and sometimes funny chaos of the ongoing struggle in the Middle East, in which all players find themselves alone in their struggle to survive. As usual, the Palestinian cause is dismissed, the movie ends with the Israeli wife moving out (obviously separating from her husband), a tall concrete wall has been built between the two properties and a final camera shot shows us half the trees have been cut right down.

A: Between 19˚N and 19˚S, however, precipitation is higher and the mountains above 5,000 m (16,400 ft) usually have permanent snow. Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: Glaciers are not typically found between the north latitudes of 30°N and 30°S, as this region encompasses the tropics and subtropics, where temperatures are generally warmer. However, there are a few exceptions due to altitude and unique local conditions. In the tropics, the average temperatures are too high for glaciers to form or be sustained, but glaciers can still be found in some high-altitude locations. One notable exception occurs in the tropical Andes Mountains in South America, where some glaciers exist above 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) due to the high precipitation rates and lower temperatures associated with higher altitudes. Another significant exception is the presence of glaciers on Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, which is located just 3° south of the equator. These glaciers are experiencing rapid melting due to climate change and are expected to disappear in the coming decades. There are also isolated cases of glaciers occurring within the tropics on high volcanic peaks in Oceania, such as Puncak Jaya in Indonesia, at about 4° south latitude. These glaciers are formed and maintained by their altitude and specific climate conditions. Generally, glaciers are not found between the north latitudes of 30°N and 30°S (tropics), but several exceptions exist due to specific locations that provide the necessary cooler temperatures and precipitation for glaciers to form and survive. However, as global temperatures continue to rise, these glaciers are retreating and disappearing, making their presence increasingly rare in tropical and subtropical regions."},{"instruction":"Write the last sentence in this story.

Article: If you can see the magic in a fairytale, you can face the future.\\" --Danielle Steel Who have not read fairytales? We all have had the experience of reveling in the beauty and innocence of fairytales. May it be Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty... fairytale is a word which cannot be new to us. But have you ever traveled ages back to the earliest of times and uncovered the fascinating facts about these stories? Well, if not, then here are some mystical finds I discovered when I undertook this journey. A fairytale or fairy story is a fictional tale that usually features folkloric characters (such as fairies, talking animals). A fairytale often stars transformed princes, princesses, animals, as in \\"fairytale ending\\" where the humble but heroic princes defeat the wicked enemies or as in \\"fairytale romance\\" where after much ado the beautiful princesses marry their Prince Charming. One distinct feature of fairytales is that, they take place \\"once upon a time\\". The history of the fairytale is particularly difficult to trace. The oral tradition of the fairytale came long before the written page. The oldest known fairytales stem from ancient Egypt around 1,300 B.C and now, after traveling through various periods of time, they have grown and matured in various aspects and have become the most popular genre of stories for young children. The most famous authors of fairytales are the Grimm Brothers whose works include Cinderella, Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and many more; The Grimm Brothers collected their tales from farmers and edited them to suit their audience. But whatever may the form be, fairytales are after all fairytales! G. K. Chesterton said, \\"Fairytales do not tell children the dragons exist; they tell the dragons can be killed.\\" This quote has great weight. Every child believes in fairies, dragons, etc. They do not need fairytales to tell them that. Instead fairytales tell that good always succeed over evil. So fairytales are necessary for young minds. Fairytales are narrated to... Question: By saying \\"Fairytales do not tell children the dragons exist; they tell the dragons can be killed.\\", G. K. Chesterton meant _ .

Glam artists drew on diverse sources ranging from bubblegum pop and '50s rock and roll to cabaret theatrics, science fiction, and complex art rock. The flamboyant clothing and visual styles of performers were often camp or androgynous, and have been described as playing with nontraditional gender roles. - Strawbs (or The Strawbs) are an English rock band founded in 1964. Although the band started out as a bluegrass group they eventually moved on to other styles such as folk rock, progressive rock, and (briefly) glam rock. - Hounslow is the principal town in the London Borough of Hounslow in Greater London and is part of the historic county of Middlesex. It is a suburban district 10.6 miles (17 km) west south-west of Charing Cross. It forms a larger post town in the TW postcode area and is an economic hub within the capital; it has a large shopping centre which adjoins its high street and a large number of restaurants, cafés and small businesses, many of which are associated with product assembly, marketing, telecommunications and London Heathrow Airport. A minority of its workers are employed in Central London, to which the town is connected by rail and tube. Hounslow is part of the TW3 postcode area, though some areas to the west are in TW4 instead. The population of the town, comprising the Hounslow Central, Hounslow Heath and Hounslow South wards, was 41,304 in the 2011 census. - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - Richard Christopher \\"Rick\\" Wakeman (born 18 May 1949) is an English keyboardist, songwriter, television and radio presenter, and author. He is best known for being in the progressive rock band Yes across five tenures between 1971 and 2004 and for his solo albums released in the 1970s. - Grave New World is a studio album by English band Strawbs . It was the first album to be released after the departure of Rick Wakeman , under circumstances about which band leader Dave Cousins was very bitter . Cousins has admitted that the track \`\` Tomorrow '' was written about Wakeman . Happily their friendship survived and the two have since performed and recorded together , releasing an album Hummingbird in 2002 . Wakeman 's departure to join prog - rockers Yes caused a lot of predictions of Strawbs demise . Cousins was into the I Ching at the time and he asked the book what he should do . The answer was used in the lyrics for the first track on the album , \`\` Benedictus '' . Blue Weaver , late of Amen Corner , was recruited and considered by most fans to be a more than adequate replacement for Wakeman . The album depicts the story of one man 's life . For instance , the track \`\` Hey Little Man '' represents an older man giving advice to his young son . The songs themselves show the continuation of the movement away from Strawbs ' original folk leanings . Founding member Tony Hooper began to be increasingly uncomfortable with this and left after the recording sessions of this album . The original vinyl album had lavish artwork and included a pamphlet showing the lyrics of each track together with details of instrumentation . The front cover is a reproduction of William Blake 's Glad Day . The album reached number 11 in the UK Album Charts . - Folk rock is a musical genre combining elements of folk music and rock music. In its earliest and narrowest sense, the term referred to a genre that arose in the United States and the United Kingdom around the mid-1960s. The genre was pioneered by the Los Angeles band the Byrds, who began playing traditional folk music and songs by Bob Dylan with rock instrumentation. The term \\"folk rock\\" was coined by the U.S. music press to describe the Byrds' music in June 1965, the month in which the band's debut album was issued. - Dave Cousins (born David Joseph Hindson, 7 January 1945, Hounslow, Middlesex, England) is an English singer and songwriter, who has been the leader, singer and most active songwriter of Strawbs since 1967. - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. What entity does 'grave new world' has the relation 'genre' with? A:","output":"'Grave New World' has the relation 'genre' with progressive rock, folk rock, and, to a lesser extent, glam rock. The album was released by the English band Strawbs, which experimented with these various musical styles throughout their career. The album showcases a departure from their original folk leanings and a movement towards a more progressive rock sound, incorporating elements of folk rock as well.

To me, Son de Mar is beautiful to SEE, but there's precious little substance, unless mawkish, melodramatic, manipulative love yarns turn you on. This may be one of those famous 'chick flicks' you've heard so much about. We're about half-way through this film before anything really happens: Ulises (Jordi Molla) goes out to sea looking for tuna, and doesn't come back, leaving his wife Martina (Leonor Watling) and son to fend for themselves. Then, in a furious six minutes of screen time, they bury Ulises, Martina gets married again, and her son grows into mid-childhood. This rapid transposition is jarring, to say the least, and very sloppy: after 40 minutes of more or less hanging around, we're suddenly into a full-blown melodrama, all in six minutes. I think this is called wayward narrative pacing. Five years later, Ulises (as in the wandering superhero Ulysses; get it?), returns to his 'Penelope' (Watling) only to find she's married to Sierra (Eduard Fernandez), an inexplicably wealthy guy (what does he DO to earn all that dough?) who inexplicably keeps crocodiles as pets. When Martina, in great anger, questions Ulises about his absence, he tells her that he'll take her to the island of Sumatra someday and she'll understand EVERYTHING. And here's the thing: he DOESN'T take her to the island of Sumatra. The reference just dies somewhere in the script. He DOESN'T really explain where he was and why he ignored his wife and child for five years. He DOESN'T acquit himself as an honourable guy, and the movie DOESN'T fill in the plot holes that are staring at us for at least half of the film. I can only assume that director Bigas Luna wants us to fill in the story lines with the mystical clues (fish, reptiles, the sea) he offers through breathtaking cinematography and evasive dialogue. It just doesn't work. The narrative 'arc' on this film ends up looking more like a wobbly clothesline. I'm sure Jordi Molla is a good actor, but I just couldn't buy his Ulises as any kind of hero (which is what the original Ulysses was supposed to be). With moist sensuality, he spouts a short stanza of identical poetry from Virgil roughly 2,000 times and each and every time it excites Martina to explosive orgasm. This guy should be rented out to reinvigorate stale marriages. I'm sure Virgil would be impressed. He didn't get laid that often, as I understand it. This poetic 'device' figures prominently in the film, and I had no choice but to assume it was a gender reversal of Ulysses' famous 'siren song' (i.e. beautiful maidens singing seductively to far-off sailors, who were doomed if they answered the, well, siren call). If this is what Bigas Luna is up to, you can see the problem -- he's offering convoluted symbolism in a snatch-and-grab attempt at High Art. Once again, it just doesn't work, at least in my eyes. Watling is a beautiful and magnetic young actor, but she gives us a character here who doesn't seem to have much intellectual or even romantic depth. It's beyond me how she could desperately fall in love with a guy who sports a for-rent sign on his face (as in vacant), oily 1960s-style hair that looks more like seaweed, and one of those trendy 21st-century 'beards' (you know, four days' growth, no more, no less). He's SUPPOSED to be a dreamy kind of guy (I think), but those eyes of his suggest he might be suffering more from overexposure to a preposterous script. But, don't despair, this film is great to look at. Just don't try to connect the dots on the red herrings or think too much about what you're hearing in the way of dialogue.

Your task is to classify whether the given answer is correct or not by providing \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\", based on the article. Article: Common sense would tell us that physically active children may be more likely to become active and healthy adults. In the United States, elementary and middle schools are advised to give students two and a half hours of physical activity a week. That is what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart Association recommend. They say high schools should provide about four hours of physical activity each week. Yet many schools across the country have reduced their physical education programs. Just this week, a study reported that life _ has fallen or is no longer increasing in some parts of the United States. The situation is worst among poor people in the southern states, and especially women. Public health researchers say it is largely the result of increases in fatness, smoking and high blood pressure. They also blame differences in health services around the country. In 2006, a study found that only four percent of primary schools provided daily physical education all year for all grades. This was true of eight percent of middle schools and two percent of high schools. The study also found that twenty-two percent of all schools did not require students to take any P.E. Charlene Burgeson , a health expert says one problem for P.E. teachers is that schools are under pressure to put more time into academic subjects. Also, parents may agree that children need exercise in school. Yet many parents today still have bad memories of being chosen last for teams because teachers favored the good athletes in class. But experts say P.E. classes have changed. They say the goal has moved away from competition and toward personal performance, as a way to build a lifetime of activity. These days, teachers often lead activities like weight training and yoga. Some parents like the idea of avoiding competitive sports in P.E. class. Yet others surely dislike that idea. In the end, schools may find themselves in a no-win situation. Question: According to the passage which of the following may not lead to poor health? Options: (A) Fatness.

His father was a sharecropper named Agustin Arango, and his mother was Micaela Arambula. He grew up at the Rancho de la Coyotada, one of the largest haciendas in the state of Durango. After Villa successfully captured the strategic prize of Torreon, Carranza ordered Villa to break off action south of Torreon and instead to divert to attack Saltillo. He threatened to cut off Villa's coal supply, immobilizing his supply trains, if he did not comply. This was widely seen as an attempt by Carranza to divert Villa from a direct assault on Mexico City in order to allow Carranza's forces under Alvaro Obregon, driving in from the west via Guadalajara, to take the capital first. This was an expensive and disruptive diversion for the Division del Norte. Villa's enlisted men were not unpaid volunteers but paid soldiers, earning the then enormous sum of one peso per day. Each day of delay cost thousands of pesos. Disgusted but having no practical alternative, Villa complied with Carranza's order and captured the less important city of Saltillo, and then offered his resignation. Felipe Angeles and the rest of Villa's staff officers argued for Villa to withdraw his resignation, defy Carranza's orders, and proceed to attack Zacatecas, a strategic railroad station heavily defended by Federal troops and considered nearly impregnable. Since the colonial era, Zacatecas was the source of much of Mexico's silver, and thus a supply of funds for whoever held it. Villa accepted his staff's advice and cancelled his resignation, and the Division del Norte defied Carranza and attacked Zacatecas. Attacking up steep slopes, the Division del Norte defeated the Federals in the Toma de Zacatecas (Taking of Zacatecas), the single bloodiest battle of the Revolution, with Federal casualties numbering approximately 7,000 dead and 5,000 wounded, and unknown numbers of civilian casualties. (A memorial to and museum of the Toma de Zacatecas is on the Cerro de la Bufa, a key defense point where the Federal Army was entrenched.) Villa's victory at Zacatecas in June 1914 broke the back of the Huerta regime. Huerta left the country on 14 July 1914. The Federal Army collapsed, ceasing to exist as an institution. In August 1914, Carranza and his revolutionary army entered Mexico City ahead of Villa. Civil war between the winners was the next stage of the Revolution.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities.

This indicates that the danger is most likely related to the contact made during the sport. Step 3: Comparing options related to danger - Small cuts: Although small cuts may occur during fencing, they are not as common since fencers wear protective clothing to minimize the risk of injury. - Puncture wound: Fencing involves using thrusting weapons like foils, epees, and sabers, which are designed to strike the opponent with the tip of the blade, increasing the risk of puncture wounds. - Injury: It is too broad an option, as it could include several types of injuries related to fencing (puncture wounds, bruises, sprains, etc.). Step 4: Eliminating non-danger-related options - Competition: A common aspect of any sport, not necessarily a danger - Panting: A physical response to exertion, also not considered a danger Step 5: Choosing the best option - Puncture wound The most common danger when participating in the sport of fencing is \\"puncture wound\\" because fencing weapons are designed to strike opponents with their tips, increasing the risk of such injuries.

During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana. I am facing a new situation today: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets. Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which planet is currently making less oceanic crust? Answer:","output":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article, Timon is the planet currently making less oceanic crust. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that Timon has been a stable planet with no continental movement for a while now. In contrast, the planet of Sarahn is going through a large geographic shift with continents breaking apart and moving. As mentioned in the article, during periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Since young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods, causing an increase in the formation of oceanic crust. Therefore, given the current situation of both planets, Timon is making less oceanic crust compared to Sarahn."},{"instruction":"In this task, you're given a review from Amazon.

Until about a century ago, the deep ocean floor was completely inaccessible and hidden beneath waters averaging over 3,600 meters deep. Totally without light and in the case of intense pressures hundreds of times greater than at the earth's surface, the deep-ocean bottom is a strange environment to humans, in some way as frightening and remote as the outer space. Although researchers have taken samples of deep-ocean rocks for over a century, the first detailed global study of the ocean bottom did not actually start until 1969, with the beginning of the National Science Foundation's Deep Sea Drilling Project(DSDP). Using techniques first developed for the offshore oil and gas industry, the DSDP's drill ship, the Glomar Challenger, was able to maintain a steady position on the ocean's surface and drill very deep waters, taking samples of rocks from the ocean floor. The Glomar Challenger completed 96 voyages in a 15-year research program that ended in November 1983. During this time, it sailed 600,000 kilometers and took almost 20,000 samples of rocks around the world. Those samples have allowed geologists to reconstruct what the planet looked like hundreds of millions of years ago and to make out what it will probably look like millions of years in the future. Today, largely on the strength of evidence gathered during the Glomar Challenger's voyages, nearly all earth scientists agree on the theories of plate tectonics and continental drift that explain many of the geological processes. The sample of rocks drilled by the Glomar Challenger have also provided a climatic record stretching back hundreds of millions of years. The information of past climatic change can be used to predict the future climate. Options: A It is a military submarine. B It is used to develop tourism. C It has gone on over 100 voyages.

Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: When we consider the predictability of the stock market, we must take into account a myriad of factors that influence its movements. First, there are external factors such as global economic trends, political events, and natural disasters, all of which have the potential to drive dramatic shifts in market performance. The complexity and interconnectedness of these occurrences make predictions exceedingly difficult. Furthermore, the stock market is influenced by various internal factors, such as company management decisions, financial performance, and industry competition. These elements constantly change as businesses evolve, innovate, and respond to market threats and opportunities. This unpredictability ensures that accurately forecasting the rise and fall of each company's stock prices is a significant challenge. Additionally, the behavior and perceptions of individual investors play a significant role in market movements. Human emotions, such as fear and greed, can drive decision-making based on irrational factors, rather than objective financial data. This psychological element further complicates any attempt to accurately predict stock market trends. Lastly, it's worth acknowledging that even if we could collect and analyze all the available data to create a highly advanced predictive model, there would still be unquantifiable risks that defy prediction. This is especially true in the long term, as unforeseen events such as technological breakthroughs and major geopolitical changes can sway market trends in unexpected ways. In light of these factors, the answer is clear: it is not possible to tell with absolute certainty the long-term movements of the stock market."},{"instruction":"Review: I have nothing against religious movies.

That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang. Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative.

In Pompeo's background, however, are indications of his capabilities: First in his class at the U.S. Military Academy, time served on the House of Representative's intelligence committee, a brief stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and two meetings with Kim in Pyongyang.

He plans to take advantage of Trump's political naivete to deceive him === The correct answer is A:","output":"While it is difficult to pinpoint Kim Jong Un's exact motivations in meeting with Trump, it is likely that his motivations include a combination of options A, B, and D. A. He admires Trump and is genuinely willing to cut back or eliminate his nuclear program in return for a lifting of sanctions: It is possible that Kim Jong Un sees a genuine opportunity in working with Trump to bring about changes to the region. By agreeing to denuclearize, Kim Jong Un could gain economic benefits for his country as a result of the lifting of sanctions. This, in turn, could help build a stronger economy and improve the living standards for the citizens of North Korea, which could potentially strengthen Kim Jong Un's grip on power. B. He wants to appear as a competent statesman before the world and his subjects: Kim Jong Un's decision to meet with Trump was a historic event and has undoubtedly increased his profile on the global stage. By engaging in dialogue with the United States, he has portrayed himself as a competent and reasonable leader, improving his image both internationally and domestically. D. He plans to take advantage of Trump's political naivete to deceive him: It is possible that Kim Jong Un intends to use his interactions with Trump to buy time and continue developing his nuclear program covertly. Additionally, he could be trying to drive a wedge between the United States and its allies in the region, such as South Korea and Japan, in order to weaken the US's influence over East Asia. In conclusion, Kim Jong Un's motivations for meeting with Trump are likely multifaceted and may include a combination of admiration for Trump, a desire to appear as a competent statesman, and a strategic plan to deceive the US and its allies. However, without more information, it is impossible to determine the precise weight of each of these factors in Kim Jong Un's decision-making process."},{"instruction":"Q:You are considering whether to buy a product.

Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, fatigue, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later. In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms. This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria. The disease is most commonly transmitted by an infected female \\"Anopheles\\" mosquito. The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito's saliva into a person's blood. The parasites travel to the liver where they mature and reproduce. Five species of \\"Plasmodium\\" can infect and be spread by humans. Most deaths are caused by \\"P. falciparum\\" because \\"P. vivax\\", \\"P. ovale\\", and \\"P. malariae\\" generally cause a milder form of malaria. The species \\"P. knowlesi\\" rarely causes disease in humans. Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films, or with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests. Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction to detect the parasite's DNA have been developed, but are not widely used in areas where malaria is common due to their cost and complexity. The risk of disease can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites through the use of mosquito nets and insect repellents, or with mosquito control measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water. Several medications are available to prevent malaria in travellers to areas where the disease is common. Occasional doses of the combination medication sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine are recommended in infants and after the first trimester of pregnancy in areas with high rates of malaria. Despite a need, no... - Mosquito control manages the population of mosquitoes to reduce their damage to human health, economies, and enjoyment. Mosquito control is a vital public-health practice throughout the world and especially in the tropics because mosquitoes spread many diseases, such as malaria and the Zika virus. - Plasmodium , commonly known as the malaria parasite , is a large genus of parasitic protozoa . As with some other genera of clinically important microorganisms , the genus name also yields a common noun ; thus species of the genus are known as plasmodia . Infection with plasmodia is known as malaria , a deadly disease widespread in the tropics . The parasite always has two hosts in its life cycle : a Dipteran insect host and a vertebrate host . Sexual reproduction always occurs in the insect definitive host ( also known as the disease vector ) . The life - cycle is complex , involving a sequence of different stages both in the vector and the vertebrate host . These stages include sporozoites , which are injected by the insect vector into the vertebrate host 's blood ; latent hypnozoites , which may rest undetected in the liver for up to 30 years ; merosomes and merozoites , which infect the red cells ( erythrocytes ) of the blood ; trophozoites , which grow in the red cells , and schizonts , which divide in red blood cells . Schizonts produce merozoites , which leave to infect more red cells . The sexual forms , gametocytes , are taken up by other insect hosts during feeding . Gametocytes develop into gametes in the insect midgut , and then fertilize each other to form motile zygotes , which escape the gut . Zygotes grow into new sporozoites , which move to the insect 's salivary glands . Sporozoites are injected into vertebrate hosts during insect feeding , thus completing the cycle of infection . The genus Plasmodium was first described in 1885 . It now contains about 200 species divided into several subgenera ; as of 2006 the taxonomy was shifting , and species from other genera are likely to be added to Plasmodium . At least ten species infect humans ; other species infect other animals , including birds , reptiles and rodents , while 29 species infect non-human primates . The parasite is thought to have originated from Dinoflagellates , photosynthetic protozoa . The most common forms of human malaria are... - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Artemisinin, also known as qinghao su, and its semi-synthetic derivatives are a group of drugs that possess the most rapid action of all current drugs against \\"Plasmodium falciparum\\" malaria. It was discovered by Tu Youyou, a Chinese scientist, who was awarded half of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Medicine for her discovery. Treatments containing an artemisinin derivative (artemisinin-combination therapies, ACTs) are now standard treatment worldwide for \\"P. falciparum\\" malaria. Artemisinin is isolated from the plant \\"Artemisia annua\\", sweet wormwood, an herb employed in Chinese traditional medicine. A precursor compound can be produced using genetically engineered yeast. - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - Anopheles (Greek anofelís: \\"useless\\") is a genus of mosquito first described and named by J. W. Meigen in 1818. About 460 species are recognised; while over 100 can transmit human malaria, only 3040 commonly transmit parasites of the genus \\"Plasmodium\\", which cause malaria in humans in endemic areas. \\"Anopheles gambiae\\" is one of the best known, because of its predominant role in the transmission of the most dangerous malaria parasite species (to humans) \\"Plasmodium falciparum\\". - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - The liver is a vital organ of vertebrates and some other animals. In the human, it is located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, below the diaphragm. The liver has a wide range of functions, including detoxification of various metabolites, protein synthesis, and the production of biochemicals necessary for digestion. - An infant (from the Latin word \\"infans\\", meaning \\"unable to speak\\" or \\"speechless\\") is the more formal or specialised synonym for \\"baby\\", the very young offspring of a human or other animal. - Saliva is a watery substance formed in the mouths of animals, secreted by the salivary glands. Human saliva comprises 99.5% mostly water, plus electrolytes, mucus, white blood cells, epithelial cells (which can be used to extract DNA), glycoproteins, enzymes (such as amylase and lipase), antimicrobial agents such as secretory IgA and lysozyme. The enzymes found in saliva are essential in beginning the process of digestion of dietary starches and fats. These enzymes also play a role in breaking down food particles entrapped within dental crevices, thus protecting teeth from bacterial decay. Furthermore, saliva serves a lubricative function, wetting food and permitting the initiation of swallowing, and protecting the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity from desiccation. What entity does 'plasmodium' has the relation 'found in taxon' with? Answer:","output":"Plasmodium has the relation 'found in taxon' with the genus Anopheles, specifically with the female Anopheles mosquito. Anopheles mosquitoes are the primary vectors for the transmission of Plasmodium parasites, which cause malaria in humans and other animals. The mosquito bite introduces the Plasmodium parasites from the mosquito's saliva into a person's blood, initiating the infection process."},{"instruction":"Can I give you the children for the weekend?

He has been heading for Australia with only birds, fish, and sharks ever since. Crossing the Pacific is only part of his journey. Eruc has decided to go all the way around the world using his own energy. He will row, bike, walk and climb the world without help from any motors at all. His plan includes climbing the tallest peak on six of the continents along the way. For the first part of his trip, he bicycled 5,546 miles from Seattle, Washington to Mount McKinley in Alaska and back, walked 67 miles to base camp and climbed 20,320 feet to McKinley's peak. Now in the second part of his adventure , he is rowing to Australia. Why would he try to go around the world this way? He explains that he wants to encourage kids to dream their dreams and get to their own goals. He wants to show kids that there might be hard parts along the way, and sometimes they might not even get to that final goal. But they can have adventures and learn a lot along the way. When his trip around the world takes him across land, he enjoys meeting people---especially children. He has already visited many schools and shared his story. Eruc encourages all kids to set their eyes on a goal and not give up. He says, \\"with goals, we will make progress, and we will be farther along than when we started, even if we don't get to some goals.

Options: - domestic - local person - indigenous - normal - native Let's give stream of consciousness first:","output":"Based on the given context, it seems that the correct answer would be \\"native.\\" Since he no longer carries a foreign accent and people just assume he belongs to the place, it suggests that he is perceived to be a native of the area. Here's the step-by-step justification for the answer: - Domestic implies more of a concept related to homes or being inside a country, but it does not necessarily indicate a person's origin or roots. - Local person could also be a valid option, but it typically refers to someone who is simply residing or working in a particular area at the time, regardless of their place of origin. - Indigenous people are the original inhabitants of a specific area or territory, and it is not mentioned in the context that the person belongs to a particular indigenous group. - Normal implies a subjective idea about a person fitting a general criterion or standard, but it does not reflect a person's geographical origin or background. Therefore, the most appropriate answer in this context would be \\"native,\\" as it reflects that the person is perceived to be originally from the area in question."},{"instruction":"Here are some keywords about a restaurant: name = Aromi, eatType = coffee shop, food = Indian, customer rating = low, area = riverside, familyFriendly = yes.

Given the context: How would you describe Sydney? Possible answers: someone who stays home, someone who loves playing games, happy to take a break Answer:","output":"Sydney can be described as a hardworking and dedicated individual who values the importance of balance in her life. As someone who had a long day at work and also manages her responsibilities towards her two children, Sydney demonstrates the qualities of resilience and adaptability. She understands that maintaining a healthy work-life balance is crucial in order to ensure her well-being and address the needs of her family. Sydney's love for playing games indicates that she appreciates the role of leisure and relaxation in her life. Engaging in recreational activities allows her to decompress and rejuvenate from the stresses of her everyday routine. Playing games not only offers her an enjoyable pastime, but can also create opportunities for bonding and interaction with her children, fostering stronger relationships within her family. Thus, we can describe Sydney as someone who loves playing games, not just for her personal pleasure but also to facilitate a more connected and harmonious family life. In addition to her fondness for games, Sydney is also characterized by her ability to recognize when she needs a break from her responsibilities. The fact that she allowed herself the time to unwind after a hard day at work demonstrates her awareness of her own needs and limitations. In doing so, she cultivates a sense of self-care and self-compassion, which is essential for her psychological and emotional well-being. Her appreciation for breaks shows that she is happy to take a pause when necessary, acknowledging that periodic rest and relaxation are vital components of a balanced and healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, Sydney can be described as a hardworking, family-oriented individual who loves playing games and enjoys taking breaks when needed.

And I was wondering What will happen to Sydney? The answer is:","output":"As an AI language model, I cannot provide real-life information about specific individuals. However, I can provide some general insights regarding the potential consequences Sydney might face if she discovered her son Austin smoking pot, despite her instructions not to. As a parent, Sydney may experience a range of emotions and reactions upon discovering her son using marijuana. Here are some potential outcomes she may experience: 1. Emotional distress: Sydney may feel disappointed, frustrated, or concerned about her son's well-being, particularly if she considers marijuana use a risk to his health, social life, or future prospects. She could experience increased worry or anxiety about his choices. 2. Conversations and discipline: Sydney may need to have a serious conversation with Austin about drug use and the importance of following her rules. This could lead to establishing consequences for breaking house rules or discussing potential risks associated with marijuana use. 3. Evaluating her parenting approach: Sydney might decide to reevaluate her parenting strategies, as she may feel that her current approach is not effectively communicating her expectations or values. This might include seeking expert advice or speaking with other parents about their experiences. 4. Seeking external help: If Sydney believes that Austin's marijuana use is indicative of deeper issues, she might consider seeking assistance from a therapist, support group, or substance abuse counselor to help address the situation. Ultimately, the outcome for Sydney will largely depend on her beliefs, values, communication skills, and support network. Keep in mind, though, that this answer only provides general information and should not be considered a definitive response to a specific situation involving real-life individuals."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Dear Micheal, How's your vacation?

My uncle took me to the tomato festival in Bunol, which is just 30 miles away from where my uncle lives. You have probably never heard of this festival before. Neither had I. The tomato festival is called \\"La Tomatina\\"in Spanish. It was the biggest and messiest tomato fight in the world. When we first got to the square where the festival took place, it was very crowded with people from all around the world, and many trucks were carrying tomatoes. My uncle told me the crowded people here were around 38,000 and this was more than four times the population of Bunol. The tomato fight started as soon as the first banger was beaten. Then everyone including me started throwing tomatoes at each other. I took red tomatoes and threw them at anyone that ran, moved, bent down, or turned around. Tomatoes must be squashed before people threw them in order not to hurt anybody. After a little while, the streets, people and nearby buildings were splashed with red. There was no winner in this fight,but we all had fun. As soon as a second banger was beaten, people stopped throwing. I really had a great time, I wish you were here, too.

Directed by the up-and-coming filmmaker, Jane Richardson, the movie runs for a total of 25 minutes and boasts of a compact yet powerful cast. Focusing on the subtle complexities of personal relationships, Unspoken Divide aptly addresses racial tension through an engaging blend of evocative storytelling, strong dialogues, and breathtaking cinematography. The movie is set in a small, tightly-knit suburban neighborhood, where characters from diverse ethnic backgrounds struggle to maintain harmony and a semblance of unity, despite their differences. A sense of discomfort is established from the very beginning, as vivid close-ups of micro-aggressions, misunderstood actions, and concealed prejudices permeate through the captivating visuals. The director demonstrates her skill at imparting emotional depth to individual characters without resorting to stereotypes or caricatures, thus establishing a profound empathy for their respective plights. Central to the narrative are two families - one African-American and the other Caucasian - who embark upon a journey of self-discovery and introspection in their quest to accept and appreciate each other's unique backgrounds. At the heart of this profound tale lie the children of these two families, whose innocent friendships serve as a beacon of hope and a symbol of unity. The cinematography in Unspoken Divide is nothing short of breathtaking, with stunning visuals that underscore the deeply emotional and thought-provoking themes explored in the movie. The choice of color palette is particularly noteworthy, as it effectively evokes a sense of calm amidst the chaos of conflicting emotions. Moreover, the cast in Unspoken Divide provides an exceptional performance, breathing life into each character while maintaining a realistic edge. The actors masterfully convey a range of emotions – fear, insecurity, anger, and ultimately, love – that the audience can resonate with. Far from being preachy, Unspoken Divide examines the complex dynamics of racial tension from a refreshingly unique perspective, prompting viewers to question their own prejudices and beliefs. The movie serves as a stark reminder that sometimes, the hardest battles are fought not in overt acts of aggression, but in the silent, unspoken divides that permeate through our daily lives. In conclusion, the critic views Unspoken Divide in a highly positive light, lauding the movie as an insightful and moving portrayal of racial tension in modern society. The director's expertise in capturing the subtle nuances of human emotions coupled with powerful performances by the cast and the breathtaking cinematography make Unspoken Divide a must-watch for anyone seeking to better understand and appreciate the diverse world we inhabit."},{"instruction":"Q: who wrote the book upon which the last picture show was based? A:","output":"A: The book upon which the film \\"The Last Picture Show\\" was based was written by Larry McMurtry. Larry McMurtry was an American novelist, essayist, bookseller, and screenwriter known for his works portraying the essence of life in rural America, particularly the Old West and contemporary Texas. He was born on June 3, 1936, in Archer City, Texas, and passed away on March 25, 2021. \\"The Last Picture Show,\\" published in 1966, was McMurtry's third novel and marked his rise to literary prominence. The novel is set in a small, fictional North Texas town called Thalia and explores the lives and relationships of its young residents against the backdrop of the declining rural town, where the local movie theater represents one of the last vestiges of communal entertainment. The story captures themes of love, loss, loneliness, and the transition from adolescence to adulthood. The film adaptation of \\"The Last Picture Show,\\" directed by Peter Bogdanovich, was released in 1971. McMurtry co-wrote the screenplay for the film with Bogdanovich, and the movie went on to achieve both critical and commercial success. Starring Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, and Cybill Shepherd, the movie received eight Academy Award nominations, winning two of them: Best Supporting Actor for Ben Johnson and Best Supporting Actress for Cloris Leachman. Following the success of \\"The Last Picture Show,\\" McMurtry published several other novels, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning \\"Lonesome Dove\\" (1985), which was adapted into a successful television miniseries. His works often captured the American West's gritty reality and complex characters, making him one of the most prominent and influential authors in contemporary American literature."},{"instruction":"In order to convince your parents to let you have a dog, you need to be persuasive. You will be in a better position to convince them if you are well informed. Begin to research your presentation by looking into different dog breeds. When you talk to your parents, you will want to be as specific as possible. You will sound more convincing if you are able to make definitive statements such as, \\"Mom, Dad, the Jack Russell Terrier is the right dog for us.\\" Start by looking at different dog breeds online. You can even take a quiz about what type of dog is right for you. Use some websites such as the American Kennel Club site to figure out what type of dog you should ask for. For example, if your sister might be allergic, look into a Yorkshire Terrier. If your mom is worried that a dog will be messy, you can look for a dog that doesn't shed heavily. Research dachshunds, which are a small, neat dog. Go to your local or school library. Ask the reference librarian to help you find some books that offer information about different breeds of small dogs. Adopting a dog is a great way to add a pet to your family. With adoption, you can rescue an animal who needs a home. You can also save money, as you won't have to pay an expensive breeder. Once you have an idea about some of the breeds you are interested in, contact your local animal shelter. The staff and volunteers there will be able to provide you with some helpful information. State that you are looking for a small dog and offer any other specific requirements that you have. For example, tell the staff whether you are looking for a puppy or an older dog. Ask if they regularly have a wide selection of dogs that might fit your needs. For example, you can say, \\"Will it be fairly easy to adopt a small dog such as a dachshund or terrier?\\" Collect other information. Find out what information you and your parents will need to provide in order to adopt a dog. You can also ask how long the process takes. The best way to convince your parents to let you have a dog is to prepare a thoroughly researched presentation. You will definitely want to include the financial aspects of dog ownership in your request. Do some research about how much it costs to adopt and raise a dog. Talk to the experts. You can ask the staff at the shelter how much the adoption fees are and if you will need to pay for vaccinations. Contact a local vet. You can phone the office and ask for general pricing information. Ask how much it will cost to spay or neuter a dog, and how much regular office check-ups cost. Visit a local pet store. You can price food, toys, and grooming products. Combine all of your information to figure out the monthly cost of dog ownership. If you plan to pay for part of the dog's care, make that part of your presentation, too. Your parents will want to make sure that you understand how much time it takes to care for a dog. For the next part of your presentation preparation, figure out how you will fit dog care into your family's routine. This will help show your parents that you have put a lot of thought into caring for the dog. Think about how much time it will take to exercise your dog each day. Do you have a yard where he can play independently? Or will you need to make sure to walk him? If you are asking for a puppy, think about how long it will take to train the dog. Are you planning to spend some time each day helping to house train the dog? Make a calendar that shows the breakdown of how much time you will spend caring for the dog. If you are asking other family members to help, make sure to make that clear. Summary:","output":"In order to convince your parents to let you have a dog, start by researching different dog breeds to find one that suits your family's needs and preferences. Use resources like the American Kennel Club website and your local library to gather information. Consider factors like allergies and preferences for dog size and temperament. Contact your local animal shelter to learn about the adoption process, fees, and available dogs. Gather information on the financial aspects of dog ownership, such as vet costs, spaying or neutering, vaccines, food, toys, and grooming products. Calculate the monthly cost of caring for a dog and, if possible, commit to contributing to these expenses. Create a detailed plan for integrating the dog into your family's routine, considering factors like exercise, training, and care responsibilities. Develop a calendar that outlines the time you and your family members will spend caring for the dog. By presenting well-researched, organized information and demonstrating your commitment to responsible pet ownership, you'll be better equipped to persuade your parents to let you have a dog."},{"instruction":"Write an email with the following subject: Historical Correlation Calculator","output":"Subject: Introducing Our New Historical Correlation Calculator - A Powerful Tool for Analyzing Market Connections Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you well.

Here is another sentence: Amanda carried the package from home to New York. Q: Does the term carry mean the same thing in both these sentences? Choices: (1). different meanings; (2). the same meaning;","output":"The term \\"carry\\" in both sentences has the same fundamental meaning, which is to support and move an object, but there are slight contextual differences in the two situations. In the first sentence, \\"You must carry your camping gear,\\" the term \\"carry\\" refers to the action of physically supporting and moving your camping gear, most likely on your back or in your arms, from one location to another. This context typically suggests that the person carrying the gear is accountable for their belongings while traveling or navigating through a camping environment. In the second sentence, \\"Amanda carried the package from home to New York,\\" the term \\"carry\\" also refers to the act of supporting and moving an object from one place to another. However, in this case, the context suggests a longer distance and the potential involvement of different modes of transportation, such as vehicles, trains, or airplanes.

One such task that incorporates these elements is called the \\"Tower of Hanoi.\\" The Tower of Hanoi is a classic puzzle that was invented by the French mathematician Edouard Lucas in 1883. The puzzle consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, making a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules: 1. Only one disk can be moved at a time. 2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod. 3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. The Tower of Hanoi puzzle requires a good understanding of spatial relationships, as the person attempting to solve it must visualize the disks' positions on the rods and plan accordingly. Additionally, it requires a mechanical understanding, as one must engage with the physical system of the disks and rods to accomplish the goal. Force and motion come into play when considering the manual dexterity needed to grasp, lift, and accurately position the disks. Problem-solving is central to this task, as the person must strategize and develop a systematic approach to successfully moving the stack without violating the rules. The Tower of Hanoi puzzle becomes more challenging as the number of disks increases, as the minimum number of moves required to solve the puzzle is 2^n - 1, where n is the number of disks. In conclusion, the Tower of Hanoi is an excellent task to test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning, as it requires spatial awareness, mechanical understanding, force and motion, and strong problem-solving capabilities. There are plenty of other tasks that can test an individual's physical reasoning skills, such as assembling furniture, navigating through a maze, or even playing certain sports. However, the Tower of Hanoi stands out due to its specific focus on all the essential components required for developing and testing physical reasoning abilities."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Question: \\"what destroyed the Palace of Westminster?\\" Context: \\"Remodelling of the structure began in 1762. After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. At one stage, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament, after the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834.\\" Answer: The answer is:","output":"The Palace of Westminster was destroyed by fire in 1834."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

The story must include the five ordered key facts while expanding upon them to create a broader and coherent narrative. Guidelines: 1. Include all five key facts in the story. 2. Follow the order of appearance for the key facts. 3. Expand the narrative while maintaining coherence. Solution: Emma had always been close with her mother, but as she got older, their relationship turned sour. Her mother, Aurora, had become more controlling and possessive over the years, often meddling in Emma's personal life. Desperate to escape this suffocating relationship, Emma decided to marry Anxious, someone she barely knew. She thought that by marrying him, she could finally establish some boundaries and independence. Fact1: Emma marries Anxious to escape her mother. Despite Emma's seemingly impulsive marriage to Anxious, they managed to form a strong connection over time. They couldn't always be together, as Emma wanted to stay in close proximity to her children from her previous marriage. Consequently, their primary means of staying in touch was through telephone calls and texts. Fact2: The tie between Emma and Anxious keeps them in touch by telephone. Back at home, Aurora was left struggling with loneliness after Emma had moved out. No longer able to interfere in her daughter's life, Aurora sought a new distraction. As fate would have it, a whirlwind romance blossomed between her and her next-door neighbor, a charming widower named Garrett. Fact3: Lonely Aurora begins a whirlwind romance with her next-door neighbor. Sadly, Emma's temporary respite from her mother's watchful eye came to a screeching halt when she was diagnosed with a severe illness. Her condition required extensive treatment and hospitalization, which proved to be physically and emotionally draining for her. Aurora, despite her past behavior, stayed by Emma's side throughout her treatment, offering her support. Realizing the strain this situation placed on their new romance and Emma's need for her mother's support during this vulnerable time, Aurora and Garrett decided to put an end to their relationship. Fact4: Aurora stays by Emma's side through treatment and hospitalization and ends her relationship with Garrett. With Aurora often at the hospital supporting Emma, Garrett felt the urge to do something helpful. He began spending time with Emma's young children, who were struggling to cope with their mother's illness. Garrett's gentle and caring nature struck a chord with them, and they quickly developed a strong bond. As he grew closer to the children, Garrett couldn't help but feel a sense of love and responsibility for their well-being. Fact5: Garrett begins to bond with Emma's young children. As time went on, Emma's condition improved, and she was eventually released from the hospital. Throughout this trying period, her relationship with her mother had dramatically changed, fostered by Aurora's unwavering support. With her newfound appreciation for family, Emma decided to take her husband Anxious and her children on a long-overdue family vacation, seeking to create new memories for them all. Meanwhile, Aurora and Garrett, realizing that their love had never truly faded, decided to rekindle their romance, now grounded in a mature and deep understanding of what truly matters in life: the love and support of family. In weaving together the lives and tribulations of its characters, the story above follows the five key facts in their given order, while expanding upon them to create a broader, coherent, and engaging narrative."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - Landscape is a one - act play by Harold Pinter that was first broadcast on radio in 1968 and first performed on stage in 1969 .

This is illustrated through the two characters who appear to be talking to one another though neither seems to hear the other . The dialogue resembles two independent monologues . The play is often studied , read , and performed alongside Silence , another one - act play published soon after Landscape . Both plays mark a change in Pinter 's style , with echoes of the work of Samuel Beckett . In both plays nothing happens , the action of the plays is brought to a halt putting an added emphasis on the role of the dialogues and monologues that take place . As one critic put it \`\` nothing happens but much is explored '' . - Satyr plays were an ancient Greek form of tragicomedy, similar in spirit to the bawdy satire of burlesque. They featured choruses of satyrs, were based on Greek mythology, and were rife with mock drunkenness, brazen sexuality (including phallic props), pranks, sight gags, and general merriment. - A one-act play is a play that has only one act, as distinct from plays that occur over several acts. One-act plays may consist of one or more scenes. In recent years, the 10-minute play has emerged as a popular subgenre of the one-act play, especially in writing competitions. The origin of the one-act play may be traced to the very beginning of drama: in ancient Greece, \\"Cyclops\\", a satyr play by Euripides, is an early example. - Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\"). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory. - Samuel Barclay Beckett (13 April 1906 22 December 1989) was an Irish avant-garde novelist, playwright, theatre director, and poet, who lived in Paris for most of his adult life and wrote in both English and French.

His screenplay adaptations of others' works include \\"The Servant\\" (1963), \\"The Go-Between\\" (1971), \\"The French Lieutenant's Woman\\" (1981), \\"The Trial\\" (1993), and \\"Sleuth\\" (2007). He also directed or acted in radio, stage, television, and film productions of his own and others' works. - The Nobel Prize (; Swedish definite form, singular: \\"Nobelpriset\\") is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, and/or scientific advances. - The avant-garde (from French, \\"advance guard\\" or \\"vanguard\\", literally \\"fore-guard\\") are people or works that are experimental, radical, or unorthodox, with respect to art, culture, and society. It may be characterized by nontraditional, aesthetic innovation and initial unacceptability, and it may offer a critique of the relationship between producer and consumer. - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France. It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits. The city is both a commune and department, and forms the centre and headquarters of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an area of and a population in 2014 of 12,005,077, comprising 18.2 percent of the population of France.

Harold Pinter, the playwright of \\"Landscape,\\" was an English writer whose works were predominantly written in English. \\"Landscape\\" is a one-act play that exemplifies Pinter's exceptional command of the English language and showcases the difficulty of communication between two people within a marriage, where their dialogues appear to be more like independent monologues."},{"instruction":"Jerrica saw the guard as she snuck past. Who is she referring to?","output":"In this sentence, Jerrica is referring to a particular guard whom she encounters while attempting to sneak past. The guard is usually a person assigned to oversee the security or protection of a specific place, event, person or item. They are responsible for ensuring the safety and orderliness of the area under their watch and taking necessary measures to prevent unauthorized access or security threats. Here, Jerrica is either trying to covertly enter or bypass a secured area without being noticed by the guard.

Choices: - eukaryotes - protists - scavangers - prokaryotes A: A:","output":"Prokaryotes help convert some molecules to forms that can be taken up by other organisms. Step 1: Identify the role of each choice in the ecosystem. - Eukaryotes: Organisms with complex cells, including plants, animals, and fungi. - Protists: Single-celled eukaryotes, such as algae and protozoa. - Scavengers: Organisms that feed on dead plants and animals. - Prokaryotes: Single-celled organisms without a nucleus, such as bacteria and archaea. Step 2: Consider the processes that involve molecular conversion. - Prokaryotes, especially bacteria, are well-known for their role in decomposing dead organic matter and recycling nutrients in the ecosystem. They break down complex organic molecules into simpler forms, making them available for uptake by other organisms. Step 3: Evaluate which choice is most directly involved in molecular conversion. - Eukaryotes and protists can play roles in nutrient cycling, but they do not primarily convert molecules for uptake by other organisms. - Scavengers contribute to the decomposition process, but they mainly consume larger pieces of dead organisms rather than converting molecules for uptake by others. - Prokaryotes, specifically bacteria, are the primary transformers of molecules in the ecosystem, participating in processes like nitrogen fixation, carbon cycling, and decomposition. Conclusion: Prokaryotes are the most significant factor in converting molecules to forms that can be taken up by other organisms."},{"instruction":"Mi cambio de mascotas » How do you say this sentence in English?","output":"To translate the given sentence from Spanish to English, I will follow a step-by-step approach: 1.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"The presence of a smaller bird in the scenario seems unrelated to the functioning of the thermostat and heating system but, for the sake of argument, we will consider any potential impact on the system. Suppose the smaller bird affects the room temperature in some way. Its body heat may contribute slightly to the temperature of the room. The effect of the bird's presence on the overall room temperature will vary depending on the size of the room, insulation, and other factors, but it is generally negligible. If the slightly increased temperature (due to the bird's body heat) is enough to be detected by the thermostat, it may indeed cause the thermostat to signal the heating system less often than it would otherwise. However, we should note that this effect would be minimal. As for the second effect mentioned - oil becoming a fine mist mixed with air and ignited in the combustion chamber - the presence or size of a bird in the room would not have any direct influence on this process. This stage of the heating system sequence is independent of the external environment and relies on the functionality of the mechanical components such as the oil burner, pump, and combustion chamber. The perturbation of the bird's presence would have no effect on this phase of the heating system. In conclusion, the presence of a smaller bird might have a minimal influence on how often the thermostat signals the heating system but would have no effect on the process of the oil becoming a fine mist mixed with air and being ignited in the combustion chamber."},{"instruction":"Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

I had no clue who she was, but I thought she was a year younger than me. That’s why I thought it was weird that she said my name. But the “nice sweatshirt” bit was what really got me. I wasn’t even wearing my sweatshirt. So. There was a substitute teacher in my literacy class, so my class was split. half of us did actual work, and the other half watched a documentary. Ben, Evan, Isabelle and myself were put together in the class watching the super boring documentary. We got bored, so, when Ben left the classroom for a bit and left his jacket behind, I don’t remember why, but, I put on his sweatshirt and traded it for mine. This turned into everyone swapping sweatshirts for the next hour until school was out. At one point I was called to the office to deliver a message to a different classroom. I walked out of the office with the information, and turned around at the sound of my name. “Hey, Natalie! Nice sweatshirt!” I smiled and thanked her like the nice human being I want people to think I am. Once she started down the stairs I looked down at my sweatshirt. Black and orange? Nike? But my sweatshirt’s gray and purple! Then I remembered our little game of “try not to get caught swapping sweatshirts and giggling”. I wasn’t wearing my sweatshirt. Someone else had it.

You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. and the situation: David is trying to understand temperature and the science behind it. He took two objects, object A and object B, to his physics professor. Object A had higher temperature, but object B had lower temperature. His physics professor explained him why one object's temperature was higher while other object's temperature was lower. Answer the following question: Would particles move slower or faster in object A than in object B? Answer:","output":"The particles would move faster in object A than in object B. The justification for this answer comes directly from the background given. According to the physics definition of temperature, temperature is related to the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. Kinetic energy relates to the motion of the particles. Higher kinetic energy implies more motion, or faster moving particles. Given that object A has a higher temperature than object B, this means that on average, the particles in object A have more kinetic energy than those in object B. More kinetic energy translates to faster movement. Hence, the particles are moving faster in object A than in object B. This increased movement is what makes object A feel warmer to the touch, as stated in the background."},{"instruction":"Is this product review positive?

To find the lead out groove on a vinyl record, follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the vinyl record First, ensure that you have a vinyl record, typically a black or colored circular disc with grooves on both sides. Step 2: Recognize the grooves Look closely at the vinyl record. You'll notice concentric circles or grooves on the surface. These grooves represent the recorded audio on the record. Step 3: Locate the lead out groove As the record plays, the stylus (needle) moves from the outer edge of the record toward the center. The lead out groove is a continuous groove located at the end of the playable audio section, near the center. It is this groove that prevents the stylus from moving further inward and potentially causing damage to the record center label and the stylus itself. Now, let's review the sentence you provided: \\"Precisely because of this mechanism, most automatic turntables are incapable of playing any audio in the lock groove, since they will lift the arm before it reaches that groove.\\" This sentence is relevant to the topic of lead out groove on vinyl records, but it specifically addresses the ability of automatic turntables and their interaction with the lock groove (another term for the lead out groove). The sentence explains that most automatic turntables are incapable of playing any audio in the lock groove because they are designed to lift the arm before it reaches that point. This prevents potential damage to the record and the stylus. In conclusion, while the provided sentence is informative about the lock groove and automatic turntables' mechanism, it doesn't directly describe how to find the lead out groove on a vinyl record.

The passenger pursues the dog, firing a rifle, until he is shot dead by Garry, the station commander. The Americans send a helicopter pilot, MacReady, and Dr. Copper to the Norwegian camp for answers, but they find only a charred ruin.

French prosecutors last month tracked down the IP address of the computer used in the theft of the medical records to Zurich-based Rega, which is the main operator of air ambulances in Switzerland. The company denied any wrongdoing, and had, along with Schumacher's family, pressed charges against \\"unknown persons\\" for violating professional secrecy. The records were stolen and offered for sale to a number of journalists for 50,000 euros (A73,600). The Zurich prosecution said on Wednesday that the man found hanged in his cell was believed to have acted alone in the case, but stressed he should be presumed innocent until proven guilty. Schumacher spent more than five months in hospital in the French city of Grenoble after sustaining serious head injuries in a skiing accident at Meribel on December 29. The former champion driver, long a resident of Switzerland, was brought by ambulance on June 16 from Grenoble to a cutting-edge clinic in the Swiss city of Lausanne. The transfer was conducted with utmost secrecy. * Readers seeking support and information about suicide prevention can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14. Do you have any news photos or videos?

The man was an employee of Swiss helicopter air rescue company Rega, which was responsible for arranging Schumacher's transport from a French hospital to Switzerland in June. The suspect had denied any wrongdoing during his arrest and interrogation. He was discovered hanged in his cell when officers went to serve him breakfast before a scheduled hearing with a judge. At this stage, no other individuals are believed to have been involved in his death. The initial investigation into the theft of Schumacher's medical records traced the IP address used in the crime back to Rega. The company, however, denied any wrongdoing and, along with Schumacher's family, filed charges against unknown persons for violating professional secrecy. The stolen medical records were offered for sale to various journalists for a sum of €50,000 (A73,600). While the man found dead in his cell is believed to have been the lone actor in this case, he should still be presumed innocent until proven guilty. In December 2013, Schumacher suffered serious head injuries during a skiing accident and spent five months in a hospital in Grenoble, France.

Here is a step-by-step process along with justifications: 1. Identify the components: Understand the parts included in the furniture kit, such as wooden planks, screws, brackets, and the instruction manual. This is important because each element has a specific role in the assembly process. 2. Read and comprehend the instruction manual: Follow the step-by-step guide provided in the manual to assemble the furniture correctly. This is crucial because it outlines the manufacturer's recommended method for putting the pieces together safely and securely. 3. Sort the parts: Separate the different components based on their type and function (e.g., screws, brackets, wooden planks) and organize them for easy access. This makes the assembly process more efficient and prevents confusion during the build. 4. Assemble the pieces: Using the correct tools (such as a screwdriver or hammer), start connecting the parts together according to the instructions. It is essential to use the appropriate method and join the pieces in the correct order for structural integrity and stability. 5. Check and adjust: Once the assembly is complete, examine the finished product for any loose connections or misaligned parts. Tighten or adjust as necessary to ensure the bookshelf is stable and free from potential hazards. This step is necessary to guarantee a secure and functional piece of furniture. 6. Position the furniture: Place the bookshelf in the desired location, making sure it is level and secure. Positioning the furniture correctly prevents accidents and ensures ease of use. This task requires knowledge of physical objects such as the materials (wood, screws, brackets), tools (screwdriver, hammer), and understanding the physical properties and functions of each component to assemble a functional and stable piece of furniture."},{"instruction":"Q:I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The astrophysicist Nidhal Guessoum while being highly critical of pseudo-scientific claims made about the Quran, has highlighted the encouragement for sciences that the Quran provides by developing \\"the concept of knowledge.\\". He writes: \\"The Qur'an draws attention to the danger of conjecturing without evidence (And follow not that of which you have not the (certain) knowledge of... 17:36) and in several different verses asks Muslims to require proofs (Say: Bring your proof if you are truthful 2:111), both in matters of theological belief and in natural science.\\" Guessoum cites Ghaleb Hasan on the definition of \\"proof\\" according the Quran being \\"clear and strong... convincing evidence or argument.\\" Also, such a proof cannot rely on an argument from authority, citing verse 5:104. Lastly, both assertions and rejections require a proof, according to verse 4:174. Ismail al-Faruqi and Taha Jabir Alalwani are of the view that any reawakening of the Muslim civilization must start with the Quran; however, the biggest obstacle on this route is the \\"centuries old heritage of tafseer (exegesis) and other classical disciplines\\" which inhibit a \\"universal, epidemiological and systematic conception\\" of the Quran's message.

This question requires students to engage deeply with the passage and understand the various perspectives presented by the mentioned scholars. Specifically, students will need to: 1. Identify the significance of knowledge and evidence in the Quran as depicted by Nidhal Guessoum. It is crucial for them to recognize the Quran's disapproval of conjecturing without evidence (17:36) and its demand for proofs in theological belief and natural science (2:111). 2.

In Sentence 1, it is stated that \\"The unpredictable consonant of every word was then dropped, the distribution of first leaving.\\" In this sentence, the emphasis is on dropping the unpredictable consonant from every word. As such, the focus here is on the unpredictability of the consonant being removed from the words. Additionally, this sentence implies that there is a distribution of firsts that are left after the unpredictable consonants are dropped. It is not clear what \\"first\\" refers to in this context, so the meaning of this phrase is quite vague. In Sentence 2, the statement is \\"The first consonant of each word was then dropped, leaving the distribution of unpredictable.\\" Here, the primary detail is that the first consonant of each word is removed. Unlike in Sentence 1, this sentence explicitly states that the first consonant is dropped and reveals what remains as \\"the distribution of unpredictable.\\" While still somewhat ambiguous, it seems that the focus here is on the unpredictable nature of the remaining distribution after dropping the first consonant, possibly referring to the unpredictable nature of the words or elements left in the text. In summary, these two sentences do not convey the same information. Sentence 1 focuses on dropping the unpredictable consonant of every word and has a vague reference to a distribution of firsts.

Let's break down the sentence to help understand the translation: 1. \\"I told you\\" - \\"Řekl jsem ti\\". In Czech, \\"řekl\\" implies you have said or told something, while \\"jsem\\" is used to denote \\"I.\\" Combined with \\"ti,\\" meaning \\"you\\" (directed towards the person you are speaking with), this phrase is complete. 2. \\"they're gone\\" - \\"už odešli\\". In this part of the sentence, \\"už\\" can be translated as \\"already\\" or \\"now,\\" and \\"odešli\\" is the past form of \\"odejít,\\" which means \\"to leave\\" or \\"to go away\\" in Czech. \\"Odešli\\" is in plural form, indicating \\"they\\" (more than one person) as the subject. So, when you combine the two parts, you get the complete translation: \\"Řekl jsem ti, že už odešli.\\" This translation maintains the intended meaning of \\"I told you, they’re gone\\" as it conveys a sense of past action and affirmation that they are no longer present."},{"instruction":"Question: Who does Davies discover in London ?

US district judge Donovan Frank sided with patients who were civilly committed to the Minnesota Sex Offender Program, and argued that they had little hope for freedom. In more than 20 years of existence, no one has been fully discharged from the program, even those thought to be at low risk of committing new crimes. “The constitution protects individual rights even when they are unpopular,” Frank wrote. Frank deferred immediate action, instead ordering legislators to begin proceedings on a remedy by August or he could impose his own. He said the state’s two facilities in Moose Lake and St Peter “will not be immediately closed”. The judge said the remedy must include at least a dozen requirements, including the creation of alternate less restrictive facilities. He said he would appoint a special master to ensure compliance. He warned that failure to do so could lead him to order the closing of the St Peter and Moose Lake facilities or extensive release of patients. Minnesota has struggled for years with the rising costs of its policy on sex offenders, spending millions to expand and update the two facilities. But lawmakers, many fearful of appearing soft on crime, have resisted any substantive changes to the program. Just this year, legislators declined a proposal to buy land for and design two facilities aimed at housing sex offenders on course for eventual release. Dan Gustafson, the lead attorney for plaintiffs, said the order highlighted “the complete failure of the political system in Minnesota”. “More importantly, it reaffirms that all people, no matter how disliked they are or how reprehensible their prior conduct, are entitled to constitutional protection,” he said. The class-action lawsuit was filed in 2011 for residents in the state’s two secure treatment facilities. They argued that the law allowing commitments of sex offenders after they have finished their prison time is unconstitutional because hardly anyone ever gets discharged, even if they do well in treatment and are judged unlikely to commit new crimes, and are seen as good candidates for less restrictive facilities than the prison-like settings in St Peter and Moose Lake. The plaintiffs argue that the program keeps them in punitive conditions that don’t emphasize treatment enough. “The key fact that overwhelms all others is that ‘no one ever gets out,’” lawyers for the offenders wrote in their closing brief. Only three people have been given provisional discharges under intense supervision, and one of those returned after violating the conditions of his release and died in the program. In contrast, neighboring Wisconsin’s program has freed 118 offenders since 1994. Several sex offenders testified to their frustration at having no clear path to freedom. Dennis Richard Steiner, a Moose Lake patient who admits molesting 31 boys, said he didn’t think he would ever get out but participated in treatment because he thought it was his only chance. “If I drop out, I’m not going to get out. So I’ve stayed with the program,” he said. Citing other trial testimony, the plaintiffs said the program doesn’t do regular risk assessments to see whether patients are still dangerous, in contrast with other states. They also said the program puts the burden on patients to seek review and release, rather than the state regularly recommending release or reduced restrictions for patients who make progress. The plaintiffs also argued that high staff turnover, chronic understaffing, misapplication of the program’s own scoring criteria and even minor behavioral infractions that have nothing to do with sexual offenses make it hard to progress in treatment. The state argued in its closing brief that the plaintiffs hadn’t proven any constitutional violations, and defended the quality of the program. It also argued that it was up to the legislature, not the court, to rewrite the law. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"A federal judge has ruled that Minnesota's sex offender treatment program is unconstitutional, violating the fundamental rights of over 700 individuals who remain in custody after completing their prison sentences.

Leopold II ascended to the throne in 1865 after the death of his father and predecessor, Leopold I, and ruled as King of the Belgians until his death on December 17, 1909. In addition to his reign over Belgium, Leopold II also exercised control over the Congo Free State, which he ruled as sovereign from July 1, 1885, to November 15, 1908.

Leopold II's rule was succeeded by Albert I, who continued to shape Belgian history in the years that followed. The late king was married to Marie Henriette of Austria, and together, they had four children: Princess Stéphanie, who would become the Crown Princess of Austria; Princess Clémentine, who married Prince Napoléon of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; Prince Leopold, the Duke of Brabant; and Louise, a princess in her own right.

In the premise itself, it is clear that the speaker (the one concerned) is satisfied or agrees with the \\"deal,\\" which could represent a negotiation, agreement, or arrangement struck with another person or party. However, the speaker's opinion or agreement might not be enough to conclude anything about the opinion of the person's boss. To determine if the hypothesis is true or not, more information is required. Here are some possible scenarios that can help illustrate the limitations in reaching a conclusion based on only the given premise: 1. If the speaker is the boss: In this scenario, if the speaker making the statement is actually the boss, then the hypothesis would be true. The deal satisfies the boss, and this would be evident in his statement. 2. If the speaker is not the boss but has the authority to make decisions on behalf of the boss: In this case, if the speaker has the authority to represent the boss and make decisions for them, the hypothesis might be considered true. By agreeing to the deal, the speaker might essentially convey the boss' agreement as well. 3. If the speaker is not the boss and does not have the authority to make decisions: In this situation, the speaker's agreement with the deal does not necessarily imply the boss's agreement. The hypothesis in this case cannot be assumed as true. The boss might have different opinions or criteria to evaluate the deal, and thus, their views might vary. 4. If the speaker is not aware of the boss's opinion: If the speaker has no knowledge regarding the boss's opinion or awareness about the existence of the deal, we cannot conclude anything about the hypothesis. The boss's views might be aligned or contradictory to the speaker's views, and we would need more information to determine the boss's stance on the said deal. In summary, based on the premise provided, we cannot definitively conclude whether the hypothesis \\"It's a deal according to his boss\\" is true or not. Further information about the relationship between the speaker and the boss, the speaker's authority level, or the boss's opinion on the deal, will be required to draw a more coherent conclusion regarding the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Objective: pet mouse Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?

The people of Bali were happy and had a peaceful life. They were not allowed to fight. At one time there had been terrible wars on Bali. Then the people decided it was wrong to fight or have wars. They made rules to keep apart those people who wanted to fight. Bali was divided into seven small kingdoms. The land around each kingdom was kept empty, and no one lived there. Since the kingdoms did not share the same borders , the people could not fight about them. On Bali, even children were not allowed to fight.

To find the value of o, we need to isolate o by dividing both sides of the equation by 3: 15 = 3o Divide both sides by 3: (15) / (3) = (3o) / (3) Simplify: 5 = o So, the value of o is 5."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Oustanding...\\" Answer:","output":"4"},{"instruction":"Ces questions, qui sont actuellement soumises à des règles d'harmonisation minimale, seront intégralement harmonisées par la directive-cadre.

Others on the expedition were Edward Sabine , science officer and Frederick William Beechy .","output":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other. A paraphrase is a restatement or rewording of a sentence, maintaining the original meaning while presenting the information in a different way. Paraphrasing is a useful technique for improving writing, making it more concise, and emphasizing different aspects of the content. In this case, both sentences relay the same information in slightly different ways, yet they convey the same general idea. They both mention that others on the expedition were Frederick William Beechy, who might have a different role in the expedition, and Edward Sabine, who is specified as the science officer. The first sentence states, \\"Others during the expedition were Frederick William Beechy, science officer, and Edward Sabine.\\" The second sentence states, \\"Others on the expedition were Edward Sabine, science officer, and Frederick William Beechy.\\" In both sentences: 1. The phrases \\"during the expedition\\" and \\"on the expedition\\" are interchangeable and refer to the same context, involving individuals who participated in the journey. 2. Both sentences mention two people - Frederick William Beechy and Edward Sabine - emphasizing their roles within the expedition team. 3. The role of the science officer is mentioned, which is Edward Sabine's position on the team. The primary difference between the two sentences is the order of the individuals mentioned. By switching the positions of Frederick William Beechy and Edward Sabine, the second sentence essentially paraphrases the first sentence, but the meaning remains intact. The fact that both people and their roles are mentioned communicates to the reader that they were essential team members involved in the expedition."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a context, a pronoun, and a noun in this task.

At the hearing preceding Norman's release, Lila Loomis (Vera Miles) shows up to protest, producing a petition that she's been circulating with signatures of 743 people who do not want to see Norman return to society. Lila is the sister of Marion Crane, one of Norman's victims (from the first film), and the widow of Sam Loomis, who was Marion's boyfriend at the time of her death. When the judge refuses to acknowledge Lila's petition, she vows to see Norman returned to the institution to pay for his crimes.Dr. Raymond takes Norman back to his old home, the gloomy mansion on the hill behind the Bates Motel.

Answer:","output":"Ealdwulf of Lindsey was a prominent figure in the Catholic Church, serving as the Bishop of Lindsey from 750 to 765. He played a significant role in the religious sphere during his tenure, leading the Diocese of Lindsey and contributing to the spiritual growth and development of the region. Born in an unknown year, Ealdwulf's early life remains somewhat of a mystery. However, his appointment as the bishop came after the departure of his predecessor, Alwig. Ealdwulf's strong commitment to the church and his people saw him serve as bishop for 15 years, during which time he made considerable effort to guide his congregation in their faith. Throughout his term, Ealdwulf worked within the Catholic Church to uphold its teachings and values. He likely participated in various ecclesiastical activities and collaborated with other members of the clergy to address pressing issues and maintain the unity of the church. In 765, Ealdwulf's time as the Bishop of Lindsey came to an end upon his resignation or retirement. He was subsequently succeeded by Ceolwulf, who continued to lead the diocese in its spiritual pursuits. After his departure from the position of bishop, Ealdwulf presumably remained active in the religious community until his death in 796. Though specific details of his life and achievements may be sparse, it is clear that he played a crucial and enduring role in shaping the religious landscape of Lindsey and leaving a lasting mark on the Catholic Church."},{"instruction":"Student: Premise: \\"A boy is walking on a floor covered in graffiti.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The boy is sitting in the grass.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?.

Hotshot ensign Alan Drake, fresh from the flying academy at Pensacola, Florida, gets off to a bad start with the pilots of an elite squadron, nicknamed the \\"Hellcats\\", to which he has been posted in San Diego. Making a nearly disastrous landing attempt in heavy fog against orders and disqualifying the squadron during a competitive shooting exercise by colliding with the target drogue does not endear him to his fellow pilots. He also asks out a woman he has met, Lorna, not knowing that she is the squadron commander Billy Gary's (Walter Pidgeon) wife. However, Drake is earnest and contrite. He mixes with the Hellcats at the Garys' large house, which the sociable couple have opened as an unofficial officers' club. His flying and his social errors are forgiven, and his fellow pilots accept him, nicknaming him \\"Pensacola\\". Drake further proves himself when he helps Lieutenant Jerry Banning solve a problem in a blind-landing apparatus he is developing. Just after Commander Gary is sent out of town on assignment, Banning decides the apparatus is ready to test in fog — but it fails and Banning is killed. Working with Banning's assistant, Drake soon identifies the problem, but no further testing is allowed until Commander Gary's return. Banning had been a childhood friend of Lorna Gary, and is not her first friend to die. She sinks into a deep depression. She also knows that Gary will expect her to hide her feelings and carry on, something that is very much not in her nature. Drake, appreciating the help the Garys gave him when he arrived, visits her at her home, and convinces her she should not suffer alone. They go for walks, drives, and tennis; he amuses her with jokes. Finally, at a restaurant she reaches for his hand and in doing so realizes she is falling for him.

Investors staged a global flight from risk Thursday that sent stocks plummeting and 10-year Treasury yields to 1940s levels renewed fears of a global economic slowdown. Paul Vigna, Dave Callaway and Bob O'Brien discuss on The News Hub. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 391.01 points, or 3.5%, to 10733.83, as investors barreled out of stocks and into \\"safe\\" assets like the U.S. dollar, which surged. The blue-chip measure fell more than 500 points in afternoon action, averting its lowest close in a year with a late-session lift. The action built on the stock market's Wednesday selloff, when the Fed acknowledged \\"significant\\" downside risks to the economy and noted \\"strains\\" in global financial markets, a reference to debt-strapped Europe. A weak reading on manufacturing in China contributed to the slowdown fears. Adding to the grim mood was a lack of appreciable progress in containing Europe's debt crisis, which has weighed on markets for months. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 37.20 points, or 3.2%, to 1129.56, after touching its lowest intraday level since early August. The technology-oriented Nasdaq Composite slumped 82.52 points, or 3.2%, to 2455.67.

All blue-chip stocks finished in the red, as did all S&P 500 sectors. Materials and energy stocks were hit hardest, falling as investors acted on their economic slowdown worries and in reaction to the fast rise of the U.S. dollar. \\"They're selling literally everything,\\" said Alan Valdes, director of floor trading at DME Securities at the New York Stock Exchange. \\"It's the realization that things aren't getting better that has traders concerned.

The Stoxx Europe 600 shed 4.6% to hit the lowest level in more than two years in intraday trading. Asian bourses also dropped sharply, with China's Shanghai Composite losing 2.8% on news that manufacturing activity in China contracted in September. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slid 4.9%. \\"A lot of people who had very significant investment positions based on a scenario of dollar weakness changed those position pretty violently,\\" said Douglas Cliggott, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. \\"I think the bottom line of the Fed's decision was, 'No, we're not going to be growing our balance sheet for the foreseeable future.' It leaves the U.S. as the odd man out in this effort to, in effect, grow central bank balance sheets and weaken currencies.\\" The first improvement in U.S. jobless claims data in three weeks did little to change the negative tone of trading. New claims for unemployment benefits last week dropped by 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 423,000, according to the Labor Department. The level remains too high to suggest much improvement in the stubbornly weak U.S. jobs market. In addition, the previous week's figure was revised to reflect more jobless claims. Investors also shrugged off other modestly positive economic data Thursday morning. The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators increased for the fourth consecutive month in August and government data showed that U.S. home prices increased in July for the fourth straight month. In the backdrop was a flareup in U.S. debt worries, the result of the surprise failure of a bill to fund the U.S. government through mid-November. Conservative Republicans and most Democrats teamed up for the largest defeat inflicted on the Republican House majority this year. The episode was a reminder of market gyrations this summer, when Washington was caught in an impasse of raising the limit on federal borrowing.

This morning, we’re seeing that volatility express itself, with global stocks all falling and US stocks down about 2.5% from where they closed yesterday. But let’s not kid ourselves that there’s any particular reason why global stocks are falling. And especially, let’s not try to invent some spurious reason for the fall, be it broad and inchoate (“global economy fears”) or weirdly specific (“Federal Reserve pessimism”). It’s may or may not be helpful, here, to check out the price-and-volume chart of the S&P 500 over the past few days. You see that little wobble in the mid-afternoon yesterday, before the high-volume sell-off at the end of the day? That was the immediate reaction to the release of the FOMC statement at 2:30pm. The big plunge, on unusually high volume, started about an hour later. And the big drop at the open today was much more notable in price terms than it was in volume terms. It’s silly to think that the decline in stock-market prices was a rational reaction to the FOMC statement. If the FOMC is more pessimistic than the market expected, that’s normally a good sign for markets, since it implies that monetary policy will remain looser for longer. The market cares about the Fed because the Fed controls monetary policy. And so Fed forecasts are important because they help drive that policy. No one revised down their growth expectations as a result of the FOMC statement. As a general rule, if you see “fears” or “pessimism” in a market-report headline, that’s code for “the market fell and we don’t know why”, or alternatively “the market is volatile and yet we feel the need to impose some spurious causality onto it”. This kind of thing matters — because when news organizations run enormous headlines about intraday movements in the stock market, that’s likely to panic the population as a whole. They think that they should care about such things because if it wasn’t important, the media wouldn’t be shouting about it so loudly. And they internalize other fallacious bits of journalistic laziness as well: like the idea that the direction of the stock market is a good proxy for the future health of the economy, or the idea that rising stocks are always a good thing and falling stocks are always a bad thing. Or, most invidiously, the idea that the most interesting and important time period when looking at the stock market is one day. The single most reported statistic with regard to the stock market is where it closed, today, compared to where it closed yesterday. It’s an utterly random and pointless number, but because the media treats it with such reverence, the public inevitably gets the impression that it matters. Here’s a more useful stock market chart, for the vast majority of people for whom the stock market only matters as a long-term investment: I’m not going to try to read any great narrative into this chart. But if you want to explain stocks to the broad population, this is the sort of thing you should be showing them. Rather than useless and irrelevant news about what happened to stock prices this morning. ||||| MarketWatch NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — U.S. stocks were thrashed Thursday, with the major indexes taking their hardest single-day hit in five weeks, amid widespread selling of stocks and commodities on escalated fears about the global economy. “This is a class example of indiscriminate selling to raise cash, it’s not a selective process here,” said Art Hogan, head of product strategy, equity research at Lazard Capital Markets.

The negative sentiment taking hold among investors is “driven by the bank runs in Europe, and some of the European banks are rumored to be looking in the Middle East for capital; it’s like a replay of 2008 for some of the U.S. banks,” said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital.

The bun in my burger was stale, almost seemed like it was toasted in an attempt to cover its lack of freshness. The fries were decent. The wings were average or maybe slightly less than average. Overall, I won't be returning. Is this review positive or negative? OPT: A. negative. B. positive. Answer:","output":"Answer: A. negative. The review you provided is clearly negative. The customer has mentioned several issues with their dining experience, including the stale bun in their burger, the average or below-average wings, and the merely decent fries. Furthermore, the customer states that they will not be returning to the establishment, which underscores their dissatisfaction with the overall experience. Breaking down the review, we can observe the following points that contribute to the negative impression: 1. Stale bun in the burger: A stale bun is not just an indicator of a lack of freshness but also affects the overall taste and texture of the burger. Toasting the bun may be an attempt to hide the staleness, but the attempt was unsuccessful and left the customer unsatisfied. 2. Decent fries: While the fries were not terrible, being described as \\"decent\\" implies that they were not exceptional or memorable. Ideally, a positive review would have lauded the taste, texture, or overall appeal of the fries. 3. Average or below-average wings: By stating that the wings were \\"average or maybe slightly less than average,\\" the customer is suggesting that they were not satisfied with the quality of the wings served. This could be due to factors such as the taste, texture, or presentation of the dish. 4. No intention to return: The most telling part of the review is the customer's outright statement that they will not return to the restaurant. This implies that their negative experience was significant enough to deter them from trying the establishment again. In conclusion, this review is predominantly negative, as the customer expresses dissatisfaction with several aspects of their dining experience and has no intention of returning to the restaurant."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following: An emollient is a skin-softening preparation that you can purchase over-the-counter at your local drugstore or pharmacy. Examples include petroleum jelly (Vasoline), or other thick creams that your doctor or dermatologist may recommend. It is best to apply an emollient to your psoriasis lesions right after a shower or bath. You can also make your own emollients at home, using ingredients such as cocoa butter, almond butter, coconut oil, olive oil, and beeswax among other things. One example is to mix 4 ounces of cocoa butter, 4 ounces of almond butter, and 2 ounces of shaved beeswax. Use heat to mix the ingredients together, then place them in a heat-proof container and let them cool before use. Another example is to mix 4 ounces of extra virgin olive oil with 2 ounces of coconut oil, 1 ounce of vitamin E oil, and 1 ounce of shaved beeswax. Again, mix the ingredients with heat so that they meld together, then put them in a heat-proof container and let the mixture cool before use. Other thick moisturizers that you can use to treat psoriasis include Eucerin cream and Cetaphil cream. Products labeled as \\"lotions\\" are not good enough emollients — look for creams. A corticosteroid cream or ointment functions by suppressing the immune response at the area of the psoriatic lesions. When you apply it over the affected areas, it brings down the inflammation. It can help resolve (or at least improve) psoriasis flares in the shortest amount of time possible. There are various strengths (potencies) of corticosteroids that you can get. A simple hydrocortisone cream of 0.5% or 1% can be purchased over-the-counter at your local drugstore or pharmacy. Your doctor will need to prescribe stronger corticosteroid creams. You can also get shampoos containing corticosteroids if you have psoriasis lesions on your scalp. When applying steroids, apply to the affected area only. Do not use a topical steroid for more than three weeks at a time without consulting a physician. Do not use steroid cream around the eyes. Refrain from abrupt discontinuation of the medication. Potential side effects of steroids include skin thinning, changes in pigmentation, easy bruising, and stretch marks. Calcipotriene or calcitriol are both related to vitamin D and have been proven to be effective in the treatment of psoriasis. These topical preparations can work well with corticosteroids, and you usually need to apply them twice per day. Speak to your doctor to obtain a prescription, and for specific dosing instructions depending upon the severity of your psoriasis. Other topical treatments that you can use to treat psoriasis flare ups include tar, tazarotene, calcineurin inhibitors, and anthralin. These are not typically first-line treatments, but are reserved for cases that are unresponsive to other treatments. Consult your physician if you are interested in receiving a prescription for one of these other topical treatments for psoriasis. Summary:","output":"Emollients are skin-softening preparations used to treat psoriasis lesions, available over-the-counter or as homemade alternatives using ingredients like cocoa butter, almond butter, and beeswax. Thick moisturizers, like Eucerin cream and Cetaphil cream, are also effective. Corticosteroid creams help reduce inflammation and improve psoriasis flare-ups. They vary in potency, with simple hydrocortisone available over-the-counter and stronger options requiring a prescription. Vitamin D-related topical treatments, such as calcipotriene and calcitriol, can be combined with corticosteroids for effective treatment.

Yet due to a change in the dictatorship by the military in the 80’s, the minimum age restriction was reduced to the age of twelve but was reviewed due to reports of dangerous and hazardous working conditions in 1988. This led to the minimum age being raised once again to 14. Another set of restrictions was passed in 1998 that restricted the kinds of work youth could partake in, such as work that was considered hazardous like running construction equipment, or certain kinds of factory work. Although many steps were taken to reduce the risk and occurrence of child labour, there is still a high number of children and adolescents working under the age of fourteen in Brazil.

Hypothesis: Companies often lay off employees to save money on expenses. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"In order to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, it is essential to first understand both the premise and the hypothesis thoroughly and analyze how the hypothesis is connected to the premise. Let's break down both statements before evaluating the entailment. Premise: The premise describes a situation in which a cut in output and employment in the investment sector would not be immediately offset by a rise in output and employment in industries that produce for export or that compete with imports. In simpler terms, the premise is stating that when employment and production are reduced in one sector (in this case, the investment sector), there won't be an instant increase or adjustment in employment and production in other sectors (specifically, the export and import-competing industries). The premise implies that there's a lag or delay in the redistribution of resources (employment and production capacity) across different sectors of the economy. Hypothesis: The hypothesis states that companies often lay off employees to save money on expenses. It suggests that letting go of employees is a common strategy employed by businesses to reduce their operational costs, which can be attributed to various reasons. The reasons can include financial struggles, organizational restructuring, or adapting to market changes. The hypothesis, as a standalone statement, doesn't specifically mention any sector or type of industry. Entailment evaluation: The hypothesis focuses on a general behavior of companies, implying that layoffs can happen across different sectors or industries as a measure to save money. On the other hand, the premise outlines a specific scenario where there is a decrease in employment and output in the investment sector without an immediate balancing effect on industries related to export or competing with imports. Even though both statements talk about employment reduction, the premise does not provide explicit reasons behind the cut in employment and output, and it is focused on a particular inter-sector scenario. Considering this, we can conclude that the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise. The premise creates a scenario without providing reasons or causes that lead to employment cuts. Therefore, it is not a logical consequence of the premise that companies lay off their employees to save money on expenses simply because there is no immediate equilibrium in employment and output in export or import-competing industries following a cut in the investment sector."},{"instruction":"Given a negotiation between two participants, answer 'Yes' if both participants agree to the deal, otherwise answer 'No'.

It has a coast on the Adriatic Sea to the south-west and is bordered by Croatia to the west, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Serbia to the northeast, Kosovo to the east, and Albania to the south-east. Its capital and largest city is Podgorica, while Cetinje is designated as the Old Royal Capital (\\"prijestonica\\"). - Serbia, officially the Republic of Serbia, is a sovereign state situated at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe, covering the southern part of the Pannonian Plain and the central Balkans. Relative to its small territory, it is a diverse country distinguished by a \\"transitional\\" character, situated along cultural, geographic, climatic and other boundaries. Serbia is landlocked and borders Hungary to the north; Romania and Bulgaria to the east; Macedonia to the south; and Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Montenegro to the southwest; it also claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo. Serbia numbers around 7 million residents, and its capital, Belgrade, ranks among the largest cities in Southeast Europe. - Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music. - \\"Onamo, 'namo!\\" (Serbian Cyrillic: , '!) also known as the Serbian Marseillaise ( ) was a popular anthem in Montenegro in the late 19th to early 20th century. The royal state anthem of Montenegro at the time was To Our Beautiful Montenegro, while the education anthem was the Hymn to Saint Sava. - Ubavoj nam Crnoj Gori ( Serbian : , English : To Our Beautiful Montenegro ) was the national and state anthem of the Kingdom of Montenegro in the late 19th - early 20th century . A popular song called Onamo , ' namo ! ( There , o'er There ! ) also existed . The educational system had an honorific song , the Hymn to Saint Sava , which was sung in the Saint 's honour . The lyrics were made in 1865 by the Serb poet and a priest named Jovan Sundei , who was the secretary of Prince Nikola I of Montenegro . The music was composed by Jovo Ivaniševi , drawing from \`\` Uskliknimo s ljubavlju '' , hymn to Saint Sava and later adapted by Anton Schulz . The anthem was first performed on October 17 , 1870 , after which Prince Nikola declared it as the state anthem . In 1993 , the anthem was one of the proposals during the unsuccessful negotiations to adopt an Anthem of the Republic of Montenegro . The main problem was its monarchist lyrics . - A national anthem (also state anthem, national hymn, national song etc.) is generally a patriotic musical composition that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions and struggles of its people, recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people. The majority of national anthems are either marches or hymns in style. The countries of Latin America tend towards more operatic pieces, while a handful of countries use a simple fanfare. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - The Kingdom of Serbia, often rendered as \\"Servia\\" in English sources during the time of its existence, was created when Prince Milan I of Serbia, ruler of the Principality of Serbia, was crowned king in 1882. - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music. - Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music. In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist. \\"Composition\\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \\"score\\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music. - A constitutional monarchy (also known as a parliamentary monarchy) is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises their authorities in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution. Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy (in which a monarch holds absolute power), in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework. Constitutional monarchies range from countries such as Morocco, where the constitution grants substantial discretionary powers to the sovereign, to countries such as Sweden or Denmark where the monarch retains very few formal authorities. - The Great National Assembly of the Serb People in Montenegro, known as the Podgorica Assembly ( /Podgorika skupština), was an assembly of the representative body of the Montenegrin people (the Kingdom of Montenegro) in November 1918, after World War I, that was to decide whether Montenegro was to unite with the Kingdom of Serbia. It was organized by a Serbian government committee. The two sides were known as the \\"Greens\\" and the \\"Whites\\", in favour of a confederation (independence) and unification (annexation), respectively. The assembly concluded the decision to merge Montenegro with Serbia. The creation of Yugoslavia followed. - The Kingdom of Montenegro (Serbian: a a / \\"Kraljevina Crna Gora\\"), was a monarchy in southeastern Europe, present day Montenegro, during the tumultuous years on the Balkan Peninsula leading up to and during World War I. Legally it was a constitutional monarchy, but absolutist in practice. On 28 November 1918, following the end of World War I, with its government still in exile, the unconstitutional Podgorica Assembly proclaimed union with the Kingdom of Serbia, and was merged into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes three days later, on 1 December 1918. - Anglican church music is music that is written for liturgical worship in Anglican church services.

While this is technically true, the young group’s tattooed, pierced bad-dude posturing fills a space crucial to the teen-idol ecosystem, and the raucous, oak tag-brandishing crowd at their show at the Paradise on Monday signaled their success. The Janoskians came to prominence on YouTube, posting comedy clips that thrive to some extent on online video’s tendencies toward celebrating mild sociopathy — “Awkward Train Situations,” their first offering, was a montage of them annoying fellow passengers in a way that brought to mind a youthful, innuendo-eschewing Candid Camera. A steady stream of videos, constant updates on social media outposts like Keek and Instagram, savvy cross-merchandising via their Dirty Pig clothing line, teen magazine-ready looks, and outrage stoked by some of their randier stunts eventually — inevitably? — resulted in the Janoskians garnering attention from big-name entertainment concerns. Lionsgate signed the group to a film deal this spring; Republic Records has released their singles in the US. While the Janoskians might not consider themselves a boy band, show business is slow when it comes to developing new pipelines for stars, and the Janoskians’ material being a bit too blue for teen TV outlets means that their brand-building will be filled with lip synching and synchronized moves — at least until the movie comes out. Monday night’s show made it obvious that the group needed to work out the kinks of live performance; the miming and dancing felt tossed-off, like a trial the fivesome had to endure in order to be rewarded with the crowd’s love. (A spirited performance of “Let It Go,” the diva statement from “Frozen,” proved the exception.) The skits included a quiz show where wrong answers led to members getting electrocuted and the acting out of a piece of fan fiction that climaxed in screech-inducing clinches. Passing the mike to the crowd for a Q&A led to queries about sex posed so frankly that even the group seemed flustered. The crowd, for its part, wasn’t bothered by anything, whether half-hearted lip synching or overreliance on bodily function gags — perhaps partly because screams drowned out laugh lines. When those did come through, it was hard to not wish for a smidge of meddling from a standards-and-practices department: The guys have a not-insignificant amount of charm, but it’s lost in the morass of dime-store gags. Take the speed-dating-themed video for “Real Girls Eat Cake,” a ska-skewing track that could be the cheeky-dude counterpart to Megan Trainor’s chart-topping ode to butts, “All About That Bass.” The clip indulges more cheap stereotypes than a Katy Perry awards-show performance, while the lyrics embody the pick-up artist ideal of the “neg,” in which one wins the affections of potential suitors by not-so-subtly putting them down. It’s a bit of a drag, although the quintet’s stated unwillingness to play to teen-idol type means that they have to play fast and loose with ideals of “good behavior.” But if the Janoskians want to transcend YouTube, they need to aim their jokes both higher and more precisely. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The Janoskians, an Australian group of friends known for their funny YouTube videos, performed a show that was a mix of singing, dancing, and comedy skits.

Answer: During the past ten thousand years, rising sea levels overflowed the lowlands and separated the continent into today's low-lying arid to semi-arid mainland and the two mountainous islands of New Guinea and Tasmania. Question: what continent is australia The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the continent in question is Australia. The continent of Australia is the smallest of the seven continents, and it comprises the Australian mainland, the island of Tasmania, and the smaller islands surrounding it. Australia, as a continent, is part of the region known as Oceania, which also includes the islands of the Pacific Ocean. The statement provided accurately describes the geographical and geological changes that have occurred in the Australian continent over the past ten thousand years. Rising sea levels caused by the melting of ice caps and glaciers have resulted in the inundation of lowland areas, thus separating the mainland of Australia from the islands of New Guinea and Tasmania. Australia's geographical history has greatly influenced its unique flora and fauna, which have evolved in isolation from the rest of the world. The continent is known for its vast array of marsupials, such as kangaroos and koalas, and monotremes, such as the platypus and the echidna, along with a diverse range of bird species, reptiles, and plant life. The mainland of Australia is characterized by its arid to semi-arid climate, numerous deserts, and unique landforms such as Uluru and the Great Sandy Desert. Meanwhile, the island of Tasmania boasts a more temperate climate and a rich, mountainous landscape that supports a diverse range of ecosystems. In summary, the continent of Australia consists of the Australian mainland, Tasmania, and several smaller islands. Its geographical history has been shaped by rising sea levels, which have separated the mainland from neighboring islands like New Guinea and Tasmania, resulting in a unique array of flora and fauna not found elsewhere on the planet."},{"instruction":"What is the title of this article: Traditionally a carnival feast was the last opportunity to eat well before the time of food shortage at the end of the winter during which one was limited to the minimum necessary.

He was best known for his silent films, in which his trademark was physical comedy with a consistently stoic, deadpan expression, earning him the nickname \\"The Great Stone Face\\". Critic Roger Ebert wrote of Keaton's \\"extraordinary period from 1920 to 1929, [when] he worked without interruption on a series of films that make him, arguably, the greatest actor-director in the history of the movies\\". His career declined afterward with a dispiriting loss of his artistic independence when he was hired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and he descended into alcoholism, ruining his family life. Keaton's personal life had stabilized with his 1940 marriage, and now he was taking life a little easier, abandoning Columbia for the less strenuous field of feature films. Throughout the 1940s, Keaton played character roles in both \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" features. He made his last starring feature El Moderno Barba Azul (1946) in Mexico; the film was a low budget production, and it may not have been seen in the United States until its release on VHS in the 1980s, under the title Boom in the Moon. Critics rediscovered Keaton in 1949 and producers occasionally hired him for bigger \\"prestige\\" pictures. He had cameos in such films as In the Good Old Summertime (1949), Sunset Boulevard (1950), and Around the World in 80 Days (1956). In In The Good Old Summertime, Keaton personally directed the stars Judy Garland and Van Johnson in their first scene together where they bump into each other on the street. Keaton invented comedy bits where Johnson keeps trying to apologize to a seething Garland, but winds up messing up her hairdo and tearing her dress. Keaton also had a cameo as Jimmy, appearing near the end of the film It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963). Jimmy assists Spencer Tracy's character, Captain C. G. Culpepper, by readying Culpepper's ultimately-unused boat for his abortive escape. (The restored version of that film, released in 2013, contains a restored scene where Jimmy and Culpeper talk on the telephone. Lost after the comedy epic's \\"roadshow\\" exhibition, the audio of that scene was discovered, and combined with still pictures to recreate the scene.) Keaton was given more screen time in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1966). The appearance, since it was released after his death, was his posthumous swansong. Keaton also appeared in a comedy routine about two inept stage musicians in Charlie Chaplin's Limelight (1952), recalling the vaudeville of The Playhouse. With the exception of Seeing Stars, a minor publicity film produced in 1922, Limelight was the only time in which the two would ever appear together on film. In 1949, comedian Ed Wynn invited Keaton to appear on his CBS Television comedy-variety show, The Ed Wynn Show, which was televised live on the West Coast. Kinescopes were made for distribution of the programs to other parts of the country since there was no transcontinental coaxial cable until September 1951. Great. What else?","output":"Besides his film appearances, Buster Keaton also made a significant impact on the small screen with several appearances on television, and continued to work on stage throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. In 1950, he hosted and co-starred in the television show \\"The Buster Keaton Show,\\" which only lasted one season due to fractious relationships between Keaton and the executive producers. However, this did not deter him from pursuing other television opportunities. Keaton made guest appearances on several popular television shows, such as \\"The Ed Wynn Show,\\" \\"The Garry Moore Show,\\" \\"What's My Line?\\", \\"Candid Camera,\\" \\"The Twilight Zone,\\" and \\"The Donna Reed Show.\\" Remarkably, the comedian had a recurring role as a time-traveling train conductor on the children's show \\"The Adventures of Hiram Holliday\\" in the late 1950s, showcasing his ability to adapt to different audiences. As television became an increasingly vital medium for entertainment, Keaton embraced the opportunities it presented to comedians such as himself. In the early 1960s, Keaton starred in a series of industrial films to promote the benefits of using aluminum, produced by the Alcoa Company. These shorts, known as \\"The Homeowner,\\" \\"The Boat Builder,\\" and \\"The Blacksmith,\\" allowed him to employ his trademark physical comedy style while teaching viewers about the many uses of aluminum materials. Furthermore, Keaton's legacy on stage continued with his noteworthy performance in the 1955 stage play \\"Once Upon a Mattress.\\" He then went on to tour with the play in 1960, visiting various cities and giving audiences an opportunity to witness his timeless talent on stage. Keaton also ventured into the field of advertisement. In a series of commercials for Simon Pure Beer, he reprised a few of his iconic silent comedy routines to promote the beverage. These commercials served as an additional platform for reintroducing his comedy to a new generation of viewers. In January 1966, shortly before his death, Keaton was presented with an honorary Oscar \\"for his unique talents which brought immortal comedies to the screen.\\" Despite facing numerous personal struggles, professional setbacks, and the daunting challenges of working in a constantly changing entertainment landscape, Buster Keaton left an indelible mark on the film, television, and theatrical worlds. Buster Keaton's influence can be seen today in the works of various comedians, filmmakers, and actors, who continue to draw inspiration from his innovative approach to physical comedy, deadpan expression, and determination to push the boundaries of what was possible on screen. Keaton's life and work serve as a testament to his enduring impact on the world of entertainment and as a reminder of the importance of perseverance in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: With winter fast approaching, flu season is here.

Answer:","output":"The missing first step could be: \\"A butterfly lays an egg.\\" Justification: Step-by-step, here's how the caterpillar (and eventually butterfly) life cycle usually goes: 1. A butterfly lays an egg - This is a necessary first step in which a butterfly lays an egg on a leaf. This process must take place for a caterpillar and butterfly to eventually emerge. 2. The caterpillar (or larva) emerges from the egg - The egg hatches into a caterpillar. This step is assumed in the original statement as we jump right to the caterpillar stage. 3. The caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger - As given in the original list. 4. The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself - The next phase after being caterpillar as mentioned. 5. The caterpillar becomes a pupa - This is a stage when the caterpillar rests inside the cocoon. 6. After some time the cocoon hatches - After complete evolution, the pupa hatches. 7. Finally, a butterfly is born - A fully grown butterfly comes out from the cocoon. Therefore, to establish the connection between the butterfly and the caterpillar, the caterpillar must first hatch from an egg laid by the butterfly.

The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent.

Context: SEOUL — North Korea shut down its Punggye-ri nuclear test site on Thursday to demonstrate its commitment to denuclearization in advance of the planned U.S.-North Korea summit. The development came hours before President Donald Trump called off the highly anticipated meeting. The South Korean government welcomed the North's unilateral nuclear concession to help facilitate a broader agreement with the United States to completely end its nuclear weapons program in exchange for ending punishing sanctions and security guarantees. \\"We are hoping that this action will become the opportunity for complete denuclearization in the future,\\" South Korea Foreign Ministry spokesman Noh Kyu-duk said. However, while the closure of the nuclear test complex is a significant symbolic gesture, analysts are skeptical it will seriously inhibit the Kim Jong Un government's ability to carry out further nuclear tests in the future. \\"That renders the test site unusable, but not forever and it's not like North Korea has a shortage of mountains or people to make new tunnels,\\" said Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California, during an interview with Vice News. North Korea conducted all six of its nuclear tests at the Punggye-ri underground site that includes at least two extensive tunnel systems, according the 38 North website that monitors the North's nuclear activities. Each nuclear test conducted at the site was progressively more powerful, with the first bomb detonated in 2006 producing an estimated 1-2 kiloton yield, much less powerful than the 16-kiloton bomb the United States used on Hiroshima during World War II, and the last test in 2017 producing close to a 250-kiloton yield.

Sacramento has been the state capital since California became the 31st state in the United States on September 9, 1850. It was chosen as the capital due to its central location, making it easily accessible to people coming from different parts of the state. Sacramento has a population of around 513,000, making it the sixth-largest city in California. The city is known for its rich history, vibrant culture, and diverse community. It is home to many important landmarks and institutions, such as the California State Capitol building, where the state's government operates.

Joseph Recalls a Positive Interaction with Kathy: Contrary to Jessica's questioning, Joseph recalls that Kathy once helped him with an Excel file. This recollection suggests that Kathy, despite her typical behavior, has shown a degree of kindness and cooperative attitude at least once. 6. Jessica Laughs at Joseph’s Comment: Jessica ends the conversation with a laugh, implying that she finds the idea of Kathy being nice somewhat amusing. Her response suggests that she perceives Kathy’s kind act as a rare or unexpected occurrence. In summary, this conversation largely revolves around Kathy's altered appearance and the complex relationship between Kathy, Jessica, and Joseph. While they find amusement in discussing Kathy’s peculiar look, they also reminisce about their past interactions with her."},{"instruction":"L'Office est d'avis qu'une personne raisonnable pourrait se demander si le droit du transporteur de refuser de transporter une personne ayant un comportement turbulent ou de la faire descendre de l'avion se veut une mesure ponctuelle ou si le transporteur a le pouvoir d'imposer une sanction encore plus sévère comme le refus de transport à long terme, une interdiction à vie ou même l'assujettissement de l'acceptation d'un passager qui a des antécédents de comportement turbulent à un certain nombre de conditions.

Lalbai leads the bride to the shaitani ilaaka (devil's domain) where she is roused from her spell. The bride is sacrificed, screaming and kicking, at the altar of her aka (the Shaitan, or great devil). Shaitan is an ancient and fearsome demon. Years ago, he roamed free and indiscriminately terrorized the local townsfolk. But he was ultimately defeated, reduced to a formless soul, and held, by a magic charm, to remain imprisoned forever within the shaitani ilaaka. Lalbai brings him a fresh bride every Amavasya night. Shaitan consumes the blood of this bride, and grows stronger with each offering, until he can break the charm, restore all his evil powers and ravage the world again. At the affluent home of rich industrialist Thakur, he has a wife, Roma, and their six-year old daughter, Anju. They have retained a governess, Shalaka, for Anju. Anju seems to be a happy child with one exception. She experiences strange convulsions and horrible nightmares every Amavasya night. Thakur decides to bring her to Dr. Yograj, a medical man who has attained Siddhi through rigorous spiritual training. Dr. Yograj examines Anju from a medical standpoint, but also notices strange telekinetic events when Anju is in his office. Later, at the home, he observes phenomena that strongly indicate a poltergeist. When he talks to Shalaka, she firmly snubs him. (Unbeknownst to the family however, Shalaka practices voodoo with Anju as the target.) Dr. Yograj refers Thakur to a famed Tantrik Baba (wise man), recently returned from Tibet after an extended spiritual course, for help. Baba visits the home, inspects Anju's room, and immediately identifies it as the work of a malevolent aatma (soul).

Although much time has passed, I still think of that ant farm. Over the years, I came to realize the ants have the spirit of teamwork. Working together, they were able to create an amazing world for themselves. I also learned that they should be admired for their hard work. Day in and day out, each worked at their task. The ant farm showed that teamwork and perseverance are indeed the keys to success. But there was an even larger lesson that I did not realize until recently --Adversity is a natural part of life, and must be accepted. Unlike the ants, humans cannot give up when they face disappointment. So I try to live my life like those hardworking ants. But, unlike them, I try not to let frustration defeat me. I will have to keep building my tunnels. The answer is:","output":"Question: In the article \\"I learned about life from an ant farm,\\" what important lessons did the author learn from observing the ants and their behavior? A) Teamwork and perseverance are the keys to success. B) Frustration can lead to defeat. C) Adversity is a natural part of life and must be accepted. D) All of the above. Answer: D) All of the above."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: \\"Because all of you of Earth are idiots!\\" shouted Tom, wearily wiping the glass counter, removing coconut oil from the reflections of overpriced candy bars. Inside the theater the movie echoed him: \\"Because all of you of Earth are idiots!\\" Tom sighed, not for the first time that evening. The Manager, who paid in cash every Sunday, had decided to take advantage of the bizarre tastes of his Generation X clients and offer an Ed Wood film festival. Bride of the Monster, Plan 9 From Outer Space, and Night of the Ghouls ran on the second, smaller screen on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, two bucks a head. The Manager was making a killing. Tom, who needed the job in order to move out of his parents' trailer home, found little about the Ed Wood canon amusing, although it was light-years beyond anything by Coleman Francis. Even so, Tom had been forced to hear the dialog of each film, on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday... He only had to watch them once, having filled in for the Manager's weasel-featured nephew/projectionist Neoldner, who had called in sick to buy grass in Beloit. But he would have been able to forget the experience had it not been for the penetrating soundtrack which bled into the lobby. The ordeal, for tonight, was almost over - the concession stand closed after Plan 9. He hoped he had sold enough to keep his job - there was the worry that the Manager would increase his profit margin by manning the concession stand himself. But the Manager strolled out of the second theater with a broad grin, revealing his cutting overbite. \\"I don't know why,\\" the Manager exclaimed, \\"but they love it!\\" \\"Most of them are from the 'Ed 9 Film Society,'\\" Tom replied. \\"By the way, I need to restock the chocolates.\\" After working that shift, Tom would likely A. reveal the whereabouts of Neoldner B. keep his job C. quit his job D. not enough information Answer:","output":"B. keep his job Based on the information provided, it seems likely that Tom would choose to keep his job. The Manager is shown to be making a profit from the Ed Wood film festival, which indicates that the concession stand may also be performing well. Tom is also concerned about selling enough to keep his job, implying that he values it and wants to maintain his employment. Furthermore, Tom needs the job in order to move out of his parents' trailer home, giving him a clear motivation for continuing to work at the theater. The Manager's broad grin and evident satisfaction with the event's success suggest that Tom might not be in immediate danger of losing his job. Though Tom finds the Ed Wood films unamusing and is frustrated by having to listen to their dialog, this discontent does not appear to be severe enough for him to quit his job. Instead, he seems to find some solace in the fact that the ordeal would soon be over, at least for the night, when the concession stand closed after Plan 9. There is not enough information to suggest that Tom would reveal the whereabouts of Neoldner or that he would quit his job. As such, the most likely outcome is that Tom would keep his job after working that shift."},{"instruction":"After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Reull Vallis is a valley on Mars that appears to have been carved by water . It runs westward into Hellas Planitia . It is named after the Gaelic word for planet . - Astrology is the study of the movements and relative positions of celestial objects as a means for divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events. Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some such as the Indians, Chinese, and Maya developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. Western astrology, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th-17th century BCE Mesopotamia, from which it spread to Ancient Greece, Rome, the Arab world and eventually Central and Western Europe. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems. - The Noachis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Noachis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-27 (Mars Chart-27). - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - The asteroid belt is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The asteroid belt is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids. About half the mass of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the asteroid belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200 km). - Hellas Planitia is a plain located within the huge, roughly circular impact basin Hellas located in the southern hemisphere of the planet Mars. Hellas is the third or fourth largest impact crater and the largest visible impact crater known in the Solar System. The basin floor is about deep, deeper than the Moon's South Pole-Aitken basin, and extends about east to west. It is centered at Hellas Planitia is in the Hellas quadrangle and the Noachis quadrangle. - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. - A terrestrial planet, telluric planet, or rocky planet is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The terms \\"terrestrial planet\\" and \\"telluric planet\\" are derived from Latin words for Earth (\\"Terra\\" and \\"Tellus\\"), as these planets are, in terms of composition, \\"Earth-like\\". - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. - An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins. - The Hellas quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Hellas quadrangle is also referred to as MC-28 (Mars Chart-28). The Hellas quadrangle covers the area from 240° to 300° west longitude and 30° to 65° south latitude on the planet Mars. Within the Hellas quadrangle lies the classic features Hellas Planitia and Promethei Terra. Many interesting and mysterious features have been discovered in the Hellas quadrangle, including the giant river valleys Dao Vallis, Niger Vallis, Harmakhis, and Reull Vallisall of which may have contributed water to a lake in the Hellas basin in the distant past. Many places in the Hellas quadrangle show signs of ice in the ground, especially places with glacier-like flow features. - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known. What object entity has the relation of 'location' with the subject 'reull vallis'?

Following the hype generated by the movie's enticing trailer and the favorable reviews it received at numerous film festivals, this spectacle seemed to have it all: talented cast members, incredible visuals, and a thrilling and original script. However, it all came crashing down once the film began rolling. It is with great disappointment that I must report that Beyond Redemption is a tragic catastrophe of a film that leaves its audience feeling unsatisfied and frustrated. From the onset, the movie's core story revolves around an improbable band of rebels who come together to defy an oppressive regime in a dystopian near-future setting. The premise seems promising enough to stir the imagination of any viewer, but unfortunately, the plot quickly devolves into a tangled mess of incoherent storylines and underdeveloped characters that the audience is never given an opportunity to invest in emotionally. Furthermore, the dialogue in Beyond Redemption is abysmal and overly dramatic, littered with cliché phrases and pseudo-philosophical ramblings. The talented cast, led by an A-list actor who shall remain unnamed for their sake, struggles to make sense of the poorly written script, and their efforts to breathe life into their flat characters only serve to highlight how disconnected and disjointed the overall narrative is. When it comes to the technical aspects of the movie, disappointment runs deep as well. The breathtaking visuals showcased in the promotional material are far and few between in the actual film. They are overshadowed by an overuse of cheap CGI effects that contribute nothing to the story, but only serve to disengage the viewer further, distancing them from any semblance of immersion. Additionally, directing leaves much to be desired, as scenes that possess potential for genuine emotional impact are relegated to mere afterthoughts, obscured by the misguided focus on hollow action scenes and nonsensical plot twists. The pacing of Beyond Redemption is erratic, and not in a way that keeps the audience on their toes. Rather, it forces viewers to question if the editor fell asleep during the post-production process, leaving the movie with such haphazard and confusing tempo. As for the music, what should have been a blanket of sound expertly woven into the fabric of the movie becomes an intrusive cacophony. At its best, the soundtrack is forgettable, and at its worst, it pulls the audience out of the viewing experience, inciting frustration rather than the intended emotional response. The most unsatisfactory element of Beyond Redemption, however, is the missed potential that the concept possesses. With a more competent and deft hand at the helm, the dystopian world could have provided the backdrop for an engaging and thought-provoking story. Instead, the audience is subjected to a fever-dream rollercoaster that leaves them craving a cohesive narrative and characters that are worth emotionally investing in. In conclusion, Beyond Redemption is a colossal failure in all aspects of filmmaking. Shallow and convoluted, it squanders a promising premise and wastes the talent of a remarkable cast. With such a disjointed plot, lackluster visuals, and forgettable music, this cinematic catastrophe will do little more than induce regret for the time and money spent watching it. Save yourself the aggravation - give this movie a miss."},{"instruction":"The son of a physician, Kunstler was born in New York City and attended DeWitt Clinton High School. He was educated at Yale College, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1941, and Columbia University Law School from which he graduated in 1948. While in school, Kunstler was an avid poet and represented Yale in the Glascock Prize competition at Mount Holyoke College. Kunstler served in the U.S. Army during World War II in the Pacific theater, attaining the rank of Major, and received the Bronze Star. In 1974-1975, Kunstler defended a prisoner charged with killing a guard during the Attica Prison riot. Under cross-examination, Kunstler forced Correction Officer Donald Melven to retract his sworn identification of John Hill, Kunstler's client, and Charles Pernasilice (defended by Richard Miller), admitting he still retained \\"slight\\" doubts that he confessed to investigators at the time of the incident. Kunstler focused on pointing out that all the other prosecution witnesses were testifying under reduced-sentencing agreements and called five prison inmates as defense witnesses (Miller called none), who testified that other prisoners hit the guard. Despite Justice King's repeated warnings to Kunstler to \\"be careful, sir\\", Kunstler quickly became \\"the star of the trial, the man the jurors watch most attentively, and the lawyer whose voice carries most forcefully\\". Although the prosecution was careful to avoid personal confrontation with Kunstler, who frequently charmed the jury with jokes, on one occasion Kunstler provoked a shouting match with the lead prosecutor, allegedly to wake up a sleeping jury member. The jury convicted Hill of murder and Pernasilice of attempted assault. When Kunstler protested that the defendants would risk being murdered due to the judges remanding them, King threatened to send Kunstler with them. New York Governor Hugh Carey granted executive clemency to Hill and the other inmates in 1976, even though Hill's name was not on the recommended list of pardons delivered to the governor and his appeals were still pending.

Question: What would describe the hands of someone who doesn't do manual labor? Options: A. articulate B. soft C. sign language D. graceful E. cup water","output":"Option B. soft would describe the hands of someone who doesn't do manual labor. Manual labor involves physically strenuous tasks, which can lead to noticeable changes in the hands of those who perform it regularly. When an individual engages in frequent manual labor, their hands become tougher, showing visible signs of wear and tear such as calluses and rough skin. On the other hand, someone who doesn't engage in manual labor is more likely to have softer hands, free from the consequences of working with heavy tools, materials, and machinery. Soft hands are characteristic of a lifestyle that doesn't entail physically demanding work and may be taken as an indication of an office or sedentary job. This option aligns with common sense, as it directly refers to the physical condition of someone's hands in relation to their engagement in manual labor. It is worth briefly examining the other options for clarity: A. Articulate - This term is primarily used to describe someone who can express their thoughts and ideas clearly and effectively, typically through verbal communication. While it's an important skill, it is not directly relevant to the condition of a person's hands. C. Sign Language - This refers to a system of communication that employs hand gestures, facial expressions, and body language to convey meaning, often used by the deaf community. Although sign language involves hand movements, it doesn't necessarily correlate with manual labor or its physical effects on one's hands. D. Graceful - Describing someone as having graceful hands can mean that they move their hands in an elegant and sophisticated manner. This is a subjective descriptor and doesn't directly correlate with manual labor or the absence thereof. E. Cup Water - This seems to be an irrelevant and unrelated option, as cupping water implies the action of holding or scooping water with the hands. This has no direct connection to an individual's manual labor participation or the physical state of their hands.

What is the answer??","output":"Let's solve the equation step by step for the variable 'q'. Step 1: Write down the equation. -5*q = -5*q + 4*q Step 2: Simplify the equation by combining like terms on the right side. To do this, let's add the two terms involving 'q' together. -5*q = -5*q + 4*q -5*q = -(5-4)*q -5*q = -1*q Step 3: Now, we need to find the value of 'q' that makes this equation true. We can do this by eliminating the term containing 'q' from both sides of the equation. Since both sides of the equation have a coefficient of -1 or -5 for the 'q' term, let's add 5*q to both sides of the equation. -5*q + 5*q = -1*q + 5*q 0 = 4*q Step 4: To solve for 'q', we need to isolate 'q' by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'q' (in this case, that's 4). This will give us: 0/4 = 4*q/4 0 = q So, the value of 'q' that makes the equation true is q = 0."},{"instruction":"Please add punctuation to this: Carl married Elsa von Rosen on 06 JUL 1937 in Friedhem Sweden The marriage ended in divorce Elsa was born on 07 FEB 1904 in Stockholm She died on 15 APR 1991 in Stockholm","output":"Carl married Elsa von Rosen on 06 JUL 1937 in Friedhem, Sweden.

He hitchhikes to his childhood home, a decrepit place now owned by Jeremiah. Run down as it is, it is the dream home for Wes Merritt and his wife Louise. They are painstakingly saving up the money to buy it from Wes's meager wages as a cowhand. Wes recognizes Jeff as a once-prominent rodeo rider, and introduces himself, then helps Jeff gets a job at the same ranch. Wes has competed in some local rodeos, but has the ambition to do more, and wants Jeff to help him improve his skills. Wes enters a local rodeo behind his wife's back.

To begin with my family is extremely conservative and pretty religious so I have been raised the same way as well and right now its nearing college time. (Quick note we are in Canada) My parents are willing to pay for my full tuition and I am more than grateful for that, but when I was registering for universities my mom was upset because she has her heart set on me going to a specific university in the United States, this uni is super conservative and aligns with most of my personal values, it will be hard though because I am not religious and hide that from my family. For example I drink and smoke and am bisexual, these are huge no-nos at this uni in the USA. So for a lot of reasons (even including cost) I am thinking of going to a campus here in Canada close to home. Now on to the actual AITA today I called my mom as one of the colleges here requires a 500 dollar deposit which I agree is kinda bs because If I do decide to go to another college they keep the 500 dollars, after telling her this she said on the phone \\"Well I guess we won't pay the 500 dollars then\\" which to then I said \\"Well then I guess I'm not going to that college then\\" at this she began to get upset and practically yelled at me asking \\"You really want to go to that college x3\\" At this I just said I don't feel like talking to you right now and hung up. I called my dad because he is supportive of wherever I go. When I got home from school I just got some angry looks hardly any talking from my mom and it's clear that she is very mad at me. I understand she wants what's best for me but she needs to see my side too? Maybe it's just school and I need my spring break to come faster... I just don't know anymore AITA?

It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt.
