In Iran (Persia and Greater Persia) the title was continuously used; rather than King in the European sense, each Persian ruler regarded himself as the \\"Šhanšh\\" (King of Kings) or Emperor of the Persian Empire. - Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (; 27 October 1919 27 July 1980), known as Mohammad Reza Shah, was the Shah of Iran from 16 September 1941 until his overthrow by the Iranian Revolution on 11 February 1979. He took the title Shhanshh (\\"Emperor\\" or \\"King of Kings\\") on 26 October 1967. He was the second and last monarch of the House of Pahlavi of the Iranian monarchy. Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi held several other titles, including that of rymehr (Light of the Aryans) and Bozorg Arteshtrn (Head of the Warriors). His dream of the Great Civilization in Iran led to a rapid industrial and military expansion as well as economic and social reforms. - The Iranian Revolution (also known as the Islamic Revolution or the 1979 Revolution;) refers to events involving the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty under Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, who was supported by the United States and its eventual replacement with an Islamic republic under the Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution, supported by various leftist and Islamist organizations and Iranian student movements. - The Ottoman Empire ('; Modern Turkish: ' or '), also known as the Turkish Empire, Ottoman Turkey, was an empire founded at the end of the thirteenth century in northwestern Anatolia in the vicinity of Bilecik and Söüt by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman. After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe, and with the conquest of the Balkans the Ottoman Beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror. - Princess Shams Pahlavi ( Persian : ) ( 28 October 1917 , Tehran , Iran -- 29 February 1996 , Santa Barbara , California , United States ) was the elder sister of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , the last Shah of Iran .

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Bamboozled Movie plot: Pierre Delacroix (whose real name is Peerless Dothan), is an uptight, Harvard University-educated black man, working for the television network CNS. At work, he has to endure torment from his boss Thomas Dunwitty, a tactless, boorish white man. Not only does Dunwitty use AAVE, and use the word \\"nigger\\" repeatedly in conversations, he also proudly proclaims that he is more black than Delacroix and that he can use nigger since he is married to a black woman and has two mixed-race children. Dunwitty frequently rejects Delacroix's scripts for television series that portray black people in positive, intelligent scenarios, dismissing them as \\"Cosby clones\\". In an effort to escape his contract through being fired, Delacroix develops a minstrel show with the help of his personal assistant Sloane Hopkins. Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show features black actors in blackface, extremely racist jokes and puns, and offensively stereotyped CGI-animated cartoons that caricature the leading stars of the new show. Delacroix and Hopkins recruit two impoverished street performers â Manray, named after American artist Man Ray, and Womack â to star in the show. While Womack is horrified when Delacroix tells him details about the show, Manray sees it as his big chance to become rich and famous for his tap-dancing skills. To Delacroix's horror, not only does Dunwitty enthusiastically endorse the show, it also becomes hugely successful. As soon as the show premieres, Manray and Womack become big stars, while Delacroix, contrary to his original stated intent, defends the show as being satirical. Delacroix quickly embraces the show, his newfound fame and awards while Hopkins becomes horrified at the racist nightmare she has helped to unleash. Meanwhile, an underground, militant rap group called the Mau Maus, led by Hopkins' older brother Julius, becomes increasingly angry at the content of the show.

The Premise: The stated premise is a cruise plan to sail from Solomon (likely Solomon's Island, located in Maryland) to Maryland, and then up to Philadelphia this summer. The details provided in the premise suggest that the main focus of this summer's plan is a sailing trip along the East Coast of the United States.

In this case, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise discusses a plan to go on a sailing cruise from one particular location to another, while the hypothesis involves an unrelated activity - camping in the woods. The two plans could potentially be part of a more extensive summer vacation plan that includes both sailing and camping.

The year 1960 marked another turning point in Shostakovich's life: he joined the Communist Party. The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union's artists. This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears, and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed. Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal. From 1962, he served as a delegate in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Once he joined the Party, several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name. In joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called \\"The Year 1917.\\" Around this time, his health began to deteriorate. Shostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece \\"To the victims of fascism and war\\", ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram. Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman, \\"I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself.\\"...

The weaving of such carpets originated in the nomadic cultures of central Asia (carpets being an easily transportable form of furnishing), and was eventually spread to the settled societies of Anatolia.

Is the Illuminati card game still popular? Answer. no What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","output":"The Illuminati card game, created in 1982 by Steve Jackson and released by Steve Jackson Games, has seen a significant decline in popularity over the years. Though it still has a dedicated fan base, it is not considered popular or mainstream in comparison to other contemporary card games. Here are some step-by-step reasons that justify this answer: 1. Age and competition: Considering the game's age, it is natural for newer and more advanced card games to take the spotlight. The market for tabletop games, especially collectible card games (CCGs), has drastically expanded, introducing games such as Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon, and Yu-Gi-Oh! These games have attracted a majority of the card game community, leaving older games like the Illuminati card game to experience a decline in popularity. 2. Limited marketing and retail availability: The Illuminati card game's marketing has been minimal compared to other established card games that have consistent updates, expansions, and promotional events. Furthermore, the game is not as readily available in local game stores or online platforms. It has become a niche product for collectors and enthusiasts, rather than a popular game played by a broad audience. 3. Changes in gaming trends: The gaming world has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with the rise of video games, mobile gaming, and online communities. Many players now prefer digital experiences or games with online playability, which the Illuminati card game does not offer. As a result, the Illuminati card game has become less relevant and unable to compete with the newer games that cater to these trends. 4. Controversial themes: The Illuminati card game's controversial content and conspiracy-themed gameplay might also contribute to its decline in popularity. The game is based on secret societies and world domination, and it includes some provocative cards that could make it polarizing and less appealing to a broader audience. While the Illuminati card game might still retain its appeal for collectors, enthusiasts, and those interested in its themes, it has not maintained significant popularity or mainstream attention in comparison to the wide array of modern card games."},{"instruction":"we advised ian fleming publications on the exploitation of their ip rights for their james bond novels, which included advice on film publication rights and publishing rights.

To better understand the translation, here is a breakdown of the sentence: - \\"Cu toate acestea\\" is translated to \\"However\\" and is used to introduce a contrasting or qualifying statement. - \\"noi\\" means \\"we\\" and refers to the people who are awaiting the decisions. - \\"aşteptăm\\" is the verb \\"to wait\\" or \\"to await\\" in English.

Both are folk song artists, whose latest gig at a small music club fails to impress the owner and draw a crowd. The owner fires them and declares that since everyone seems to prefer 'rock and roll' and 'disco dancing,' he's decided to turn his place into a Rock Club.Dan and Jan then find themselves on the street with little money. Dan takes his guitar to a pawn shop to get money for food, leaving Jan alone in the woods. As she sits there, she laments how she'd give anything to be a rock star, feeling that if she was one, people would listen to her music.Suddenly, the Earth shakes, and in a puff of smoke, a large, red-skinned creature appears, clad in a white suit. He presents Jan with his card, which claims him to be B.L. Zebub, the head of 'Devil May Care Productions.' B.L. then introduces his assistant, Wheez Weasel, who shows Jan a contract. However, the enormous amount of paperwork leaves Jan's head spinning, and she decides to sign without having thoroughly read the paperwork.

Options: (A) 39/40 (B) 49/50 (C) 59/60 (D) 9/10 (E) 14/15","output":"To find the probability that an archer hits the bullseye at least once from the three given distances, it is easier to calculate the complementary probability, i.e., the probability that she misses the bullseye from all three distances. Then we subtract it from 1 to get the probability of hitting the bullseye at least once. First, let's find the probabilities of her missing the bullseye at each distance: - Missing at 40 yards: 1 - 4/5 = 1/5 - Missing at 50 yards: 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 - Missing at 60 yards: 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 Now, we need to find the combined probability that she misses all three targets: 1/5 * 1/4 * 1/3 Multiplying the fractions: = (1 * 1 * 1) / (5 * 4 * 3) = 1 / 60 Now we'll subtract this probability from 1 to get the probability that she hits the bullseye at least once: 1 - 1/60 = 59/60 So the probability of hitting the bullseye at least once in three shots, one from each distance, is 59/60, which is option (C)."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

(Associated Press) Afghan forces gather during clashes with Taliban fighters in Kandahar, southern Kabul, Afghanistan, Sunday, June 15, 2014. In the southern Kandahar province police said they raided a building on Sunday... (Associated Press) The Taliban had warned people not to participate in Saturday's vote. The two candidates, former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah and former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, have both vowed to improve ties with the West and sign a long-delayed security pact allowing nearly 10,000 U.S. troops to remain in the country for two more years. Afghanistan was relatively quiet the day after the second round of voting as the process of counting the votes began. Official preliminary results were to be announced on July 2, with final results released on July 22. The commission plans to release partial results in the coming weeks. The voting was relatively peaceful despite a series of rocket barrages and other scattered attacks that Interior Minister Mohammad Umar Daudzai said killed 47 people, including 20 civilians and an election commission worker. He said 60 militants were killed. Later on Saturday a minibus hit an improvised explosive device in the northern Samangan province, with the blast killing six women, one child and four men in the provincial capital Aybak, said Sediq Azizi, spokesman for the provincial governor. Azizi said four of the victims were employees of the election commission, which organized Saturday's vote. It was not immediately clear if they were the target of the explosion. In a separate incident, the Taliban cut off the index fingers of 11 civilians on Saturday in western Herat province to punish them for voting, police spokesman Raoud Ahamdi said. The United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan condemned the mutilations in Herat. \\"Like millions of their countrymen and women, these ordinary Afghans were exercising their fundamental right to determine the future path of their country through voting and not through violence and intimidation. By their vote, they already defeated those who promote terror and violence,\\" said Jan Kubis, the U.N. special representative. In the southern Kandahar province police said they raided a building on Sunday that had been occupied by the Taliban the day before, setting off clashes in which police shot dead two would-be suicide bombers but were unable to prevent another two from blowing themselves up, killing three policemen and wounding another two. Gen. Abdul Razeq Achakzai, Kandahar's provincial police chief, said his forces had surrounded the building on Saturday but waited to move in until after the voting ended. Afghans braved threats of violence and searing heat Saturday to vote in the presidential runoff, which likely will mark the country's first peaceful transfer of authority, an important step toward democracy as foreign combat troops leave. Abdullah, who emerged as the front-runner with 45 percent of the vote in the first round, faced Ahmadzai, an ex-World Bank official. Neither garnered the majority needed to win outright, but previous candidates and their supporters have since offered endorsements to each, making the final outcome unpredictable. The Independent Election Commission said initial estimates showed that more than seven million Afghans voted Saturday, or about 60 percent of the country's 12 million eligible voters. The first round on April 5 saw a similar turnout. The Electoral Complaint Commission has started processing complaints and will continue to do so through the end of the day Monday when the deadline expires, spokesman Nadir Mohsini said. ___ Associated Press reporter Mirwais Khan in Kandahar, Afghanistan contributed to this report. ||||| Image caption People who voted had their index fingers dipped in ink to prevent them from voting again Taliban insurgents cut the index fingers off 11 Afghans who participated in this weekend's presidential run-off poll, officials say.

Let's reason step-by-step:","output":"To answer the question \\"Neurons are the structural and functional units of where what is critical?\\", let's go through each option step-by-step and evaluate their relevance to neurons: (A) organs - Neurons are not specifically related to organs, as they are primarily components of the nervous system, not individual organs. (B) Glial cells - Glial cells are supportive cells in the nervous system, but they are separate from neurons. So, this doesn't fit the question. (C) nerves - Neurons make up the structure and function of nerves in the nervous system. This option seems like a good fit as neurons are critical to the function of nerves. (D) Structural units - This option is too vague as it doesn't provide a context for neurons. (E) voltage - While neurons do use changes in voltage to propagate electrical signals, the question does not ask specifically about the electrical properties of neurons. (F) Storage units - Although neurons are involved in memory storage, this option is too narrow to encompass the overall role of neurons as the structural and functional units. (G) Critical care - This option doesn't seem relevant to the role of neurons as structural and functional units. (H) A computer - Neurons are not related to computers and are not the structural or functional units of a computer.

A third ward was created during Edward I's extension to the Tower, as the narrow enclosure completely surrounded the castle. At the same time a bastion known as Legge's Mount was built at the castle's north-west corner. Brass Mount, the bastion in the north-east corner, was a later addition. The three rectangular towers along the east wall 15 metres (49 ft) apart were dismantled in 1843. Although the bastions have often been ascribed to the Tudor period, there is no evidence to support this; archaeological investigations suggest that Legge's Mount dates from the reign of Edward I. Blocked battlements (also known as crenellations) in the south side of Legge's Mount are the only surviving medieval battlements at the Tower of London (the rest are Victorian replacements). A new 50-metre (160 ft) moat was dug beyond the castle's new limits; it was originally 4.5 metres (15 ft) deeper in the middle than it is today. With the addition of a new curtain wall, the old main entrance to the Tower of London was obscured and made redundant; a new entrance was created in the south-west corner of the external wall circuit. The complex consisted of an inner and an outer gatehouse and a barbican, which became known as the Lion Tower as it was associated with the animals as part of the Royal Menagerie since at least the 1330s. The Lion Tower itself no longer survives. Edward extended the south side of the Tower of London onto land that had previously been submerged by the River Thames. In this wall, he built St Thomas's Tower between 1275 and 1279; later known as Traitors' Gate, it replaced the Bloody Tower as the castle's water-gate. The building is unique in England, and the closest parallel is the now demolished water-gate at the Louvre in Paris. The dock was covered with arrowslits in case of an attack on the castle from the River; there was also a portcullis at the entrance to control who entered. There were luxurious lodgings on the first floor. Edward also moved the Royal Mint into the Tower; its exact location early on...

Have you ever wanted to play a card game with your family or friends? Today, I am going to teach you a super-simple card game that you can enjoy with anyone. Let's get started! Step 1: Learning the Hand Rankings First, you need to know which card combinations are the best. These combinations are called \\"hand rankings.\\" For our simple game, we will use these hand rankings: 1. Pair - Two cards with the same number or letter (like two 3s or two Kings) 2. High Card - The card with the highest number/letter if nobody has a pair Step 2: Agree on the Rules of Play Before starting the game, make sure you and your friends understand the rules and agree to them. This will make the game more enjoyable and fair. Step 3: Deal One Card to Each Player Now, you're ready to begin! Sit in a circle with your friends. Choose one person to be the dealer. The dealer will give one card to each player, including themselves. Step 4: Starting the Betting The player to the left of the dealer starts by deciding if they want to bet. Betting is like saying, \\"I think my card is the best!\\" If they want to bet, they can place something small, like a candy or a chip, in the middle of the circle. This starts the \\"pot.\\" Step 5: Play Continues Clockwise Now, the next player has to decide if they want to \\"call\\" (match the bet) or \\"fold\\" (give up their chance to win). If they call, they add the same amount to the pot. If they fold, they cannot win this round. This continues until everyone has had a turn. Step 6: Deal a Second Card Once everyone has made their decision, the dealer gives each player another card. Step 7: Bet Again Just like before, the first player to the left of the dealer can decide to bet. Then, everyone else can call, raise, or fold, going around the circle. Step 8: Deal a Third Card Then, the dealer deals one more card to each player. Step 9: Repeat the Betting Now, the players bet one more time using their three cards, like before. Step 10: Reveal All Hands Once all the betting is finished, players show their cards. Remember the hand rankings? Here's where you'll use them. Players compare their hands to see who wins. Step 11: The Winner Takes the Pot The player with the best hand ranking wins and takes all the goodies in the pot! Step 12: Rotate Dealers and Play Another Round After that exciting round, now it's time to give someone else a chance to be the dealer. The dealer role moves to the left. Keep playing rounds like this until you all decide to stop. And that's it! This simple and fun card game is an excellent way to spend time with your friends and family. Remember, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy yourself!

It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you.

Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s lawyer said on Thursday he would try to stop publication of a book that portrays an inept president in a fumbling White House and threatened legal action against former top aide Steve Bannon over “defamatory” comments in the book. Harder also told Reuters “legal action is imminent” against Bannon . Trump cut ties with Bannon on Wednesday saying his former adviser had “lost his mind ” in a blistering statement issued after comments attributed to Bannon in the book were made public. Trump lawyers sent a cease-and-desist letter to Bannon on Wednesday asking him not to disclose any confidential information. They said Bannon had breached an agreement by communicating with Wolff about Trump his family and the campaign and made “disparaging statements and in some cases outright defamatory statements” about them. In the book Bannon was quoted as describing a June 2016 meeting with a group of Russians at Trump Tower in New York as “treasonous” and “unpatriotic.” The meeting held after the Russians promised damaging information on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was attended by Donald Trump Jr. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort who was Trump’s campaign manager at the time. Trump’s statement also diminished Bannon ’s role in the election victory and accused him of leaking to the media. Before joining the campaign Bannon had headed conservative Breitbart News website and he proved to be a divisive figure in the White House. He returned to Breitbart after being fired although he reportedly continued to talk with Trump.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo Bannon ’s reaction to the book controversy has been muted. In interviews with Breitbart News after the news broke he called Trump a “great man” and pledged continued support for his agenda. Bradley Moss a Washington lawyer specializing in national security law said any non-disclosure agreement would not apply to Bannon once he became a government employee. The government has far less power to limit speech by employees than private companies Moss said. A lawsuit could hurt Trump because Bannon ’s lawyers would be entitled to interview White House officials and collect potentially damaging documents from them in his defense Moss said. On Thursday the White House said no personal devices including cellphones would be allowed in the West Wing beginning next week for security purposes. The moves followed the Bannon split but had been considered for some time.

A firefighter is shown walking on a tight rope in his gear very slowly. he Answer:","output":"(III). moves along the rope towards the end and walks back to the start until he fails. What most naturally follows after the description of the firefighter walking on a tightrope in his gear very slowly is the action of him moving along the rope towards the end and walking back to the start until he fails. This further illustrates his dedication and practice in improving skills that will be useful for his profession or simply for personal enjoyment. Additionally, this option continues the narrative of the firefighter's journey on the tightrope and creates a sense of suspense and tension, as the audience anticipates whether he will successfully navigate the tightrope or fall as a result of fatigue or error. Option (I) might be considered a starting point of the story, rather than a natural continuation of the scene described, as it involves the firefighter initially picking up the rope and getting on the tightrope. In contrast, options (II) and (IV) introduce new elements and aspects (different animals and using the rope at higher heights) that seem like they could be separate events or challenges rather than a direct continuation of the initial scenario. The chosen answer, option (III), helps to showcase the firefighter's determination to continuously improve his skills and abilities on the tightrope. The image of him walking back and forth, potentially experiencing failure, adds a human touch to the story – emphasizing the resilience that is often associated with people in high-pressure professions such as firefighting. Furthermore, it allows the audience to engage with the scene by following the firefighter's progress along the rope, making them feel invested in his success or failure."},{"instruction":"Here is a premise: uh-huh i think they're made out of aluminum Here is a hypothesis: They're soda cans.

Premise: Uh-huh, I think they're made out of aluminum. This premise suggests that the objects in question are made of aluminum, but it does not provide any further details about the objects themselves. Hypothesis: They're soda cans. Soda cans are commonly made out of aluminum, as it is lightweight and easily recyclable. Thus, this hypothesis is reasonable based on the premise provided. However, it does not prove definitively that the objects in question are soda cans. There are several other products and objects that can be made from aluminum, ranging from automotive parts to cookware and packaging materials. Since the premise only specifies that the objects are made of aluminum, without any other details to narrow down the possibilities, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis must be true. Considering the connection between aluminum and soda cans, it is entirely possible that the objects in question could indeed be soda cans. However, without further observational evidence or information, the connection between the premise and the hypothesis is essentially an educated guess rather than a solid conclusion. To reach a more definitive conclusion, additional context and details about the objects would be necessary to eliminate other plausible alternatives, such as the possibility that the aluminum constructs are parts of an airplane, electronics case, or some other application of aluminum."},{"instruction":"Larry Jeff McMurtry, is an American novelist, essayist, bookseller, and screenwriter whose work is predominantly set in either the old West or in contemporary Texas, McMurtry and cowriter Diana Ossana adapted the screenplay for which 2005 American neo-western romantic drama film directed by Ang Lee and produced by Diana Ossana and James Schamus?

Yes or no? Answer: For example, the penis of a mammal is at most analogous to the penis of a male insect or barnacle . Question: what are penises made out of Answer:","output":"Penises, like other body parts, are composed of various types of tissues, blood vessels, and muscles. In most mammals, including humans, the penis serves as both a reproductive organ and a means for the expulsion of urine. Though the overall purpose and function of penises may be similar across various species, their anatomical structures may display variations. For example, as you mentioned, the penis of a mammal may be analogous to the penis of a male insect or barnacle in terms of their reproductive role, but their structure, composition, and formation may vary significantly. The main components of the human penis include: 1. Corpora Cavernosa: These are two sponge-like cylindrical tissues that extend along the length of the penis. They are composed of smooth muscle fibers, connective tissue, and sinusoidal spaces that fill with blood during erection. The corpora cavernosa tissues aid in determining the size and rigidity of the penis during erection. 2. Corpus Spongiosum: This is another sponge-like tissue, but it is smaller and runs along the underside of the penis, surrounding the urethra. The corpus spongiosum has a similar composition to the corpora cavernosa, containing smooth muscle fibers, connective tissue, and sinusoidal spaces. Its primary function is to prevent the urethra from being compressed during erection, allowing for the passage of semen and urine. 3. Tunica Albuginea: A thin, fibrous sheath encompassing the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum. It is comprised of a dense network of collagen fibers, which help maintain the shape and rigidity of the penis during erection. The tunica albuginea plays a crucial role in the penile erection mechanism by compressing the veins and restricting blood outflow, thus maintaining an erect state. 4. Blood Vessels and Nerves: The penis is rich in blood vessels and nerves that facilitate its various functions. Arteries and veins transport blood to and from the erectile tissues, providing essential nutrients and oxygen to the cells. Nerves are responsible for transmitting sensory information to the brain during sexual activity and communicating the brain's response to trigger erections. 5. Skin and Fascia: The outermost layer of the penis consists of skin and a loose connective tissue known as the fascia. This sheath-like structure permits flexibility, free movement, and accommodates changes in penile size during erections. Moreover, the skin of the penis contains nerve endings that provide sensory feedback during sexual activity. In conclusion, penises are made up of an intricate combination of tissues, blood vessels, and muscles designed to fulfill both reproductive and urinary functions. While there are similarities in the core functions of penises across different species, the specific structure, composition, and formation may differ significantly, as observed in the comparisons between mammalian and insect penises."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Process: - You breathe in - Air goes through all the little branches in your lungs to fill up the air sacs, or alveoli - Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries - The oxygen goes into the bloodstream - Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up - You breathe it out through your lungs - Question: suppose less air is breathed in happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If less air is breathed in, it will lead to a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. This is because the process of respiration and oxygen delivery depends on the quantity and concentration of inhaled air. The decline in available oxygen signifies a reduced supply for the body's tissues and organs, potentially leading to inadequate oxygenation. The supposed perturbation, being less inhaled air, influences the second effect mentioned, which is the passage of oxygen through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries. With a smaller volume of air having less oxygen entering the alveoli, the concentration of oxygen available for diffusion into the capillaries also decreases. Consequently, less oxygen makes its way into the bloodstream, and the overall oxygen delivery to the body's tissues becomes compromised. The effect on the second step mentioned (oxygen going through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries) is therefore \\"less.\\" This situation can cause additional implications if sustained over time, such as increased fatigue, shortness of breath, and a decreased ability to perform physical activities. In extreme cases, it may lead to hypoxia, a condition where the body's cells and tissues are deprived of adequate oxygen supply. To mitigate the adverse effects of this perturbation, it is essential to identify and address the cause of reduced air intake, which may involve seeking medical attention, improving one's respiratory health, or making changes to one's environment to increase the availability of fresh, oxygen-rich air."},{"instruction":"Which of these sentences doesn't make sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"Making money is hardwork for any human.\\" - Sentence B: \\"Making money is silly for any human.\\" Hmmm, let me think.

Here's a detailed explanation of why: - Sentence A: \\"Making money is hard work for any human.\\" This statement makes sense because it implies that earning a living or accumulating wealth typically requires a lot of effort, dedication, and time. The process of making money can indeed be challenging for many people due to factors such as competition, skill development, and resource allocation. So, this sentence is logical and can be understood easily in the context of personal finance and professional development. - Sentence B: \\"Making money is silly for any human.\\" This statement doesn't make sense because it implies that the act of making money is ridiculous or foolish for anyone. Since making money is a fundamental part of most people's lives and necessary for survival, the statement contradicts the general understanding of the importance of financial stability and sustenance. Additionally, it doesn't acknowledge that people have different levels of skills and resources available to create income. As a result, this sentence lacks clarity regarding the purpose or intent behind it. In conclusion, Sentence B appears to be the one that doesn't make sense when considering the generally accepted notions about earning money and its role in people's lives."},{"instruction":"Ludendorff was born on 9 April 1865 in Kruszewnia near Posen, Province of Posen, Kingdom of Prussia (now Poznan County, Poland), the third of six children of August Wilhelm Ludendorff (1833-1905). His father was descended from Pomeranian merchants who had achieved the prestigious status of Junker. Erich's mother, Klara Jeanette Henriette von Tempelhoff (1840-1914), was the daughter of the noble but impoverished Friedrich August Napoleon von Tempelhoff (1804-1868) and his wife Jeannette Wilhelmine von Dziembowska (1816-1854), who came from a Germanized Polish landed family on the side of her father Stephan von Dziembowski (1779-1859). Through Dziembowski's wife Johanna Wilhelmine von Unruh (1793-1862), Erich was a remote descendant of the Counts of Donhoff, the Dukes of Duchy of Liegnitz and Duchy of Brieg and the Marquesses and Electors of Brandenburg. In the West in 1916 the Germans attacked unsuccessfully at Verdun and soon were reeling under British and French blows along the Somme. Ludendorff's friends at OHL, led by Max Bauer, lobbied for him relentlessly. The balance was tipped when Romania entered the war, thrusting into Hungary. Falkenhayn was replaced as Chief of the General Staff by Field Marshal Hindenburg on 29 August 1916. Ludendorff was his chief of staff as first Quartermaster general, with the stipulation that he would have joint responsibility. He was promoted to General of the Infantry. Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg warned the War Cabinet: \\"You don't know Ludendorff, who is only great at a time of success. If things go badly he loses his nerve.\\" Their first concern was the sizable Romanian Army, so troops sent from the Western Front checked Romanian and Russian incursions into Hungary. Then Romania was invaded from the south by German, Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian, and Ottoman troops commanded by August von Mackensen and from the north by a German and Austro-Hungarian army commanded by Falkenhayn. Bucharest fell in December 1916. According to Mackensen, Ludendorff's distant management consisted of \\"floods of telegrams, as superfluous as they were offensive.\\" When sure that the Romanians would be defeated OHL moved west, retaining the previous staff except for the operations officer, blamed for Verdun. They toured the Western Front meeting --and evaluating-- commanders, learning about their problems and soliciting their opinions. At each meeting Ludendorff did most of the commander's talking. There would be no further attacks at Verdun and the Somme would be defended by revised tactics that exposed fewer men to British shells. A new backup defensive line would be built, like the one they had constructed in the east. The Allies called the new fortifications the Hindenburg Line.

The green jersey is a distinctive racing jersey worn by the leader in a subsidiary competition. - The Tour de France is an annual multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France, while also occasionally making passes through nearby countries. The race was first organized in 1903 to increase sales for the newspaper \\"L'Auto\\"; which is currently run by the Amaury Sport Organisation. The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1903 except when it was stopped for the two World Wars. As the Tour gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened and its reach began to extend around the globe. Participation expanded from a primarily French field, as riders from all over the world began to participate in the race each year. The Tour is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI WorldTeams, with the exception of the teams that the organizers invite. - The Great Dividing Range, or the Eastern Highlands, is Australia's most substantial mountain range and the third longest land-based range in the world. The range stretches more than from Dauan Island off the northeastern tip of Queensland, running the entire length of the eastern coastline through New South Wales, then into Victoria and turning west, before finally fading into the central plain at the Grampians in western Victoria. The width of the range varies from about to over . - The Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) is part of the French media group, EPA (Éditions Philippe Amaury). It organises sporting events including the Tour de France, Vuelta a España and ParisNice professional cycle road races, and the Dakar Rally. In 2008 it began the Central Europe Rally, a rally raid endurance race in Romania and Hungary. - The points classification is a secondary competition in the Tour de France, that started in 1953. Points are given for high finishes in a stage and for winning intermediate sprints, and these are recorded in a points classification. It is considered a sprinters' competition. The leader is indicated by a green jersey which has become a symbol for the points classification in the sense that when a cyclist wins the points classification. - Robbie McEwen ( born 24 June 1972 in Brisbane , Queensland ) is an Australian former professional road bicycle racer . He last rode for Orica - GreenEDGE on the UCI World Tour , . As a triple winner of the Points classification in the Tour de France , at his peak he was arguably the fastest sprinter in the world . A former Australian BMX champion , McEwen switched to road racing in 1990 at 18 . He raced as a professional from 1996 until 2012 . McEwen lives in Australia with his Belgian wife Angélique Pattyn , his son Ewan , and his daughters Elena and Claudia . In 2011 he published an autobiography , One Way Road . McEwen lived a long time in the Belgian town of Everbeek and is fluent in Dutch . He retired from the World Tour after riding the 2012 Tour of California . - The UCI ProTour was a series of road bicycle races in Europe, Australia and Canada organised by the UCI (International Cycling Union). Created by Hein Verbruggen, former president of the UCI, it comprises a number of 'ProTour' cycling teams, each of whom are required to compete in every round of the series. It was initially the basis of a season long competition for rankings points, created for 2005 to replace the UCI Road World Cup series, which ended at the end of the 2004 season (although the World Cup did not include any stage races). The ProTour was the subject of continuing disputes involving the UCI, cycling teams, and the organizers of the world's most prominent bicycle races (most notably, the Grand Tours), and in 2009 and 2010 the ranking element of the ProTour was superseded by the UCI World Ranking. For 2011, the ProTour and World Ranking were fully merged into the UCI World Tour. ProTour status for teams relabelled UCI ProTeams will continue as the highest level of registration, and will carry the right and obligation to participate in all World Tour races. - The UCI World Tour (20092010: \\"UCI World Ranking\\") is the premier annual male elite road cycling tour. It refers to both the tour of 28 events and an annual ranking system based upon performances in these. The World Ranking was launched in 2009, and merged fully with its predecessor the UCI ProTour in 2011. - Brisbane is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Queensland, and the third most populous city in Australia. Brisbane's metropolitan area has a population of 2.3 million, and the South East Queensland urban conurbation, centred on Brisbane, encompasses a population of more than 3.4 million. The Brisbane central business district stands on the original European settlement and is situated inside a bend of the Brisbane River, about from its mouth at Moreton Bay. The metropolitan area extends in all directions along the floodplain of the Brisbane River Valley between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range, sprawling across several of Australia's most populous local government areas (LGAs), most centrally the City of Brisbane, which is by far the most populous LGA in the nation. The demonym of Brisbane is Brisbanite. - The points classification is a secondary award category in road bicycle racing. Points are given for high finishes and, in some cases, for winning sprints at certain places along the route, most often called \\"intermediate sprints\\". The points classification is the top prize for many cycling sprinters and is often known as the sprint classification; however, in some stage races these classifications are based on different criteria. What is the relationship between 'robbie mcewen' and 'road bicycle racing'? Answer:","output":"Robbie McEwen has a profound connection with road bicycle racing. He is an Australian former professional road bicycle racer who had a prolific career competing in some of the most prestigious cycling events globally, including the Tour de France. Robbie McEwen was born on June 24, 1972, in Brisbane, Queensland, and his journey into cycling began with his involvement in BMX racing where he was a champion before switching to road racing in 1990 at the age of 18. He turned professional in 1996 and continued his professional racing career until 2012. One of Robbie McEwen's signature triumphs in road bicycle racing was his triple victory in the Points classification at the Tour de France. The Point classification, symbolized by the green jersey, is a significant part of the Tour de France and other Grand Tour stage races. It is a secondary competition within the race where points are given for high finishes in a stage and for winning intermediate sprints. This competition is particularly suited to sprinters, and hence McEwen's repeated victories in this classification underlined his reputation as one of the fastest sprinters in the world during his prime. McEwen competed in the most elite circuit of road bike racing. This included the UCI ProTour, a series of road bicycle races organised by the International Cycling Union (UCI), which later merged into the UCI World Tour. McEwen's team, the Orica - GreenEdge, was a part of the UCI World Tour, which attests to the level of competition that McEwen was up against. Despite retiring from the World Tour after competing in the 2012 Tour of California, McEwen has remained connected to the sport. His experiences and achievements have made him a renowned figure in the field of road bicycle racing. In summary, Robbie McEwen's relationship with road bicycle racing is extensive, from being a competitor at the highest levels of the sport, excelling particularly in sprint finishes, to being a celebrated figure within the sport even post-retirement. His accomplishments have solidified his status as one of the leading figures in the road bicycle racing domain. He represents a bridge between the sport's competitive aspects and its broader cultural and institutional structures, including its most significant competitions like the Tour de France and organisations like the UCI."},{"instruction":"This is the content of an email: Molly and I discovered that CES has about 1400 dt of Texas Gas Zone SL to Z4 capacity each month.

Picture this setting: a verdant, idyllic countryside, an undulating landscape the eye cannot tire of beholding. The distinctive feature of this landscape is its slopes, transitioning from gentle inclines to steeper drops, painting a dynamic contrast of earth and sky. The rich, green grasses sway in the cool wind, making these slopes appear like waves in an earthy ocean. The slopes aren't barren — they are home to life. Upon these very slopes, in the loving care of the day's light, we find a flock of sheep, scattered yet unified, grazing calmly. In its most elementary understanding, a flock refers to a gathering of sheep that live together and follow a single leader. This form of grouping is characteristic of sheep, a trait molded by evolution and necessity. The flock of sheep on the slope is picture-perfect, capturing a living, breathing postcard moment. The sheep graze, their woolly figures speckling the vibrant green canvas of the slope like impromptu splashes of white paint - a mobile, soft contrast to the solid and robust nature of the land underneath. The flock's manner of moving might seem random to a casual observer, but it follows a subtle order—each sheep is conscious of the others' positions, and there's a quick repositioning if one strays too far. The reasons behind this collective behaviour are rooted in safety and social structure. Living as a flock allows the sheep to detect predators with more efficiency and stave off attacks as a unified front. Besides, the close-knit gathering facilitates simple social interactions and heat conservation in the colder months. On the slope, this communal gathering is also beneficial for grazing. As the flock moves, they expose new patches of grass, ensuring that the land's resources are evenly utilized rather than exhausted in one spot. This movement also aides in natural fertilization of the land, ensuring a constant cycle of growth which sustains not just this flock, but the ecosystem of the slope in its entirety. Incorporating these concepts of a flock, sheep, and a slope, we can conjecture a simple yet encompassing sentence: \\"The flock of sheep grazed freely, their white forms dotting the lush green slopes; these sheep moved, lived, and survived together, their collective existence painting a picture of unity and harmony on the canvas of the idyllic landscape.\\""},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Upgrades included rheostatic brakes and new brakes , electromagnetic speed measurement and curve lighting . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","output":"While these two sentences convey similar information, they do have slight differences in meaning and structure. Let's carefully analyze each sentence to better understand their meanings: 1. Upgrades included rheostatic brakes and electromagnetic brakes, new speed measurement and curve lights. This sentence implies that the following upgrades were made: - Rheostatic brakes: These are a type of braking system that uses electrical resistance to control the braking force. - Electromagnetic brakes: These brakes use electromagnetic force to apply friction and stop the vehicle. - New speed measurement: This phrase suggests that an improved or updated method or system for measuring speed was added. - Curve lights: Also known as adaptive headlights, these lights automatically adjust to different road and weather conditions, providing better visibility around curves. 2. Upgrades included rheostatic brakes and new brakes, electromagnetic speed measurement and curve lighting. This sentence describes the upgrades as such: - Rheostatic brakes and new brakes: This part suggests that rheostatic brakes were installed, along with some other unspecified new brakes. - Electromagnetic speed measurement: The phrase implies an updated speed measurement system that uses electromagnetic technology, possibly to more accurately or efficiently measure speed. - Curve lighting: Similar to curve lights mentioned in the first sentence, curve lighting refers to an adaptive lighting system that enhances visibility while driving around curved roads. In conclusion, the two sentences do not mean exactly the same thing. While they both discuss upgrading brakes and incorporating speed measurement and curve lighting systems, the first sentence explicitly mentions that electromagnetic brakes were installed. In contrast, the second sentence ambiguously states that new brakes were added alongside rheostatic brakes. Additionally, the second sentence introduces electromagnetic speed measurement, which is not mentioned in the first sentence."},{"instruction":"Answer the question below: Mona is sitting at the beach watching the waves.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is less pressure in the magma chambers happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen being brought to the body's cells. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the supposed perturbation does not have a direct effect on the process of oxygen transportation in the body. Justification: The process of oxygen transportation in the body is a biological process that takes place within the circulatory and respiratory systems of the body. This process involves the intake of oxygen through the lungs, its diffusion into the blood via the alveoli, and the transport of oxygen through the bloodstream by red blood cells to various cells in the body. The pressure in magma chambers pertains to geological activity, which primarily affects the earth's crust. This change would have no direct impact on the internal biological processes of a human body such as oxygen transportation. Indirectly, if this perturbation somehow altered the atmospheric composition or pressure, it might impact the amount of oxygen available for the lungs to intake. However, the scenario stated does not involve such conditions, so we can conclude that it does not affect the oxygen transport process in the body. Also, it is important to consider that the body has many regulatory mechanisms to maintain homeostasis. Any minor disruptions to oxygen levels are usually corrected by these mechanisms unless the disruption is too severe or long-lasting. In this case, the perturbation mentioned wouldn't be sufficient or relevant to overpower these regulatory mechanisms. As a result, we do not foresee any significant impact on the rate of oxygen being brought to the body's cells. So in conclusion, the pressure in the magma chambers would not affect the process of oxygen transportation within the body either directly or indirectly."},{"instruction":"Information: - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America.

He has always been outwitted by the animals in Peaceful Woods, especially Bugs Bunny, a clever and mischievous rabbit who is loved by all his fellow woodland creatures. Bugs has managed to outsmart Elmer multiple times by evading his hunting attempts and playing practical jokes on him. In turn, Elmer is determined to capture Bugs and prove his own intelligence to the village. One morning, Elmer stumbles upon a dusty old book titled \\"The Ultimate Guide to Catching Woodland Creatures.\\" Intrigued, he reads about a rare breed of fish that is attracted to carrots. The book tells of a legend that the fish will grant any wish in exchange for their release. Seeing this as an opportunity to finally catch Bugs, Elmer decides to catch the carrot-loving fish and wish for Bugs to be in his grasp. He sets off with his fishing gear and a bag of carrots, making his way to the mystical lake where the rare fish is believed to dwell. Along the way, he encounters other animals from Peaceful Woods, who hear about his plan and warn Bugs of Elmer's intentions. Bugs, unfazed by the threat, decides to come up with a plan to outsmart Elmer yet again. He recruits his friends to help him: Daffy Duck, a sarcastic and intelligent duck, and Lola Bunny, Bugs' fearless and quick-witted love interest.

Bugs, however, shows Elmer mercy by inviting him to a village picnic, where the woodland creatures and Elmer celebrate their friendship and shared love for the environment. The story ends with the heartfelt message that love, friendship, and harmony can overcome even the most determined adversaries. The villagers of Peaceful Woods learn the importance of compassion, teamwork, and accepting others, despite their differences. And Elmer learns that there's more to life than just trying to outsmart a certain rascally rabbit."},{"instruction":"Article: Long queues at cinemas buying hot tickets for blockbusters will become rare as Beijing residents will be able to order film tickets via cell phone networks in a month.

(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP) (Associated Press) NEW YORK (AP) — With most of music industry's top acts absent, the two-hour MTV Video Music Awards lacked star power and felt flat — and it was up to a pop veteran to bring the house down. Jennifer Lopez, who earned the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award for lifetime achievement, provided the night's most energetic performance as she gave a lengthy performance of her hit songs. She started off slow — Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott's unamused faces perfectly captured the vibe — but she hit a strong stride when she sang old smashes like \\"Jenny from the Block,\\" ''I'm Real\\" — where Ja Rule joined her onstage — and \\"All I Have,\\" which showed the skilled dancer's vocal range. But Lopez's speech was more stirring than her powerful performance: She was emotional as she thanked her children and beau Alex Rodriguez onstage at Radio City Music Hall in New York. She was teary-eyed and looked at her \\"two little angels,\\" as she called them, and said, \\"I stand here stronger and better than ever ... so thank you Max and Emme.\\" She called Rodriguez, who filmed her performance with his phone, \\"my twin soul.\\" \\"My life is sweeter and better with you in it,\\" she said. While Lopez's speech went for the heart, Cardi B aimed for jokes. The rapper, in her well-known silly demeanor, \\"opened\\" the show — not with a performance, but with cute jokes. The new mom was onstage pretending to hold a baby, but she then revealed to the audience that it was actually a Moonman, which she won earlier in the night for song of the summer for her No. 1 hit, \\"I Like It,\\" with Bad Bunny and J Balvin. Cardi B was the top contender of the night with 10 nominations. She gave birth to Kulture Kiari Cephus last month and was up for video of the year with \\"Finesse,\\" her collaboration with Bruno Mars. The song's video, inspired by the 1990s sketch comedy series \\"In Living Color,\\" is also nominated for four other honors. For the top prize, Cardi B and Mars were competing with Childish Gambino's \\"This Is America,\\" Drake's \\"God's Plan,\\" Beyonce and Jay-Z's \\"Apes--t,\\" Camila Cabello's \\"Havana\\" and Ariana Grande's \\"No Tears Left to Cry.\\" But only Cardi B and Grande were on hand for the evening's festivities. Nicki Minaj won the first televised award — best hip hop — and checked comedian Tiffany Haddish for dissing girl group Fifth Harmony, now on hiatus. After congratulating ex-Fifth Harmony member Cabello on her five nominations, presenter Haddish said sarcastically, \\"Hi Fifth Harmony.\\" When Minaj accepted an award moments later, she looked to Haddish and said, \\"Don't be coming for Fifth Harmony because Normani is that (chick).\\" Normani currently has her first hit apart from the group with the Khalid-assisted \\"Love Lies.\\" Minaj, who has been a trending topic this week after she madly tweeted about why her new album debuted at No. 2 behind Travis Scott, also provided the first bleeped moment of the night when she told the audience to listen to her Apple Music radio show this week to hear \\"who the (expletive) of the day award is going to.\\" There was a political moment when Logic was joined onstage by young immigrants wearing T-shirts that read, \\"We are all human beings,\\" to protest the Trump administration's separation of migrant children from their parents after they illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border. The rapper, best known for the suicide prevention anthem \\"1-800-273-8255,\\" wore a T-shirt that read, \\"(Expletive) the wall.\\" Grande won best pop video and thanked her fiance Pete Davidson \\"for existing.\\" As for the top nominees, Beyonce and Jay-Z were behind Cardi B with eight bids for \\"Apesh--t,\\" filmed at the Louvre museum in Paris.

The household includes Frank, his wife Ethel, their three children â Reg, Vi and Queenie â his widowed sister Sylvia and Ethel's mother. Frank is delighted to discover that his next-door neighbour is Bob Mitchell, a friend from his days in the army. Frank finds employment in a travel agency run by another old army chum. As the children grow up and the country adapts to peacetime, the family attend a number of events, such as the British Empire Exhibition held at Wembley in 1924. Reg becomes friendly with Sam, a staunch socialist, who is attracted to Vi. Queenie is pursued by Bob's sailor son Billy, but she longs to escape the suburbs and lead a more glamorous life elsewhere. During the General Strike of 1926, Reg is injured in a brawl in Whitechapel Road. Vi blames Sam, who had brought her brother to the area, but eventually her anger dissipates and she marries him. In 1928, Charleston dance mania arrives in England; Queenie exhibits her fancy steps at the local dance hall and wins a dance contest. As all of London is swept up in the Jazz Age, news of new German chancellor Adolf Hitler begins to appear in the newspapers. Reg marries Phyllis. Billy proposes to Queenie, but she confesses she is in love with a married man and soon after runs off with him. Her mother says she cannot forgive her and never wants to see her again. As time passes, Aunt Sylvia discovers spiritualism, Reg and Phyllis are killed in a car crash, and the British Union of Fascists tries to stir up anti-Semitic sentiment in the city. Stanley Baldwin becomes Prime Minister, King George V dies, and Ethel's mother passes away. When Neville Chamberlain returns from Munich with the promise of \\"peace in our time\\", Frank is disgusted by people's enthusiastic response. Billy, home on leave from the Royal Navy and now a sub-lieutenant, announces to the family he ran into Queenie...

OPTIONS: [+] yes; [+] it is not possible to tell; [+] no;","output":"[+] yes; Based on the given premise, \\"A Dutch and British cemetery is to be found farther down the hill,\\" we can confidently conclude that it entails the hypothesis \\"Further down the hill, there is a Dutch and British cemetery.\\" Both the premise and the hypothesis convey the same information, but they are structured differently. The premise is expressed in the passive voice, while the hypothesis is in the active voice. The key elements in both sentences are the location (\\"further down the hill\\"), and the existence of a \\"Dutch and British cemetery.\\" Since the premise asserts that such a cemetery is located down the hill, it also inherently supports the same claim made by the hypothesis. The relationship between these two statements is an example of a semantic entailment. Semantic entailment is the idea that if one statement is true, another statement or a series of statements must also be true.

We at Technoholik got exclusive access to Aadhar's technology centre in Bangalore to figure out whats happening under the hood.The tech can broadly be divided into three areas ie. enrollment, data centre and authentication.The UIDAI will partner with a number of agencies ranging from district collectors' offices to banks as \\"enrollment partners\\" who will be tasked with collecting data.These partners will receive a slick-looking pair of tough briefcases containing neatly packed hardware required for enrollment. A laptop with the Aadhar enrollment software installed along with a fingerprint reader and an iris scanner go into one briefcase while a webcam, a laser printer (for the receipt) and a small monitor fit into the other one. That last bit of hardware is an innovative touch because it's meant purely for the person getting enrolled to verify that the data being entered into the laptop is accurate.While Aadhar may be collaborative in its approach to enrollment, it's taking no chances with its central servers and whats being stored in them. The data centres themselves will be built and maintained by vendors, but access will be strictly controlled solely by the UIDAI at multiple levels. No data can leave the enrollment laptops unencrypted and any attempt to tamper or modify the data will raise an alarm when it is uploaded to the central server. Only once it is validated as being secure will it be accepted for further processing.Then comes the tricky part called \\"de-duplication\\" ie. checking to see if the person has not already enrolled which means comparing his biometric data (iris and ten fingerprints) to that of all the existing IDs. This will require enormous computing power and although Aadhar will have a large \\"grid\\" of networked computers, built using open-source technologies to do these \\"compute jobs\\" , building this grid as the volume grows will be the challenge.Complex algorithms to quickly compare biometrics have also been procured from specialist vendors to be run on this grid. \\"It has never been tried before, so it's the first time and Indians are attempting to do it with the next largest system only about 1/10th the size\\" , says Dr Pramod Varma, chief architect, Aadhar.\\"Once the data comes into the CIDR it never leaves, its like a blackhole\\" , quips Dr Varma. What he means is that in order to protect citizens' privacy, no data will actually leave the Aadhar servers.Outsiders can only \\"query\\" the database for a yes/ no answer to authenticate someone who is quoting an ID, but cannot extract any other information. The authentication API (application programming interface) is publicly available on the Aadhar website, which means any programmer can build this querying ability into a software application in the future. ||||| India's vaunted tech savvy is being put to the test this week as the country embarks on a daunting mission: assigning a unique 12-digit number to each of its 1.2 billion people. The project, which seeks to collect fingerprint and iris scans from all residents and store them in a massive central database of unique IDs, is considered by many specialists the most technologically and logistically complex national identification effort ever attempted. To pull it off, India has recruited tech gurus of Indian origin from around the world, including the co-founder of online photo service Snapfish and employees from Google Inc., Yahoo Inc. and Intel Corp. The country's leaders are pinning their hopes on the program to solve development problems that have persisted despite fast economic growth. They say unique ID numbers will help ensure that government welfare spending reaches the right people, and will allow hundreds of millions of poor Indians to access services like banking for the first time. Critics question whether the project can have as big an impact as its backers promise, given that identity fraud is but one contributor to India's development struggles. Civil-liberties groups say the government is collecting too much personal information without sufficient safeguards. The technology requires transferring large amounts of data between the hinterland and an urban database, leading some to question whether the system will succumb to India's rickety Internet infrastructure. An ambitious national ID program in India is using sophisticated biometric technology to register the country's 1.2 billion citizens. WSJ's Amol Sharma reports. The sign-up effort is already under way in a handful of districts, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is expected to kick off nationwide enrollment Wednesday. The government hopes to issue the first 100 million unique ID numbers by March and 600 million within four years. The undertaking is the latest chance for India to show it can pull off a massive project after what is widely viewed as its mishandling of next week's Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, where infrastructure and hygiene issues led some nations to threaten withdrawing. To lead the program, Mr. Singh picked Nandan Nilekani, former CEO of Infosys Technologies Ltd., which helped pioneer India's low-cost offshore model of technology services. A native of Bangalore, India's tech hub, and son of a textile-mill manager, the 55-year-old billionaire is trying to infuse some of Infosys's efficiency into a lumbering bureaucracy. \\"You have a whole mass of people who are shut out of society,\\" Mr. Nilekani says. \\"A lack of identity is a big source of exclusion. You're giving them a key to social services.\\" In one early registration drive in Nagaram, a village 30 miles outside the southern city of Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh state, dozens of people were streaming into a drab government office one recent afternoon to have their fingerprints taken and irises scanned. Many applicants, who ranged from vegetable and rice farmers to real-estate brokers and shopkeepers, had never used a computer much less seen biometric equipment. Local officials had knocked on their doors the night before to tell them about the program. Salekula Anjaiah, a 44-year-old farmer who earns about 40 per month for his family of five, said he hoped the IDs would keep people from cheating the welfare system and getting food rations they don't qualify for. \\"It will take fraud out of the government schemes,\\" said Mr. Anjaiah, who relies on subsidies to feed his family. \\"Then it will be guaranteed I get what I deserve.\\" India has been attempting to improve governance through technology for two decades. Programs have digitized land records, created Web portals for government agencies and computerized tax filing systems. But the unique ID program, dubbed \\"Aadhaar,\\" or \\"foundation\\" in Hindi, is by far the largest and most ambitious effort. Many countries have some form of national ID and a handful use biometrics, but none come close to matching the scale of what India is attempting. Mr. Nilekani started recruiting Indians in the global technology industry in the summer of 2009. These early recruits included Srikanth Nadhamuni, who had spent 16 years as a technology engineer for companies like Sun Microsystems and Intel. Word spread in Silicon Valley that Mr. Nilekani wanted help, and by the fall a few others arrived in Bangalore. The team rented an apartment at a gated community on the eastern outskirts of the city to use as an office. Everyone worked for free. The group worked in the living room. They bought a few tables, two whiteboards and some markers. For food, they went to Mr. Nadhamuni's house nearby, where his wife served rice cakes, lentil crepes and lemon rice. Visitors had to use a wooden shoe rack as a bench since there weren't enough chairs. The team came up with a plan to capture a mix of biometric information—digital photos, fingerprints and iris scans—as well as names, addresses, genders and dates of birth. Since they knew they wouldn't have a second chance to collect the data, the engineers say they erred on getting too much information, including all 10 fingerprints instead of just one. The government would issue the random 12-digit numbers by mail. Passports, driver's licenses, ration cards and government health-insurance cards could either have the numbers printed on them or embedded electronically. Enlarge Image Close Bloomberg News Project head Nandan Nilekani says 'a lack of identity is a big source of exclusion' in India today. That still left a major hurdle: How to verify that a number and a person actually match? Retailers, like banks and cell-phone companies, could install fingerprint readers and match the data over the Internet. But getting readers and Internet access to the 500,000, often remote locations where subsidized food is distributed to the poor would be costly and impractical. The Indian government is expected to spend as much as 250 billion over five years on programs aimed at the poor, including subsidies for food, diesel, fertilizer and jobs. But 40% of the benefits, as the system now stands, will go to the wrong people or to \\"ghosts\\" with fake identification papers, according to a report by brokerage firm CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. Today's ration cards, for example, are issued on paper, and are relatively easy to forge or doctor. India Real Time Who's Who in Nilekani's UID Dream Team In November 2009, Mr. Nilekani wrote to tech companies such as Intel, Google, Oracle Corp. and Yahoo, asking them to send Indian-origin engineers to contribute to the cause, either on paid sabbatical or as volunteers. More than 20 people joined the effort. The government has approved about 670 million for the project so far, and the entire cost will likely be \\"several billion dollars,\\" says Mr. Nilekani. By early this year, the Bangalore team moved into a real office at a technology park. Mr. Nilekani became a traveling salesman for the project, taking a PowerPoint presentation on the road and making the case for unique IDs with government agencies and regulators across the country. In his pitch, Mr. Nilekani focused in part on reducing fraud, but also on the potential for bringing into the financial system the roughly two-thirds of Indian adults who don't have bank accounts. The poor often have few or no documents to prove who they are or where they live. The unique ID would solve that problem, says Mr. Nilekani, and could be linked to banks' plans to offer \\"no-frills\\" accounts, with no minimum balance and low fees, as well as nascent money-transfer services via mobile phones. Scanning the World India's unique ID program is the largest and most logistically challenging identification project in the world. A look at other such schemes. Germany Now issues paper ID cards, but plans to replace with electronic cards embedded with fingerprints and a six-digit PIN number that can be used to digitally sign forms. Nigeria Creating a national database with biometric data on citizens. Government hopes that 100 million out of 150 million Nigerians will be issued a unique ID card in three years. Bosnia-Herzegovina National ID cards were issued in 2002, partly to encourage unity following ethnic strife. The technology involves a bar code, a single fingerprint and a photograph. About 2.5 million IDs had been issued as of May. Malaysia Smart cards hold personal data and a thumbprint, and can be used to pay road tolls and access ATM machines. Oman One objective of smart-card program is to track immigrants, including workers from Pakistan, Iran, India and elsewhere. U.S. The US-VISIT program collects digital fingerprints and photos from foreign travelers as a way to keep immigration violators and criminals from entering the country. It has over 100 million records. Source: CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets; WSJ Research In the village of Nagaram, officials say they have been signing up 200 people per day, and as of early September, had made it through half of the 4,500 residents. The goal is for hundreds of villages and towns in Andhra Pradesh to start enrollment soon, and to reach 30 million people state-wide by the end of the year. Signing up is technically voluntary, but any government agency or company will be allowed to require a unique ID as identity proof, an approach critics say amounts to a de facto mandate for people to enroll. The process is slow going, taking anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes per person. Capturing iris scans with binocular-like devices is tricky and can take several minutes. Administrators had to hold one elderly man's eyelids open to get a good image. In addition to biometrics, residents provided an array of personal information, including their caste, religion and cellphone number. State agencies and companies who register people can gather whatever information they deem appropriate. Such vast data gathering rankles privacy advocates who say demographic details can potentially be used to discriminate in the services that companies offer customers or government agencies offer citizens. Another concern is that marketers will find ways to build profiles of people based on how they use their IDs—tracking where people bank, which hospitals they have checked into and who their cellphone providers are, for example. \\"You will basically be creating these wonderful resources for people to mine,\\" says Sudhir Krishnaswamy, a law professor at the National University of Juridical Sciences in Kolkata. Mr. Nilekani says he has drafted legislation to address the concerns of critics. Under the bill, which has been approved by India's cabinet but must still be passed by parliament, the government would have to ensure that the information it collects \\"is secured and protected against any loss or unauthorized access.\\" Anyone who discloses private information or hacks into the ID database would face up to three years in prison and stiff fines. Mr. Nilekani said India also needs a broader privacy law. Andhra Pradesh officials say early data already show how unique IDs could reduce corruption at the state's 43,000 ration shops, which distribute subsidized food to the poor. At one shop, records showed rations were being delivered to 330 families, but after the IDs were rolled out, only 203 families claimed benefits by placing their finger on a scanner at the shop. State officials suspect the shop owner had been making up fake accounts to divert some of the food into the black market. Jejjayila Venkatesh, a 35-year-old Nagaram resident who earns 50 a month in a local government job, said he isn't concerned about privacy. He just hopes the ID will help him open a bank account and get a driver's license, which he has had difficulty obtaining thus far, and maintain his benefits when he goes out of state for work: \\"This will help me prove my identity wherever I roam.\\" —Vibhuti Agarwal contributed to this article.

In simpler words, if we look after the pretty flowers in our garden, the flying friends, like bees and butterflies, will come to play with the flowers, making it an even happier and prettier place to be."},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"Context: The impact of social media on mental health In today's digital age, the use of social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat has become an integral part of people's lives. Interacting through online posts, sharing updates, and staying connected to friends and family members has exponentially increased in the last decade. However, there has been a growing concern over the possible impact of social media on people's mental health, especially among young adults and teenagers. Many factors contribute to the relationship between social media usage and mental health, including time spent online, potential cyberbullying, exposure to unrealistic standards, and social comparison. Hypothesis: Intensive social media usage negatively affects mental health among young adults and teenagers. This hypothesis suggests that young adults and teenagers who excessively use social media experience a decline in their mental health. The decline could manifest as a heightened risk for developing issues such as anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and other psychological disorders. To explore this hypothesis, researchers could assess mental health indicators like stress levels, self-reported depression, and overall life satisfaction among different age groups and compare these measures with the amount of time spent on social media. Additionally, qualitative research methods could be employed to gather in-depth insight into the experiences of young adults and teenagers dealing with the negative effects of excessive social media exposure. If the hypothesis is supported by research findings, it would create opportunities for educational programs, campaigns, or interventions that aim to mitigate these detrimental effects. For example, solutions might include digital literacy programs, encouraging healthy social media habits, or creating more diverse and inclusive environments on these platforms to break the cycle of negativity and adhere to a more supportive online community. Furthermore, experts in mental health and social media could collaborate to develop practical guidelines and foster a better understanding of the potential risks and implications associated with excessive social media usage."},{"instruction":"Short general knowledge question: where did robin gibb die? The answer to this question is:","output":"Robin Gibb, a prominent member of the Bee Gees and a significant figure in the music industry, sadly passed away on May 20, 2012. Born on December 22, 1949, in Douglas, Isle of Man, Robin Gibb became well-known for his contributions to the iconic Bee Gees alongside his brothers Maurice and Barry Gibb. Throughout their career, the trio achieved numerous accolades, such as inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame. Robin Gibb succumbed to his long battle with cancer at the age of 62 in London, England. His health issues initially emerged in August 2010 when he was admitted to a hospital for severe abdominal pain. Later, in October 2011, he was diagnosed with liver and colorectal cancer. Despite undergoing aggressive chemotherapy treatments and several surgeries, the cancer spread to other parts of his body, including the liver. Over time, Robin's health deteriorated, and he eventually fell into a coma in April 2012 due to complications of pneumonia. Miraculously, Robin briefly emerged from his coma in mid-April 2012, providing a moment of hope for his family, friends, and fans. However, the cancer ultimately proved to be too aggressive, and Robin Gibb passed away at his home in Thame, Oxfordshire, England, on May 20, 2012. Robin Gibb's death had a profound impact on the music world, as he was not only the co-creator of the distinct Bee Gees sound but also a talented singer and songwriter. Together with his brothers, Robin was responsible for numerous chart-topping hits that defined the disco era, such as \\"Stayin' Alive\\" and \\"Night Fever.\\" His contribution to music history will forever be remembered."},{"instruction":"Options are: 1).

They are sometimes called long-spinneret ground spiders. - Mesothelae is a suborder of spiders (order Araneae) that includes a single living (extant) family, Liphistiidae, and a number of extinct families. This suborder is thought to form the sister group to all other living spiders, and retain ancestral characters, such as a segmented abdomen with spinnerets in the middle and two pairs of book lungs. Members of Liphistiidae are medium to large spiders with eight eyes grouped on a tubercle. They are only found in China, Japan, and southeast Asia. - The Thomisidae are a family of spiders, including about 175 genera and over 2,100 species. The common name crab spider is often applied to species in this family, but is also applied loosely to many other species of spiders. Among the Thomisidae, \\"crab spider\\" refers most often to the familiar species of \\"flower crab spiders\\", though not all members of the family are limited to ambush hunting in flowers. - The Entelegynae or entelegynes are a subgroup of araneomorph spiders, one of the two main groups into which the araneomorphs are divided. Almost all members of this group, unlike most members of Haplogynae (the other main group), have eight eyes, and females have a genital plate. However, some entelegyne species have no (or reduced) eyes, and six-eyed spiders do occur, for example in the genus \\"Lygromma\\" (Prodidomidae, Gnaphosoidea). - The Mygalomorphae or mygalomorphs are an infraorder of spiders. The name is derived from the Greek \\"mugal\\", meaning \\"shrew\\", plus \\"morph\\" meaning form or shape. An older name for the group is Orthognatha, derived from the orientation of the fangs which point straight down and do not cross each other (as they do in the araneomorphs). - The Dionycha are a phylogenetic group of spiders ( Araneomorphae : Entelegynae ) with about 10,000 species . 17 families belong to this group , amongst others : Salticidae ( jumping spiders ) , Gnaphosoidea , Thomisidae ( crab spiders ) , and the Clubionidae . Spiders in this group have better senses ( sight , hearing ) than others , some even show courtship dances and songs . The Dionycha probably evolved from the web - building Trionycha . Unlike these , the Dionycha have only two instead of three tarsal claws . The central third claw of the Trionycha is responsible for tracking the silk thread . Instead of this claw , Dionycha have dense tufts of scupula hairs that produce strong adhesion , enabling some species to climb glass . Most species hunt their prey instead of building webs , although some species of Trionycha ( members of Lycosoidea ) also hunt . There are no cribellate members in the Dionycha . The monophyly of the Dionycha has been disputed . Today it is thought that the reduction of the third claw evolved several times independently . - Lygromma is a spider genus of Central and South America. There are species with eight, six (e.g. \\"L. senoculatum\\", \\"L. valencianum\\") and no eyes. The eyeless \\"L. anops\\" is endemic to Galapagos, while the not closely related blind \\"L. gertschi\\" is found only on Jamaica. - Tarantulas comprise a group of large and often hairy arachnids belonging to the Theraphosidae family of spiders, of which approximately 900 species have been identified. This article only describes members of Theraphosidae, although some other members of the same suborder are commonly referred to as \\"tarantulas\\". Except in cases of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) no species of tarantula are dangerous to humans, and some species have become popular in the exotic pet trade. - Opisthothelae is a taxon within Order Araneae, consisting of the Mygalomorphae and the Araneomorphae, but excluding the Mesothelae. Opisthothelae is sometimes presented as an unranked clade and sometimes as a suborder of the Araneae. In the latter case, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae are treated as infraorders. - Araneomorphae (sometimes referred to as Labidognatha) is an infraorder of spiders. They are distinguished by having fangs that oppose each other and cross in a pinching action, in contrast to the Mygalomorphae (tarantulas and their close kin), which have fangs that are nearly parallel in alignment. Both Araneomorphae and Mygalomorphae belong to the suborder Opisthothelae, which comprises nearly all extant species of spider. Mesothelae, the only other suborder in Aranea, includes only about 100 living species. - The Gnaphosoidea or gnaphosoids are a superfamily of araneomorph spiders with seven families. A 2014 study did not find the group to be monophyletic. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'instance of' with 'taxon'.

We have two terms with the variable l: -24*l and -13*l. We will combine these terms by adding their coefficients. -24*l - 13*l = (-24 - 13) * l = -37 * l Step 2: Rewrite the equation. Now our equation looks like this after combining like terms: -37*l - 74 = 0 Step 3: Isolate the variable term. To isolate the variable term, we want to get rid of the constant term, which is -74. We can do this by adding 74 to both sides of the equation: -37*l - 74 + 74 = 0 + 74 -37*l = 74 Step 4: Solve for l. To solve for l, we need to get it alone on one side of the equation. Right now, we have -37 times l. To undo this multiplication, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -37: (-37*l) / -37 = 74 / -37 l = -2 So the solution to the equation -24*l - 13*l - 74 = 0 is l = -2."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Organisms are constantly exposed to different kinds of radiations.

Now, let's think step by step:","output":"Step 1: Identify the subject of the question - in this case, sand cats and their eating habits concerning eel prey. Step 2: Establish the natural habitats of sand cats and eels. Sand cats are native to deserts and arid regions in North Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia; whereas, eels are mostly aquatic animals, living in freshwater and saltwater environments. Step 3: Analyze if there is an overlap in their habitats or any event where sand cats might come in contact with eels. Given the sand cat's natural habitat (deserts and arid regions), it is highly unlikely for them to come into contact with eels, which are aquatic animals. Step 4: Determine if the diet of a sand cat would support the consumption of eels. Sand cats mainly consume rodents, small mammals, birds, and reptiles, which are typically found in their natural environment. Step 5: Combine the information gathered from Steps 1-4 to answer the question. As sand cats live in arid habitats and predominantly consume prey found in those regions, it is highly unlikely that they would encounter or consume eels. Therefore, sand cats would, in effect, avoid eating all of the prey of eels, primarily due to the differences in their natural habitats and diet preferences."},{"instruction":"Aujourd'hui, je réaffirme ici que les Fidji acceptent ces principes, sans l'ombre d'un doute.

Chasing Colors has double tracking","output":"Based on the provided paragraph, we cannot conclusively determine if \\"Chasing Colors\\" has double tracking. The paragraph only provides general information about the song, its creators, vocalists, writers, and its release date and label. To conclude whether \\"Chasing Colors\\" has double tracking, one would need more technical details related to the audio production or mix of the song. Double tracking is a recording technique where a performance or a part of a performance is recorded twice or duplicated to create a fuller and richer sound. This technique is typically employed for vocals, guitars, and other instruments where a separation of tone and texture is desired. As an AI, I currently do not have the ability to analyze the audio track of \\"Chasing Colors\\" to offer a firsthand analysis. You might want to consult more technical sources or interviews with the song's producers – Marshmello and Ookay – or examine the sound engineering aspects of the track in order to determine whether double tracking was used in its production process."},{"instruction":"Denny asked: Premise: \\"Women gather in an office breakroom.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The women are snacking in the breakroom.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no. Le: OK, so how can I answer with some explanation?","output":"Answer: it is not possible to tell. Explanation: The premise states that \\"Women gather in an office breakroom\\" but does not provide any information about their purpose or what activities they are engaged in while in the breakroom. Although it is common for people to snack in a breakroom, we cannot definitively conclude from the provided information that \\"The women are snacking in the breakroom.\\" Thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, and it is not possible to tell whether the women are snacking or not."},{"instruction":"Q: Do people take laxatives because they enjoy diarrhea? A: no Explain how we arrive at this answer:","output":"1. First, we need to understand what laxatives are. Laxatives are medications or substances used to promote bowel movements and relieve constipation. 2. Now, we should consider the primary purpose of using laxatives. People usually take laxatives for medical reasons, such as difficulty in passing stool or to prepare for certain medical procedures. 3. Next, we need to understand that diarrhea is generally considered an undesirable side effect of taking laxatives, not the main goal. Diarrhea can cause dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and discomfort. 4. Additionally, when people take laxatives responsibly and according to the dose indicated by a healthcare professional, they typically aim for regular bowel movements rather than experiencing diarrhea. 5. Lastly, it is important to note that some individuals might misuse laxatives for weight loss purposes or due to eating disorders, which can lead to dangerous health consequences. In conclusion, people do not generally take laxatives because they enjoy diarrhea. Instead, they typically take them to address medical issues related to constipation or to follow medical advice for certain procedures. Diarrhea is an undesirable side effect, and taking laxatives to intentionally cause it can lead to health problems."},{"instruction":"Q: For the past few weeks I have been talking about the merits of the Mediterranean Diet. However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work. But . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost. The healthy foods on the Mediterranean diet may not seem so expensive after all. Question: How long does someone need to stay on the Mediterranean diet for? === The answer to the above question is Select from: [A]. As long as they would like; [B]. not enough information; [C]. until it gets too expensive; [D]. on occasion; The answer is:","output":"[A].

Your friend says they don't think it's right that vanilla is the most popular flavor. You say, \\"That's exactly how I feel too!

Born on January 30, 1882, FDR was the 32nd president of the United States, serving from 1933 until his death in 1945. FDR came from a wealthy, well-established family in New York. He was educated at Groton School, followed by Harvard University and Columbia Law School. His political career took off when he successfully ran for the New York State Senate in 1910. He later served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson, where he gained experience in naval affairs that would inform his response to the Pearl Harbor attack. FDR's presidency began during the Great Depression, and he implemented a series of wide-ranging measures, known as the New Deal, to address the nation's economic crisis. These programs aimed to relieve the financial struggles of Americans, help revive the economy, and reform the financial system to prevent another depression in the future. The Pearl Harbor attack, which was led by the Japanese military, marked a significant turning point in both FDR's presidency and the United States' involvement in World War II. That day, more than 2,400 Americans were killed, and more than 1,100 were injured. The Japanese attack severely damaged the U.S. Pacific Fleet, sinking or damaging eight battleships, three cruisers, four destroyers, and several other vessels, and destroying 188 aircraft. On December 8, 1941, FDR addressed Congress and requested a declaration of war against Japan, famously referring to December 7th as \\"a date which will live in infamy.\\" He used his leadership skills to rally the nation and unite Americans behind the war effort. FDR made a series of strategic decisions during the war, including the establishment of the Manhattan Project, which would ultimately lead to the development of the atomic bomb. As FDR's presidency progressed, he focused not only on winning the war but also on envisioning what a post-war world could look like. He was instrumental in the establishment of the United Nations and played a significant role in shaping the Allied strategy for the remainder of the war. Franklin Delano Roosevelt died in office on April 12, 1945. He is remembered as one of the most influential and important presidents in American history, due to his leadership during the Great Depression and World War II."},{"instruction":"What key details about fiona jones can be extracted from the following bio?

Ten times greater The answer is:","output":"Title: \\"Outbreak Unchained: The Lyme Revelation\\" Genre: Science-Fiction/Thriller Setting: A near-future world in which Lyme disease has become a pandemic, affecting ten times as many people as AIDS and West Nile Virus combined. Society faces complete collapse as the disease spreads at an alarming rate, and the once bustling cities lie in ruins. Plot: Act 1: Introducing the World and the Characters. Dr. Jennifer Adams, a talented but haunted virologist, is working day and night with her dwindling team at the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, desperately trying to find a cure for the rapidly spreading Lyme disease pandemic. Ten times more people are getting infected with the disease compared to those suffering from AIDS and West Nile Virus combined, pushing humanity to the brink of extinction. Enter Jack Thompson, a grizzled and determined former special forces soldier turned private security consultant who has lost his wife and daughter to the disease. Desperate for answers and fuelled by revenge, he follows a lead about a mysterious biotech corporation called Genesis Labs, which was rumored to be developing a revolutionary vaccine for Lyme disease but had unexpectedly shut down its operations. Act 2: Discovering the Hidden Truth. Dr. Adams and Jack's paths cross as both follow clues leading to Genesis Labs. Together, they navigate through the lawless and dangerous world, evading Lyme-infected people and cutthroat scavengers. As they grow closer, they find solace and hope in each other's company amid the pervasive bleakness. Upon reaching the abandoned Genesis Labs facility, they make a shocking discovery. The corporation had developed a highly effective Lyme disease vaccine but had intentionally withheld it for nefarious purposes: to create an artificially-induced apocalypse that would wipe out most of the world's population, only to later introduce the vaccine at a premium, allowing them to profit and essentially control the remaining population. Act 3: Fighting for a Cure and Redemption. A morally conflicted scientist who had worked at Genesis Labs, Dr. Simon Reeves, leaks vital information to Jennifer and Jack, revealing the whereabouts of the hidden vaccine stockpiles. They realize that they are pawns in a bigger game and that they are the only ones who can expose Genesis Labs' sinister plan and save humanity from the Lyme disease menace. With the help of Dr. Reeves and a group of trusted allies, Jennifer and Jack embark on a mission to infiltrate Genesis Labs' secret underground facility and retrieve the vaccine. As the clock ticks and infected hordes draw nearer, they face challenges and betrayals from unexpected sources. Through their shared pain and purpose, their bond grows stronger, and their determination to succeed becomes unbreakable. The climax involves a gripping confrontation with the ruthless leaders of Genesis Labs and a relentless fight for survival against overwhelming odds. Dr. Adams, Jack, and their team engage in a fierce battle to retrieve the vaccine and expose the corporation's evil deeds to the world. In the end, Jennifer and Jack emerge victorious, and the vaccine is distributed globally in the nick of time, saving millions of lives and averting complete human extinction. Genesis Labs is dismantled, and its leaders are prosecuted for their heinous acts. Epilogue. The world begins a slow and arduous journey towards recovery. Jennifer and Jack, having found love amid chaos, dedicate their lives to rebuilding society and contributing to the scientific community. Their personal triumph signifies the enduring nature of hope, love, and the human spirit in the face of unspeakable adversity. \\"Outbreak Unchained: The Lyme Revelation\\" would not only be a thrilling and engaging science-fiction movie but also serve as a warning about the potential consequences of unregulated corporate greed and the importance of unity in overcoming seemingly insurmountable challenges."},{"instruction":"Given a set of five words, generate the word from the set that does not belong (i.e. is the least relevant) with the other words.

It was a beautiful but somber morning as the soft sunlight filtered through the stained glass windows of the church, casting a warm glow upon the congregation that had gathered to say their final goodbyes. The scent of lilies and roses mixed with the gentle hum of whispered prayers filled the air. Laura, a life-long friend of Patricia, found herself at the funeral embraced in a deep feeling of sadness and empathy for her friend. As Patricia stood near the wooden casket, adorned with flowers, Laura moved closer and gently placed her hand on Patricia's shoulder. Patricia, who was visibly distraught, wept softly as the memories of her beloved mother came flooding to the forefront of her mind. Her mother, an inspiring woman of love, kindness, and resilience, had played a crucial role in shaping the person she had become today. Laura could see the pain in her friend's eyes, and intuitively she knew that mere words would never be enough to provide solace, but she felt compelled to offer her sincerest condolences. With a soft and empathetic voice, she said, \\"Patricia, I'm so sorry for your loss. Your mother was an incredible woman who will never be forgotten. She touched the lives of everyone she met, and her memory will live on in all of us.\\" Patricia, grateful for Laura's support, leaned on her shoulder and continued to sob gently as her tears dampened Laura's blouse. Throughout the ceremony, Patricia struggled to compose herself. The eulogies delivered painted beautiful portraits of her mother's life and accomplishments, and Patricia could not help but feel a mixture of pride, sorrow, and helplessness. She knew her mother's death had created a profound void in her life that would never be filled. Laura, sensing the waves of emotion radiating from her friend, made sure to stay close by attending to Patricia's every need, offering tissues when necessary and comforting embraces in the moments she felt most vulnerable. After the funeral ceremony ended, the mourners slowly made their way to the reception area, where family and friends would spend time sharing stories and reminiscing about their cherished memories of Patricia's mother. Laura remained by Patricia's side, always listening and ready to lend her support. During the reception, as Laura and Patricia weaved through the crowded room, they encountered countless family members and friends who offered their condolences, sharing stories of love and admiration about Patricia's mother. Patricia couldn't help but smile through her tears as she began to realize the extent to which her mother had reached and touched so many hearts. Each story acted as a testament to the beautiful life her mother had created and the love she had brought into the world. As the event drew to a close, Patricia and Laura sat down at a quiet corner of the room. Laura asked Patricia how she was doing, and Patricia decided to share something she had not told anyone yet. \\"You know, Laura, the past few days have been a whirlwind of emotions. I miss my mother terribly, but today, seeing everyone coming together and celebrating her life, has given me a sense of comfort and reassurance,\\" she confessed. \\"It's made me realize that people truly loved and admired her, and that her memory will live on in all of them.\\" Laura nodded, understanding how powerful those realizations could be in the healing process. She held onto Patricia's hand and squeezed it reassuringly. The two friends sat there in silence for a while, processing the events of the day and reflecting on the impact Patricia's mother had on their lives. As the sun began to set and the guests trickled away, Laura helped Patricia gather her belongings and offered to drive her home. They knew the road ahead would not be easy, but they also knew that they did not have to face it alone. So, hand in hand, the friends walked towards the car, each step a testament to the love, strength, and resilience they possessed, and the love they had inherited from Patricia's mother.

(2) Men Suddenly in Love is a 2011 Hong Kong romantic comedy written by Wong Jing , produced and managed by . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"While these two sentences convey similar information about the 2011 Hong Kong romantic comedy film \\"Men Suddenly in Love,\\" there are slight differences in the phrasing and presentation of details. In the first sentence: 1. The film is identified as being \\"written by,\\" \\"produced by,\\" and \\"directed by\\" Wong Jing. This implies that Wong Jing was responsible for all three roles in creating the film. 2. The use of \\"and\\" between \\"produced by\\" and \\"directed by\\" emphasizes that the same person, Wong Jing, has multiple responsibilities in the making of the film. 3. The overall structure of the sentence highlights that Wong Jing undertook multiple key tasks in the creation of the film. In the second sentence: 1. The film is identified as being \\"written by Wong Jing,\\" \\"produced,\\" and \\"managed by\\". This still implies that Wong Jing was responsible for writing the film; however, it does not explicitly state that he also produced and directed it. 2. The use of \\"and\\" between \\"produced\\" and \\"managed by\\" indicates that \\"produced\\" and \\"managed\\" are connected, but it doesn't clearly attribute both responsibilities to Wong Jing. 3. The overall structure of the sentence creates some ambiguity about Wong Jing's involvement in producing and managing the film. Though both sentences share the same central idea – that \\"Men Suddenly in Love\\" is a 2011 Hong Kong romantic comedy associated with Wong Jing – the first sentence clearly attributes writing, producing, and directing roles to him, while the second sentence could be interpreted as suggesting that other individuals were involved in its production and management."},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"Context: Imagine we are in a magical forest where all the animals can talk to each other.

In the fourth century, Han Chinese living in the Central Plains area began to migrate south, gradually gathering in Fujian and forming the Hakka communities. As a defence against enemies, the Hakkas chose to live in compact communities, and the tulou was their preferred houses. Tens of thousands of such earthen structures were constructed in Fujian Province. Most tulous are to be found in the valleys, surrounded by high mountains, and some are in the depths of the great mountains. Most are three to four stories high, and look like circular blockhouses . Rooms on the first floor are used as kitchens, rooms on the second floor are used as barns , and rooms on the third and fourth floors are for bedrooms and living rooms. For defensive purposes, the rooms on the first floor have no windows. Raw materials for the tulou were obtained locally. Their main building material was a mixture of clay, sand, lime and water, and egg whites, brown sugar and rice water were added as adhesive agents . It was then mixed to form the walls. Once they dried, the walls were so hard that driving a nail into them would have been difficult. Fir branches, which are extremely strong and do not rot, were used to strengthen them, and many centuries later they have remained their original look. Tulous are located in a region where earthquakes happen frequently, and their circular construction helps them resist the regular shocks. The proven design even inspired one famous Peruvian architect, who paid several visits to Yongding, to build a tulou back home. Not long after, an earthquake struck only 10 kilometers away, and while all the houses around the earthen building fell down, his tulou remained. Options: A Hakkas built tulous when they lived in the Central Plains area B Raw materials for the tulou were obtained from far away C It is difficult to dig a hole into the walls of the tulou D Fir branches may help them resist the regular shocks Answer: C It is difficult to dig a hole into the walls of the tulou Question: A:","output":"Which of the following is true about the construction and features of Fujian tulou?

I'm giving it a 1-star rating due to the plethora of issues I've experienced and the utter lack of support and responsiveness from the developers. Firstly, the app crashes frequently and without warning. It doesn't matter if I'm in the middle of using a key feature or simply browsing the interface - the app will crash and I lose all progress. This has made it nearly impossible to use the app's services, as I can't rely on it to remain functional for any meaningful length of time. Additionally, the user interface is incredibly poorly designed. It's confusing and counterintuitive right off the bat. With no clear instructions or explanations as to how to navigate or use the features, I found myself frustrated and lost more often than not. Frankly, it feels like no thought was put into designing and optimizing the user experience. Moreover, the app drains my battery at an alarming rate. It seems to always be running in the background, consuming resources, and draining my battery no matter what I do to curb its resource usage. This has made it impossible to use the app for extended periods and has left me scrambling for a charger multiple times. Lastly, the customer support has been abysmal. I've reached out to the developers several times to report the issues I've been experiencing and to seek assistance. However, each time, I've been met with either radio silence or canned, generic responses that do nothing to address my concerns. It's clear that they have little interest in supporting or improving their product. In conclusion, I cannot recommend this app to anyone. Between the frequent crashes, poor user interface, battery drain, and lack of support from the developers, it's simply not worth the frustration. If you're in search of a reliable and helpful app in this category, I would strongly advise looking elsewhere."},{"instruction":"Triple: Phil Taylor 3-DART_AVERAGE 105.73; Phil Taylor HIGH_CHECKOUT 144 What is a sentence that describes this triple?","output":"Phil Taylor, a renowned professional darts player, has an impressive 3-dart average score of 105.73 during his matches, paired with a high checkout score of 144, showcasing his exceptional skill and precision in the competitive world of darts."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: parade, perform, rehearsal","output":"During the rehearsal, the performers practiced diligently for the upcoming parade, ensuring a flawless performance."},{"instruction":"Data: name = The Golden Curry, food = Indian, near = The Bakers.

They appeared 83.5 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, a less ambiguous vernacular term for this group is crocodilians. - The clade Sauria was traditionally a suborder for lizards which originally ( before 1800 ) comprised crocodilians too . It has been redefined as the group containing the most recent common ancestor of archosaurs and lepidosaurs and all its descendants ; as such it was commonly thought that Sauria is a crowned - base grouping of diapsids . However , recent genomic studies and comprehensive studies in the fossil record suggest that turtles are closely related to archosaurs , not to parareptiles as previously thought . As such Sauria can be seen as a crowned - group of all modern reptiles ( including birds ) within the larger total group Sauropsida , which also contains various stem - reptile groups . - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - Herpetology (from Greek \\"\\"herpein\\"\\" meaning \\"to creep\\") is the branch of zoology concerned with the study of amphibians (including frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians (gymnophiona)) and reptiles (including snakes, lizards, amphisbaenids, turtles, terrapins, tortoises, crocodilians, and the tuataras). Batrachology is a further subdiscipline of herpetology concerned with the study of amphibians alone. - Amphisbaenia (called amphisbaenians or worm lizards) is a group of usually legless squamates, comprising over 180 extant species. Amphisbaenians are characterized by their long bodies, the reduction or loss of the limbs, and rudimentary eyes. As many species have a pink body and scales arranged in rings, they have a superficial resemblance to earthworms. While the genus \\"Bipes\\" retains forelimbs, all other genera are limbless. Although superficially similar to the snakes and Dibamidae, recent phylogenetic studies suggest that they are most closely related to the Lacertidae. Amphisbaenians are widely distributed, occurring in North America, Europe, Africa, South America, and the Caribbean. Most species are less than long. Little is known of them outside of their anatomy, and even that is difficult to study due to the mechanics of dissecting such small animals. - Sauropsida (\\"lizard faces\\") is a group of amniotes that includes all existing birds and reptiles as well as their fossil ancestors and other extinct relatives. Large land animals are either in this group or in its sister group, Synapsida, which includes mammals and their fossil relatives. This clade includes Parareptilia and other extinct clades. All living sauropsids are members of the sub-group Diapsida, the Parareptilia clade having died out 200 million years ago. The term originated in 1864 with Thomas Henry Huxley, who grouped birds with reptiles based on fossil evidence. - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes. - Diapsids (\\"two arches\\") are a group of amniote tetrapods that developed two holes (temporal fenestra) in each side of their skulls about 300 million years ago during the late Carboniferous period. The diapsids are extremely diverse, and include all crocodiles, lizards, snakes, tuatara, turtles, and dinosaurs (both avian and non-avian). Although some diapsids have lost either one hole (lizards), or both holes (snakes and turtles), or have a heavily restructured skull (modern birds), they are still classified as diapsids based on their ancestry. At least 7,925 species of diapsid reptiles exist in environments around the world today (nearly 18,000 when birds are included). - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Tuatara are reptiles endemic to New Zealand. Although resembling most lizards, they are part of a distinct lineage, the order Rhynchocephalia. Their name derives from the Mori language, and means \\"peaks on the back\\". The single species of tuatara is the only surviving member of its order, which flourished around 200 million years ago. Their most recent common ancestor with any other extant group is with the squamates (lizards and snakes). For this reason, tuatara are of great interest in the study of the evolution of lizards and snakes, and for the reconstruction of the appearance and habits of the earliest diapsids, a group of amniote tetrapods that also includes dinosaurs, birds, and crocodilians. - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Parareptilia (\\"at the side of reptiles\\") is a subclass or clade of reptiles which is variously defined as an extinct group of primitive anapsids, or a more cladistically correct alternative to Anapsida. Whether the term is valid depends on the phylogenetic position of turtles, the relationships of which to other reptilian groups are still uncertain. - Toxicofera (Greek for \\"those who bear toxins\\"), is a proposed clade of scaled reptiles (squamates) that includes the Serpentes (snakes), Anguimorpha (monitor lizards, gila monster, and alligator lizards) and Iguania (iguanas, agamas, and chameleons). Toxicofera contains about 4600 species, (nearly 60%) of extant squamata. It encompasses all venomous reptile species, as well as numerous related non-venomous species. There is little morphological evidence to support this grouping, however it has been recovered by all recent molecular analyses. - Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe. - Synapsids (Greek, 'fused arch'), synonymous with theropsids (Greek, 'beast-face'), are a group of animals that includes mammals and every animal more closely related to mammals than to other living amniotes. They are easily separated from other amniotes by having a temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye, leaving a bony arch beneath each; this accounts for their name. Primitive synapsids are usually called pelycosaurs or pelycosaur-grade synapsids; more advanced mammal-like ones, therapsids. The non-mammalian members are described as mammal-like reptiles in classical systematics; they can also be called stem mammals or proto-mammals. Synapsids evolved from basal amniotes and are one of the two major groups of the later amniotes; the other is the sauropsids, a group that includes modern reptiles and birds. The distinctive temporal fenestra developed in the ancestral synapsid about 312 million years ago, during the Late Carboniferous period.

Altricial organisms are helpless at birth, and their parents give them a lot of care. This care is often seen in bird species. ( Figure below ). Altricial birds are usually born blind and without feathers. Compared to precocial organisms, altricial organisms have a longer period of development before they reach maturity. Precocial organisms, such as the geese shown below, can take care of themselves at birth and do not require help from their parents ( Figure below ). In order to reproduce as much as possible, altricial and precocial organisms must use very different strategies. and the situation: A female goose now has a large family of chicks, the chicks mostly fend for themselves and can move around almost immediately after being born. A short way away a female dog gives birth to a litter of puppies. These on the other hand are defenseless, cant really move and are blind. They require extensive care from their mother.

Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion. - Ishmael Wadada Leo Smith (born December 18, 1941) is an American trumpeter and composer, working primarily in the fields of avant-garde jazz and free improvisation.

Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\". - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics. - The Penguin Guide to Jazz is a reference work containing an encyclopedic directory of jazz recordings on CD which are currently available in Europe or the United States. The first nine editions were compiled by Richard Cook and Brian Morton, two well known chroniclers of jazz resident in the United Kingdom. - Thelonious Sphere Monk (October 10, 1917 February 17, 1982) was an American jazz pianist and composer.

Monk is the second most-recorded jazz composer after Duke Ellington, which is particularly remarkable as Ellington composed more than 1,000 pieces, whereas Monk wrote about 70. - African-American music is an umbrella term covering a diverse range of musics and musical genres largely developed by African Americans. Their origins are in musical forms that arose out of the historical condition of slavery that characterized the lives of African Americans prior to the American Civil War. - Henry Threadgill (born February 15, 1944) is a Pulitzer Prize-winning American composer, saxophonist, and flautist, who came to prominence in the 1970s leading ensembles with unusual instrumentation and often incorporating non-jazz genres. - Improvisation is broad term referring to the process of devising an atypical method of solving a problem due to lack of time or resources. In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation, within the context of performing arts, is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines. - Ragtime also spelled rag-time or rag time is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns. - John William Coltrane, also known as \\"Trane\\" (September 23, 1926 July 17, 1967), was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes in jazz and was later at the forefront of free jazz. He led at least fifty recording sessions during his career, and appeared as a sideman on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk. - Roscoe Mitchell (born August 3, 1940 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American composer, jazz instrumentalist, and educator, known for being \\"a technically superb if idiosyncratic saxophonist.\\" \\"The Penguin Guide to Jazz\\" described him as \\"one of the key figures\\" in avant-garde jazz; All About Jazz states that he has been \\"at the forefront of modern music\\" for the past 35 years. Critic John Pareles in \\"The New York Times\\" has mentioned that Mitchell \\"qualifies as an iconoclast.\\" In addition to his own work as a bandleader, Mitchell is known for cofounding the Art Ensemble of Chicago and the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). - The saxophone (also referred to as the sax) is a family of woodwind instruments. Saxophones are usually made of brass and played with a single-reed mouthpiece similar to that of the clarinet. The saxophone family was invented by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax in 1840. Adolphe Sax wanted to create a group or series of instruments that would be the most powerful and vocal of the woodwinds, and the most adaptive of the brass instruments, that would fill the vacant middle ground between the two sections. He patented the saxophone on June 28, 1846, in two groups of seven instruments each. Each series consisted of instruments of various sizes in alternating transposition. The series pitched in B and E, designed for military bands, have proved extremely popular and most saxophones encountered today are from this series. Instruments from the so-called \\"orchestral\\" series, pitched in C and F, never gained a foothold, and the B and E instruments have now replaced the C and F instruments when the saxophone is used in an orchestra. - Muhal Richard Abrams (born September 19, 1930, in Chicago, Illinois) is an American educator, administrator, composer, arranger, clarinetist, cellist, and jazz pianist in the free jazz medium. - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America.

He was a member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and cofounded the Art Ensemble of Chicago. - The avant-garde (from French, \\"advance guard\\" or \\"vanguard\\", literally \\"fore-guard\\") are people or works that are experimental, radical, or unorthodox, with respect to art, culture, and society. It may be characterized by nontraditional, aesthetic innovation and initial unacceptability, and it may offer a critique of the relationship between producer and consumer. - The Moers Festival is an international jazz festival in Moers, Germany, happening yearly every Whitsun. - The Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) is a non-profit organization, founded in Chicago, Illinois, United States, by pianist/composer Muhal Richard Abrams, pianist Jodie Christian, drummer Steve McCall, and composer Phil Cohran. Early members included Henry Threadgill, Anthony Braxton, Jack DeJohnette, Wadada Leo Smith, Leroy Jenkins, Amina Claudine Myers, Adegoke Steve Colson, Chico Freeman, George Lewis and the Art Ensemble of Chicago: Lester Bowie, Roscoe Mitchell, Joseph Jarman, Famoudou Don Moye, and Malachi Favors. The AACM is devoted \\"to nurturing, performing, and recording serious, original music,\\" according to its charter. It supports and encourages jazz performers, composers and educators. While founded in the Jazz tradition, the groups outreach and influence has, according to Larry Blumenfeld, \\"touched nearly all corners of modern music.\\" - A trumpet is a musical instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group contains the instruments with the highest register in the brass family. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC; they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late-14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through almost-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a \\"buzzing\\" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century they have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape. - Kelan Phil Cohran (born in Oxford, Mississippi on May 8, 1927) is a jazz musician. He is known most for his trumpet contributions in the Sun Ra Arkestra in Chicago during 1959-1961 and for his involvement in the foundation of the AACM. - New Orleans (or ) is a major United States port and the largest city and metropolitan area in the state of Louisiana.

The New OrleansMetairieBogalusa Combined Statistical Area, a larger trading area, had a 2010 population of 1,452,502. - Free jazz is an approach to jazz music that was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s as musicians attempted to alter, extend, or break down jazz convention, often by discarding fixed chord changes or tempos. Though the music of free jazz composers varied widely, a common feature was dissatisfaction with the limitations of bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz that had developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Often described as avant-garde, free jazz has also been described as an attempt to return jazz to its primitive, often religious, roots and emphasis on collective improvisation. - A rhythm section (also called a backup band) is a group of musicians within a music ensemble or band who provide the underlying rhythm and pulse of the accompaniment, providing a rhythmic reference and \\"beat\\" for the rest of the band. Many of the rhythm section instruments, such as keyboard instruments and guitars, are also used to play the chord progression upon which the song is based. The bass instrument (either double bass or electric bass, or another low-register instrument, such as synth bass, depending on the group and its style of music) plays the low-pitched bassline that supports the chord progression, typically by emphasizing the roots of the chords (and to a lesser degree the fifths and thirds of the chords). - Joseph Jarman (born September 14, 1937 in Pine Bluff, Arkansas), is a jazz musician, composer, and Shinshu Buddhist priest. He was one of the first members of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and a member of the Art Ensemble of Chicago. - A big band is a type of musical ensemble associated with playing jazz music and which became popular during the Swing Era from the early 1930s until the late 1940s. Big Bands evolved with the times and continue to today. A big band typically consists of approximately 12 to 25 musicians and contains saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and a rhythm section. The terms jazz band, jazz ensemble, stage band, jazz orchestra, and dance band are also used to refer to this type of ensemble. This does not, however, mean that each one of these names is technically correct for naming a \\"big band\\" specifically. - Eric Allan Dolphy, Jr. (June 20, 1928 June 29, 1964) was an American jazz alto saxophonist, flautist, and bass clarinetist. On a few occasions, he also played the clarinet and piccolo. Dolphy was one of several multi-instrumentalists to gain prominence in the 1960s. He was one of the first important bass clarinet soloists in jazz, extended the vocabulary and boundaries of the alto saxophone, and was among the earliest significant jazz flute soloists. - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Miles Dewey Davis III (May 26, 1926September 28, 1991) was an American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th century music. With his ever-changing directions in music, Davis was at the forefront of a number of major stylistic developments in jazz over his five-decade career. - The piccolo (Italian for \\"small\\", but named \\"ottavino\\" in Italy) is a half-size flute, and a member of the woodwind family of musical instruments. The modern piccolo has most of the same fingerings as its larger sibling, the standard transverse flute, but the sound it produces is an octave higher than written. This gave rise to the name \\"ottavino\\" (Italian for \\"little octave\\"), the name by which the instrument is referred to in the scores of Italian composers. Piccolos are now only manufactured in the key of C ; however, they were once also available in D. It was for this D piccolo that John Philip Sousa wrote the famous solo in the final repeat of the closing section (trio) of his march \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\". - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Whitsun (also Whitsunday, Whit Sunday or Whit) is the name used in Britain and Ireland, and among Anglicans throughout the world, for the Christian festival of Pentecost, the seventh Sunday after Easter, which commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Christ's disciples (Acts of the Apostles chapter 2). In England it took on some characteristics of Beltane, which originated from the pagan celebration of Summer's Day, the beginning of the summer half-year, in Europe. Whitsuntide, the week following Whitsunday, was one of three vacation weeks for the medieval villein; on most manors he was free from service on the lord's demesne this week, which marked a pause in the agricultural year. Whit Monday, the day after Whitsun, remained a holiday in the UK until 1978 when the movable holiday was replaced with the fixed Spring Bank Holiday in late May. Whit was the occasion for varied forms of celebration. In the North West of England, church and chapel parades called Whit Walks still take place at this time (sometimes on Whit Friday, the Friday after Whitsun). Typically, the parades include brass bands and choirs; girls attending are dressed in white. Traditionally, Whit fairs (sometimes called Whitsun ales) took place. Other customs such as Morris dancing were associated with Whitsun, although in most cases they have been transferred to the Spring bank holiday. Whaddon, Cambridgeshire has its own Whitsun tradition of singing a unique song around the village before and on Whit Sunday itself.

By 1926, the monastery had been transformed into a history and art museum. In 1934, it became affiliated with the State Historical Museum. Most of its facilities were turned into apartments, which spared the convent from destruction. In 1943, when Stalin started to make advances to the Russian Orthodox Church during World War II, he sanctioned opening the Moscow Theological Courses at the convent. Next year the program was transformed and became the Moscow Theological Institute. In 1945, the Soviets returned Assumption Cathedral to the believers. The residence of the Metropolitan of Krutitsy and Kolomna has been located in the Novodevichy Convent since 1980. In 1994, nuns returned to the convent, which is currently under the authority of the Metropolitan of Krutitsy and Kolomna.

Article: In the mid 1990s, people started doing business on the Internet. At that time, there were two kinds of companies. First, there were traditional companies which sold things in stores. Then, there were Internet companies which didn't have stores, they sold things only over the Net. Traditional companies didn't want to lose any business. Quickly, they created their own websites and began selling things over the Net. These are the so-called \\"brick and click\\" companies. Many stores are made of brick, and you click on your mouse to buy things with your computer. That's where the name \\"brick and click\\" comes from. By the late 1990s, e-businesses like Amazon.com, Buy.com, and eToys.com were in trouble. Their profits were not very high, and there was a lot of competition. Many of these businesses lost a lot of money, and in 2000, many e-businesses were out of business. In the world of e-commerce , companies are fighting for every dollar and every customer. Will brick and click companies win the war? Only time will tell.

The final answer is always a single number. These questions can range from a variety of topics like simple arithmetic, solving equations, converting a quantity from one unit to another, finding remainders/GCD/LCM, finding probabilities etc. Each question has only one correct answer. This answer can be a positive or negative integer, a fraction or a decimal number. If the answer is a negative number use the hyphen (e.g. -42) symbol for the minus sign. For decimal numbers, do not add extra zeros after the decimal point. For fractional numbers, separate the numerator and denominator using a forward slash (e.g. 3/25). Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: What is prob of sequence nnn when three letters picked without replacement from {p: 6, n: 4}? Student:","output":"Alright, let's break down the given problem. The task is to: 1. Calculate the probability of getting the sequence 'nnn' when picking three letters without replacement from a given set. 2. Provide the final answer as a single number, either as a positive or negative integer, a fraction, or a decimal. Guidelines: 1. You're given a set with specific quantities of letters: {p: 6, n: 4}. 2. You pick three letters without replacement, meaning each time you pick a letter, it is removed from the set for the next pick. 3. You need to find the probability of getting the sequence 'nnn'. 4. Don't add extra zeros after the decimal point, if the answer is a decimal. If the answer is a fraction, separate the numerator and denominator with a forward slash. Now, let's solve the problem: There are a total of 6 p's and 4 n's in the set, making a total of 10 letters. We need to calculate the probability of picking 'n' three times in a row, without replacement. 1. First pick: The probability of picking an 'n' is 4 (number of n's) out of 10 (total letters): 4/10. 2. Second pick: After picking one 'n', there are now 3 n's left and a total of 9 letters. So the probability is 3/9. 3. Third pick: After picking two 'n's, there are 2 n's left and a total of 8 letters. The probability is 2/8. To find the probability of 'nnn', multiply these probabilities together: (4/10) * (3/9) * (2/8) = 24/720 Now simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 24. 24/720 = 1/30 So, the probability of getting the sequence 'nnn' when picking three letters without replacement from the given set is 1/30."},{"instruction":"If \\"An Asian man reading book and taking notes.\\", does this mean that \\"A man taking notes while reading a book.\\"?","output":"Yes, that's correct!

The first packets of mince pies, plum puddings, stollen and Santa shaped sweets and biscuits have been stacked on the country's most popular supermarket. The shelves which just days before were stacked with uniforms, pens and pencils, and stationary for school children going back to school, have been swapped for festive goodies. Ho ho no? The shelves in some Tesco supermarkets are being stocked with Christmas produce in September. Chocs away: These are the festive shelves at the Meadows Tesco, in Camberley, Surrey. Tesco is ranked as the country's top supermarket and it has unashamedly heralded that there was the '100 sleeps' until Christmas at the weekend. The countdown features on the homepage of Tesco.com.

The range of festive produce was on the shelves even before spooky Hallowe'en treats and the sparkly delights of November 5th. Too much too soon? These Santas are up for sale in the Camberley store. On Tuesday surprised shoppers took to Twitter to voice their irritation that that the supermarket had tried to force Christmas onto shoppers too soon.

But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him.

Robert James Fischer (March 9, 1943 - January 17, 2008) was an American chess grandmaster and the eleventh World Chess Champion. Many consider him to be the greatest chess player of all time. Bobby Fischer showed great skill in chess from an early age; at 13, he won a brilliancy known as \\"The Game of the Century\\". At age 14, he became the US Chess Champion, and at 15, he became both the youngest grandmaster up to that time and the youngest candidate for the World Championship. Sources implying that Paul Nemenyi, a Hungarian-Jewish mathematician and physicist and an expert in fluid and applied mechanics, was Fischer's biological father were first made public in a 2002 investigation by Peter Nicholas and Clea Benson of The Philadelphia Inquirer. Throughout the 1950s, the FBI investigated Regina and her circle for her alleged communist sympathies, as well as her previous life in Moscow. FBI files identify Paul Nemenyi as Bobby Fischer's biological father, showing that Hans-Gerhardt Fischer never entered the United States, having been refused admission by US immigration officials due to his alleged Communist sympathies. Not only were Regina and Nemenyi reported to have had an affair in 1942, but Nemenyi made monthly child support payments to Regina and paid for Bobby's schooling until his own death in 1952. Nemenyi had lodged complaints with social workers, saying he was concerned about the way that Regina was raising Bobby, to the point that, on at least one occasion, Nemenyi broke down in tears. Later on Bobby told the Hungarian chess player Zita Rajcsanyi that Paul Nemenyi would sometimes show up at the family's Brooklyn apartment and take him on outings. After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote a letter to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will: Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or medicine was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ (who was married to Joan), Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.","output":"This text is about Robert James Fischer, also known as Bobby Fischer, who was an American chess grandmaster and the eleventh World Chess Champion.

The formula can also be applied to other factors such as unemployment and literacy, they claim. Brazil is known to have extremely high murder rates, which the team argue could now be better anticipated. The scientists say their work, published in journal Plos One, could one day help prevent crime. Gang and drug violence are among the factors accounting for many of Brazil's cities being classed as the most violent in the world. Now a team has analysed data from Brazilian cities from the year 2000 and found that mathematical laws emerge when looking at how several factors - what they refer to as \\"urban metrics\\" - relate to each other. Criminologists are less convinced and say statistics and formulas are too far removed from the social issues that affect crime. \\"We have shown that most of the indicators that we use to characterise cities - such as GDP, the number of illiterate, the number of unemployed - are closely related with the population of the cities,\\" said Haroldo Ribeiro, from the State University of Maringa, Brazil, one of the co-authors of the study. \\"Usually, the indicators increase with the population size, following a well-defined mathematical law.\\" He told BBC News that the same mathematical law can be applied to homicides as well as 11 other urban indicators, including cases of child labour. However, it was hard to predict the most likely indicator for crime, added Dr Ribeiro, although he found that factors relating to money - such as unemployment and family income - had more influence on the number of homicides, something already well established by criminologists. \\"While this work is not focused on preventing crime... I believe that unveiling relationships between crime and urban metrics can help to guide public policies towards more effective investments, and, consequently, to help prevent crime.\\" Despite the problems Brazil is facing, Dr Ribeiro said his country was becoming better at tackling its crime problems. But he added that justice was very slow, which could keep spreading a \\"culture of impunity\\". Criminologist David Wilson of Birmingham City University, UK, said that although murders \\"do tend to be concentrated in parts of cities with low levels of income\\", the idea that there was a mathematical formula related to population growth \\"entirely ignores\\" the emotional triggers - or \\"foreground factors\\" - that lead to crime. \\"Murder is usually about the loss of face; it's about young men in circumstances in which there's some kind of conflict that results in one of those young men wanting to extract revenge. \\"It's about the foreground factors much more than the background factors - which this study looks at. \\"This study doesn't capture the phenomenon of murder. It's such a complicated phenomenon based on emotion,\\" Prof Wilson told BBC News. He added that statistical correlations could be found in many kinds of data \\"but that doesn't prove cause and effect\\". But Luis Bettencourt of the Santa Fe Institute, US, who works with data from cities to analyse human behaviour, said the formula could be applied to other cities too. \\"When you look at a city and want to characterise it in some way, the obvious one is population size. What's interesting about crime is that the levels of homicides tend to increase on a per capita basis, the larger the city. \\"The explanation is essentially that cities exist to promote social interaction. And crime is one such social interaction.\\"","output":"Researchers have developed a mathematical formula that reveals a connection between high murder rates and urban metrics, such as unemployment and literacy, in Brazilian cities, potentially aiding crime prevention efforts."},{"instruction":"Given the below context: The two sides to Poulenc's musical nature caused misunderstanding during his life and have continued to do so. The composer Ned Rorem observed, \\"He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual\\"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested in the works of younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, \\"Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans maître with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today.\\" Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, \\"There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [du Printemps]. It was not progress.\\" Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: \\"You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music\\".In his last years Poulenc observed, \\"if people are still interested in my music in 50 years' time it will be for my Stabat Mater rather than the Mouvements perpétuels.\\" In a centenary tribute in The Times Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: \\"both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carmélites and Les Mamelles de Tirésias.\\" At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as \\"a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds. His language speaks clearly, directly and humanely to every generation.\\" Guess a valid title for it!","output":"A valid title for this context could be: \\"Francis Poulenc: The Dual Nature of a Musical Genius.\\""},{"instruction":"Question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

On the east coast lies Mega-City One, a violent metropolis with 800 million residents and 17,000 crimes reported daily. There, an addictive new drug called \\"Slo-Mo\\" has been introduced, which slows the user's perception of time to 1% of normal. The only force for order are the Judges, who act as judge, jury and executioner. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is tasked by the Chief Judge (Rakie Ajola) with evaluating new recruit Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thrilby), a powerful psychic who failed the aptitude tests to be a Judge.In Peach Trees, a 200-storey slum tower block, drug lord Madeline Madrigal, also known as \\"Ma-Ma\\" (Lena Headley), executes three rogue drug dealers (Travis Snyders, Chad Phillips) by having them skinned, infused with Slo-Mo and thrown down the atrium from the top floor. Dredd and Anderson are sent in to investigate and learn of a drug den, which they raid. They arrest a thug named Kay (Wood Harris), whom Anderson's mind probe reveals to be the one who carried out the drug dealers' execution. Dredd decides to take him in for questioning. In response, Ma-Ma's forces seize the tower's security control room and seal the building, using its blast shields under the pretence of a security test, preventing the Judges from leaving or summoning help.Ma-Ma orders Dredd and Anderson killed, and the Judges fight their way through dozens of armed thugs. Arriving at the 76th floor, the Judges are assaulted by Ma-Ma and her men with miniguns that rip through the walls, killing numerous residents. By breaching a damaged outer wall, the Judges become able to call for backup. Meanwhile, Ma-Ma sends her henchman Caleb (Warrick Grier) to confirm the Judges' deaths, but when they meet, Dredd throws Caleb off the tower in full view of Ma-Ma.Dredd suspects Ma-Ma is desperate to keep Kay quiet and beats him for information. Anderson intervenes and uses her psychic abilities to read Kay's mind and learn that Peach Trees is the centre of Slo-Mo...

This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. I am facing a new situation today: Jennifer is currently looking for a new city to move to since she is looking to change her life and just do something different. Jennifer is a strong environmentalist and doesn't want to move to a city that contributes a lot to climate change since she feels it's every person's duty to take care of the Earth. She looks online and finds out about two cities in Minnesota that are several hundred miles apart. Jamestown has a very famous water park and uses coal to generate the city's electricity. Dapperton, the other city she is considering, has a neat hobby shop that Jennifer likes and the city uses nuclear power for its electricity needs. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which city is more likely to run out of the material used to generate electricity first? A:","output":"Dapperton is more likely to run out of the material used to generate electricity first, as it uses nuclear power and radioactive elements are relatively rare and limited compared to fossil fuels like coal used in Jamestown."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given the title and three arbitrary sentences out of a five-sentence story.

Climate change is primarily caused by the increased release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and nitrous oxide, into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, causing the Earth's average temperature to rise, destabilizing ecosystems, and triggering extreme weather events. One sector that has received considerable attention as a primary contributor to climate change is the energy production industry, which heavily relies on the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to generate electricity. This conventional method of energy generation emits a significant amount of greenhouse gases, thereby accelerating climate change. In recent years, the focus has shifted towards cleaner, more sustainable methods of energy production to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, have shown great potential in being viable alternatives to traditional fossil fuel-powered energy production. However, the widespread adoption of these alternative sources has faced several challenges, including infrastructure, costs, and intermittency issues. Hypothesis: Adopting renewable energy sources on a large scale and investing in the development of smart grid technology will lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, thereby slowing the progression of climate change and allowing ecosystems and economies to adapt more effectively. This hypothesis assumes that the replacement of conventional energy production methods with renewable alternatives would result in an overall decrease in the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The hypothesis also suggests that technological advancements, specifically smart grid technology, can help address some of the intermittent nature of certain renewable energy sources, like solar and wind power, making them more reliable and efficient while reducing the reliance on fossil fuels."},{"instruction":"Write a question about the following article: A September 2014 Lucid Talk Belfast Telegraph poll showed that 40.1% of the population supported same-sex marriage, while 39.4% opposed and 20.5% either had or stated no opinion.

When can a person's death not be wanted by the person? Options: - cyanide - love - burial - suicide - murder","output":"The question is essentially asking when a person's death might occur against their will, as in it wouldn't be their choice. To answer this, we need to go through each of the options and evaluate whether it would involve the person's will and consent. 1. Cyanide - Cyanide is a poisonous substance that can cause death, but it does not directly address the question. A person's death could be against their will if cyanide poisoning occurs without their consent or knowledge, but it could also be with their consent in cases of suicide. So, this option is inconclusive. 2. Love - Love is an emotion and not a direct cause of death. While it might be a factor in some cases, it doesn't provide a clear answer to the question. 3. Burial - Burial is a method of disposing of a deceased person's body. It does not address the question of whether a person's death is against their will or not. 4. Suicide - Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Since it is a deliberate act, it assumes that the person wanted their death, at least at the time of the act. Therefore, this option does not answer the question of when a person's death would be unwanted by them. 5. Murder - Murder is the unlawful and intentional killing of another human being without their consent. In this case, the victim's death is clearly against their will since it is inflicted upon them without their permission or desire. Based on the step-by-step analysis of the given options, we can conclude that \\"murder\\" is the answer to the question, as it is the only scenario in which a person's death is explicitly not wanted by the person themselves."},{"instruction":"What most naturally follows?

Given the question \\"Why did Casey do this?\\", is \\"Get warm\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"No, \\"Get warm\\" is not a valid answer in this context. To explain better, the situation tells us that Casey rushed to their car tonight in the rain without having a jacket on. Typically, a jacket provides warmth by insulating the body from cold weather, and one might usually wear a jacket especially when it's raining to keep warm and dry. In Casey's case, they did not even wear a jacket, implying conditions that were either urgent or in some way disruptive to normal procedures. There are several possible reasons why Casey might act in this manner. Maybe they were in a hurry and forgot to pick up their jacket, or perhaps the urgency of their situation caused them to ignore the cold and rain. It might also be possible that they didn't anticipate the rain, or felt that getting to the car was more essential than staying dry. To put it in another way, if the rain began suddenly, they may have rushed to the car to avoid getting any wetter than they already were. Given these possible explanations, saying that Casey went to the car without a jacket on to \\"get warm\\" is counter-intuitive. If their aim was to feel warm, the logical thing to do would have been to wear a jacket before going out in the cold and rainy weather. Therefore, it is not a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Casey do this?\\". It might, however, be a valid answer if the question was more directed towards what Casey might be hoping to do once inside the car - getting warm inside the car by turning on the heater, for instance. But as it stands, the act of rushing to the car in the rain without a jacket does not appear to be an effort made with the intention of getting warm."},{"instruction":"Translate from English to Spanish: I welcome you with joy on the occasion of the celebrations of these days that mark an important moment in the history of the Pontifical French Seminary in Rome.

Blue group did weight training for 3 months, while Brown group ran 3 miles a day for three months. The Captain observed different results on each group. Which group didn't have their hearts pumping more blood while training? Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Answer:","output":"The Blue group, which did weight training for 3 months, didn't have their hearts pumping more blood while training. This is because weight training primarily focuses on increasing the size and strength of the skeletal muscles by making them contract against a resisting force. On the other hand, the Brown group, which ran 3 miles a day for three months, engaged in an exercise that made their cardiac muscles contract faster, leading to their hearts pumping more blood. This increased the strength and efficiency of their cardiac muscles.

The longest throw was by Dave Morrison, who tossed his knob 21.8m (71ft). Organiser Nigel Collins thought up the idea after seeing a Yorkshire pudding throwing contest at a Yorkshire food festival. He said: \\"We used to throw knobs occasionally as a child because they're the size of a golf ball, so the whole thing gelled from there. \\"Most of the contest is taken in good heart and there is no food wastage. Everything that is left over - even the broken bits on the ground - goes to feed local chickens. \\"We needed funding for the playing fields, village hall, cricket club, and football club. We're a very small village, very rural, and we needed a unique event to get people here.\\" The savoury biscuits, made by the Moores family since 1880, have to be thrown underarm and one of the competitor's feet must remain on the ground during the toss in order for it to count. The best of three is measured and recorded. The winner receives their winning biscuit and a plaque, while their name is added to a board in the village hall. The record is still held by Dave Phillips with a throw of 29.4m (96ft) in 2012. Other events included a knob eating contest, knob darts, knob weighing, and knob painting.

At first glance, we can confirm that part of the stated hypothesis is correct. Specifically, the fact that muffins are available at the TI cafeteria in the mornings aligns with the information given in the premise. This part of the hypothesis is quite straightforward. The premise quite clearly states that muffins are available at the TI cafeteria in the mornings. Let's consider the second part of the hypothesis—that these muffins are \\"really good\\". This particular part of the hypothesis is not confirmed by the premise. The premise doesn't contain any information concerning the quality or taste of the muffins at the TI cafeteria. The measure of food quality or taste can be highly subjective and usually relies on personal opinion or preference. Judgments of food quality could be based on a variety of parameters, including the freshness of the ingredients, the way they are prepared, how they are presented, and, of course, how they taste. However, there's also a level of consistency to be considered—quality could mean that the muffins are reliably fresh, prepared well, and taste good consistently over time, not just on a one-off occasion. This is not given in the quoted premise. Without any specific information or details about the taste, texture, freshness, or any other factors related to the quality of the muffins in the premise, we cannot accurately confirm that the muffins served in the TI cafeteria in the mornings are \\"really good\\". Further information, such as customer reviews, ratings, or additional personal accounts regarding these muffins would be necessary to confirm this part of the hypothesis. In conclusion, while the premise confirms that the TI cafeteria serves muffins in the mornings, it does not provide any supporting evidence to confirm that they are \\"really good\\". Thus, we can only conclude that part of the hypothesis is corroborated based on the given premise."},{"instruction":"Write a (2). tweet. Possible tweet types: Available options: (1). negative.

Beef prices have dropped so low, cattle companies are being urged to sell their stock to a rendering plant. Ben tries to intervene, and eventually learns that banker Parker is colluding with Odell and the plant's owner, Sledge, to gain control of the ranchers' valuable land.

A. being judged B. responsibility C. go to jail D. feeling guilty E. killing The best answer is A:","output":"A tough judging in a court case might result in various outcomes. These outcomes can have far-reaching implications for the individuals involved and the broader justice system. Among the given options, the best answer is A: being judged. A. Being judged: A tough judging usually means that the judge will be strict and adhere closely to the rules and laws. The involved parties will have to face a thorough examination of their arguments and evidence. This might mean that the judge's decision will be more accurate and better reflect the truth of the situation. In this case, the accused will be correctly judged according to the presented evidence and arguments. This would contribute to the overall fairness and impartiality of the trial. B. Responsibility: While a tough judging might highlight the responsibilities of the individuals involved in the court case, this is not the main outcome of such a case. Responsibility can be a factor considered during the trial, but the result of a strict judging would primarily be accurate judgment based on evidence. C. Go to jail: A tough judging in a court case may result in the accused going to jail if they are found guilty. However, the outcome would depend on the nature of the crime, the available evidence, and the arguments presented during the trial. It is essential to consider that a tough judging does not guarantee imprisonment but rather a fair and impartial decision based on the presented arguments and evidence. D. Feeling guilty: While the accused party or other individuals involved in a court case might feel guilt, this is a subjective emotion and not the primary outcome of a tough judging. The emotional responses of the involved parties should not be the focus of the trial. Instead, the court aims to reach a judgment based on the legal facts and evidence presented. E. Killing: This option is not relevant to the outcome of a tough judging in a court case. The primary goal of a fair judicial process is to ensure that justice is served while preserving the rights of all parties involved. There is no direct link between a strict judging and any acts of violence. To conclude, in a court case with a tough judging, the best answer to the question is A: being judged. It represents the most accurate and relevant outcome of a fair and impartial trial, focusing on reaching a decision based on available evidence and arguments. The other options might be related to the consequences or emotions associated with such a trial but do not directly result from a tough judging."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A group of kids playing in a water fountain area in their swimwear.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A group of kids is near a water fountain.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations. What is probably true about the narrator - not enough information - She likes baking - She likes to dig - She likes to hunt Answer:","output":"The narrator is someone who enjoys baking and trying out new recipes. They are interested in the history and traditions behind certain dishes, such as the colomba.

She addresses the audience directly on her life and problems throughout the film. When a van stops by, she gives it the brush off, recalling the last time she serviced a man in a van: it turned out there were several other men in the van, who gang-raped her and left her for dead. A passer-by (Jack Nance) helps her to the hospital, and even pays her bill there. She sends him a thank you note. Liz isn't merely attempting to get a customer, however: she is attempting to escape her pimp, Blake (Benjamin Mouton). Blake is a well-dressed, businesslike and extremely controlling man who catches up with her at a convenience store. He demands money, and Liz has no choice but to agree though she gives him the finger as he leaves. As Liz stops off at a strip club for a drink, she explains how she ended up as she did: she was a small town girl, who married a violent drunk named Charlie (Frank Smith). Though they have a child together, she can no longer take it and leaves him, taking her son with her, as he's sleeping it off. She takes a job on the graveyard shift at a diner, and when a customer offers her more money to have sex with him, she decides, given her rather low pay, to take it. She does this independently for a time until she meets Blake, who takes her to LA. Though Blake does do some things for her (including getting her tattooed), he is ultimately as cruel as her husband, so she decides to escape from him. A local homeless person/street performer named Rasta (Antonio Fargas) decides to treat Liz to a movie. Though Rasta is a bit scary (his act involves walking on broken glass), Liz agrees. At this point the scenes of Liz and Rasta at the movie are intercut with Blake explaining his life to the audience, giving the impression that Liz and Rasta are watching Blake's soliloquy.

He stumbles to the home of Nicole Devon, and collapses. She calls an ambulance, the authorities are alerted, and soon Welles is operated on, given plastic surgery and interrogated by a hard-boiled government official named Tuxan. But Welles claims to have no memory of his crime. In fact, he claims no memory of his life at all, save for brief glimpses of a woman and small boy frolicking on a beach. Despite Tuxan's brutal interrogation techniques (electro-shock and water submersion), Welles still maintains his story of total amnesia. Tuxan allows Welles to escape, hoping he will lead them to the people behind the attempted theft. Welles goes to Nicole's home and begs her to help him remember. But she knows nothing. Eventually the inside conspirators behind the attempted theft are found, and Tuxan reveals the truth to Welles, who still cannot remember any details of the crime.

The sentence does not share details about Ebroin's involvement before the murder, leaving it ambiguous. On the other hand, the second sentence tells us that Leudesius and Theuderic III fled with the royal treasure to Baizieux, and Ebroin was with them during the escape. In this version, Leudesius overtook all of them in Baizieux and had Ebroin murdered. The language suggests that Ebroin was with the company fleeing with the treasure, and more explicitly states who was involved.

Unlock the door while maintaining your balance, and carefully slide into the driver's seat. To avoid further injury, it is advised to slide in with your backside first. If you are using a second crutch, place it on the passenger seat or behind the driver's seat. Do not shut the driver's side door. Insert the key into the ignition, and turn it forward slightly so that the car turns on, but the engine does not start. Wind down the driver's side window and reach back for the crutch that you left outside earlier. As you bring the crutch into the car, make sure that the top (the padded under-arm part) is near the upper part of your body. When you close the driver's side door, make sure the top of the crutch goes through the open window; it should stick out the window a little bit. Buckle your seat belt and using your left hand, place the end of the crutch on the clutch pedal (the one on the far left). Push the clutch all the way in and apply the brake with your right foot while making sure the car is in neutral with your right hand. If it is, then turn the ignition all the way and wait for the engine to start. Once the car turns over, take the crutch off the clutch pedal and remove the emergency brake. ’ With your left hand, use the crutch to push in the clutch again, and with your right hand, shift the car into first gear. Grab the steering wheel with your right hand at the 2 o'clock position. Take your right foot off of the brake and use it to push in the accelerator, revving the engine to around 2,000 RPMs. Slowly release the clutch (using the crutch) until you feel the car start to pull forward. Push the gas in further and release the clutch completely (it's a push/pull relationship between the two pedals). Shifting from first to second is similar to the step above. Keeping your eyes on the road, start out with your left hand on the crutch handle and your right hand on the steering wheel. When it is safe to shift, move your right hand to the shifter and bring your left thigh up to stabilize the steering wheel. With the crutch, push the clutch in and pull the shifter down (into the second gear position) with your right hand. Remember to not give the car gas until after you have released the clutch (push/pull). Now you are in second gear. Repeat step 5 to shift into higher gears. There may come a point during your drive that you would like to downshift to a lower gear. This may be because you are heading down a steep slope or feel that you want to accelerate at a greater rate. Place the crutch on the clutch, take your right foot off of the gas, and move your right hand to the shifter. In a quick, smooth motion push in the clutch with the crutch and then move the shifter into the desired lower gear. Remember, it is always best to downshift into the next smallest gear (e.g. if you are in 5th gear, downshift to 4th). Once you are in the desired gear, release the clutch and slowly push on the accelerator with your right foot. Lastly, bring your right hand up onto the steering wheel. Once you arrive at your destination, park the car, push the clutch in with the crutch, shift the transmission into neutral, and apply the emergency brake. Open the driver's side door and lean your crutch(es) outside of the car against the top of the door frame. Roll up your window and turn off the car. Shift the transmission into first gear (or reverse) to keep it from rolling. Carefully bring yourself out of the car with the help of your crutch(es) and close the door behind you. Good luck with that foot! Summary:","output":"To drive a manual car with a crutch, you'll need to use the crutch to help you push the pedals. First, get into the car and place the crutch on the passenger seat or behind the driver's seat. Then, turn on the car, and use the crutch to push the clutch pedal. When it's time to shift gears, use the crutch to push the clutch again and move the gear shifter with your other hand. To change to a lower gear, use the crutch to push the clutch again and move the shifter to the lower gear. When you arrive at your destination, park the car and carefully get out using your crutch(es)."},{"instruction":"Q:Both gross and tragic. The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff. Recently one of the women involved in this crime came up for parole. Of course there was great opposition from the community relative to her release. She was young and that was 38 years ago. I believe people deserve a second chance, but of course this is a very controversial matter. Question: The nurse probably believes that: Options: A. All the hospital staff on duty that day are still traumatized B. The girlfriend of one of the policemen is still unmarried C. not enough information D. The woman who recently came up for parole should not be pardoned. === The correct answer is A:","output":"All the hospital staff on duty that day are still traumatized. The detailed and long answer: The 1980 Central Nyack bank robbery was a devastating event for everyone involved, particularly for the hospital staff who responded to the Code 66, indicating an external disaster requiring immediate medical attention at the emergency room. The fact that the two mortally wounded police officers were personal friends of the staff members and one was the boyfriend of a nurse made the situation even more emotionally charged and difficult to process. The fact that they had to treat machine gun injuries, which they hadn't encountered in their Trauma and Triage Course, added to the stress of the situation. It was mentioned that the hospital staff had debriefing sessions for weeks, and they were upset for months after the incident. This shows the extent of the emotional trauma they endured. The nausea that the nurse recalls feeling is also an indication of the incredible emotional strain brought on by processing such a horrific event. Though it took place 38 years ago, it is likely that the memories still reside with the hospital staff who were on duty during that tragic day, resulting in an ongoing sense of trauma. Regarding the other options presented, there is not enough information provided to determine if the girlfriend of one of the policemen is still unmarried (Option B), and the nurse's opinion on the woman who recently came up for parole potentially deserving a second chance indicates that Option D is not correct. Option C, \\"not enough information,\\" could be somewhat accurate, but this does not address the impact of the event on the hospital staff, and thus, Option A (\\"All the hospital staff on duty that day are still traumatized\\") serves as the most fitting and comprehensive answer."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given dialogue, and you have to find the most critical location in the given conversation.

Traditionally only women are invited to a baby shower. However, more and more baby showers are also including the father-to-be. Like a bridal shower, a mother-to-be will register a wish list of things she wants at one or several stores. This list usually includes things the mother wants for her baby like clothes, diapers and even furniture. This way friends and family members can go to the stores and buy something from the list. Registering helps make sure that there aren't repeat items, like 30 bottles when a new mom only needed 15. At a baby shower, people can give cards with wishes for the new baby and mom.

Over the past few years, data has shown a consistent diminishing trend in reading comprehension, particularly among the 6th to 8th graders. This has led to a significant impact on the students' overall academic performance, leading to lower test scores, poor writing skills, and difficulty understanding complex texts. These growing concerns prompt the educators to consider implementing a new approach to improving the students' reading comprehension skills. The recent changes in teaching methodology had focused more on project-based learning, digital integration, and collaborative work but had diverted attention from the traditional reading and writing exercises that once held an important place in the curriculum. School administrators and teachers are willing to invest time and resources to identify the primary cause of this issue and develop a comprehensive plan to address the decline in reading comprehension levels among their students. To do this, they are considering the potential effects of instructional time on reading comprehension development, as well as the influence of digital technology and other factors. Hypothesis: The decline in reading comprehension scores among 6th to 8th-grade students is primarily attributable to a combination of reduced instructional time devoted to reading and writing exercises, increased reliance on digital technology for in-class activities, and a lack of consistent and focused approach to directly improving reading comprehension skills. To test this hypothesis, the school will implement an intervention program aimed at increasing the amount of instructional time spent on reading and writing exercises in the curriculum. They will also introduce targeted reading comprehension strategies and practices to help students build core comprehension skills. These methods will be used alongside digital technology to provide a balanced learning experience. The results of this intervention will be analyzed to determine whether it leads to improved reading comprehension scores over a certain period. If the hypothesis is proven correct, the school can then look at implementing long-term strategies to ensure the continuous development of reading comprehension skills. This could include ongoing professional development for teachers in effective reading instruction practices, a comprehensive review of the curriculum to maintain a balance between innovative teaching methods and traditional literacy development, and exploring ways to incorporate digital technology without sacrificing the students’ reading skills."},{"instruction":"James buys a weight vest for 250. He then buys 200 pounds of weight plates for 1.2 per pound. A 200-pound weight vest would cost 700 but there is a 100 discount. How much does he save with his vest? Let's think first. Chain of thought:","output":"1. Calculate the total cost of weight plates: 200 pounds * 1.2 per pound. 2. Add the cost of the weight vest to the total cost of weight plates: 250 (vest) + total cost (weight plates). 3. Calculate the discounted cost of the 200-pound weight vest: 700 (original price) - 100 (discount). 4. Compare the total cost of James' vest (step 2) with the discounted cost of the 200-pound weight vest (step 3) to determine the amount saved. Now, let's apply this chain of thought to solve the problem: 1. Total cost of weight plates: 200 * 1.2 = 240. 2. Total cost of James' vest: 250 (vest) + 240 (weight plates) = 490. 3. Discounted cost of the 200-pound weight vest: 700 - 100 = 600. 4. Amount saved with James' vest: 600 (discounted cost) - 490 (James' vest cost) = 110.

(A) Water (B) Carbon dioxide (C) Oxygen (D) Glucose (E) Sunlight Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When considering the process of photosynthesis, we must first understand its purpose and requirements. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy, producing glucose and oxygen as byproducts. So, while water (A) and carbon dioxide (B) are necessary components of the photosynthesis process, they do not provide the energy needed to power the reaction. Oxygen (C), on the other hand, is produced as a byproduct of photosynthesis and is not the source of energy. It is primarily a waste product that is released by plants during the process. Similarly, glucose (D) is also produced as a byproduct of photosynthesis and is stored as energy for future use, but it is not the primary source of energy for the process itself. This leaves us with option (E), sunlight. Sunlight is the driving force behind photosynthesis, as the energy in light is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules within specialized structures called chloroplasts in plants. This energy from sunlight is then used to ease the breakdown of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, facilitating the production of glucose from carbon dioxide. Therefore, the primary source of energy for the process of photosynthesis in plants is, indeed, sunlight (E)."},{"instruction":"The crimes took place between 23 December and 7 January in Iver, Chalfont St Peter, Slough and Windsor.

Dan found out he is healthy and had normal blood cholesterol and calcium levels. Ben however, was told that he had a disease called hypercalcaemia and had to start a treatment for that. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which brother experienced less nausea? Hint: Excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia. However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Dan experienced less nausea as he is healthy and had normal blood cholesterol and calcium levels, while Ben was diagnosed with hypercalcaemia, which has symptoms that include nausea."},{"instruction":"The programme about the Disappeared also hears denials from Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams that he ordered the disappearance of Mrs McConville. The Disappeared are those who were abducted, murdered and secretly buried by republicans during the Troubles. Mrs McConville's body was found at a beach in County Louth in 2003. By Alison MillarProducer/Director of The Disappeared \\"I remember as a child being at an agricultural fair with my family. Between the latest tractor and cutting edge machinery were stalls selling novelty jeweller. This year I knew exactly what I wanted - an 'Elvis' necklace. In my excitement to get the necklace, I ran ahead, but in the busy crowds I lost my mum. It felt like an eternity before my mum came to find me in the security hut. I have never been so happy to see her in my life. Way before this film began, I saw the footage of the McConville children appealing for their mum to come home. It broke my heart. Darragh MacIntyre and I spent almost a year getting to know the families of the Disappeared - we listened to one tragic tale after another. Years of silence inflicted on them by the fear of the IRA had caused a pain that was as raw as the memory of the last moment they saw their loved ones alive. I saw a profound sadness in the eyes of those families who are waiting for their loved ones remains to be found. A crucial part of the grieving process has been removed and emptiness will always be in their hearts. \\" One of her 10 children, Agnes, described her mother's abduction, which happened in 1972. \\"We could hear her squealing, still squealing and looked over at the banister on Divis Flats (in west Belfast) and there she was getting thrown into the back of a van,\\" she said. \\"That was the last time that we saw her.\\" Agnes' brother Michael also recalled seeing his widowed mother being taken away. \\"All of us were just wrapped around her, all crying and squealing,\\" he said. \\"I remember one of the girls (who abducted her) talking, who I knew because she hadn't got a mask on, she used to be a neighbour of ours, her and her sister were there. \\"They kept trying to calm us down, because they knew us and they knew us by name.\\" In the programme, Mr Adams is asked about allegations that he ordered the murder of Mrs McConville. He is also asked about his knowledge of the fate of two IRA men who also disappeared the same year. \\"No, I had no act or part to play in either the abduction, the killing or the burial of Jean McConville or indeed any of these other individuals,\\" he said. \\"My focus is in trying to do what I can as an individual to bring those remaining bodies to the families who grieve them, who want a burial place to go to. \\"Of course I regret, one wouldn't be a thinking, living human being if one didn't have regrets. All of us bear a responsibility, those of us who are in leadership, and I've never shirked that.\\" Although the remains of some of the Disappeared have been recovered, seven have never been found. One of them is Columba McVeigh, a 19-year-old from Donaghmore in County Tyrone, who was abducted and murdered by the IRA in 1975. His sister, Dympna, told the programme: \\"I never did anything to the IRA, neither did my mum, so why are they torturing us? Thirty-eight years on and they're still torturing us and that's what it is. How would you feel if it was your brother? \\"I've got an image in my head of Columba standing there crying, looking into a hole.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Pick your answer from: * no * yes","output":"Celebrating birthdays is a topic that has been debated among Islamic scholars and communities. Some argue that it is haram (forbidden) in Islam, while others hold a more open stance, stating that it is permissible as long as it does not conflict with Islamic teachings and values. Those who argue that birthdays are haram often cite the absence of such celebrations in Islamic history and traditions to support their claim. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) himself did not celebrate his own birthday, nor did he direct his followers to do so. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that the early Muslims marked such events. Critics assert that birthday celebrations stem from non-Islamic cultures and may incorporate elements that conflict with Islamic values. On the other hand, some scholars and individuals believe that birthday celebrations are permissible in Islam as long as they comply with Islamic teachings. Proponents state that there are no explicit Quranic verses or Hadiths that expressly forbid marking this milestone. As long as a birthday celebration is conducted modestly, without indulging in extravagance or acts contrary to Islamic principles, such as drinking alcohol or engaging in immoral behavior, it can be seen as a permissible social gathering. Now, if you would like to know the best way to celebrate your birthday, keeping in mind Islamic values, here are a few suggestions: 1. Express gratitude to Allah: Begin your special day by offering prayers and thanking Allah for all the blessings in your life - not only on your birthday but every day. 2. Give back to the community: Use the occasion as an opportunity to engage in charitable activities as a gesture of gratitude. Help the less fortunate, volunteer, or donate to a worthy cause. 3. Strengthen bonds: Birthdays can be a time to connect with family and friends. Prioritize modesty and simplicity by hosting a small gathering to strengthen relationships. 4. Engage in self-reflection: Use the time to evaluate your past year and envision goals for the upcoming one, in both your personal life and faith. Assess your spiritual growth and continue on your journey towards self-improvement. Addressing the multi-choice problem that you presented, I would say that these questions are *no*, not the same. While both are related to the topic of birthdays in the context of Islam, the first question addresses the permissibility of these celebrations from a religious standpoint, while the second question concerns the best way to celebrate one's birthday in adherence to Islamic values."},{"instruction":"Question: \\"Where in Asia did greke language and culture extend?\\" Context: \\"After Alexander the Great's ventures in the Persian Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west Asia (Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamon), north-east Africa (Ptolemaic Kingdom) and South Asia (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom). This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum. This mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca through the Hellenistic world.\\" Answer: A:","output":"The Greek language and culture extended to various regions in Asia as a result of the conquests and subsequent Hellenistic kingdoms established by Alexander the Great and his successors. The Hellenistic period, which stretched from 323 BCE to 31 BCE, witnessed the expansion of Greek influence and colonization throughout Asia, merging with local cultures and customs. The regions where Greek language and culture extended in Asia included: 1. Southwest Asia: After Alexander the Great's conquest of the Persian Empire, the Seleucid Empire was established, covering a vast area that included present-day Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, the Caucasus, and parts of Turkey. The Seleucid Empire played a crucial role in the dissemination of Greek culture and language throughout these regions. Important centers of Hellenistic culture like Seleucia and Antioch were founded in this region and adopted Greek as their official language. 2. Anatolia: The Kingdom of Pergamon, located in modern-day Turkey, was another Hellenistic realm where Greek culture and language flourished. Pergamon itself was a significant center of learning and culture, with its famous library rivaling the renowned Library of Alexandria in Egypt. Greek culture and language were deeply integrated into the society, with inscriptions and public buildings adorned with Greek art and architecture. 3. South Asia: Alexander's conquests extended as far as the Indus River in modern-day Pakistan. Although the Greek presence in India was relatively short-lived, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom became gateways for the diffusion of Greek culture and language into South Asia. The Greek city of Ai-Khanoum, located in present-day Afghanistan, was a prime example of Hellenistic culture, with Greek inscriptions, art, and architecture found throughout the city. 4. Central Asia: Following Alexander's conquests, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom emerged in what is now Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. The Greek language was widely spoken in this region, and several major cities, such as Bactra (modern Balkh), were known for their Hellenistic architectural and artistic styles. The fusion of Greek culture with the traditions of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia led to the development of a distinct Hellenistic civilization characterized by the diffusion of a common Attic-based dialect, Koine Greek. This language became the lingua franca of the Hellenistic world, unifying diverse Greek-speaking populations and facilitating the spread of Hellenistic culture throughout regions in Asia. In conclusion, the Greek language and culture extended throughout various regions in Asia during the Hellenistic period, including Southwest Asia, Anatolia, South Asia, and Central Asia. This expansion was driven by the conquests of Alexander the Great and the establishment of Hellenistic kingdoms, which encouraged the mingling of Greek and indigenous cultures; thus, creating a unique and diverse Hellenistic civilization."},{"instruction":"Teacher:Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

This shambolic excuse for a film is a prime example of how a novice director and an appalling script can band together to create an abysmal disaster. The film follows protagonist Tony (played by Brad Johnson) as he struggles to piece together his life after a dream that foreshadows an imminent catastrophe. What might have been an intriguing plotline in more capable hands is utterly squandered by a frivolous script that is rife with clichés and groan-worthy dialogue. The acting, far from elevating the film, adds to its ever-growing list of shortcomings. Brad Johnson's wooden performance in the lead role is nothing short of an assault on the senses and stands as a testament to Hollywood's infatuation with charm over talent. The rest of the cast does little to salvage the film's dignity as they spew out their lines like automatons with no emotional engagement. As for the visuals, cinematographer Jane Adams fails to provide the audience any semblance of artistry, opting for uninspired shots and banal, beige color palettes that leave a dull and drab aesthetic. The use of lighting only underscores the lifelessness of every scene, doing the film no favors and further emphasizing its tedious nature. The soundtrack by composer Joe King is equally unimaginative and only serves to contribute to the cacophony of mediocrity that defines A Disastrous Dream. Mundane instrumentals and cliché musical cues hinder the film's pace, making it difficult for the audience to endure the 90-minute runtime. Smith's use of symbolism and metaphor is heavy-handed and borderline insulting, as it unfolds with a deep lack of subtlety that leaves the audience feeling exasperated. The film's most egregious sin, however, lies in its director's inability to evoke any meaningful emotion, leaving one wondering whether there was any genuine intent behind creating this monstrosity. In summary, A Disastrous Dream is a filmic plague that should be avoided at all costs. It offers nothing in the way of entertainment nor intellectual stimulation, and serves as a blueprint on how not to create cinema. This convoluted mess falls short in every conceivable aspect, and its eventual disappearance into the annals of cinematic failure will be nothing short of a blessing."},{"instruction":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals.

Now the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are reopening the case. Article:","output":"Title: Rehtaeh Parsons Case Reopened: The Struggle for Justice Continues Introduction: The tragic story of Rehtaeh Parsons, a 17-year-old girl from Nova Scotia, Canada, has captured the attention of the world. Rehtaeh's parents have not given up on their quest for justice for their daughter, and now, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) have announced that they are reopening the case. This development comes after initial investigations did not result in any charges being pressed, leaving the family and the public in search of answers and accountability. The Incident: When Rehtaeh Parsons was just 15 years old, she allegedly endured a nightmarish experience that would impact her for the rest of her short life. In 2011, Rehtaeh attended a party where, according to her family, she was gang-raped by four of her classmates. The cruelty did not end there; a photo of the attack was reportedly taken by one of the assailants and shared around the school. This haunting image depicted one of the rapists smiling as he engaged in a non-consensual sexual act with Rehtaeh, while she was inebriated and vomiting out of a window. Initial Investigation: The horrifying incident was reported to the local police, prompting an investigation. However, the authorities ultimately decided not to press charges against the accused individuals, citing insufficient evidence. This decision led to widespread public outcry, with many questioning how such a heinous crime could go unpunished. The failure to hold the alleged perpetrators accountable deeply affected Rehtaeh, and in April 2013, she took her own life. RCMP Reopens the Case: After years of relentless efforts by Rehtaeh's family and growing public support, the RCMP has announced that they are reopening the case. With fresh eyes and renewed determination, the authorities are aiming to shed light on the previously overlooked aspects of the investigation and bring justice to Rehtaeh and her family. Conclusion: The reopening of Rehtaeh Parsons' case serves as a testament to the importance of perseverance in the pursuit of justice. While it does not guarantee a different outcome or the possibility of convictions, it does signify a renewed commitment by the authorities to thoroughly investigate the incident, as well as the hope that justice shall finally be served. For Rehtaeh's family and supporters, the opportunity to obtain closure and hold the alleged perpetrators accountable remains the ultimate goal, and this new development represents a step towards achieving that end."},{"instruction":"When you love someone, what will that person most likely do? Options: - give money - cost nothing - bring joy - last forever - hurt Step-by-step reasoning process below:","output":"Step 1: Identify the context of the question. The question is about the general outcomes of loving someone and the possible effects it may have on the person being loved. Step 2: Evaluate the options. Option 1: give money Loving someone doesn't necessarily mean that they will give money. While it might happen in some cases, it's not guaranteed or universal. Option 2: cost nothing Loving someone may not have a direct monetary cost, but it does require emotional investment, time, and effort. Therefore, it cannot be considered as costing nothing. Option 3: bring joy Loving someone often brings joy to the person being loved, as love provides emotional support, happiness, and a sense of belonging. This option seems like a likely positive outcome of love. Option 4: last forever As much as we might want love to last forever, relationships can change and love may not always be permanent. Although some relationships can last a lifetime, it's not a guaranteed outcome for everyone. Option 5: hurt It's possible that loving someone can lead to hurt due to misunderstandings, conflicts, or the end of the relationship. But it's not a guaranteed outcome, and love also has the potential to be a source of happiness and support. Step 3: Compare and choose the best option. Based on the evaluations above, the most likely outcome when you love someone is that they will \\"bring joy\\". However, it's important to remember that individual experiences may vary, and other options, such as \\"hurt,\\" could also occur depending on the relationship dynamics."},{"instruction":"Available options: a). , the man makes only toes and stuns when the balls strike the wood.; b). , the man hit a ball that enters the basket.; c). , the man hits the ball to the drain and start to play alone.; d). , the man puts an arrow in the pool and continues to play.;Choose from options above and answer: What most naturally follows?

This special kind of art can take the form of paintings, sculptures, cloth or even stickers. Street art has become part of a culture which can be seen around the world. Now, even art museums and galleries are collecting the works of street artists. People have different thoughts about street art. Some think street art is bad, but others see this art as a rich form of non-traditional cultural expression. Street art began in New York City in the 1960s. Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray their \\"tag\\" on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to show off themselves and their artwork. This style of drawing and writing became known as graffiti . Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits . One well-known street artist is Swoon. She cuts out paper images of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art but, as time went on, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's strong and interesting style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Nowadays street art has become part of a world-wide culture.

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center.

Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin.

Healthy people then give blood to the bank to replace the blood that is used. Blood can be kept in the fridge for about three weeks with a kind of chemical. When people lose much of their blood because of operations or accidents, they may need transfusions . Some people may need transfusions because of illness. Sometimes only a part of the blood is used for transfusions. Plasma , the liquid part of the blood , may be given alone. Transfusions of plasma are often given when people have been badly burned. When a person gets a transfusion, he gets blood of the same type as his. Or there may be a bad reaction . To make it safer, before a transfusion is given, the blood to be used must be tested with the blood of the person who is to receive it. This testing is called cross matching of the blood. Oswald Robertson, an American doctor, was the first one to give transfusions. He used blood that had been stored for some time to help wounded soldiers in 1918 in World War One.

Robbie got a job as a boat hand.","output":"The task requires you to selectively pick two sentences from the options given that will connect and make sense with the mentioned three-sentence story. Guidelines: 1. The story revolves around a character named Robbie and his encounter at sea. The choices you have to add in the story are a, b, and c. 2. To find the correct sentences that fit the story, you have to analyze each sentence carefully and consider if they help in creating a fluent and more understandable story. 3. Your selected sentences can fit in the story in any place, not necessarily in the order they are given. 4. If any two options seem plausible, preference should be given to the options that make the story more meaningful and impactful. Steps to solve: 1. Read the story and understand the premise. In this context, Robbie gets a job on a boat without any prior experience. During a rough sea, he falls into the water and is rescued by the captain who then reprimands him. 2. Go through the three additional sentence options. Analyze each. 3. Within the context of the story, b \\"Anna had to wash the entire load again!\\" does not make sense as it introduces a new character and action unrelated to the major events in the story. Hence, it can be eliminated. 4. Both remaining options, namely, a \\"Robbie got fired when they got back to shore\\" and c \\"Robbie got a job as a boat hand\\" fit into the story. 5. Since the title of the story mentions Robbie's lack of experience and the fact he was rescued and reprimanded by the salty captain suggests he was perhaps not very proficient at his job. Therefore, considering this context, choice a \\"Robbie got fired when they got back to shore\\" seems to make more sense than him getting a job. 6. Hence, after integrating your choices into the story the answer should be 'ac'. The final story: \\"He had no prior experience whatsoever. Robbie got a job as a boat hand. One day the seas get rough, and Robbie fell into the water. The salty captain rescued him, then rebuked him. Robbie got fired when they got back to shore\\".

The early study, published in Science Translational Medicine, shows the concept works on pig hearts. The British Heart Foundation describes it as a \\"novel approach\\" that requires further trials. Over half a million people in the UK have heart failure. It is a long-term condition that gradually gets worse over time. For people with the illness, the heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly - most commonly because cardiac muscle has been damaged, after a heart attack, for example. Scientists based at Harvard and the Boston Children's Hospital, and in Leeds, say their soft sleeve was inspired by the actions and structure of real heart muscle. The silicon-based device stiffens or relaxes when inflated with pressurised air. Fixing it around six pig hearts, scientists found they were able to synchronise the sleeve with each heart's shape and movements. The study shows the robotic sleeve helped boost the amount of blood being pumped around the body. And when the hearts stopped beating, the sleeves helped restore blood flow. Currently, mechanical devices can be implanted in the heart to help it pump. But because they are in direct contact with heart tissue, the body can react to them - leading to the risk of dangerous blood clots. Researchers argue their sleeve could help cut this risk by \\"hugging\\" the outside of the heart rather than being implanted inside it. But they acknowledge their research is still at an early stage and much longer-term animal studies and then human studies would need to be carried out before it could be used in patients. Christopher Allen, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: \\"People living with end-stage heart failure are in desperate need of symptom relief, and some will even require a heart transplant. \\"We currently don't have enough hearts available to meet the needs of those who require a heart transplant, so we're always looking for innovative new ways to buy time to give people the best chance possible of receiving a new heart and a new lease of life. \\"This early research suggests a novel approach to help support heart function, and it will be interesting to see if this translates successfully in human trials in the future.\\" This article was about:","output":"This article is about a novel medical device - a robotic sleeve made of silicon-based material inspired by the structure and action of heart muscle.

The innovative aspect of this approach is that by working outside the heart, the device may minimize the risk of blood clots associated with traditional implants. However, the researchers acknowledge further long term animal studies and human trials are needed. The British Heart Foundation commended this development due to the shortage of hearts available for transplants and the potential relief it could provide to patients with end-stage heart failure."},{"instruction":"How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? How can I check for gas leaks in pipes?","output":"Alright kiddo, let's say you want to check for gas leaks in pipes, like you're a detective looking for clues! Here are some simple steps: 1. Use your nose: Sometimes, you can smell a gas leak because it has a stinky odor, like rotten eggs. If you smell something like that, it could be a gas leak. 2. Soapy water: You can create a soapy water solution by mixing a little bit of dish soap into a cup of water. Stir it well! Then, ask an adult to help you brush or spray the soapy water onto the pipes. If you see bubbles forming, that could mean there's a leak. 3. Listen: Be extra quiet and listen carefully. If you hear a hissing or whistling sound near the pipes, it might be a gas leak trying to tell you it's there. Remember, always ask an adult for help when checking for gas leaks. If you find one or think there might be one, tell a grown-up and let them handle it to keep everyone safe."},{"instruction":"Give the step-by-step reasoning process and then the final answer. Bill is trying to count the toddlers at his daycare, but they keep running around. He double-counts 8 toddlers and misses 3 who are hiding. If Bill thinks he counted 26 toddlers, how many are there really?","output":"Step 1: Identify the total number of toddlers that Bill initially counted, which is 26. Step 2: Determine the number of toddlers who were double-counted, which is 8. Step 3: Determine the number of toddlers who were not counted at all since they were hiding, which is 3. Step 4: Calculate the number of 'extra' counted toddlers due to the double counting. Since 8 toddlers were double-counted, it means that there are 8 'extra' counted toddlers. Step 5: Calculate the corrected number of toddlers by removing the 'extra' counted toddlers from the initial count and then adding the toddlers who were hiding. Corrected number of toddlers = (Initially counted toddlers - 'Extra' counted toddlers) + Hidden toddlers Corrected number of toddlers = (26 - 8) + 3 Step 6: Perform the calculation to find the corrected number of toddlers.

To specifically examine responses of the gamma delta + T cell subset.', 'Proliferation of PsA synovial fluid lymphocytes (SFL) and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) cultured with streptococcal antigen was measured using a 3H thymidine (3HTdr) uptake assay system. gamma delta + T cells from PsA PBL and SFL were phenotyped by flow cytometry. Following culture with streptococcal antigen, gamma delta + enriched SFL were sorted by automated flow cytometry and 3HTdr uptake measured.', 'Patients with PsA and the control group did not differ significantly in their PBL responses to 2 strains of streptococci, one of which was isolated from a patient with guttate psoriasis (Strep 1) and the other from a patient with rheumatic fever (Strep 2).

SFL from 8 of 9 patients with PsA responded to both streptococcal strains as did SFL from 3 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). gamma delta + SFL from 7 patients with PsA 3 patients with RA responded only to the psoriasis associated strain. Answer: PsA PBL and SFL responded to stimulation by streptococcal antigen but this reactivity was not disease specific. We have demonstrated that gamma delta + T cells from PsA SF proliferated when cultured with a psoriasis associated strain of streptococcus (Strep 1). However, RA gamma delta + SFL responded similarly suggesting that gamma delta + T cell reactivity to streptococcal antigen may be a feature of inflammatory arthritis.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"In addition to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Cafe Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \\"bistro\\" means \\"quickly\\" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer.

Sentence 2: Alcohol and injury are not in the emergency opportunities. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. To understand why, let's first break down both of these sentences to understand their meanings and the differences between them. Sentence 1: Alcohol and injury in the emergency opportunities for intervention. This sentence implies that there is a relationship between alcohol and injury when it comes to emergency situations. More specifically, it suggests that there are opportunities for intervention in emergency settings, possibly to mitigate the negative effects of alcohol or to prevent injuries associated with alcohol consumption. Sentence 2: Alcohol and injury are not in the emergency opportunities. In this sentence, it is being stated that alcohol and injury are not part of the emergency opportunities. The meaning is quite unclear, and it's challenging to derive a specific interpretation. However, it seems to negate the idea that there are opportunities for intervention concerning alcohol and injury in the emergency context. The key difference between the two sentences lies in their stance towards the concept of intervention opportunities. The first sentence implies that emergency situations involving alcohol and injury present intervention opportunities, while the second sentence seems to negate (or at a minimum, be neutral) the existence of such opportunities. Therefore, it can be concluded that the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as it does not have the same implications or follow logically from the information presented in the first sentence."},{"instruction":"In this task your given two statements in Thai.

Input: What is the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Reza Zarrab ? Reza Zarrab once the lead defendant in a widespread money laundering investigation has pleaded guilty to money laundering and bank fraud among other charges according to court documents. On Tuesday his fifth day of testimony Zarrab estimated how much he made by laundering Iranian money for six years until he was arrested in Miami in 2016. \\"I don't remember exactly \\" Zarrab said. \\"It could be 100 million. It could be more than that maybe 150 million.\\" Although Zarrab has not said how much Iranian money he illegally moved through international banks an 0.4% cut matching his payout would mean that he helped Iran move 25 billion to 37 billion -- an astonishing number for a black-market operation spearheaded by a single man. During previous testimony in court Zarrab said that Iran had 3 billion at the Turkish state-owned Halkbank. It was those accounts that Zarrab says he was tasked with emptying to move Iranian funds. Atilla's defense lawyer Cathy Fleming appeared to attack Zarrab 's integrity by questioning him on Tuesday and Wednesday about how he spent his riches. Zarrab admitted that in 2013 he paid for prostitutes to satisfy \\"others \\" likely business partners and clients. He also said he was carrying 102 000 when he was arrested in March 2016 -- cash that the international bank fraudster and money launderer planned to spend on a family trip to Walt Disney World. \\"This was the money needed for our 10-day trip for seven individuals \\" Zarrab said. He also admitted that while in a US jail he used his Turkish lawyer to funnel 45 000 to a US prison guard. It was a bribe so that he could sneak alcohol into the jail and use the guard's cell phone to call family members in Turkey. Zarrab also admitted paying other jail inmates to use their phone time when his own 300-minute allotment was up. The closely watched trial took an unexpected turn Wednesday evening when Zarrab was sued by a former jail inmate who accused him of rape. According to the man's lawsuit Zarrab raped him assaulted him with his hands and sodomized him with a cucumber when they shared a cell earlier this year at Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center. Zarrab's attorney Benjamin Brafman told CNN by email: \\"Mr Zarrab vehemently denies this outrageous and patently false allegation. He intends to vigorously defend against this offensive lawsuit.\\" Last week Zarrab implicated top Turkish government officials when he testified that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who was prime minister at the time personally intervened in the scheme -- as well as former Turkish economy minister Zafer Caglayan.

The wreckers are responsible for a series of engineered shipwrecks in which they extinguish coastal warning beacons to cause ships to run aground on the rocky Cornish coast. Then they kill the surviving sailors and steal the cargo from the wrecks. Beautiful, young Mary Yellan (Maureen O'Hara) is travelling to Jamaica Inn in a carriage, but the driver is afraid to stop there and drives a long way past the inn in spite of her repeated demands that he stop. Instead, he drops her off near the home of the local squire and justice of the peace, Sir Humphrey Pengallan (Charles Laughton). She meets him and requests the loan of a horse so she can go back to Jamaica Inn. Pengallan warns her not to go there. Nevertheless, Mary says she just came from Ireland, and as the orphaned niece of Joss's wife Patience (Marie Ney), she intends to live at Jamaica Inn. Unable to convince her to stay, Pengallan accompanies Mary to Jamaica Inn. When Joss meets Mary, he tries to kiss her and push himself on her. Patience is distraught to learn her sister, Mary's mother, has died. When Mary tells Joss that Pengallan has accompanied her to Jamaica Inn, Joss goes upstairs and reports to Pengallan. We learn that Pengallan is the secret criminal mastermind behind the wrecking gang, who finds out when well-laden ships are passing near the coast, determines when and where the wrecks are to be done, disposes of the stolen cargo, and uses the booty to support his lavish lifestyle, passing a small fraction of the takings back to Joss and the gang.

She addresses the audience directly on her life and problems throughout the film. When a van stops by, she gives it the brush off, recalling the last time she serviced a man in a van: it turned out there were several other men in the van, who gang-raped her and left her for dead. A passer-by (Jack Nance) helps her to the hospital, and even pays her bill there. She sends him a thank you note. Liz isn't merely attempting to get a customer, however: she is attempting to escape her pimp, Blake (Benjamin Mouton). Blake is a well-dressed, businesslike and extremely controlling man who catches up with her at a convenience store. He demands money, and Liz has no choice but to agree though she gives him the finger as he leaves. As Liz stops off at a strip club for a drink, she explains how she ended up as she did: she was a small town girl, who married a violent drunk named Charlie (Frank Smith). Though they have a child together, she can no longer take it and leaves him, taking her son with her, as he's sleeping it off. She takes a job on the graveyard shift at a diner, and when a customer offers her more money to have sex with him, she decides, given her rather low pay, to take it. She does this independently for a time until she meets Blake, who takes her to LA. Though Blake does do some things for her (including getting her tattooed), he is ultimately as cruel as her husband, so she decides to escape from him. A local homeless person/street performer named Rasta (Antonio Fargas) decides to treat Liz to a movie. Though Rasta is a bit scary (his act involves walking on broken glass), Liz agrees.

As global temperatures continue to rise and weather patterns become more unpredictable, the conditions necessary for grapes to thrive may shift, ultimately leading to less grapes being grown. These effects can include: 1. Changes in temperature: Warmer temperatures can lead to earlier ripening of grapes, which might result in a lower quality wine. If temperatures rise too much, it can even lead to the death of the grapevines. 2. Water availability: Droughts and fluctuating precipitation patterns can lead to insufficient water supply for grapevines. Inadequate water, combined with higher temperatures, can reduce grape yield and quality. 3. Pests and diseases: Warmer climates can also bring about an increase in pests and diseases affecting grapevines. Higher temperatures and humidity levels can create a more favorable environment for pests and fungi to thrive, potentially causing more damage to grape crops. 4. Changes in suitable growing regions: As temperatures rise and precipitation patterns change, the areas suitable for grape cultivation may shift. Some areas may become less viable for grape production, while others might become more so, leading to an overall decrease in grape production. Overall, climate change is expected to have a negative impact on grape cultivation. As weather patterns become increasingly unstable and temperatures rise, grape growers may need to adapt their methods in order to maintain grape production and quality."},{"instruction":"Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what does botulism affect?\\" is \\"the skin\\", given that botulism affects neurons?

Answer: The international borders of the RSFSR touched Poland on the west; Norway and Finland on the northwest; and to its southeast were the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolian People's Republic, and the People's Republic of China. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Answer: The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), the largest and most populous republic within the Soviet Union, shared its western borders with several other constituent republics. To provide a comprehensive understanding, it is essential to differentiate between the Soviet republics within the USSR and foreign states outside the union. The western border of the RSFSR mainly consisted of seven Soviet republics: 1. Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic: To the southwest of the RSFSR lay the Ukrainian SSR. Sharing a long border with the RSFSR, the Ukrainian SSR was a crucial republic in the Soviet Union, known for its agricultural resources, industry, and population centers such as Kyiv and Kharkiv. 2. Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic: Positioned to the northwest of the Ukrainian SSR and the west of the RSFSR, the Belarusian SSR was a border region between the Soviet Union's Eastern European territories and its northern European neighbors. The capital of the Belarusian SSR was Minsk. 3. Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic: The northernmost of the Baltic republics, the Estonian SSR bordered the RSFSR to the northwest. The capital, Tallinn, lies on the coast of the Gulf of Finland and was an essential strategic port for the Soviet Union during the Cold War. 4. Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic: South of the Estonian SSR, the Latvian SSR also shared a border with the RSFSR to the north. With its capital Riga, the Latvian SSR played a significant role in the Soviet Union's economy and industry, particularly shipbuilding and manufacturing. 5. Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic: The southernmost among the Baltic republics, the Lithuanian SSR bordered Latvia to the north and the RSFSR to the east. The capital of the Lithuanian SSR was Vilnius. 6. Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic: In addition to Ukraine, the Moldavian SSR also touched the western border of the RSFSR. Located in the southwestern part of the Soviet Union, the Moldavian SSR was well known for its agricultural productivity. 7. Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic: The RSFSR shared a border with the Karelo-Finnish SSR in the northwest. Situated between Finland and the bulk of the Soviet Union's territories, the Karelo-Finnish SSR held a strategic position facing the Nordic countries. However, the Karelo-Finnish SSR was integrated into the RSFSR in 1956 and ceased to exist as a separate republic. To reiterate, the question about which Soviet countries the RSFSR border on the west was answered by identifying the seven neighboring Soviet republics on the western front. It is paramount to consider that the RSFSR was part of the USSR and shared its borders not only with other Soviet republics but also with several foreign states."},{"instruction":"Presidential Guidester polls voters, matches their positions with those of candidates.

So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare. The place looked pretty much the same as he remembered it, only three years worse off. The strip of grass outside the back door was parched yellow and paint peeled around the blown-out windows.

Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt.

Some Indian political parties boycotted the Commission because there were no Indians in its membership, and there were protests across the country. When the Commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928, Lala Lajpat Rai led a march in protest against it. Police attempts to disperse the large crowd resulted in violence. The superintendent of police, James A. Scott, ordered the police to lathi charge (use batons against) the protesters and personally assaulted Rai, who was injured. Rai died of a heart attack on 17 November 1928. Doctors thought that his death might have been hastened by the injuries he had received. When the matter was raised in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the British Government denied any role in Rai's death. Bhagat was a prominent member of the HRA and was probably responsible, in large part, for its change of name to HSRA in 1928. The HSRA vowed to avenge Rai's death. Singh conspired with revolutionaries like Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar, and Chandrashekhar Azad to kill Scott. However, in a case of mistaken identity, the plotters shot John P. Saunders, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, as he was leaving the District Police Headquarters in Lahore on 17 December 1928. Contemporary reaction to the killing differs substantially from the adulation that later surfaced. The Naujawan Bharat Sabha, which had organised the Lahore protest march along with the HSRA, found that attendance at its subsequent public meetings dropped sharply. Politicians, activists, and newspapers, including The People, which Rai had founded in 1925, stressed that non-co-operation was preferable to violence. The murder was condemned as a retrograde action by Mahatma Gandhi, the Congress leader, but Jawaharlal Nehru later wrote that: Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol, the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months each town and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India, resounded with his name. Innumerable songs grew about him and the popularity that the man achieved was something amazing. Answer this question \\"Who is Saunders?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Saunders was an Assistant Superintendent of Police, who was mistakenly shot by the plotters seeking to avenge Lala Lajpat Rai's death, as they intended to kill James A. Scott, the superintendent of police.

The competition was based upon the existing Sanremo Music Festival held in Italy since 1951. - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. - Information is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer. - The amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change over a single period (such as time or spatial period). There are various definitions of amplitude (see below), which are all functions of the magnitude of the difference between the variable's extreme values. In older texts the phase is sometimes called the amplitude. - Alternating current (AC), is an electric current which periodically reverses polarity, whereas direct current (DC, also dc) flows only in one direction with a single polarity either positive or negative. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electric energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions and electric lamps into a wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. The abbreviations \\"AC\\" and \\"DC\\" are often used to mean simply \\"alternating\\" and \\"direct\\", as when they modify \\"current\\" or \\"voltage\\". - Teleradio - Moldova is the state - owned national radio - TV broadcaster . It owns the TV channels Moldova 1 and TVMI and the radio channels Radio Moldova and Radio Moldova Internaional . TRM was admitted as a full active member of the European Broadcasting Union on 1 January 1993 , under its former name Radioteleviziunea Nationala din Moldova ( RTNM ) . - In physics and electrical engineering, a conductor is an object or type of material that allows the flow of an electrical current in one or more directions. A metal wire is a common electrical conductor. Electrical current is generated by the flow of negatively charged electrons, positively charged holes, and positive or negative ions in some cases. - Moldova (or sometimes ), or Moldavia, officially the Republic of Moldova, is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south. The capital city is Chiinu. - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - Radio Moldova (RM) is the first publicly funded radio broadcaster in Moldova. - The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) is an alliance of public service media entities, established on 12 February 1950. As of 2015, the organisation comprises 73 active members in 56 countries, and 34 associate members from a further 20 countries. Most EU states are part of this organisation and therefore EBU has been subject to supranational legislation and regulation. It also hosted debates between candidates for the European Commission presidency for the 2014 parliamentary elections but is unrelated to the institution itself. It is best known for producing the Eurovision Song Contest. EBU is a member of the International Music Council. - The European Commission (EC) is an institution of the European Union, responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the EU treaties and managing the day-to-day business of the EU. Commissioners swear an oath at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, pledging to respect the treaties and to be completely independent in carrying out their duties during their mandate. - Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , \\"techne\\", \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings. - Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light. - Moldova 1 is the national Moldovan television channel, operated by the national public broadcaster, TeleRadio-Moldova. - The International Music Council (IMC) was created in 1949 as UNESCO's advisory body on matters of music. It is based at UNESCO's headquarters in Paris, France, where it functions as an independent international non-governmental organization. Its primary aim is to facilitate the development and promotion of international music-making. - In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on or to heat the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.

The first step in this process was to convince groups of large states to combine to form a \\"princely union\\" through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger. Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the Rajpramukh of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was formed on 15 July 1948 from Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Malerkotla, Nalargarh, and Kalsia. The United State of Rajasthan was formed as the result of a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949. Travancore and Cochin were merged in the middle of 1949 to form the princely union of Travancore-Cochin. The only princely states which signed neither Covenants of Merger nor Merger Agreements were Kashmir, Mysore and Hyderabad., what would be the answer ?

Researchers from the University of Sydney are conducting a world-first study on newborn babies to investigate whether it is possible to predict whether a child will stutter even before they can talk. Sydney University's Australian Stuttering Research Centre are conducting the study in an attempt to discover the cause of stuttering, using 20 babies with a family history of the disorder and 20 without. 17-week old Levi Crellin was the first baby to take part in the study, after his older sister Zoe suffered from a debilitating stutter from the time she was two years old. 17-week old Levi Crellin was the first baby to take part in the study on the causes of stuttering","output":"The researchers are utilizing advanced brain imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), to monitor the brain activity of these infants as they listen to speech sounds. By comparing the brain responses of babies with and without a family history of stuttering, the researchers aim to identify specific neural patterns that may indicate an increased likelihood of developing the speech disorder. In addition to brain imaging, the infants are also being closely monitored in other aspects of their development. This includes tracking their language acquisition, motor skills, and social interactions over the course of several years. The comprehensive approach will allow researchers to gather a wealth of data to better understand the full spectrum of factors that might contribute to stuttering. The study's lead researcher, Professor Alice Scott, explains that while previous research has already established that genetics play a significant role in stuttering, the exact causes remain unknown. \\"By studying these babies from such an early age, we hope to shed light on the specific neural, genetic, and environmental factors that contribute to the development of stuttering. Understanding these factors could ultimately help us to develop better screening methods and more targeted interventions for children at risk.\\" Once the study is completed and the results have been analyzed, the researchers anticipate that their findings will not only provide valuable insights into the origins of stuttering but may also pave the way for innovative, early detection and prevention strategies. These strategies, in turn, could potentially minimize the social and emotional burdens faced by children who stutter and their families. For the Crellin family, their participation in the study represents a hope for a better future not only for their son Levi but also for thousands of other families around the world who face the challenges of stuttering on a daily basis. Zoe's father, Mark Crellin, said, \\"We want to do everything we can to help understand this condition and give Levi the best possible chance to avoid the struggles that Zoe has faced. Even if it's too late for Zoe, if this research helps just one child, then it's worth it.\\" In conclusion, the University of Sydney's groundbreaking study on newborn babies is set to revolutionize the way we understand and approach stuttering. By identifying the root causes of stuttering and developing early intervention methods, the researchers aim to make a significant and positive impact on the lives of those who stutter and their loved ones. With continued support for research into this complex and often misunderstood condition, there is hope for a future where stuttering can be predicted, managed, and ultimately overcome."},{"instruction":"My question is: Daniel owns a textile company. Every Monday he delivers 20 yards of fabric, and every Tuesday he delivers twice the amount of fabric he delivers on Monday. Every Wednesday, he delivers 1/4 of the amount of fabric he delivers on Tuesday. If each yard of fabric costs 2 and each yard of yarn costs 3, how much does he earn from Monday to Wednesday? Your thoughts:","output":"To determine how much Daniel earns from Monday to Wednesday, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Calculate the total amount of fabric and yarn delivered on each day. On Monday, Daniel delivers 20 yards of fabric. On Tuesday, he delivers twice the amount of fabric he delivers on Monday, which means he delivers 2 * 20 = 40 yards of fabric. On Wednesday, he delivers 1/4 of the amount of fabric he delivers on Tuesday, which means he delivers 1/4 * 40 = 10 yards of fabric. Step 2: Calculate the total earnings for each day. On Monday, Daniel earns 20 yards of fabric * 2 per yard = 40. On Tuesday, he earns 40 yards of fabric * 2 per yard = 80. On Wednesday, he earns 10 yards of fabric * 3 per yard (as it's yarn, not fabric) = 30. Step 3: Calculate the total earnings from Monday to Wednesday. Total earnings = Monday's earnings + Tuesday's earnings + Wednesday's earnings = 40 + 80 + 30 = 150.

It is caused by a virus called hepatitis B, which can be passed through sexual activity. Hepatitis B causes vomiting. It also causes yellowing of the skin and eyes. The disease goes away on its own in some people. Other people are sick for the rest of their lives. In these people, the virus usually damages the liver. It may also lead to liver cancer. Medicines can help prevent liver damage in these people. There is also a vaccine to protect against hepatitis B. Paragraph: Jennifer and Maria both had unprotected sex with the same man. This man, unbeknownst to them, has hepatitis b. Both women go to the doctor to get checked out. Jennifer reports that she is coughing frequently and has a congested nose. The doctor notices that Maria has yellow eyes and she tells the doctor that she has been throwing up. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will probably not be prescribed medicine for their liver? Answer:","output":"Based on the given background information and the paragraph provided, it is likely that Jennifer will probably not be prescribed medicine for her liver. This conclusion can be drawn from the fact that Jennifer's symptoms, namely coughing frequently and having a congested nose, do not align with the symptoms of hepatitis B. On the other hand, Maria exhibits symptoms that are more consistent with hepatitis B, as she presents with yellow eyes, and has been experiencing vomiting. Yellowing of the skin and eyes, also known as jaundice, along with vomiting are characteristic signs of hepatitis B, which is a disease that affects the liver. Consequently, Maria would be the one more likely to receive medication for her liver to help prevent liver damage. It is important to note that both women should still be thoroughly tested for hepatitis B, as well as any other sexually transmitted infections, given their unprotected sexual contact with a person who has hepatitis B. Moreover, it is crucial that they receive medical advice and potential treatment to safeguard their health and prevent further transmission of the disease."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Mycenaean Greece (or Mycenaean civilization) was the last phase of the Bronze Age in Ancient Greece (c. 16001100 BC). It represents the first advanced civilization in mainland Greece, with its palatial states, urban organization, works of art and writing system. Among the centers of power that emerged, the most notable were those of Pylos, Tiryns, Midea in the Peloponnese, Orchomenos, Thebes, Athens in Central Greece and Iolcos in Thessaly. The most prominent site was Mycenae, in Argolid, to which the culture of this era owes its name. Mycenaean and Mycenaean-influenced settlements also appeared in Epirus, Macedonia, on islands in the Aegean Sea, on the coast of Asia Minor, the Levant, Cyprus and Italy. - Alexander III of Macedon (20/21 July 356 BC 10/11 June 323 BC), commonly known as Alexander the Great (\\"Aléxandros ho Mégas\\" ), was a king (\\"basileus\\") of the Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon and a member of the Argead dynasty. Born in Pella in 356 BC, Alexander succeeded his father, Philip II, to the throne at the age of twenty. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders. - Herodotus (\\"Hródotos\\") was a Greek historian who was born in Halicarnassus in the Persian Empire (modern-day Bodrum, Turkey) and lived in the fifth century BC (484 425 BC), a contemporary of Socrates. He is widely referred to as \\"The Father of History\\" (first conferred by Cicero); he was the first historian known to have broken from Homeric tradition to treat historical subjects as a method of investigationspecifically, by collecting his materials systematically and critically, and then arranging them into a historiographic narrative. \\"The Histories\\" is the only work which he is known to have produced, a record of his \\"inquiry\\" (or \\"historía\\") on the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, including a wealth of geographical and ethnographical information. Some of his stories were fanciful and others inaccurate; yet he states that he was reporting only what was told to him and was often correct in his information. Despite Herodotus' historical significance, little is known of his personal history. - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. - Central Asia or Middle Asia is the core region of the Asian continent and stretches from the Caspian Sea in the west to China in the east and from Afghanistan in the south to Russia in the north. It is also colloquially referred to as \\"the 'stans\\" (as the six countries generally considered to be within the region all have names ending with the Persian suffix \\"-stan\\", meaning \\"land of\\") and is within the scope of the wider Eurasian continent. - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning. - The Greco-Persian Wars (also often called the Persian Wars) were a series of conflicts between the Achaemenid Empire of Persia and Greek city-states that started in 499 BC and lasted until 449 BC. The collision between the fractious political world of the Greeks and the enormous empire of the Persians began when Cyrus the Great conquered the Greek-inhabited region of Ionia in 547 BC. Struggling to rule the independent-minded cities of Ionia, the Persians appointed tyrants to rule each of them. This would prove to be the source of much trouble for the Greeks and Persians alike. - A tyrant (Greek , \\"tyrannos\\"), in its modern English usage, is an absolute ruler unrestrained by law or person, or one who has usurped legitimate sovereignty. Often described as a cruel character, a tyrant defends his position by oppressive means, tending to control almost everything in the state. The original Greek term, however, merely meant an authoritarian sovereign without reference to character, bearing no pejorative connotation during the Archaic and early Classical periods. However, it was clearly a negative word to Plato, a Greek philosopher, and on account of the decisive influence of philosophy on politics, its negative connotations only increased, continuing into the Hellenistic period. - Cleobulus (\\"Kleoboulos ho Lindios\\"; fl. 6th century BC) was a Greek poet and a native of Lindos. He is one of the Seven Sages of Greece. - Corinth (\\"Kórinthos\\") is a city and former municipality in Corinthia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality of Corinth, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit. It is the capital of Corinthia. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe. Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki. - Classical Greece was a period of around 200 years (5th and 4th centuries BC) in Greek culture. This Classical period saw the annexation of much of modern-day Greece by the Persian Empire and its subsequent independence. Classical Greece had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire and on the foundations of western civilization. Much of modern Western politics, artistic thought (architecture, sculpture), scientific thought, theatre, literature, and philosophy derives from this period of Greek history. In the context of the art, architecture, and culture of Ancient Greece, the Classical period, sometimes called the Hellenic period, corresponds to most of the 5th and 4th centuries BC (the most common dates being the fall of the last Athenian tyrant in 510 BC and the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC). The Classical period in this sense follows the Archaic period and is in turn succeeded by the Hellenistic period. - Archaic Greece was the period in Greek history lasting from the eighth century BC to the second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC, following the Greek Dark Ages and succeeded by the Classical period. The period began with a massive increase in the Greek population and a series of significant changes which rendered the Greek world at the end of the eighth century as entirely unrecognisable from the perspective of the beginning of that century. According to Anthony Snodgrass, the Archaic period in ancient Greece was bounded by two revolutions in the Greek world. It began with a \\"structural revolution\\" which \\"drew the political map of the Greek world\\" and established the poleis, the distinctively Greek city-states, and ended with the intellectual revolution of the Classical period. - The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism. - The Seven Sages (of Greece) or Seven Wise Men (Greek: , \\"hoi hepta sophoi\\"; c. 620 550 BC) was the title given by ancient Greek tradition to seven early-6th-century BC philosophers, statesmen, and law-givers who were renowned in the following centuries for their wisdom. - The Greek Dark Age, also called Greek Dark Ages, Homeric Age (named for the fabled poet, Homer) or Geometric period (so called after the characteristic Geometric art of the time), is the period of Greek history from the end of the Mycenaean palatial civilization around 1100 BC to the first signs of the Greek poleis, city states, in the 9th century BC. - Arion ( / æri.n / ; Greek : ) was a kitharode in ancient Greece , a Dionysiac poet credited with inventing the dithyramb : \`\` As a literary composition for chorus dithyramb was the creation of Arion of Corinth , '' The islanders of Lesbos claimed him as their native son , but Arion found a patron in Periander , tyrant of Corinth . Although notable for his musical inventions , Arion is chiefly remembered for the fantastic myth of his kidnapping by pirates and miraculous rescue by dolphins , a folktale motif . Herodotus ( 1,23 ) says \`\` Arion was second to none of the lyre - players in his time and was also the first man we know of to compose and name the dithyramb and teach it in Corinth '' . However J.H. Sleeman observes of the dithyramb , or circular chorus , \`\` It is first mentioned by Archilochus ( c 665 BC ) ... Arion flourished at least 50 years later ... probably gave it a more artistic form , adding a chorus of 50 people , personating satyrs ... who danced around an altar of Dionysus . He was doubtless the first to introduce the dithyramb into Corinth '' . Arion is also associated with the origins of tragedy : of Solon John the Deacon reports : \`\` Arion of Methymna first introduced the drama ( i.e. action ) of tragedy , as Solon indicated in his poem entitled Elegies \`\` . - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. - The Early Middle Ages (or early medieval period) marked the start of the Middle Ages of European History, lasting from the 6th to the 10th century C.E. The Early Middle Ages followed the decline of the Western Roman Empire and preceded the High Middle Ages (c. 10th to 13th centuries). The Early Middle Ages largely overlap with Late Ant1iquity. The term \\"Late Antiquity\\" is used to emphasize elements of continuity with the Roman Empire, while \\"Early Middle Ages\\" is used to emphasize developments characteristic of the later medieval period. - The Late Bronze Age collapse was a Dark Age transition period in the Aegean Region, Southwestern Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, a transition historians believe was violent, sudden and culturally disruptive. The palace economy of the Aegean Region and Anatolia that characterised the Late Bronze Age broke down to the isolated village cultures of the Greek Dark Ages. - Periander (died c. 587 BC), was the Second Tyrant of the Cypselid dynasty that ruled over Corinth. Perianders rule brought about a prosperous time in Corinths history, as his administrative skill made Corinth one of the wealthiest city states in Greece. Several accounts state that Periander was a cruel and harsh ruler, but others claim that he was a fair and just king who worked to ensure that the distribution of wealth in Corinth was more or less even. He is often considered one of the Seven Sages of Greece, men of the 6th century BC who were renowned for centuries for their wisdom. (The other Sages were most often considered to be Thales, Solon, Cleobulus, Chilon, Bias, and Pittacus.) - Homer (, \\"Hómros\\") is the name ascribed by the Ancient Greeks to the semi-legendary author of the two epic poems, the \\"Iliad\\" and the \\"Odyssey\\", the central works of Greek literature. Many accounts of Homer's life circulated in classical antiquity, the most widespread being that he was a blind bard from Ionia, a region of central coastal Anatolia in present-day Turkey. The modern scholarly consensus is that these traditions do not have any historical value. - Ancient Greece was a civilization belonging to a period of Greek history from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th-9th centuries BC to the end of antiquity (AD). Immediately following this period was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine era. Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the period of Archaic Greece and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was followed by the period of Classical Greece, an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars, lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedonia, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire. - The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water. - In Ancient Rome, a province (Latin: \\"provincia\\", pl. \\"provinciae\\") was the basic, and, until the Tetrarchy (293 AD), largest territorial and administrative unit of the empire's territorial possessions outside of Italy. The word \\"province\\" in modern English has its origins in the term used by the Romans. - A hymn is a type of song, usually religious, specifically written for the purpose of adoration or prayer, and typically addressed to a deity or deities, or to a prominent figure or personification. The word \\"hymn\\" derives from Greek (\\"hymnos\\"), which means \\"a song of praise\\". A writer of hymns is known as a hymnodist. The singing of hymns is called hymnody. Collections of hymns are known as hymnals or hymn books. Hymns may or may not include instrumental accompaniment. - The dithyramb (\\"dithurambos\\") was an ancient Greek hymn sung and danced in honor of Dionysus, the god of wine and fertility; the term was also used as an epithet of the god: Plato, in \\"The Laws\\", while discussing various kinds of music mentions \\"the birth of Dionysos, called, I think, the dithyramb.\\" Plato also remarks in the \\"Republic\\" that dithyrambs are the clearest example of poetry in which the poet is the only speaker. - Paros (Venetian: \\"Paro\\") is a Greek island in the central Aegean Sea. One of the Cyclades island group, it lies to the west of Naxos, from which it is separated by a channel about wide. It lies approximately south-east of Piraeus. The Municipality of Paros includes numerous uninhabited offshore islets totaling of land. Its nearest neighbor is the municipality of Antiparos, which lies to its southwest. - Dionysus (\\"Dionysos\\") is the god of the grape harvest, winemaking and wine, of ritual madness, fertility, theatre and religious ecstasy in ancient Greek religion and myth. Wine played an important role in Greek culture, and the cult of Dionysus was the main religious focus for its unrestrained consumption. He may have been worshipped as early as c. 15001100 BC by Mycenean Greeks; traces of Dionysian-type cult have also been found in ancient Minoan Crete. His origins are uncertain, and his cults took many forms; some are described by ancient sources as Thracian, others as Greek. In some cults, he arrives from the east, as an Asiatic foreigner; in others, from Ethiopia in the South. He is a god of epiphany, \\"the god that comes\\", and his \\"foreignness\\" as an arriving outsider-god may be inherent and essential to his cults. He is a major, popular figure of Greek mythology and religion, becoming increasingly important over time, and included in some lists of the twelve Olympians, as the last of their number, and the only god born from a mortal mother. His festivals were the driving force behind the development of Greek theatre. - Archilochus (\\"Arkhilokhos\\"; c. 680 c. 645 BC) was a Greek lyric poet from the island of Paros in the Archaic period. He is celebrated for his versatile and innovative use of poetic meters, and is the earliest known Greek author to compose almost entirely on the theme of his own emotions and experiences. - Roman Greece as described here is the period of Greek history affecting its subsequent constituent Roman provinces that followed the Roman victory over the Corinthians, at the Battle of Corinth (146 BC), until the adoption of the city of Byzantium by the Emperor Constantine as the capital of the Roman Empire (as Nova Roma, later Constantinople) in AD 330. - A myth is any traditional story consisting of events that are ostensibly historical, though often supernatural, explaining the origins of a cultural practice or natural phenomenon. The word \\"myth\\" is derived from the Greek word mythos, which simply means \\"story\\". Mythology can refer either to the study of myths, or to a body or collection of myths. Myth can mean 'sacred story', 'traditional narrative' or 'tale of the gods'. A myth also can be a story to explain why something exists. - Halicarnassus (or \\"Alikarnssós\\") was an ancient Greek city at the site of modern Bodrum in Turkey. It was located in southwest Caria on a picturesque, advantageous site on the Ceramic Gulf. The city was famous for the tomb of Mausolus, the origin of the word mausoleum, built between 353 BC and 350 BC, and one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. It was part of the Persian Empire (Achaemenid Empire) until captured by Alexander the Great at the siege of Halicarnassus in 334 BC. - A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience.

The 26-year-old admitted wanting to knock him out, to 'neutralise' him. Harvey was jailed for five years by Teesside Crown Court. Harvey told jurors the victim threatened to stab the woman at the house.","output":"Title: The Aggressive Action of Lee Harvey in Middlesbrough: A Glimpse into the Trial and Sentencing Introduction Lee Harvey, a 26-year-old man from Middlesbrough, has recently become the center of attention in the local news for his violent actions against another individual. The incident, which took place some time ago, has now reached its legal conclusion with the sentencing of Mr. Harvey by the Teesside Crown Court. In this article, we will delve deeper into the events and trial, analyzing the reasons behind Lee Harvey's aggressive behavior and the outcome of the judicial process. The Incident The initial event, which sparked the subsequent legal proceedings, involved Lee Harvey assaulting another man on the streets of Middlesbrough. Witnesses and video evidence from the scene showed that Harvey had violently punched, kneed, and kicked the victim for an extended period. During the trial, Harvey admitted that he wanted to knock the man out to \\"neutralize\\" him, an admission that would play a significant role in the prosecution's case against him. Harvey's Reasoning Though the violent actions of Lee Harvey were not contested, the trial brought forth his reasoning for the assault. Harvey's defense centered on the claim that the victim had threatened to stab a woman at the house they were all in. As a result, Harvey took it upon himself to defend the woman and neutralize the perceived imminent threat. It is important to note that the testimony of other individuals regarding the alleged threat played a key part in Harvey's explanation and subsequent trial. The Trial The case went to trial at the Teesside Crown Court. Here, jurors carefully considered Lee Harvey's testimony, cross-examinations, and evidence in order to reach their verdict. The prosecution questioned Harvey's claims that the assault was purely an act of self-defense or defense of others. The defense, however, focused on presenting Harvey as a man acting in the best interest of others and reacting to a dangerous situation. The jury weighed this evidence alongside the video footage of the decidedly brutal attack, considering whether Harvey's actions were justified based on his claims. While the reason given for the assault was taken into account, there was a strong focus on the disproportionate level of force used by Harvey, who had sought to incapacitate the victim entirely. By doing so, they assessed whether this level of force aligned with the principles of legitimate self-defense or defense of others. The Sentencing In light of the evidence and testimonies, the jury reached a decision. Lee Harvey was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison by the Teesside Crown Court. This sentence takes into account the severity of the assault, Harvey's deliberate use of excessive force, and the negative impact of his actions on the victim and community. Although Harvey had sought to neutralize a perceived threat, his actions ultimately landed him in jail. Conclusion The case of Lee Harvey serves as a cautionary tale for the wider public and showcases the importance of understanding the legal principles surrounding self-defense and the defense of others. It is not enough to claim one is protecting others from harm; the actions taken must align with the legal framework. The judicial process in this case has demonstrated that using excessive force, even in defense of another, can have severe consequences that lead to long-term penalties."},{"instruction":"Translate to German: It has been a solemn day for us here today: we have commemorated the fall of the Berlin Wall.

Due to his extensive background, Wilson is approached by Plame's CIA colleagues to travel to Niger and glean information as to whether yellowcake uranium is being procured by Iraq for use in the construction of nuclear weasons. Wilson determines to his own satisfaction that it is not.After military action is taken by George W.

For this example, let's say we're going to write a review for a fictional restaurant called \\"Food Fusion\\". Step 2: Mention specific details of the visit To make the review seem authentic, it's important to mention specific details or experiences from the visit. For example, we can talk about the date of the visit, the meal ordered, and the service received. Step 3: Describe the negative aspects of the experience Now, it's time to detail the issues encountered. For our review, let's say the restaurant had poor service, the food wasn't of good quality, and the ambiance was unpleasant. Step 4: Be honest and constructive While writing a negative review, it's necessary to be honest about the experience while remaining respectful and providing constructive criticism so the business can potentially learn from it. Step 5: Write the review Combining the information from Steps 1-4, the following is an example of a negative Yelp review for \\"Food Fusion\\": Title: Disappointing Experience at Food Fusion I visited Food Fusion last Saturday evening, excited to try some of their fusion cuisine that I'd heard a lot about. Unfortunately, the experience was far from satisfactory. When my friend and I sat down, it took a good 15 minutes before our waiter came to us, even though the place was not very busy at that time. We decided to order the shrimp tempura roll and the chicken tikka tacos, both of which sounded interesting. However, when the food finally arrived, it was a letdown. The shrimp tempura roll was soggy and flavorless, while the chicken tikka tacos were more like regular chicken tacos with a slight kick. The ambiance of the restaurant wasn't inviting either. The dim lighting made it challenging to see the menu, and the blaring music playing from the speakers made it difficult to hold a conversation. I wish I could say something positive about my experience at Food Fusion, but sadly this was not the case. I understand that every restaurant can have a bad day, but the combination of poor service, underwhelming food, and an unpleasant ambiance left me with no choice but to share my disappointment. I hope that Food Fusion takes this feedback into consideration and works towards improving the overall experience for its customers."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

In its last configuration, the electoral district included the communities of Fairview, Armdale, Cowie Hill, Fairmount and Kline Heights - all within the Halifax Regional Municipality. - The Nova Scotia New Democratic Party is a social-democratic provincial party in Nova Scotia, Canada. It is aligned with the federal New Democratic Party (NDP). It was founded as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in 1932, and became the New Democratic Party in 1961. It became the governing party of Nova Scotia following the 2009 Nova Scotia election. It is the first New Democratic Party in Atlantic Canada to form a government. Much of the party's success prior to the 2009 election was based in the urban areas of the provincial capital, Halifax, however the party's support has grown to the rest of Nova Scotia. - Manitoba is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada. It is one of the three prairie provinces (with Alberta and Saskatchewan) and Canada's fifth-most populous province with its estimated 1.3 million people. Manitoba covers with a widely varied landscape. The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west, the territories of Nunavut to the north, and Northwest Territories to the northwest, and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south. - Atlantic Canada is the region of Canada comprising the four provinces located on the Atlantic coast, excluding Quebec: the three Maritime provinces New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia and the easternmost province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The population of the four Atlantic provinces in 2011 was about 2,300,000 on half a million km. - The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) (from 1955 the \\"\\") was a social-democratic and democratic socialist political party in Canada. The CCF was founded in 1932 in Calgary, Alberta, by a number of socialist, agrarian, co-operative, and labour groups, and the League for Social Reconstruction. In 1944, the CCF formed the first social-democratic government in North America when it was elected to form the provincial government in Saskatchewan. In 1961, the CCF was succeeded by the New Democratic Party (NDP). The full, but little used, name of the party was Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Farmer-Labour-Socialist). - Responsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house. Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers have to have the privileges of the \\"floor\\" which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament. Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament. When the lower house has passed a motion of no confidence in the government, the government must immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election. - Graham Steele ( July 8 , 1964 , Winnipeg , Manitoba ) is a Canadian lawyer and former politician , having represented the constituency of Halifax Fairview in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 2001 - 2013 for the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party .

Bacharach, 89, said a panel of music experts should be used to decide on copyright issues. He told BBC News that he has seen \\"bad decisions made\\" and said the current situation was \\"messy\\". In one high-profile copyright infringement case, US jurors ruled that Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams had copied Marvin Gaye's Got To Give It Up in their song Blurred Lines. The Gaye family estate was awarded 7.3 million (Â£4.8 million) in damages, though an appeal has since been launched. Earlier this year, Ed Sheeran settled a 20m (Â£13.8m) copyright infringement claim against him in the US over his hit song Photograph.

It serves as a valuable lesson for users to be more cautious with their online presence and take preventive measures to ensure the protection of their sensitive information. To avoid falling victim to such hacking attempts, it is essential to implement rigorous security measures for all the online accounts connected to one's email address. This includes using unique and complex passwords for each account and employing two-factor authentication whenever available. Additionally, individuals should be vigilant about monitoring their account activity for any suspicious behavior. Moreover, companies offering cloud-based services must also take the responsibility of safeguarding their users' data.

After Neb is nearly killed, the castaways are able to push it into a boiling geyser and have crab meat for dinner. Afterwards, the men continue exploring and find a herd of wild goats which they try to catch. Then they find two unconscious English ladies, Lady Mary Fairchild (Joan Greenwood) and her niece Elena (Beth Rogan), who were shipwecked here by the same storm. Working together, the castaways find cover and protection in a cave which they call \\"Granite House\\", formerly inhabited by a now deceased castaway named Thomas Ayrton. A treasure chest later washes ashore, and in it the men find a variety of useful items, including rifles, nautical charts, and books such as Robinson Crusoe.

A:","output":"The TV show being produced is an adaptation of the 19th-century novel \\"Mysterious Island\\" by Jules Verne. This science fiction adventure series is set during the American Civil War and follows a group of castaways as they navigate their way through a strange and uncharted island after crash-landing there in a hot air balloon. The storyline explores themes of survival, teamwork, and adaptation to challenging circumstances. The show's main characters include Union soldiers Cyrus Harding, Herbert Brown, and Neb, who are joined by Union war correspondent Gideon Spillet and Confederate guard Pencroft. As the group bands together to explore the island and build a life for themselves, they face various dangers and discover unique phenomena that make their journey all the more mysterious. When they encounter Lady Mary Fairchild and her niece Elena, their dynamic takes a new turn, as they must now work together to keep all members of the group safe. Throughout the series, the audience is captivated by the castaways' constant struggle for survival, which includes encounters with monstrous creatures and hostile environments. They find shelter in a cave called \\"Granite House\\", which they make their new home. Over time, the team becomes increasingly resourceful, utilizing washed-up supplies found in a treasure chest and learning important information about the island from the books they uncover. Given the detailed setting, the TV show's production would likely require an emphasis on stunning visuals and well-developed, immersive environments. Filmmakers would need to successfully capture the diverse landscapes of the island—from lush jungles and rugged plains to ominous volcanoes. Additionally, the design and implementation of the many monstrous creatures, such as the giant crab, would need to appear both realistic and terrifying to keep audiences on the edge of their seats. The adaptation from the novel to a TV show would also provide an opportunity to explore character development in greater depth, allowing viewers to form connections and emotionally invest in the castaways' journey. Elements such as flashbacks to the characters' lives before the island and other narrative devices could be used to delve further into their personal stories. Overall, the show would be a thrilling blend of science fiction, adventure, mystery, and human drama, appealing to a wide audience and staying true to the timeless nature of Jules Verne's original work."},{"instruction":"Context: The 2010 United States Census reported that Marin County had a population of 252,409.

For each daily cup of non-cow’s milk they drank, children were 0.4 centimetres shorter than average for their age, according to a study published today in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. For each daily cup of cow’s milk they drank, children were 0.2 centimetres taller than average. The study suggests the more non-cow’s milk children drink, the lower their height. The height difference for a three-year-old who drank three cups of non-cow’s milk compared to three cups of cow’s milk per day was 1.5 centimetres, according to the study. This height difference is similar to the difference between major percentile lines on the World Health Organization growth chart, said lead author Dr. Jonathon Maguire, a pediatrician at St. Michael’s Hospital. This means drinking three cups of non-cow’s milk per day might move a child to the 15th from the 50th percentile for height, and vice versa, compared with other children their age. The study also found that children who drank a combination of cow’s milk and non-cow’s milk daily were shorter than average. This finding suggests adding some cow’s milk to a child’s diet did not reverse the association between non-cow’s milk consumption and lower height, said Dr. Maguire. The study did not examine why children who drank non-cow’s milk were shorter on average than those who drank cow’s milk, however the authors hypothesize that children who drink non-cow’s milk may consume less dietary protein and fat than those who drink cow’s milk, resulting in reduced growth. Height is an important indicator of children’s overall health and development, said Dr. Maguire. Cow’s milk has been a reliable source of dietary protein and fat for North American children, two essential nutrients to ensure proper growth in early childhood. But many parents are choosing non-cow’s milk for their children, which may have lower nutritional content, said Dr. Maguire. “The nutritional content of cow’s milk is regulated in the United States and Canada, while the nutritional contents of most non-cow’s milks are not,” he said. “The lack of regulation means the nutritional content varies widely from one non-cow’s milk product to the next, particularly in the amount of protein and fat.” Click here or on the infographic above for a larger version. For example, two cups of cow’s milk contains 16 grams of protein, which is 100 per cent of the daily protein requirement for a three-year-old child, according to the study. Two cups of almond milk beverage typically contains 4 grams of protein, which is only 25 per cent of the daily protein requirement for a three-year-old, who may not be receiving sufficient protein from other dietary sources, said Dr. Maguire. Researchers examined a total of 5,034 children between the ages of 24-72 months. Of those studied, 13 per cent drank non-cow’s milk daily, and 92 per cent drank cow’s milk daily. While the majority of children studied drank cow’s milk daily, the number who drank non-cow’s milk daily suggests its popularity has increased in recent years, said Dr. Maguire, possibly due to perceived health benefits. Because this shift is so recent, there is very little research on the effect of non-cow’s milk on childhood growth, he said. This makes it difficult for the average consumer to understand the pros and cons of choosing non-cow’s milk over cow’s milk for their child. “If products are being marketed as being equivalent to cow’s milk, as a consumer and a parent, I would like to know that they are in fact the same in terms of their effect on children’s growth,” said Dr. Maguire. All study participants were enrolled in the Applied Research Group for Kids (TARGet Kids!), collaboration between children’s doctors and researchers from St. Michael’s Hospital and The Hospital for Sick Children. The program follows children from birth with the aim of preventing common problems in the early years and understanding their impact on health and disease later in life. This study received funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research and the St. Michael’s Hospital Foundation. This paper is an example of how St. Michael's Hospital is making Ontario Healthier, Wealthier, Smarter. About St. Michael's Hospital St. Michael’s Hospital provides compassionate care to all who enter its doors.

Founded in 1892, the hospital is fully affiliated with the University of Toronto. ||||| Like most parents, Andrea Thompson works hard to make sure her toddler eats nutritious foods. The Toronto mother has been a vegan for four years and thinks carefully about the food she gives her two-year-old daughter, Everest Frenke. Sometimes she adds flax oil, peanut butter or hemp seeds to soy milk to ensure her daughter is getting important nutrients. \\"The soy milk I give her is fortified,\\" Thompson said. \\"She doesn't drink it very often, mostly in her cereal or her oatmeal.\\" Recognizing that more families are reaching for alternative milks such as soy, almond or rice over traditional cow's milk, researchers in Toronto set out to see if it has an impact on growth — an indicator of optimal nutrition. The team at St. Michael's Hospital turned to their ongoing study of about 5,000 children aged two to six who were recruited from primary-care practices in the city. The kids' heights and weights were measured and blood samples taken. Participating parents were surveyed about their child's diet to see if cow's milk offered a growth advantage over non-cow's milk. Among the children in the study, 13 per cent drank non-cow's milk, including goat's milk and plant-based alternatives. The others drank cow's milk daily. The researchers found that on average, a three-year-old having three cups of cow's milk a day grew 1.5 centimetres taller than a similar child consuming the same amount of alternative milk. The study's lead author, pediatrician Jonathon Maguire, and his co-authors reported the findings in Wednesday's issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Difference 'not tiny' \\"When you are only 2.5 feet high and you are that different it is a fairly sizable difference,\\" Maguire said. \\"How that plays out over childhood, what difference that makes to adult height, is not clear at the present time, but the difference at three years of age is detectable and not tiny.\\" What's driving the height difference? The investigators speculate that factors like certain proteins in cow's milk may contribute to height, based on other studies. It is a little bit unusual that the same standard isn't applied to the other alternative milks but they are marketed as being similar to cow's milk. - Dr. Jonathon Maguire For instance, two cups of cow's milk contains 16 grams of protein, which meets 100 per cent of the daily protein requirement for a three-year-old child, the researchers said. Two cups of almond milk beverage typically contains four grams of protein, which is only 25 per cent of the daily protein requirement for a three-year-old. Researchers can't fully explain the apparent height difference and what could be contributing to it. When they factored in age, sex, ethnicity, neighbourhood income and maternal height, the results did not change. In Canada, the nutritional content of cow's milk is standardized but non-cow's milk isn't, the researchers noted. In Canada, the nutritional content of milk is standardized but non-cow's milk isn't. (Melanie Glanz/CBC) \\"I think the whole reason to standardize was to protect children and provide adequate nutrients,\\" Maguire said. \\"It is a little bit unusual that the same standard isn't applied to the other alternative milks but they are marketed as being similar to cow's milk.\\" What's driving family's choices The takeaway is that there's just an association between drinking non-cow's milk and height, but you can't say it makes you shorter, said Dr. Peter Nieman, a community pediatrician in Calgary who was not involved in the study. The number of children drinking non-cow's milk has been growing steadily over the past 10 years. In Nieman's practice, more families are avoiding dairy, more for medical reasons than social or environmental ones, although he says that's a growing segment. When talking to families, Nieman said it's important to know what's driving their decision. \\"If they tell me they did it for environmental reasons, maybe they're vegan, I would have to respect that and work with them and help them follow a lifestyle that is healthy and that is safe,\\" Nieman said. I can't tell you what to do, but because the neighbour is doing it or because more people and more people are doing it doesn't make it right necessarily. - Dr. Peter Nieman \\"If it's just something that's a fad because the neighbour's doing it, then I think you can work with those people and explain,\\" he added. \\"I can't tell you what to do, but because the neighbour is doing it or because more people and more people are doing it doesn't make it right necessarily.\\" Nieman said the findings stimulate conversation but more, longer-term information is also needed. For her part, Thompson is conscious about giving her daughter foods rich in protein and other nutrients, such as hummus, nut butters, tofu and tempe. \\"I converse with many vegan parents,\\" Thompson said. \\"We know that really store-bought almond milk is advertised as a diet food, low calorie, low fat. It is not a toddler food.\\" Thompson thinks much more research is needed before saying there's a true causal link between drinking alternative milks and shorter height. The study was funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research and the St. Michael's Hospital Foundation. |||||","output":"A study has found that children who drink non-cow’s milk, including both other animal milks and plant-based alternatives, are shorter on average than those who drink cow’s milk.

BP America President Lamar McKay and Transocean President Steven Newman will appear before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in the morning and then the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in the afternoon. BP leased from Transocean the oil rig that exploded off the Louisiana coast last month, starting the spill. Senators are expected to quiz McKay and Newman about the precautions taken before the blast that set off the underwater gusher and the steps being taken to stop the spill. Experts also are expected to testify on the possible impact of the spill on fishing, tourism and local economies. Also on Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano plans to travel to Mobile, Alabama, \\"to inspect ongoing operations to minimize the Deepwater BP Oil Spill's impact on public health, the environment and the economy,\\" the Deepwater Horizon Joint Information Center said in a statement. Napolitano and Alabama Gov. Bob Riley plan to talk with reporters late Tuesday afternoon, the center said. A change in the weather could push more oil from BP's Deepwater Horizon site into the Mississippi Delta region and areas west of the river, according to Gov. Bobby Jindal, who called the development \\"bad news for Louisiana.\\" Louisiana has been mostly spared since the oil rig exploded April 20 and sank two days later about 50 miles off the southeast coast of Louisiana. The catastrophe is sending 210,000 gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico each day. Most of the slick has been centered in an area east of the environmentally sensitive delta. \\"We've said all along that the oil coming west of the river would pose a whole new set of challenges,\\" Jindal said at a Monday news conference. He detailed efforts to place booms and other restraining devices into four passes near Grand Isle to prevent the oil from reaching land. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasters had warned over the weekend that the Mississippi Delta and areas to the northeast of it -- including Breton Sound, the Chandeleur Islands and the mainland behind them -- could see oil hit the coast by Tuesday. So far, the spill has had little impact on wildlife, said Mark J. Musaus, deputy director of the Southeast region for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Only a few birds have been taken to a wildlife rehabilitation center at Fort Jackson, Louisiana, he said. Two of them, a gannet and a pelican, were released Monday back into the wild. Another oiled pelican was still in the treatment center, as was a green heron, he said. The stakes are high for residents of coastal Louisiana who make their living from fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. The government has closed parts of the Gulf to fishing. The affected area, which is east of the Mississippi Delta, comprises about 4.5 percent of the Gulf of Mexico, NOAA said. Hundreds of thousands of feet of boom and large volumes of dispersants continued to be deployed in an effort to capture or break up the spilled oil moving toward the Gulf coastline. Thousands of workers and volunteers also have been skimming the water's surface. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"There is a big oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that is growing and getting closer to the Mississippi Delta. Important people from the companies involved, like BP America and Transocean, will be asked some questions by the Senate to find out how this happened and what they are doing to fix it. People are also worried about how this oil spill can affect fishing, tourism, and local businesses. There might be more bad news for Louisiana because oil might reach more parts of the coast and harm the environment and animals. There are many people working together to try to stop the oil from reaching the land, using things like booms to block it and chemicals to break it up."},{"instruction":"Write a title: Andre Agassi lost the Stockholm Open final in a third-set tibreaker to Sweden #39;s Thomas Johansson, who won 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (4) Sunday to capture this tournament for the second time.","output":"Title: \\"Thomas Johansson Triumphs Over Andre Agassi in Stockholm Open Final, Securing Second Tournament Victory\\""},{"instruction":"What is the answer to this question? where is mt rushmore located in south dakota?","output":"To find the answer to this question, I would follow these steps: 1.

The Mandarin-language Gēnǚ hóng mǔdān (歌 女 紅 牡 丹, Singsong Girl Red Peony), starring Butterfly Wu, premiered as China's first feature talkie in 1930. By February of that year, production was apparently completed on a sound version of The Devil's Playground, arguably qualifying it as the first Australian talking motion picture; however, the May press screening of Commonwealth Film Contest prizewinner Fellers is the first verifiable public exhibition of an Australian talkie. In September 1930, a song performed by Indian star Sulochana, excerpted from the silent feature Madhuri (1928), was released as a synchronized-sound short, the country's first. The following year, Ardeshir Irani directed the first Indian talking feature, the Hindi-Urdu Alam Ara, and produced Kalidas, primarily in Tamil with some Telugu. Nineteen-thirty-one also saw the first Bengali-language film, Jamai Sasthi, and the first movie fully spoken in Telugu, Bhakta Prahlada. In 1932, Ayodhyecha Raja became the first movie in which Marathi was spoken to be released (though Sant Tukaram was the first to go through the official censorship process); the first Gujarati-language film, Narsimha Mehta, and all-Tamil talkie, Kalava, debuted as well. The next year, Ardeshir Irani produced the first Persian-language talkie, Dukhtar-e-loor. Also in 1933, the first Cantonese-language films were produced in Hong Kong -- Sha zai dongfang (The Idiot's Wedding Night) and Liang xing (Conscience); within two years, the local film industry had fully converted to sound. Korea, where pyonsa (or byun-sa) held a role and status similar to that of the Japanese benshi, in 1935 became the last country with a significant film industry to produce its first talking picture: Chunhyangjeon (春香 傳 / 춘향전) is based on the seventeenth-century pansori folktale \\"Chunhyangga\\", of which as many as fifteen film versions have been made through 2009.

Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases.

He is also a former motorsport engineer and Formula One team principal. He had worked for a number of Formula One teams, serving as the technical director of the championship-winning Benetton and Ferrari teams. He took a sabbatical from the sport in 2007 but returned to F1 for the 2008 season as Team Principal of Honda. His career in motorsport began in 1976 when he joined March Engineering in the town of Bicester as a milling machine operator. Soon afterwards he joined their Formula 3 racing team as a mechanic. Brawn was hired by Sir Frank Williams in 1978 as a machinist for the newly formed Williams team. He quickly moved up through the ranks, working in the R&D department with Frank Dernie and as an aerodynamicist in the team's wind tunnel. Brawn joined the Haas Lola team in 1985 and was part of Neil Oatley's design team at FORCE that produced both the Lola THL1 and THL2 cars used by the team. However, with the 4 cylinder Hart engine in the THL1 and the new Ford V6 turbo powering the THL2, results were scarce against teams like McLaren and Williams with their TAG-Porsche and Honda turbo engines. This was despite the cars generally being regarded by most in the F1 paddock as being the best handling cars on the grid, as well as having 1980 World Champion Alan Jones and former factory Ferrari and Renault driver Patrick Tambay as the drivers. When the Haas team left F1 at the end of the 1986 season, Brawn moved to Arrows. There he designed the Megatron powered Arrows A10 and its update, the A10B for the 1987 and 1988 seasons respectively and the Ford V8 powered Arrows A11 used in 1989. Later in 1989 Brawn moved to the Jaguar Sportscar racing division, and was lead designer on the Jaguar XJR-14 which won the 1991 World Sportscar Championship.

Clemens was hit by Seymour and suffered an ankle injury on the play and did not return to the game. Wilson also became the Patriots' 21st player to score a touchdown on the season, tying an NFL record set by the Denver Broncos in 2000 and Los Angeles Rams in 1987. On their ensuing possession, the Jets gained 49&#160;yards on an option play to running back Leon Washington, but then failed a fourth down conversion from the Patriots' 17-yard line.

A 1-yard Maroney touchdown run a play later gave the Patriots a 17-7 lead going into halftime. Gostkowski's extra point, his 67th of the season, broke Uwe von Schamann's single-season record of 66 with the Miami Dolphins in 1984. A Jets punt gave the Patriots the ball at their own 9-yard line early in the third quarter. After two Maroney rushes for a total of 5&#160;yards, a Brady pass on third down intended to Moss was intercepted by Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis. The Jets moved into the red zone, but were driven back on a Thomas Jones run for a 1-yard loss and a delay of game penalty. On third down, Pennington completed a 10-yard pass to Baker, who then fumbled. Wilson recovered it for the Patriots, but a subsequent exchange of punts kept the third quarter scoreless. Another Hanson punt began the fourth quarter, giving the Jets the ball from their own 15-yard line. The Jets then embarked upon a 17-play drive where Pennington completed 10 passes on 12 attempts, none for more than 14&#160;yards. The drive ended at the Patriots' 15-yard line, where the Jets cut the Patriots' lead to 17-10 on a 33-yard Mike Nugent field goal. The Patriots' ensuing drive began with two incompletions intended for Moss. On third down, Brady completed a 16-yard pass to Moss, and then a 46-yard pass to Moss to give the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 14-yard line. A 4-yard Maroney run, incompletion, and sack for a loss of 6&#160;yards set up a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Jets' next possession ended in a 35-yard missed Nugent field goal, and the Jets failed to score on their final drive to give the Patriots a 20-10 win. It gave the Patriots a 14-0 record, tying them with the 1972 Miami Dolphins for the best record to start a season. The win also clinched home-field advantage throughout the playoffs for the Patriots.

To understand the reasoning behind this equation, let's break it down: 1. The equation is written in the form of expressing a percentage. 2. The percentage is based on a part (9) out of the whole (40). 3. To establish the value of 'R' which indicates the percentage, we need to determine the ratio of the part (9) to the whole (40) and convert it into percentage. Now let's solve the equation for R: 9 = (1 * 40 * R) / 100 9 = 40R / 100 9 * 100 = 40R 900 = 40R R = 900 / 40 R = 22.5 So, R = 22.5% Possible question and answer pair for this scenario: Question: \\"What percentage of the whole does the number 9 represent in a set of 40?\\" Answer: \\"The number 9 represents 22.5% of the whole set of 40.\\""},{"instruction":"Given an adjective, generate its antonym.

This character was a central figure in Catherine Tate's popular British comedy sketch show, \\"The Catherine Tate Show,\\" which aired from 2004 to 2007. Lauren Cooper is an iconic character and is especially recognized for her catchphrase \\"Am I bovvered?\\" – which translates to \\"Do I look bothered?\\" in standard English. The character is a challenging and rebellious teenage schoolgirl who is easily identifiable by her uniform and her distinct London accent. The show often displays Lauren in humorous and challenging situations with authority figures such as her teachers, her headmaster, and even her parents. Lauren's stubborn refusal to back down along with her continuous use of street-slang make the interactions hilariously engaging for the audience. The sketches are primarily set in a British secondary school and occasionally feature other regular characters from “The Catherine Tate Show.” Lauren Cooper became so popular and influential that in 2006, Catherine Tate was invited to perform a sketch as Lauren Cooper alongside Tony Blair, who was the Prime Minister of the U.K at the time, as part of the Comic Relief charity event.

The premise explicitly states that \\"we still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans.\\" This information directly contradicts the hypothesis, as it confirms the presence of bins for bottles and cans at the grocery store. The premise suggests that there are still facilities available in grocery stores for customers to bring in and turn in bottles and cans, likely for recycling or refund purposes. This practice is common in many areas where recycling programs are in place, incentivizing people to recycle their bottles and cans by offering monetary redemption values. For example, many regions in the United States have a bottle bill or container deposit legislation that provides a financial incentive for consumers to return their empty bottles and cans to a designated location for recycling. By offering such bins in grocery stores, retailers encourage and facilitate eco-friendly behavior among customers, which ultimately benefits the environment through reduced waste. As recycling efforts increase, the demand for raw materials decreases, leading to a decrease in the exploitation of resources and energy consumption. The premise also implies that there is the potential for monetary gain when turning in bottles and cans at the grocery store, as it mentions \\"getting that two cents.\\" This part of the statement seems to refer to the value assigned to specific types of containers (e.g., aluminum cans or plastic bottles) that may vary depending on the jurisdiction's recycling policies.

Ricketts Glen State Park is in five townships in three counties. After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of Northumberland County, but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County. Within Luzerne County, the majority of the park, including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean, is in Fairmount Township, which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834; the easternmost part of the park is in Ross Township, which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842. The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County, which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while Colley Township, which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849.

A:","output":"Based on the information provided in your text, the current name for what was once called Long Pond is now Lake Ganoga. Around 1800, a hunter named Robinson, the first known inhabitant in the area, had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond.

You may recall that I’d been helping out a local charity with their website? Well that is all completed now but I’ve had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

It takes the form of a story, usually with dialogue, and ends in a punch line. It is in the punch line that the audience becomes aware that the story contains a second, conflicting meaning. This can be done using a pun or other word play such as irony, a logical incompatibility, nonsense or other means. Linguist Robert Hetzron offers the definition: - Alternative comedy is a term coined in the 1980s for a style of comedy that makes a conscious break with the mainstream comedic style of an era but can also be found in cartoons. The phrase has had different connotations in different contexts: in the UK, it was used to describe content which was an \\"alternative\\" to the mainstream of live comedy, which often involved racist and sexist material. In other contexts, it is the nature of the form that is \\"alternative\\", avoiding reliance on a standardised structure of a sequence of jokes with punch lines. Patton Oswalt has defined it as \\"comedy where the audience has no pre-set expectations about the crowd, and vice versa. In comedy clubs, there tends to be a certain vibealternative comedy explores different types of material.\\" - James Roderick Moir (born 24 January 1959), better known by the stage name Vic Reeves, is an English comedian, artist, actor and television presenter, best known for his double act with Bob Mortimer (see Vic and Bob).

Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - Vic and Bob, also known as Reeves and Mortimer, are a British comedy double act consisting of Vic Reeves (born 24 January 1959, real name James Roderick Moir) and Bob Mortimer (born 23 May 1959).

It all has to do with temperature. Changes in matter are affected by temperature. For example, what if you place a cake in the oven and you leave it in too long? What do you think will happen? Thats right, it will probably burn. The same thing will happen if the oven setting is too high and you apply too much heat. In either case, heat has affected the rate of change in matter. Its probably obvious that when the temperature is increased a chemical change, like cooking, will occur faster. What about a physical change? Are physical changes affected by temperature? Most of us have seen steam rising off a wet road after a summer rainstorm. This happens because the road surface is very warm. The warm road and warm air temperature causes the water to evaporate quickly. The liquid water is turning into water vapor, but it is still water. The evaporation of water is a physical change.

I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Among other things, this theory suggests that gas molecules are in constant motion, and the average speed of the individual gas particles is dependent upon temperature – the higher the temperature, the faster the molecules move. It is not just gas particles that are in constant motion. The molecules and ions that make up liquids and solutions are also continually moving in nearly random directions. As a result, molecules and ions in a solution will collide with one another fairly frequently. As with gases, a temperature increase will produce an increase in the average particle speed. I am facing a new situation today: Scientists are observing two of the same gases at different temperatures. They are observing the speed of the particles in the gases to see how fast they are moving. Gas A has particles moving very quickly, but Gas B has particles that are hardly moving at all. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which gas is at a lower temperature?","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the situation you described, we can infer that the gas with particles moving at a slower speed must be at a lower temperature. In the case of Gas A and Gas B, since Gas B's particles are hardly moving at all compared to the fast-moving particles of Gas A, we can conclude that Gas B must be at a lower temperature. The kinetic-molecular theory of gases explains how the behavior of gas molecules is greatly influenced by temperature. As the temperature of a gas increases, so does the kinetic energy of its particles, causing them to move more rapidly. Conversely, as the temperature of a gas decreases, the kinetic energy of its particles is reduced, resulting in slower movement. In the situation described, the scientists are observing two gases with differing particle speeds. Gas A's particles are moving very quickly, implying higher kinetic energy and, therefore, a higher temperature. On the other hand, Gas B's particles are hardly moving, signifying lower kinetic energy and a lower temperature. In conclusion, according to the kinetic-molecular theory, Gas B, which has particles that are hardly moving at all, is at a lower temperature compared to Gas A, with faster-moving particles. This correlation between particle speed and temperature is a direct outcome of the behavior of gases as explained by the kinetic-molecular theory."},{"instruction":"This is an email The only problem I can see with this is that paragraph 4 could be construed to encourage NMNG to request amendment not only to increase the MAXDTQ but also to decrease it (if the MAXDTQ has been increased by a previous amendment).

The insurance for the car was more expensive than the insurance for the truck because the","output":"car was deemed to be a higher risk by the insurance company for several reasons, including the type of vehicle, its safety features, the driver's profile and driving history, the car's primary use, and the geographical location where it would be operated. Firstly, the type of car plays a significant role in determining insurance premiums. In this case, the car might have been a high-performance sports car or a luxury vehicle, which generally comes with a higher price tag and a higher likelihood of theft or involvement in accidents. On the other hand, the truck could be a more modest and robust vehicle with generally lower repair or replacement costs, thus translating into more affordable insurance rates. Secondly, some cars are equipped with more advanced safety features than others, which can significantly impact insurance costs. The car in question could have fewer safety features or a lower safety rating compared to the truck, resulting in a higher risk of severe injuries or fatalities in case of an accident. Insurance providers would factor this in when calculating the premiums, making the car insurance more expensive. The driver's profile and driving history are also critical factors in determining insurance rates. If the person driving the car has a track record of traffic violations, accidents, or has been deemed a high-risk driver due to their age or driving experience, the insurance company might charge more for their coverage. Conversely, the driver of the truck may have a clean driving record and is considered a safer and more responsible driver, leading to lower insurance premiums. Another factor to consider is the car's primary use. If the car is primarily used for personal use and is driven more frequently, especially amid heavy traffic or over long distances, it may be considered a higher risk for accidents than the truck. The truck, on the other hand, could be used for commercial purposes involving less time spent on the road or potentially more predictable, safer routes. This difference in usage patterns would reflect in their respective insurance costs. Lastly, the geographical location where the car and truck are operated also affects insurance costs. If the car is typically driven in urban areas with heavier traffic and higher crime rates, it will inevitably be considered a higher risk compared to the truck, which might be more likely to operate in rural or less congested areas. In summary, the insurance for the car was more expensive than the insurance for the truck because the car was identified as a higher risk vehicle due to a range of factors, including its type, safety features, driver profile and history, primary use, and area of operation. These aspects all contributed to the overall difference in insurance premiums and the car's higher insurance costs."},{"instruction":"What is the question to: \\"LSD is non-addictive, is not known to cause brain damage, and has extremely low toxicity relative to dose .\\"?

This implies that Remy is likely short on funds or in a financial bind. Step 2: Analyze the suggested action \\"Spend even more money in protest\\" suggests that Remy would continue to spend money despite their financial situation, and do so as an act of defiance or to make a statement. Step 3: Evaluate the rationality of the action It would be irrational for someone in need of money for rent to continue spending more money intentionally, especially if it worsens their situation. Step 4: Compare the action to Remy's goal Remy's goal is to have enough money to pay rent. Spending more money in protest would further distance them from their goal. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, \\"Spend even more money in protest\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will Remy want to do next?\\" since it is an irrational action that goes against Remy's goal of paying rent.

Nathan Deal promised, possibly including criminal charges. Hall left her job of her own volition last week, but her interim replacement promised dismissals following the report. Teachers told investigators that they felt pressure to cheat on students' behalf—four even recalled a “changing party,” where they doctored tests using answer sheets from a school official, according to the AP. “Dr. Hall and her administration emphasized test results and public praise to the exclusion of integrity and ethics,” the report concluded.

As her career soared and accolades rolled in, few dared to question the meteoric rise in academic performance. However, a recent state investigation has exposed the ugly truth behind Atlanta's glowing educational reputation. According to the New York Times, the investigation revealed widespread cheating facilitated by Hall's administration, which not only covered up these corrupt practices but also retaliated against educators seeking to report the dishonesty. The alarming findings have left people across the country questioning the integrity of a system once lauded for its achievements. Governor Nathan Deal has indicated that serious consequences will follow, including possible criminal charges against those involved. While Hall voluntarily stepped down last week, her interim replacement has vowed to take decisive action in response to the report, including dismissing those found to be culpable. The culture of wrongdoing seemingly permeated every level of the education system, with teachers admitting to investigators that they felt compelled to cheat on behalf of their students. In one of the most jaw-dropping details to emerge, four teachers recounted participating in a \\"changing party,\\" where they doctored tests using answer sheets provided by a school official. The Associated Press revealed that the intense pressure to produce results overrode any ethical considerations and fostered a climate in which dishonesty thrived. The report minces no words in pointing the finger squarely at Hall, stating that she and her administration prioritized test results and public praise above all else, with no regard for integrity and ethics. The lengths to which the administration went to conceal their actions speak to a broader issue plaguing the American education system: an obsessive focus on quantifiable results at the expense of genuine learning and intellectual growth. Although Hall's attorneys maintain that she \\"steadfastly denies\\" any knowledge of the cheating, it’s difficult to imagine how such widespread and systematic malfeasance could have occurred without her awareness, or at least her willful ignorance. It remains to be seen whether criminal charges will be brought against Hall and other administrators, but the damage to Atlanta's education system has already been done. The trust between students, parents, and educators has been severely eroded, and the fallout will likely be felt for years to come. This tragic scandal serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of a single-minded pursuit of success at any cost. While high test scores and public praise may have once made Atlanta the envy of the nation, the bitter truth that has now emerged paints a very different picture.

Some thinking first:","output":"In order to determine if the hypothesis \\"It is not raining\\" is entailed by the given premise \\"People are sitting on benches in a plaza,\\" we need to think carefully about the relationship between the two statements. 1. The premise describes a scenario where people are sitting on benches in a public place (plaza). This could suggest that the weather is not so extreme or unpleasant that they cannot sit outdoors. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that it is not raining. 2. It is also worth considering that people may still sit on benches in light rain or even in heavy rain if they have some form of protection, such as umbrellas or a covering provided within the plaza. 3.

Bennett said his client, married for 26 years, will not reveal her identity because \\"she and her husband see no value in revisiting this matter now nor in discussing the matter any further publicly or privately.\\" \\"In fact,\\" he added, \\"it would be extremely painful for her to do so.\\" Bennett released the statement after reaching an agreement to do so with the National Restaurant Association, the organization headed by Cain during the time of the alleged harassment. The group has an agreement with the alleged victim that includes a series of confidentiality and non-disparagement provisions. Dawn Sweeney, the current head of the association, issued a statement confirming that in July 1999, Bennett's client \\"filed a formal internal complaint, in accordance with the association's existing policies prohibiting discrimination and harassment.\\" Cain, she noted, \\"disputed the allegations in the complaint.\\" Sweeney said the association is prepared to fully release Bennett's client from her confidentiality agreement in the event she wants to disclose additional details. The controversy has dominated Cain's front-running campaign for the past week. A defiant Cain insists he did nothing wrong, and will not let the issue deter him. Cain spokesman J.D. Gordon said in response to Bennett's statement that the Cain campaign looks \\"forward to focusing our attention on the real issues impacting this country -- like fixing this broken economy and putting Americans back to work.\\" Cain's campaign said earlier Friday it is considering filing a lawsuit against Politico, the news organization which broke the harassment story last Sunday. A possible lawsuit \\"is being discussed,\\" Gordon told CNN. Gordon declined, however, to discuss the timetable or legal basis for such a move. Cain and his campaign aides have been highly critical of Politico's use of anonymous sources, among other things. Politico executive editor Jim VandeHei told CNN he had heard nothing from the Cain campaign, and said the organization \\"stands confidently behind every story (our) reporters have written on the topic.\\" Cain has cited strong poll numbers and fund-raising to claim voters know the allegations are a baseless political attack. \\"The American people are starting to see through this stuff, and they are sick of gutter politics,\\" Cain declared in a radio interview with conservative commentator Sean Hannity on Thursday. \\"This will not deter me.\\" Asked about money paid to two women -- including Bennett's client -- when they left the National Restaurant Association, Cain said in the one case he recalled, it was severance money because accusations of impropriety on his part proved unfounded. Bennett insisted Friday there was no severance agreement, but rather a financial settlement of the harassment complaint. Cain on Thursday also repeated his accusation that the campaign of Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a conservative rival for the GOP nomination, was behind the allegations emerging as Cain rose to the top of the polls in the race. In particular, he noted that a former aide, Curt Anderson, signed on with the Perry campaign shortly before the allegations surfaced in Politico. \\"These are the facts. Connect the dots,\\" Cain said, adding that \\"as more of the information comes out, the more baseless it appears to people.\\" In an interview Thursday with CNN, however, Perry flatly denied that his campaign had anything to do with the story. He also vowed that he'd fire any staffer if he found out they were \\"passing on rumors.\\" \\"(There is) no apology needed,\\" Perry said. \\"We found out about this the same time that I suppose the rest of America found out about it. I don't know how to tell it any other way, except I knew nothing about it.\\" Cain later softened his earlier claim that he told Anderson about one of the allegations against him in a private discussion in 2003. On Thursday, he told Hannity he was \\"almost certain\\" the discussion took place. The allegations have set off a fierce round of claims and counter-claims regarding how the information became public. At the same time, Cain's campaign announced Thursday he has raised 1.2 million this week since the allegations first surfaced on Sunday in a big boost from supporters. The news appears to have had little impact so far on Cain's standing in the GOP race. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released Friday morning -- the first survey conducted entirely after news of the alleged harassment broke -- showed Cain in a dead heat with former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney atop the GOP field. According to the poll, 24% of Republicans and independents who lean toward the GOP now say they support Romney, compared with 23% for Cain. Romney and Cain have been neck-and-neck in most major national surveys over the past month. What exactly transpired during the alleged harassment incidents remains unclear. Asked by Hannity if he ever made flirtatious comments to female subordinates or comments such as \\"you look hot\\" or anything, Cain replied: \\"No, no, no, I didn't.\\" As a business leader, he said, he \\"learned a long time ago\\" not to comment on a woman's appearance or make any kind of personal comment unless he was \\"really, really comfortable\\" with a colleague. Cain told HLN earlier this week that he has never committed sexual harassment \\"in (his) entire career. Period.\\" For his part, Anderson denied in a CNN interview Thursday that he was responsible for leaking the allegations. Anderson, who worked on Cain's unsuccessful 2004 U.S. Senate campaign in Georgia and now is a consultant to Perry's campaign, insisted Cain never told him about the accusations. \\"It's hard to leak something you don't know anything about,\\" he said. \\"I don't have any knowledge of any of this and, you know, it's just not true.\\" Later, Cain's chief campaign strategist, Mark Block, said he accepted Anderson's denial, and wanted to move on from the controversy that has dogged his candidate all week. \\"Until we get all the facts, I'm just going to say that we accept what Mr. Anderson has said, and we want to move on with the campaign,\\" Block told Fox News. Block had earlier called for Perry to apologize to Cain for allegedly leaking the harassment allegations to the media. Politico first published a report late Sunday claiming that two female employees at the National Restaurant Association accused Cain of inappropriate behavior during his tenure as head of the organization. The women, according to Politico, each received separation packages in the five-figure range. The package for one of the women totaled between 32,000 to 37,000 -- approximately equivalent to her annual salary at the time, according to a former National Restaurant Association employee who knows one of the accusers. \\"The workplace (had become) uncommunicative,\\" the former employee told CNN. \\"They didn't give her work. She didn't interact with people.\\" The New York Times previously reported that one of the packages totaled 35,000. On Thursday, Politico reported the other package was for 45,000. Cain criticized the Politico report in Thursday's interview, saying the Politico reporters never showed him any documentation or talked to the women who allegedly made the claims. When a Politico reporter was asked on CNN whether another campaign tipped him to the story, he refused to answer, Cain noted. \\"I didn't know there were so many women named 'anonymous' in America, frankly,\\" Cain joked in Thursday's interview about the lack of details about his accusers. Politico editor-in-chief John Harris told CNN the organization is following ordinary media standards by protecting its sources. Cain has provided differing accounts of the allegations this week, raising further questions about what happened and the ability of the candidate and his campaign to deal with the controversy. While Cain's campaign was first approached by Politico 10 days before the story was first published, the candidate said he was only remembering many details of the incident on Monday. Cain has seized on the uproar as an example of alleged liberal media bias. On Wednesday, Cain's campaign called a report that a third former employee had claimed that he had engaged in inappropriate behavior an example of \\"baseless allegations.\\" \\"He has never acted in the way alleged by inside-the-Beltway media, and his distinguished record over 40 years spent climbing the corporate ladder speaks for itself,\\" said J.D. Gordon, a Cain campaign spokesman. \\"Since his critics have not been successful in attacking his ideas, they are resorting to bitter personal attacks. Mr. Cain deserves better.\\" In the Hannity interview, Cain accused his critics of engaging in the politics of personal destruction, and he insisted his candidacy would survive the maelstrom. He blasted what he called a \\"vicious liberal attack on me,\\" saying the false accusations are because opponents can't coherently challenge his message and want to \\"intimidate other black conservatives to not go public.\\" So far, Cain has only released details about one of the allegations, saying it involved him gesturing to one of the women that she was the same height as his wife -- about 5 feet tall -- and came up to his chin. Bennett has not indicated which of the alleged victims he represents, though he said his client is taller than 5 feet. He said earlier this week that his client is \\"happily married.\\" For his part, Cain has said he has no recollection of a second incident. According to Politico, however, one of the allegations involves an \\"unwanted sexual advance\\" at a hotel room in Chicago. An independent group trying to help Cain released a web video Friday defending him against the harassment allegations and harshly criticizing media coverage of the story. The video, by a super political action committee called the 9-9-9 Fund, includes clips of conservative hosts, including Rush Limbaugh. It also uses television clips of liberal pundits attacking Cain, as well as the famous clip of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas calling his grilling during his confirmation hearings two decades ago \\"a high-tech lynching.\\" The video ends with the onscreen message, \\"Don't let the left do it again.\\" CNN's Brian Todd, Gloria Borger, Dugald McConnell, Joshua Levs, Kevin Bohn, Mark Preston, Jim Acosta, Phil Gast and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report. ||||| Joel Bennett, the attorney for one of the women who complained about Herman Cain at the National Restaurant Association, said Friday that his client's settlement was dated in September 1999 and signed by the trade group's general counsel but not Cain.

They open it and discover packs of cash. They are chased by yet another car for a short time but get away. Back at their upper-middle-class Hollywood apartment, they examine the cash. Jane wants to keep the money, but Alan wants to take it to the police. Alan places the suitcase and cash in a locker at Union Station, hoping he can sway Jane into surrendering it to the police. A few days later while Alan is at work, Danny (Duryea) shows up at the Palmers' apartment, tells Jane he is a detective and quickly learns she has begun spending the money. Her husband Alan likewise becomes upset when he finds she has been running up bills, clearly planning to spend the money they had agreed to store and leave untouched. Jane makes a deal with Danny to split the money. Planning to kill him, she drives Danny up into the hills on the pretense they will retrieve the cash where it's been buried. He suspects her intentions and flees. She and Alan plan a romantic evening together to make amends for their squabbling about the money. She asks Danny to meet her in the evening at Westlake Park near downtown Los Angeles, where she and Alan will be taking a boat ride. Jane has planned to kill her husband Alan in the boat but is stopped by a pang of guilt and begs him to take her to shore, then blurts out that she wants to send the claim check for the locker to the police. Unaware of why his wife is upset, Alan wants to continue with the boat ride. Hoping to find cigarettes, he picks up her bag and his own gun falls out.

This association does not stem from poverty itself, but rather from the conditions under which impoverished people live. The absence of certain resources compromises the ability of the poor to defend themselves against infectious diarrhea. \\"Poverty is associated with poor housing, crowding, dirt floors, lack of access to clean water or to sanitary disposal of fecal waste (sanitation), cohabitation with domestic animals that may carry human pathogens, and a lack of refrigerated storage for food, all of which increase the frequency of diarrhea... Poverty also restricts the ability to provide age-appropriate, nutritionally balanced diets or to modify diets when diarrhea develops so as to mitigate and repair nutrient losses. The impact is exacerbated by the lack of adequate, available, and affordable medical care.\\" Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What indicates the rate of medical care?","output":"The rate of medical care can be indicated by several factors, including: 1. Healthcare accessibility: The availability of healthcare services within a given area and how easily people can access these services. This can be measured by the number of healthcare providers per population or the proximity of healthcare facilities to the population. 2. Healthcare affordability: The cost of medical services and how easily individuals can afford the care they need, considering factors such as insurance coverage, out-of-pocket expenses, and government-funded healthcare programs. 3. Quality of care: The standard of medical services provided to patients, which can be measured using various indicators such as patient satisfaction, success rates for different treatments, and adherence to international best practices and guidelines. 4. Healthcare infrastructure: The availability of necessary facilities, equipment, and trained personnel to provide comprehensive care to the population. This can include the number of hospitals, clinics, medical equipment, and well-trained health professionals in a given area. 5. Preventive care services: The accessibility and availability of preventive care, such as vaccinations, screenings, and health education programs that promote public health and reduce the need for more expensive interventions and treatments. 6. Health outcomes: The overall health of a population can also indicate the rate of medical care, by analyzing metrics such as life expectancy, infant mortality rates, and the prevalence of communicable and non-communicable diseases. 7.

He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company. He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music. When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom.

The orange circle shows one of the sun glints. The \\"pale blue dot\\" has been twinkling like a brilliant diamond in satellite images, and scientists may have finally solved the mystery of why. Mysterious flashes of light from Earth were captured by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Deep Space Climate Observatory, or DSCOVR, an Earth and space weather satellite launched in 2015. Eagle-eyed amateur observers noticed the flashes of light, which occurred hundreds of times over the span of a year. Now, NASA scientists think they may have uncovered the cause: Flecks of high-flying ice crystals in the atmosphere glinting in the sun. [Earth from Above: 101 Stunning Images from Orbit] A powerful camera aboard the DSCOVR satellite has been taking pictures every hour since 2015 from its spot between the sun and the Earth. While skimming through these hourly images, Alexander Marshak, DSCOVR deputy project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, first noticed these sparkling lights over the oceans. It turned out that Marshak wasn't the first to observe these flashes. Astronomer Carl Sagan first spotted the reflections in 1993. At the time, the Galileo spacecraft was studying Jupiter, but briefly turned its lens toward the home planet. While reviewing these Earth images, Sagan and his colleagues noticed the anomaly. \\"Large expanses of blue ocean and apparent coastlines are present, and close examination of the images shows a region of [mirror-like] reflection in ocean but not on land,\\" Sagan and his colleagues wrote in their study, which was published in Nature in 1993. These flickering lights occur when sunlight hits smooth patches in the ocean, and the light then reflects directly back into space and hits the camera head-on, Marshak said in a statement. In this scenario, the ocean acts like a flashbulb in front of the camera. But in Galileo's images, many of the flashes seemed to occur over land, Marshak and his colleagues noticed. Enthusiasts who were looking at the database of images from DISCOVR began pointing out the flashes, too. \\"We found quite a few very bright flashes over land as well,\\" Marshak said in the statement. \\"When I first saw it, I thought maybe there was some water there, or a lake the sun reflects off of. But the glint is pretty big, so it wasn't that.\\" To explain the phenomenon, the team looked for hidden sources of water to explain the sun glint. One possibility: ice crystals floating high in the atmosphere. To test this idea, the team first took an inventory of all the sun glints occurring over land in the modern satellite images. Overall, the bursts occurred 866 times. Based on the physics of light reflection, only certain spots on Earth should produce these twinkling reflections, they reasoned. Only when the angle between Earth and the sun equals the angle between the Earth and the satellite camera would light from these ice crystals bounce directly onto the camera and produce bright glints. Sure enough, the flashes occurred only at times and locations on Earth where these angles matched, the researchers reported today (May 15) in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. Next, they looked at the angle of light to show that these glints occurred when light reflected off horizontally aligned ice crystals. Finally, the researchers showed that the light probably wasn't coming from Earth. Whenever these glints occurred, they found thin, wispy clouds, known as cirrus clouds, hovering high in the atmosphere. Cirrus clouds are composed of supercooled ice crystals. \\"The source of the flashes is definitely not on the ground. It's definitely ice, and most likely solar reflection off of horizontally oriented particles,\\" Marshak said. Originally published on Live Science. ||||| One million miles from Earth, a NASA camera is capturing unexpected flashes of light reflecting off our planet. The homeward-facing instrument on NOAA's Deep Space Climate Observatory, or DSCOVR, launched in 2015, caught hundreds of these flashes over the span of a year. As keen observers from outside NASA wrote in, questioning the source of these lights, scientists deciphered the tiny cause to the big reflections: high-altitude, horizontally oriented ice crystals. NASA's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument aboard DSCOVR is taking almost-hourly images of the sunlit planet from its spot between Earth and the sun. Alexander Marshak, DSCOVR deputy project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, first noticed light flashes occasionally appearing over oceans as he looked through that day's EPIC images. Investigating the flashes, Marshak and his colleagues found that similar reflections from our pale blue dot caught the attention of astronomer Carl Sagan in 1993. Sagan was looking at images taken by the Galileo spacecraft, which launched in 1989 to study Jupiter and its moons. During one if its gravitational-assist swings around Earth, Galileo turned its instruments on this planet and collected data. Sagan and his colleagues used that to test a key question: Whether spacecraft could detect signatures of life from afar. \\"Large expanses of blue ocean and apparent coastlines are present, and close examination of the images shows a region of [mirror-like] reflection in ocean but not on land,\\" they wrote of the glints. Flashes of light reflected off oceans - like those referenced by Sagan - could have a simple explanation, Marshak said: Sunlight hits a smooth part of an ocean or lake, and reflects directly back to the sensor, like taking a flash-picture in a mirror. But when the scientists took another took a look at the Galileo images, they saw something Sagan and his colleagues apparently missed -- bright flashes of light over land as well. And those flashes appeared in the EPIC images as well. As the contact listed on the website that posts all EPIC images, Marshak started getting emails from people curious about what the flashes were. \\"We found quite a few very bright flashes over land as well,\\" he said. \\"When I first saw it I thought maybe there was some water there, or a lake the sun reflects off of. But the glint is pretty big, so it wasn't that.\\" Instead, he and his colleagues Tamas Varnai of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and Alexander Kostinski of Michigan Technological University, thought of water elsewhere in the Earth system: ice particles high in the atmosphere. The scientists conducted a series of experiments, detailed in a new paper published in Geophysical Research Letters, to confirm the cause of the distant flashes. First, the researchers cataloged all of the prospective sunlight glints over land in images from the EPIC camera. The flashes show up in three distinct colors because the camera takes the red, green and blue images several minutes apart. In all, the scientists found 866 bursts between DSCOVR's launch in June 2015 and August 2016. The scientists reasoned that if these 866 flashes were caused by reflected sunlight, they would be limited to certain spots on the globe - spots where the angle between the sun and Earth is the same as the angle between the spacecraft and Earth, allowing for the spacecraft to pick up the reflected light. When they plotted the locations of the glints with where those angles would match, given Earth's tilt and the spacecraft's location, the two matched. This helped confirm that it wasn't something like lightning causing the flashes, Marshak said: \\"Lightning doesn't care about the sun and EPIC's location.\\" The researchers also plotted angles to determine that the light was reflecting off of ice particles floating in the air nearly horizontally. Another feature of the EPIC data helped confirm that the flashes were from a high altitude, not simply water on the ground. Two channels on the instrument are designed to measure the height of clouds, and when the scientists went to the data they found high cirrus clouds, 3 to 5 miles (5 to 8 kilometers) where the glints were located. \\"The source of the flashes is definitely not on the ground. It's definitely ice, and most likely solar reflection off of horizontally oriented particles,\\" Marshak said. Detecting glints like this from much farther away than in this case could be used by other spacecraft to study exoplanets, he said. As an Earth scientist, however, Marshak is now investigating how common these horizontal ice particles are, and whether they're common enough to have a measureable impact on how much sunlight passes through the atmosphere. If so, it's a feature that could be incorporated into computer models of how much heat is reaching and leaving Earth. The DSCOVR mission is a partnership between NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Air Force, with the primary objective to maintain the nation's real-time solar wind monitoring capabilities, which are critical to the accuracy and lead time of space weather alerts and forecasts from NOAA. # For an archive of daily EPIC images, visit: https:/ / epic. gsfc. nasa. gov ||||| Strange light flashes that reflect off planet Earth have been captured by a NASA project. Now, scientists believe they may have discovered the origins: high-altitude ice crystals. The mysterious phenomenon was imaged by the Deep Space Climate Observatory or DSCOVR of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, an Earth and space weather satellite launched back in 2015. Over a one-year period, keen observers caught hundreds of flashes of light, leading NASA scientists to a thorough probe. Flashing Lights That Have Puzzled Carl Sagan The EPIC instrument is a powerful camera aboard DSCOVR that takes near-hourly images of the space between the sun and our planet. Project scientist Alexander Marshak noticed the light flashes first over oceans as he went through that day’s EPIC captures. Apparently, the reflections from the “pale blue dot” were the same ones that garnered Carl Sagan’s attention back in 1993 while he was going over Galileo spacecraft images. Galileo was investigating Jupiter yet briefly turned its tools toward the home planet, where the weird scene appeared. The light flashes were so huge they can be seen from space, and originally scientists thought they were caused by sunlight that reflected off the ocean surface. \\"Large expanses of blue ocean and apparent coastlines are present,” Sagan and his colleagues wrote in a 1993 study in Nature, “and close examination of the images shows a region of [mirror-like] reflection in ocean but not on land.\\" Marshak offered an explanation: sunlight touches a smooth lake or ocean portion, reflects back directly into space, and hits the camera right on. The ocean then works like a flashbulb in front of the camera. But how would one explain spotting them on land? In Galileo images, on the other hand, there were sparkling light flashes over land, and Marshak began getting flooded by emails from curious minds as to what could the flashes be. “When I first saw it, I thought maybe there was some water there, or a lake the sun reflects off of. But the glint is pretty big, so it wasn’t that,” Marshak said in a statement. The Key Is In Ice Crystals The scientists put their thinking cap on and focused on water elsewhere in the planet: ice particles situated high up in the atmosphere. They conducted new experiments and, in a new paper, confirmed the source of the remote flashes. They tested their idea by taking an inventory of sun glints hitting land in the satellite images, where the bursts took place 866 times from June 2015 to August last year. If reflected sunlight is the cause, the flashes would be restricted to certain spots where the angle between Earth and the sun is equivalent to the angle between the space vehicle and the planet. This way, the spacecraft would pick up the reflected light. As they suspected, the flashes happened only at locations and times on Earth where the angles matched. Next, they plotted the angle of light to see if the glints reflected off ice particles that horizontally floated up there in the atmosphere. The team finally showed that the light likely wasn’t emanating from the planet, as whenever they occurred, there were cirrus clouds hovering around. These clouds are made up of, what else, ice crystals. The scientists are studying how commonly the horizontal ice crystals manifested, and if they are typical enough to notably impact the amount of sunlight passing through Earth’s atmosphere. They could potentially be integrated into computer models of how much heat the Earth receives and sees leaving. The findings have been discussed in the journal Geophysical Research Letters and EPIC images can be found here. ⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

Then follows a montage of videos taken over the Beindorfs 18-year-long marriage... which is an anniversary gift from Grover and Stacy. Unfortunately, Ned and Janet drop a bombshell on their children: they are considering a separation. A depressed Grover confides in his best friend Matt Finley, whose father Vic never keeps a wife for more than two years, who says if it was to him hed lock them in a closet until they sorted things out. This gives Grover an idea...That night, Grover and Stacy dress up the basement in a Hawaiian décor, inspired by their parents honeymoon in that country, and invite their parents down there for dinner in an attempt for reconciliation. Unfortunately, all Ned and Janet do are squabble with each other, so the kids leave them in the basement... and lock them in. They inform their flabbergasted parents that they will not let them out until they resolve their issues and go back to loving each other.The next morning, Grover informs Matt what hes done; however, the school bully TJ Krupp overhears them, and goes over to the Beindorf home to see for himself.

The dentist injects an anesthetic into your gum and it eventually becomes numb. One theory as to why anesthetics work deals with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in how ions move across the membrane. If ion movement is disrupted, nerve impulses will not be transmitted and you will not sense pain – at least not until the anesthetic wears off. I am facing a new situation today: Jake and his brother Jordan both have to go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled. Jake is allergic to the anesthetic unfortunately, so he has to have the procedure done without it. Jordan isn't allergic, so he is able to get his tooth pulled after an anesthetic is injected. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who will not experience a disruption of ion movement in their cell membranes? Answer:","output":"To answer this question correctly, let's consider the given information step-by-step and consider how it affects Jake and Jordan. 1. The background article states that the dentist injects an anesthetic into the gum to numb the area. This anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in ion movement across the cell membrane. 2. Disruption of ion movement results in nerve impulses not being transmitted, so the patient doesn't sense pain during the tooth removal procedure. 3. In the new situation, Jake is allergic to the anesthetic, so he cannot have the anesthetic injected before his tooth is pulled. This means that there will be no anesthetic in his cell membranes to disrupt ion movement. 4. On the other hand, Jordan is not allergic to the anesthetic, so he will receive the anesthetic injection before getting his tooth pulled. This means that the anesthetic will get into his cell membranes and cause a disruption in ion movement, which will prevent him from feeling pain. Based on these considerations, we can conclude that Jake will not experience a disruption of ion movement in their cell membranes, since he is unable to receive the anesthetic."},{"instruction":"Chaudhry was released 56 days later and the Fiji military installed an all-indigenous government led by Qarase , who won democratic elections in September 2001 .

He can hold his liquor.","output":"Although the word \\"hold\\" appears in both of the sentences, its meaning and usage are different in each case. Let's examine each sentence in detail to better understand the distinction. 1. \\"Hold your tongue.\\" In this sentence, \\"hold\\" refers to the act of restraining oneself from speaking. It means to stop oneself from saying something, especially in situations where it would be considered inappropriate, rude, or harmful. This expression is idiomatic and figurative; someone who's told to \\"hold their tongue\\" is not literally being asked to physically grasp their tongue and prevent it from moving. The meaning of \\"hold\\" in this situation primarily focuses on exercising self-control and discretion in one's speech. 2. \\"He can hold his liquor.\\" The meaning of \\"hold\\" in this sentence is contextually different from its meaning in the first sentence. In this case, \\"hold\\" is used to describe someone's ability to consume alcoholic beverages without becoming excessively intoxicated or losing control of their behavior. Someone who is able to \\"hold their liquor\\" can drink without experiencing negative consequences, such as impaired judgment or inebriation, to a significant extent. Here, the term \\"hold\\" denotes the capacity to manage and tolerate alcohol consumption. In conclusion, although the word \\"hold\\" is used in both sentences, its meaning differs based on the context. In the first sentence, \\"hold\\" refers to the restraint of speech, while in the second sentence, \\"hold\\" refers to the tolerance and control of alcohol consumption. This demonstrates the versatility and flexibility of the English language, where the meaning of a single word can vary depending on its use within a specific context or expression."},{"instruction":"I know that the answer to the question \\"How did the land come to be?\\" is in \\"The archipelago is formed by high points on the rim of the caldera of a submarine volcano that forms a seamount. The volcano is one part of a range that was formed as part of the same process that formed the floor of the Atlantic, and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The top of the seamount has gone through periods of complete submergence, during which its limestone cap was formed by marine organisms, and during the Ice Ages the entire caldera was above sea level, forming an island of approximately two hundred square miles.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The formation of the archipelago can be attributed to the geological processes involving submarine volcanoes, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and the changes in sea level due to the Ice Ages. The archipelago is a series of high points on the rim of the caldera of a submarine volcano. This volcano is part of a seamount, an underwater mountain formed by volcanic activity. The formation of this seamount and the surrounding geological structures can be traced back to the same process that formed the floor of the Atlantic Ocean and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a vast underwater mountain range that runs along the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, resulting from the process of seafloor spreading. This occurs when tectonic plates, which make up the Earth's crust, move apart from each other, allowing magma from the Earth's mantle to rise and solidify as it cools, creating new crust. This process is what led to the formation of the submarine volcano and the seamount on which the archipelago is situated. Throughout geological time, the top of the seamount has experienced periods of submersion and emergence due to changes in sea level. When the seamount was submerged, the limestone cap was formed by marine organisms, such as coral and other calcium-carbonate secreting organisms. Limestone is a sedimentary rock, predominantly composed of calcium carbonate, and it forms in warm, shallow marine environments through the accumulation of these organisms' remains. During the Ice Ages, significant amounts of water were locked up in ice sheets and glaciers, leading to a drop in sea levels. As a result, the entire caldera of the submarine volcano was above sea level, creating an island with an area of approximately 200 square miles. This temporary emergence allowed for the development of terrestrial ecosystems and the colonization of the island by land-based organisms. In summary, the archipelago's formation is a result of a combination of geological processes related to submarine volcanoes, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and changes in sea level caused by the Ice Ages. These processes led to the formation of the seamount, the emergence and submergence of the volcanic caldera, and the creation of the archipelago's limestone cap through the accumulation of marine organisms' remains."},{"instruction":"Information: - JURIST is an online legal news service hosted by the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, powered by a staff of more than 60 law students working in Pittsburgh and other US locations under the direction of founding Publisher & Editor-in-Chief Professor Bernard Hibbitts, Acting Executive Director Andrew Morgan, Research Director Jaclyn Belczyk, Technical Director Jeremiah Lee, Managing Editor Joseph Macklin and Chief of Staff Steven Wildberger.

JURIST seeks to encourage teaching, learning, and scholarship within the legal community and in the general community. - Saint Thomas Aquinas (1225 7 March 1274), was an Italian Dominican friar, Catholic priest, and Doctor of the Church. He was an immensely influential philosopher, theologian, and jurist in the tradition of scholasticism, within which he is also known as the Doctor Angelicus and the Doctor Communis. The name \\"Aquinas\\" identifies his ancestral origins in the county of Aquino in present-day Lazio. - A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC). - Scholasticism is a method of critical thought which dominated teaching by the academics (\\"scholastics,\\" or \\"schoolmen\\") of medieval universities in Europe from about 1100 to 1700, and a program of employing that method in articulating and defending dogma in an increasingly pluralistic context. It originated as an outgrowth of and a departure from Christian monastic schools at the earliest European universities. The first institutions in the West to be considered universities were established in Italy, France, Spain, and England in the late 11th and the 12th centuries for the study of arts, law, medicine, and theology, such as Schola Medica Salernitana, the University of Bologna, and the University of Paris. It is difficult to define the date at which they became true universities, although the lists of studia generalia for higher education in Europe are a useful guide, held by the Catholic Church and its various religious orders. - Adam Pulchrae Mulieris , also called Adam de Puteorumvilla , was a Paris master who studied under Peter of Lamballe , who flourished in the first half of the 13th century . Little is known of his life . He has been described as one of the \`\` metaphysicians of light '' ( Robert Grosseteste was another ) . He was a contemporary of William of Auvergne , Bishop of Paris , and his works are cited by Richard de Fournival , Gerard of Abbeville and Thomas Aquinas . The origin of his name is unknown . The only book seriously attributed to him is Memoriale Rerum Difficilium , also known as De Intelligentiis . This was originally attributed to Witelo . It was published as Adam 's in 1908 but in the 1930s the question of this attribution was re-opened . - Trouvère, sometimes spelled trouveur , is the Northern French (langue d'oïl) form of the langue d'oc (Occitan) word \\"trobador\\". It refers to poet-composers who were roughly contemporary with and influenced by the troubadours (composers and performers of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages) but who composed their works in the northern dialects of France. The first known \\"trouvère\\" was Chrétien de Troyes (\\"fl\\". 1160s-1180s) (Butterfield, 1997) and the \\"trouvères\\" continued to flourish until about 1300. Some 2130 \\"trouvère\\" poems have survived; of these, at least two-thirds have melodies. - Canonization is the act by which the Catholic Church and Anglican Communion declare that a person who has died was a saint, upon which declaration the person is included in the canon, or list, of recognized saints. Originally, people were recognized as saints without any formal process. Later, different processes, such as those used today in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church, were developed. - Robert Grosseteste ( 9 October 1253) was an English statesman, scholastic philosopher, theologian, scientist and Bishop of Lincoln. He was born of humble parents at Stradbroke in Suffolk. Upon his death, he was almost universally revered as a saint in England, but attempts to procure a formal canonization failed. A. C. Crombie calls him \\"the real founder of the tradition of scientific thought in medieval Oxford, and in some ways, of the modern English intellectual tradition\\". - Mendicant orders refers primarily to certain Christian religious orders that have adopted a lifestyle of poverty, travelling, and living in urban areas for purposes of preaching, evangelization, and ministry, especially to the poor. At their foundation these orders rejected the previously established monastic model of living in one stable, isolated community where members worked at a trade and owned property in common, including land, buildings and other wealth. By contrast, the mendicants avoided owning property, did not work at a trade, and embraced a poor, often itinerant lifestyle. They depended for their survival on the goodwill of the people to whom they preached. - Gerard of Abbeville (1220-1272) was a theologian from the University of Paris. He formally became a theologian in 1257 and from then was known as an opponent of the mendicant orders, particularly in the second stage of the conflict, taking part in a concerted attack that temporarily affected their privileges. - The Bishop of Lincoln is the ordinary of the Church of England Diocese of Lincoln in the Province of Canterbury. - The University of Paris, metonymically known as the Sorbonne (its historical house), was a university in Paris, France. Appearing around 1150 as a corporation associated with the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral school, it was the second-oldest modern university in Europe. Chartered in 1200 by King Philip II (Philippe-Auguste) of France and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent III, it was often nicknamed after its theology collegiate institution, College of Sorbonne, founded about 1257 by Robert de Sorbon. - Doctor of the Church (Latin \\"doctor\\" \\"teacher\\") is a title given by the Catholic Church to saints whom they recognize as having been of particular importance, particularly regarding their contribution to theology or doctrine. - Richard de Fournival or Richart de Fornival (1201 ?1260) was a medieval philosopher and trouvère perhaps best known for the \\"Bestiaire d'amour\\" (\\"The Bestiary of Love\\"). - Oxford is a city in the South East region of England and the county town of Oxfordshire. With a population of 159,994 it is the 52nd largest city in the United Kingdom, and one of the fastest growing and most ethnically diverse. The city is situated from London, from Bristol, from both Southampton and Birmingham and from Reading. - A friar is a member of one of the mendicant orders founded since the twelfth or thirteenth century; the term distinguishes the mendicants' itinerant apostolic character, exercised broadly under the jurisdiction of a superior general, from the older monastic orders' allegiance to a single monastery formalized by their vow of stability. The most significant orders of friars are the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians and Carmelites.

Which country introduced fewer non-native species to the environment? Hint: One of the main causes of extinction is introduction of exotic species into an environment. These exotic and new species can also be called invasive species or non-native species . These non-native species, being new to an area, may not have natural predators in the new habitat, which allows their populations to easily adapt and grow. Invasive species out-compete the native species for resources. Sometimes invasive species are so successful at living in a certain habitat that the native species go extinct ( Figure below ). Answer:","output":"Based on your description, it can be inferred that Singapore introduced fewer non-native species to the environment compared to India. This is because Singapore was very protective of its native species and thus less likely to introduce exotic or invasive species which could threaten the native ecosystems. By being protective, Singapore helps to maintain the natural balance and prevents the negative impact that these invasive species may have on their native species and environment."},{"instruction":"Q:Background: The classical explanation of gravity is that a force of attraction acts at a distance between two objects and the magnitude of the force is directly proportional to each of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. The objects move toward each other due to this force of attraction. Einstein’s new concept of gravity states that matter (mass) causes the space around the matter to curve and also distorts time. A straight line through this curved space would also be curved in order to be a straight line. Paragraph: Rob is an amateur astronomer. Recently, he detected four asteroids, asteroid A, asteroid B, asteroid C, and asteroid D. Asteroid A and asteroid B are of the same mass, but asteroid A is farther from the earth than asteroid B. Asteroid C and asteroid D are at the same distance form the earth, but asteroid C has more mass than asteroid D. He also figured out that all of these asteroids have less mass than earth. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In clssical theory, if Rob needs to find out the object with stronger gravitational pull, which one would he choose, earth or asteroid A? A:","output":"In the classical theory of gravity, the strength of the gravitational force between two objects is determined by their masses and the distance between them. If Rob wants to find out the object with a stronger gravitational pull, he would compare the gravitational force between Earth and asteroid A. Step 1: Identify the masses and distances involved. - Earth's mass (let's call it M_E) is greater than asteroid A's mass (let's call it M_A) - The distance between Earth and asteroid A is given (let's call it d) Step 2: Apply the classical gravity formula: F = (G * M_1 * M_2) / d^2 - G is the gravitational constant - M_1 and M_2 are the masses of the two objects - d is the distance between the objects Step 3: Compare the gravitational forces between Earth and asteroid A. - Calculate F_Earth = (G * M_E * M_A) / d^2 - Calculate F_AsteroidA = (G * M_A * M_A) / d^2 In this case, it's clear that M_E is greater than M_A. Therefore, F_Earth will be greater than F_AsteroidA (because F is directly proportional to the masses). So, according to the classical theory of gravity, Rob would find that Earth has a stronger gravitational pull than asteroid A."},{"instruction":"Finally, I should like to stress that the essential plank of the Commission’s strategy is to work with Member States to promote global solutions through the International Maritime Organisation - the IMO.

However, in my friend's opinion, we forget that when attending a regular school, the child is not into socializing all the while. The child is restricted to so many other activities. Studies take a major role in a child's life. The child hardly has the time to interact at school. The child might be meeting and studying along with many peers; however, how many kids interact with all the kids in a class? But in homeschooling system, as my friend mentioned, the kid has all the time and can plan his day accordingly. During the day the child studies just like other school-going kids but with no burden of homework and project work, the child has so much free time in the evening as to effectively interact and play with peers. The quality time the child spends in education is really impressive. Homeschooled kids have the opportunity to socialize more often as they have a lot of time in their hands. They can also make socializing a regular habit. Just as my friend said, her child goes to a neighboring park almost every day and has a set of friends who go there daily.

Born on January 22, 1869, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Martin grew up to become one of the important figures in Canada's public life. He was a celebrated member of the Liberal Party of Canada, one of the country's major political groupings. Throughout his life, Martin played various roles in Canadian politics to improve and shape the trajectory of his community and the nation. Martin's political journey began when he entered the Canadian Parliament as a Member of the Legislative Council of Quebec for Alma, representing the constituency of Papineau. He held this office in various periods, starting from 1906, 1914, 1919, and 1926, with term endings in 1917, 1924, 1928, and 1946. During his tenure, he succeeded Louis-Arsène Lavallée, Charles Duquette, Camille Piché, and Trefflé Berthiaume, who had held the same office before him. As a legislator, Médéric Martin worked on crucial issues affecting the region and put forth legislative proposals that aimed to improve the lives of Quebec's citizens. Apart from his engagement at the provincial level, Martin became a member of the Canadian Parliament representing the constituency of St. Mary in Montreal. This provided him with a platform to voice the interests and aspirations of his constituents in the country's legislative processes. Médéric Martin is perhaps best remembered for his role as the 32nd Mayor of Montreal. Under his leadership, the city underwent significant development projects and policy changes, which formed the basis for Montreal's vibrant contemporary lifestyle. His term as Mayor saw the establishment of vital public infrastructure and services, as well as the implementation of progressive policies that defined the city's path. After his tenure, Martin was succeeded by notable figures like Charles Duquette, Camillien Houde, Hermas Deslauriers, and Joseph-Olier Renaud as the Mayor of Montreal. Not only was Martin an active politician, but he was also a well-acknowledged industrialist. His involvement in the industrial sector provided him with the right insights to understand the economic and developmental needs of the time. Martin utilized his expertise to make informed decisions and contributed to the economic growth of the city and the rest of Quebec. Médéric Martin died on June 12, 1946, in Laval, Quebec, Canada, leaving behind a legacy of significant achievements in politics and industry. His life epitomizes dedication, innovation, and a profound sense for the welfare of the people.

Article: A deal has been signed to turn by-products from a Scottish distillery into fuel for cars. In what is declared to be a world first, the Tullibardine distillery in Perthshire has linked up with a spin-out company from Napier University in Edinburgh. They plan to use bacteria to feed on the \\"leftovers\\" from the whisky making process. This will produce butanol which can be used to fuel vehicles. More than 90% of the stuff that comes out of a whisky distillery is not whisky. It is leftovers like draff and pot ales -- both produced in the early stages of the process. They are high in sugar and are currently used for things like fertiliser and cattle feed. Napier University's Biofuel Research Centre (BfRC) has already shown that the right bacteria can feed on those by-products to produce butanol--a direct replacement for vehicle fuel. Now the spin-out company, Celtic Renewables, and independent whisky producer Tullibardine have signed an agreement. Together they will apply the process to thousands of tons of the distillery's leftovers. Professor Martin Tangney, founder of Celtic Renewables, said \\"Our partnership with Tullibardine is an important step in the development of a business which combines two important Scottish industries -- whisky and renewables. This project shows that creative use of existing technologies can _ resources on our doorstep to benefit both the environment and the economy.\\" Douglas Ross, managing director of Tullibardine, which spends PS250,000 disposing of its by-products every year, said \\"We are delighted to be partnering Celtic Renewables in this creative business, the obvious benefits of which are environmental. It takes a cost to us and turns it into something that has social as well as commercial value.\\" The project is being supported by a grant from the Scottish government's Zero Waste Scotland initiative. Celtic Renewables said it eventually aimed to build a processing plant in Scotland, with the hope of building an industry that could be worth PS60m a year.

Longford, a devout Catholic, often visited prisoners because of his passionate belief in forgiveness and society's need for prisoner rehabilitation.In 1965, he begins visiting Myra Hindley [Samantha Morton], a young woman serving a life sentence for murdering children with her lover Ian Brady [Andy Serkis]. Though Longford encountered public outrage, discouragement from his wife Elizabeth [Lindsay Duncan], doubt from his family, and criticism from his colleagues and the press, he continued to visit and exchange letters with Hindley. After learning that she once converted to Catholicism, Longford encourages her to return to the church and ask for God's forgiveness.After the Prime Minister removes him from the House of Lords, he devotes his time to crusading for Hindley and other prisoners. His wife eventually joins the crusade after reading Hindley's letters, meeting her and seeing the horrible prison conditions. She suspects that Hindley is receiving harsher punishment because she is a woman. Longford takes Hindley's cause public, talking to the press about her case and defending her as an accomplice corrupted by Ian Brady.At first, Hindley is grateful for Longford's efforts and seems to make progress in her return to the church. Later, she unexpectedly rejects his help and shocks him with the news that she lied to him about the murders. Once this information is made public, Longford's good name is damaged even further. Longford begins to question his religious beliefs, but reaches a deeper level in his Catholic faith when he is able to forgive Hindley for her transgressions against him.Many years later, she asks him to visit her once again and he complies. He shares with her the importance of their friendship to him. Until the end of his life in 2001,...

Combine the terms with m: We have two terms with m; -2m and 6m. -2m + 6m = (6 - 2)m = 4m Now the equation becomes: 4m - 12 = 0 2. Isolate the variable m: To isolate m, we need to perform operations on both sides of the equation until we have m alone on one side. In this case, we want to get rid of the -12 on the left side. To do that, add 12 to both sides of the equation: 4m - 12 + 12 = 0 + 12 4m = 12 Now, to fully isolate m, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of m, which is 4: 4m / 4 = 12 / 4 m = 3 So the solution to the equation -2m + 6m - 12 = 0 for m is m = 3."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Thanksgiving will be here before we know it! If you’re like us, you have an extra pumpkin around the house right now. I’d like to challenge you to Thirty Days of Thankfulness for the month of November. By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We’re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house. The following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you’d like. Or, you can make the conversation more interesting by cutting out the prompt strips from the document and placing them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your thankful pumpkin, you can have your child choose a strip to start the discussion. This activity probably took: Pick the correct answer from the following options: - A day - A week - not enough information - A month Answer:","output":"Thanksgiving will be here before we know it!

By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! The idea for the Thirty Days of Thankfulness, also known as the Thankful Pumpkin activity, was born from a creative approach to utilize small decorative pumpkins that are usually placed around the house during the holiday season. This simple, yet meaningful activity encourages children and adults alike to reflect on the aspects of their lives that they are grateful for and promotes quality family discussions. To create your own Thankful Pumpkin, you can use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin, or if you prefer to use a decorative pumpkin, you could paint it a neutral color and write or paint all over it too. Each day during the month of November, gather your family around the table and take turns thinking about and discussing things you are thankful for. As each family member contributes, use a marker to write keywords representing these thankful thoughts all around the pumpkin. When you are not actively writing on the pumpkin, place it in a visible spot where everyone in your family can see it each day. The Thankful Pumpkin serves as a constant reminder of the good things in life and encourages the continuation of the challenge through engaging family conversations. To make this activity even more interesting, you can cut out prompt strips from a document and place them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your Thankful Pumpkin, have your child choose a strip to initiate the discussion. These prompt strips can be kept on the fridge for the current year, or filed away for future use in the next year.

Options: - eat grass - play - kept in stables - dominated - drink coffee Step-by-step reasoning process below:","output":"Horses primarily get their energy from consuming food, specifically by eating grass or other plant-based materials. Here's a step-by-step reasoning process for the options you provided: 1. Eat grass: Horses are herbivores, which means they obtain energy and nutrients from plant-based materials. They consume grass, hay, and grains that are broken down by microbes in their digestive system, converting it into energy. This energy is then used for maintaining bodily functions, growth, reproduction, and physical activity. So, eating grass is the primary source of energy for horses. 2. Play: While play is an important aspect of a horse's social life and overall well-being, it does not provide energy; rather, it consumes energy. Playing expends the energy that a horse gets from their diet, and it helps to keep them physically and mentally fit. 3. Kept in stables: Keeping horses in a stable is a matter of managing their living space, providing shelter, and ensuring their needs are met. It does not directly provide them with energy. However, horses may receive food and water while they're in the stable, which contributes to their overall energy intake. 4. Dominated: Dominance or submission within a social structure revolves around how horses interact with each other. This hierarchy influences access to resources, such as food and water, but does not itself provide energy. The energy comes from the consumed resources. 5. Drink coffee: Horses do not drink coffee. Coffee contains caffeine, which is a stimulant, but it is not a source of energy for horses. In fact, caffeine can be harmful to horses as it's listed as a banned substance in competitive horse racing since it can cause adverse health effects. In summary, horses primarily get their energy from eating grass or other plant-based materials. The other options listed might involve activities or conditions that either expend energy, pertain to social structures, or are unrelated to a horse's energy source."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: Put a new speculum, or pointed end, onto your otoscope before each patient. Select the largest possible speculum that your patient’s ear will accommodate. When inserted, the speculum should fit snugly into the outer third of the ear canal. Speculums that are too small can cause discomfort and reduce how much of the ear you can examine. Use the following guidelines for speculum size: Adults: 4 to 6 millimeters Children: 3 to 4 millimeters Infants: as small as 2 millimeters Without using the otoscope, take a look at the person’s external ear and notice any redness, discharge or swelling. Manipulate the ear gently and ask the patient if there is any pain. With Swimmer’s ear there is often pain, swelling, redness, and discharge that can be observed before even using the otoscope. Place the otoscope at your patients ear, not in it. Look into your otoscope and then slowly insert the pointed end of it into the ear canal. Steady your hand on the side of the individuals face if necessary. Slow and gentle insertion can prevent unwanted movement in your patient. It also keeps your hand and scope in line with the ear and minimizes the risk of injury. Avoid putting too much pressure on the otoscope, which can bump the inner canal wall, causing the patient discomfort. Avoid ramming the speculum into the ear canal. Insert it at most 1 to 2 centimeters and then use the light to view beyond the tip of the speculum. Stop the examination immediately if the patient expresses any pain or discomfort. Examine the middle ear and eardrum. Angle the tip of the otoscope towards the person’s nose. This follows the normal angle of the ear canal. From here, move the otoscope gently at different angles. This allows you to view the person’s eardrum and canal walls. Stop the exam at any sign of increased pain or discomfort. Return the otoscope back to your starting position. As you watch through the speculum, gentle take the speculum and scope out of the person’s ear canal and outer ear. Release the person’s ear from your grasp. Remove the speculum from the otoscope. Throw it away in a certified medical waste container to minimize the spread of disease or infection to other patients. If you don’t have disposable speculums, scrub each tip with hot water to remove excess wax.

A founding member of the United Nations, Greece was the tenth member to join the European Communities (precursor to the European Union) and has been part of the Eurozone since 2001. It is also a member of numerous other international institutions, including the Council of Europe, NATO,[a] OECD, OIF, OSCE and the WTO. Greece, which is one of the world's largest shipping powers, middle powers and top tourist destinations, has the largest economy in the Balkans, where it is an important regional investor.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"Greece, being a developed country with an advanced high-income economy, engages in various business sectors. These sectors play vital roles in contributing to the country's overall economic growth, making it a regional leader in the Balkan area. The following are the key business sectors in Greece: 1. Tourism: Greece is one of the top tourist destinations in the world, thanks to its rich history, cultural heritage, beautiful islands, and Mediterranean climate. The tourism industry is a major driver of the Greek economy, accounting for a significant portion of GDP and creating thousands of jobs. Popular tourist attractions include Athens, Santorini, Mykonos, and the ancient sites of Olympia and Delphi. 2. Shipping: Greece has a prominent position as one of the world's largest shipping powers, with a long maritime tradition that can be traced back to ancient times. The Greek shipping sector is a significant contributor to the national economy, employing many Greek citizens and generating revenue from freight and charter services provided by its large commercial fleet. The Port of Piraeus serves as a strategic hub for the region, fostering growth in international trades. 3. Agriculture: Although agriculture’s share in the Greek economy has been declining due to the expansion of other sectors and the European Union's Common Agricultural Policies, it still plays a vital role in the country. Greek agriculture is characterized by small-scale family-owned farms, and the primary crops include olives, grapes, wheat, and vegetables. Greece is a considerable exporter of olive oil, wine, and other food products, contributing to the country's trade balance. 4. Manufacturing: The manufacturing sector in Greece is primarily centered around food, textiles, clothing, non-metallic minerals, and metal products. While the sector is relatively weak compared to other European countries, it still provides employment opportunities for the Greek population. In recent years, there has been a renewed focus on promoting manufacturing through both local and foreign investments. 5. Energy: Greece is heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels for its energy needs, primarily oil and natural gas. However, the country is striving to diversify its energy portfolio by focusing on renewable sources, such as solar and wind power. This has led to the rise of renewable energy businesses in the country, as well as companies involved in energy distribution. 6. Financial services: Greek banks play a significant role in the national economy as they provide various financial services, such as lending, investment, and wealth management to both individuals and businesses. The Greek banking sector has been going through a period of restructuring and consolidation following the country's financial crisis.

Who invented the disc brake in 1902?","output":"The disc brake, a revolutionary innovation in automotive engineering and vehicle safety, was invented in 1902 by a British engineer named Frederick William Lanchester. Born on October 28, 1868, Lanchester was a highly skilled and inventive engineer who contributed significantly to the development of the British automobile and aviation industries. Born in Lewisham, London, Frederick Lanchester displayed a keen interest in engineering from a young age. He received his formal education at Hartley University College (now the University of Southampton) and the Royal College of Science (now Imperial College London). His career began at the Forward Gas Engine Company in Birmingham, where he designed and developed engines. In 1895, Frederick Lanchester, alongside his brother George, co-founded the Lanchester Engine Company to design and manufacture engines for motor vehicles. The company soon became the Lanchester Motor Company when the brothers started producing their own automobiles. In 1902, while working on improving the braking system of the motor vehicles, Lanchester came up with the disc brake concept. He patented this invention, making it the first-known patent for a disc brake system. At that time, the existing braking systems were mainly drum brakes, which had a tendency to overheat and lose their effectiveness when used frequently or for an extended period. Lanchester's disc brake innovation incorporated a rotating disc that was clamped by calipers, with brake pads on either side of the disc. When the driver applied the brake pedal, the calipers' hydraulic system would apply pressure to the brake pads, which then created friction against the spinning disc to slow or stop the vehicle. This design provided superior heat dissipation and better braking efficiency compared to drum brakes. Although the disc brake concept was ahead of its time, it did not gain widespread adoption in the automotive industry until the 1950s and 1960s, when advancements in materials technology and manufacturing processes made it feasible and cost-effective to produce disc brakes on a large scale. Frederick Lanchester's invention of the disc brake in 1902 has had a significant and lasting impact on the automotive and transportation industries. His innovation has undoubtedly contributed to improving vehicle safety and performance, making it a cornerstone of modern braking systems."},{"instruction":"This House Believes Alternative Medicine Poses a Threat to Public Health What is a possible side to this debate?","output":"The debate around whether alternative medicine poses a threat to public health has two main contrasting sides: one that agrees with the proposition (proponents) and the other that disagrees (opponents). In order to provide a comprehensive analysis, it is important to consider the arguments from both perspectives. Proponents' Arguments: 1. Lack of Scientific Evidence: One of the primary arguments put forth by proponents is that alternative medicine lacks solid scientific evidence and peer-reviewed research that supports its effectiveness. Many alternative therapies are not subjected to rigorous clinical trials or do not produce consistent, replicable results. This lack of evidence can lead to misinformed individuals relying on unproven methods that may not be effective in treating their health concerns. 2. Interference with Conventional Treatments: Another concern is that individuals may turn to alternative therapies as a substitute for proven conventional treatments, leading them to refuse or delay evidence-based care. This can result in the worsening of existing health conditions, and in some cases, can have fatal consequences. In particular, individuals with serious illnesses, such as cancer, may elect to forego traditional medical treatments in favor of alternative therapies which do not have a proven track record of success. 3. Quality Control and Regulation: Alternative medicine products, such as supplements and herbal remedies, often lack strict quality control and regulations. This can lead to products with varying effectiveness, potential adulteration, or even contamination. Without standardized manufacturing, it is difficult for consumers to know if the products they buy are safe and contain the necessary ingredients in the correct dosage. Additionally, some practitioners who offer alternative therapies may not be held to the same standards of care and licensing as conventional healthcare providers, leaving room for potential malpractice and harm to patients. 4. Misinformation and Exploitation: Proponents argue that the alternative medicine industry is driven by profit and preys on vulnerable individuals who are desperate for a cure. The spread of misleading information, false claims, and anecdotal successes creates an environment where people are encouraged to try unproven interventions. This not only puts their health at risk but can also lead to financial exploitation as they invest in costly treatments that may not provide any tangible benefit. Opponents' Arguments: 1. Holistic and Complementary Approach: Opponents of the proposition argue that alternative medicine can be a valuable complement to conventional treatments. Oftentimes, alternative therapies focus on holistic care, addressing not just the physical symptoms of an illness but also the emotional, mental, and spiritual aspects of the patient's well-being. This approach may provide individuals with a more comprehensive care plan and promote overall health and wellness. 2. Patient Empowerment and Autonomy: The use of alternative medicine can provide individuals with a sense of control and autonomy over their healthcare decisions. By exploring various treatment options and engaging in self-care practices, individuals can actively participate in their healing process and feel more invested in their health outcomes. 3. Cultural Sensitivity: Alternative medicine often incorporates traditional healing practices from various cultures. Opponents of the proposition argue that it is important to respect and preserve these practices, as they can provide a sense of identity, heritage, and connection to one's cultural roots. Additionally, these traditional practices may offer unique perspectives and approaches to healing that can complement or enhance conventional medical treatments. 4. The Potential for Scientific Discovery: Some opponents believe that alternative medicine should not be dismissed outright, as it may offer the potential for future scientific discoveries. Documented cases of alternative therapies providing benefit or showing promise in early scientific studies can serve as the impetus for further research and development, potentially leading to new and effective treatments in the future. In conclusion, the debate over whether alternative medicine poses a threat to public health requires careful consideration of the benefits and risks involved, as well as the importance of preserving cultural practices and the potential for future scientific discoveries. Both proponents and opponents of the proposition make valid points, and an informed stance should take into account the diverse factors at play. Ultimately, public health would benefit from a cautious and discerning approach that takes into consideration both conventional and alternative healthcare practices, ensuring that individuals receive the safest and most effective treatments available."},{"instruction":"Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Emiliano Zapata Salazar (Spanish pronunciation: [emi'ljano sa'pata]; 8 August 1879 - 10 April 1919) was a leading figure in the Mexican Revolution, the main leader of the peasant revolution in the state of Morelos, and the inspiration of the agrarian movement called Zapatismo. Zapata was born in the rural village of Anenecuilco in Morelos State, where peasant communities were under increasing pressure from the small landowning class who monopolized land and water resources for sugar cane production with the support of dictator Porfirio Diaz. Zapata early on participated in political movements against Diaz and the landowning hacendados, and when the Revolution broke out in 1910 he was positioned as a central leader of the peasant revolt in Morelos. Cooperating with a number of other peasant leaders he formed the Liberation Army of the South of which he soon became the undisputed leader. Meanwhile, the disintegration of the revolution outside of Morelos put pressure on the Zapatistas. As General Arenas had turned over to the constitutionalists, he had secured peace for his region and he remained in control there. This suggested to many revolutionaries that perhaps the time had come to seek a peaceful conclusion to the struggle. A movement within the Zapatista ranks led by former General Vazquez and Zapata's erstwhile adviser and inspiration Otilio Montano moved against the Tlaltizapan headquarters demanding surrender to the Carrancistas. Reluctantly, Zapata had Montano tried for treason and executed (Womack 1983-86). Zapata began looking for allies among the northern revolutionaries and the southern Felicistas, followers of the Liberalist Felix Diaz. He sent Gildardo Magana as an envoy to communicate with the Americans and other possible sources of support. In the fall of 1917 a force led by Gonzalez and the ex-Zapatista Sidronio Camacho, who had killed Zapata's brother Eufemio, moved into the eastern part of Morelos taking Cuautla, Zacualpan and Jonacatepec. Zapata continued his work to try to unite with the national anti-Carrancista movement through the next year, and the constitutionalists did not make further advances. In the winter of 1918 a harsh cold and the onset of the Spanish flu decimated the population of Morelos, causing the loss of a quarter of the total population of the state, almost as many as had been lost to Huerta in 1914. (Womack 311). Furthermore, Zapata began to worry that by the end of the World War, the US would turn its attention to Mexico forcing the Zapatistas to either join the Carrancistas in a national defense or to acquiesce to foreign domination of Mexico. In December 1918 Carrancistas under Gonzalez undertook an offensive campaign taking most of the state of Morelos, and pushing Zapata to retreat. The main Zapatista headquarters were moved to Tochimilco, Puebla, although Tlaltizapan also continued to be under Zapatista control. Through Castro, Carranza issued offers to the main Zapatista generals to join the nationalist cause, with pardon. But apart from Manuel Palafox, who having fallen in disgrace among the Zapatistas had joined the Arenistas, none of the major generals did (Womack 313-14). Zapata emitted statements accusing Carranza of being secretly sympathetic to the Germans (Womack 315). In March Zapata finally emitted an open letter to Carranza urging him for the good of the fatherland to resign his leadership to Vazquez Gomez, by now the rallying point of the anti-constitutionalist movement (Womack 319-20). Having posed this formidable moral challenge to Carranza prior to the upcoming 1920 presidential elections, the Zapatista generals at Tochimilco, Magana and Ayaquica, urged Zapata not to take any risks and to lay low. But Zapata declined, considering that the respect of his troops depended on his active presence at the front (Womack 320-22). Did they capture any other territory or peoples?","output":"Yes, they did capture other territories and places. During the fall of 1917, a force led by Gonzalez and the ex-Zapatista Sidronio Camacho, who had killed Zapata's brother Eufemio, moved into the eastern part of Morelos and took control of Cuautla, Zacualpan, and Jonacatepec.

In a letter sent earlier this month to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, former Inspector General Joseph Schmitz outlined what he believes is the potential risk to national security posed by the military’s current chaplain vetting system. Among the concerns Schmitz outlined in his letter, which was obtained by FoxNews.com, are: — Reports that Army Maj. Nidal Hasan, accused of 13 counts of murder in last year's Fort Hood massacre, acted as a Muslim lay leader and received training from one of the approved civilian religious groups involved with the Defense Department chaplain program. — The identification of the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), one of two endorsing agencies used by the U.S. military in its approval process for Muslim chaplains,as an unindicted co-conspirator in the 2008 Holy Land Foundation terror fundraising trial. — The naming of the ISNA's former endorsing agent, Dr. Louay Safi, as an unindicted co-conspirator in the 2003 trial of Sami Al-Arian, who pleaded guilty to one count of fundraising for the terrorist organization Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Safi is also the subject of a whistleblower investigation. “The November 2008 criminal conviction in Texas of the Holy Land Foundation (HLF) as a front for Hamas, naming of the DoD's Chaplain Endorsing Agents, the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), as an unindicted co-conspirator (among others), suggests that terrorist organizations can and do disguise themselves as charitable organizations,\\" Schmitz wrote to Feinstein. \\"The November 2009 Fort Hood massacre by a commissioned Army officer who served as a lay Muslim leader at Fort Hood demonstrates that international terrorist organizations can also try to disguise their agents as chaplains and religious lay leaders,\\" he added. In a statement to FoxNews.com, Feinstein, D-Calif., said: “We recently received the letter and staff is reviewing it carefully and making inquiries into how all chaplains are vetted by the Defense Department. Certainly chaplains should be carefully interviewed and backgrounds checked, regardless of their religion.” Prospective military chaplains currently are recommended to the U.S. military by outside religious organizations, which in turn select an endorsing agent who is charged with issuing and withdrawing the chaplains' credentials for the Defense Department. Candidates undergo the same fingerprinting and background check required of members of the military, but Schmitz maintains this is not an adequate screening. Schmitz says he made a series of recommendations for vetting chaplain nominees six years ago that were not implemented by the Defense Department. In his Nov. 8 letter to Feinstein, he wrote that he had recommended that nonreligious criteria be established to justify the withdrawal or removal of a religious organization or its agent from participating in the DoD chaplain program. Examples of such criteria could include: — Advocating the violent overthrow of the U.S. government; — Being listed on a watch list as a terrorist organization; — Conviction of a religious organization or its principal leaders in connection with terrorism; — Conviction of endorsing agents in connection with any criminal activity. He said he also recommended developing screening procedures for collecting information from sources, including FBI databases relating to chaplains, supporting religious organizations and endorsers. But Schmitz says his recommendations were shot down by the Armed Forces Chaplains Board, which called those suggestions “legally problematic.\\" His account is confirmed by the department response to the 2004 report. Defense Department spokeswoman Eileen Lainez told FoxNews.com that some of Schmitz's recommendations have since been incorporated into vetting policy. Now, Lainez said, any individual or religious organization shall be rejected or removed from participation in the DoD chaplain program if they're under indictment; have been convicted of a terrorism-related offense or other offense threatening national or economic security; or if their name appears on the annual State Department list of Foreign Terror Organizations. \\"In addition, following the release of the Fort Hood report, this policy has been under review to see if there are other additional criteria that can be included,\\" Lainez said. In his letter, Schmitz asked Feinsten to ask the Defense Department to take another look at his earlier, non-implemented recommendations. Citing reports that Hasan acted as a lay leader, a sort of substitute or part-time chaplain required to undergo a vetting process similar to those of full-time chaplains, he wrote in an email to FoxNews.com: “Somebody ought to challenge the DoD on precisely how it vets its chaplains as well as its chaplain ‘endorsing agents’ to ensure non-complicity in terrorism or criminal activities, and who, if anyone, vetted Major Nidal Hasan as a so-called ‘Muslim lay leader’ at Fort Hood.” In his letter to Feinstein, he also argued that the 2008 Holy Land Foundation terror fundraising trial in itself should be enough to reconsider the organizations currently tasked with endorsing chaplain candidates. During that trial, prosecutors named the ISNA, among other well-known Muslim organizations, as an unindicted co-conspirator in the case that convicted a Texas charity of acting as a front for Hamas. (A court document unsealed two weeks ago reaffirms the prosecution’s stance that ISNA, among other groups, was tied to HLF's fundraising for Hamas.) Yet, ISNA remains one of two ecclesiastical endorsing agencies used to vet Muslim chaplain candidates for the military. ISNA did not reply to requests for comment. Schmitz also specifically named ISNA’s chaplain endorsing agent, Dr. Louay Safi, who acted on behalf of ISNA and until recently was one of two Defense Department Muslim chaplain endorsing agents for the entire U.S. military. Safi, who has participated in Pentagon programs since at least 2005, was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the 2006 Al-Arian case. (During the trial, Safi was identified as \\"Unindicted Co-Conspirator Four,\\" and evidence from the case included wiretapped phone conversations between him and Al-Arian.) Safi is also the subject of a whistleblower complaint filed late last year by a contractor who expressed concern with Safi's participation in a lecture on Islam to soldiers at Fort Hood before their deployments in the weeks after the deadly shooting there. Safi was suspended from participating in military lectures pending the outcome of the whistleblower investigation, according to email records that were obtained by FoxNews.com. But he continued to act as one of two Muslim chaplain endorsing agents working with the Defense Department. Until a week and a half ago, Safi’s name appeared on the DoD’s website listing of ecclesiastical endorsing agents. But on Nov. 18, a spokeswoman for the Defense Department said Safi was no longer an endorsing agent, and that a request had been submitted to change the website back in June. Safi's name was removed from the site later that evening. When reached by phone, Safi told FoxNews.com: \\"I left ISNA, I am now with another institution. I moved on to another career.\\" He also said that he was unaware of any whistleblower complaint or investigation. \\"That's probably something you read on some blog that is not true,\\" he said. \\"There was nothing — not that I'm aware of.\\" The status of the investigation into the whistleblower complaint about Safi is unclear. A spokesman for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service said the case was handed off to the Army, and an Army spokesman said the Army never opened a case because Safi is a civilian. Walid Phares, director of the Future of Terrorism Project at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, echoed Schmitz’s concerns, calling ISNA’s involvement in the military chaplain program a matter of urgent national security. “The main concern is that the body consulted by the U.S. government to select the chaplains is made of NGOs linked to the Jihadists or to Islamist movements. This alone compromises national security,” he said. “It would be placing — without knowledge — religious advisers to military personnel who promote Islamist ideologies and doctrines. This would be the single most dangerous penetration self inflicted by the bureaucracy.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"A former inspector general for the Defense Department has raised concerns about the vetting process for Muslim clerics who are nominated to serve as U.S. military chaplains and has called on Congress to investigate and oversee this process in a letter to the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

In this case, the supposed perturbation would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. Tree blights are diseases or infestations that can damage or kill parts of a tree, which could impact the availability and quality of nesting materials for birds. While the direct steps of nest building (collecting twigs, making the base and sides, and adding soft materials) may not be directly impacted, the indirect consequences of a tree blight could be significant. 1. Reduced availability of nesting materials: As tree blights kill branches and leaves, there may be fewer twigs and other refuse available for birds to collect, making it more challenging for them to find suitable materials for their nests. 2. Reduced structural stability: If tree blights weaken the branches or trunk of a tree, it may be less sturdy and secure for birds to build their nests on, potentially leading to nest collapse or increased vulnerability to wind and other environmental factors. 3. Diminished food resources: If a tree blight affects the overall health of the tree or surrounding trees, it may also negatively impact the food resources available for birds, such as insects or fruits. This could make it harder for them to find enough food to support nesting activities and raise their offspring. 4. Loss of habitat: If tree blights become severe or widespread, they may lead to the loss of trees in an area, which would result in a loss of suitable nesting sites for birds. Although tree blights do not directly impact a specific step of the nest-building process, their indirect effects on the availability and quality of nesting materials and viable nesting sites could make it more challenging for birds to create smaller nests that are stable and secure."},{"instruction":"(CNN) -- In the middle of the Idaho wilderness, a man on horseback had a brief conversation with two campers.

Below is a detailed breakdown of the reasons for this rating: 1. Subject of the sentences: In the first sentence, the subject is \\"two men,\\" while in the second sentence, the subject is \\"two women.\\" These refer to different genders and, as such, are not similar. 2. Location in the sentences: The first sentence takes place at a beach, while the second sentence is set in front of a tour bus. These are two distinct locations with different contexts. 3. Activity in the sentences: Although the two sentences share the activity of \\"standing,\\" the difference in their subjects and locations suggest different scenarios that aren't directly similar. The activity is the only slight similarity between the two sentences, and it is not enough to make the overall meaning very similar. 4. Context: The context of these two sentences may imply different environments and situations. The beach may suggest a more casual or leisurely setting, while the tour bus implies tourism and potentially exploration. Although there is a minor similarity in both sentences as they describe two individuals standing, the overall meaning carried in each sentence regarding gender, location, and context differs significantly.

The Cabinet is headed by the President of Venezuela , presently Nicolás Maduro , and his corresponding Vice President . The purpose of the ministries is to create , adopt , follow and evaluate policies , strategies , programs and projects in accordance with the constitution and the laws of the Republic . - A commander-in-chief is the person or body that exercises supreme operational command and control of a nation's military forces or significant elements of those forces. In the latter case, the force element is those forces within a particular region, or associated by function. As a practical term; it refers to military competencies that reside in a nation-state's executive leadershipeither a head of state, a head of government, a minister of defence, a national cabinet, or some other collegial body. Often, a given country's commander-in-chief (if held by an official) need not be or have been a commissioned officer or even a veteran. This follows the principle of civilian control of the military. - Executive Vice President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (commonly known simply as the Vice President of Venezuela, is the second highest political position in the government of Venezuela. The Vice President is the direct collaborator of the President of the Republic according to the Constitution. The office of Vice President appeared in the Constitution of 1830 until the Constitution of 1858, and once again in the Constitution of 1999. - A politician (from \\"politics\\" + \\"-ian\\", from the Greek title of Aristotle's book \\"Politika\\", meaning \\"Civic Affairs\\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution. - Venezuela, officially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, is a federal republic located on the northern coast of South America. It is bordered by Colombia on the west, Brazil on the south, Guyana on the east, and the islands of Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east. Venezuela's territory covers around with an estimated population . Venezuela is considered a state with extremely high biodiversity (currently ranks 7th in the world's list of nations with the most number of species), with habitats ranging from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon Basin rain-forest in the south, via extensive \\"llanos\\" plains and Caribbean coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east. - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch. - Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías (28 July 1954 5 March 2013) was a Venezuelan politician who served as the 64th President of Venezuela from 1999 to 2013. He was also leader of the Fifth Republic Movement from its foundation in 1997 until 2007, when it merged with several other parties to form the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), which he led until 2012. - Impeachment is the process by which a legislative body formally levels charges against a high official of Government. Impeachment does not necessarily mean removal from office; it is only a formal statement of charges, akin to an indictment in criminal law, and is thus only the first step towards removal. Once an individual is impeached, he or she must then face the possibility of conviction via legislative vote, which then entails the removal of the individual from office. - A legislature is a deliberative assembly with the authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country or city. Legislatures form important parts of most governments; in the separation of powers model, they are often contrasted with the executive and judicial branches of government. - A presidential system is a system of government where a head of government is also head of state and leads an executive branch that is separate from the legislative branch. The United States, for instance, has a presidential system. The executive is elected and often titled \\"president\\" and is not responsible to the legislature and which cannot, in normal circumstances, dismiss it. The legislature may have the right, in extreme cases, to dismiss the executive, often through impeachment. However, such dismissals are seen as so rare as not to contradict a central tenet of presidentialism, that in \\"normal circumstances using normal means\\" the legislature cannot dismiss the executive. - The President of Venezuela, officially known as the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and also commonly called President of the Republic is the elected head of state and head of government in Venezuela's presidential system. The president leads the National Executive of the Venezuelan government and is the commander-in-chief of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces. Presidential terms were set at six years in with the adoption of the 1999 constitution, and re-election has been unlimited since 2009. - Nicolás Maduro Moros (born 23 November 1962), more commonly known as Nicolás Maduro, is a Venezuelan politician who has been the 65th President of Venezuela since 2013. Previously he served under President Hugo Chávez as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2006 to 2013 and as Vice President of Venezuela from 2012 to 2013. - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country.

The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - Huso is a genus of large sturgeons from Eurasia. It contains two species, which both are critically endangered: - Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae. Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: \\"Acipenser\\", \\"Huso\\", \\"Scaphirhynchus\\" and \\"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\\". Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, \\"Polyodon spathula\\" (paddlefish) and \\"Psephurus gladius\\" (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be \\"true\\" sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean. - Scaphirhynchinae is a subfamily of sturgeon which includes two genera comprising a total of six species .

Options: - confusion - anger - sadness - loss of innocence - frustration Answer:","output":"The most suitable option to answer the question, \\"What problems do children have learning about the world?\\" is: confusion. Children can experience confusion when they begin to learn about the complex concepts and systems present in the world around them. The process of understanding the world takes time and is often hindered by several factors, which contribute to the feelings of confusion in children. Some of these factors are discussed below. 1. Cognitive development: Children's brains are still developing, and their cognitive capabilities progress in stages according to their age. This means that certain concepts and ideas may be difficult for them to understand until their cognitive development reaches the appropriate stage. 2. Varying sources of information: Children are exposed to a wide range of sources of information, including parents, teachers, books, the internet, and their peers. Often, these sources can provide conflicting information or explanations that are challenging for young minds to reconcile. 3. Language and communication barriers: Children may find it difficult to express their thoughts and questions adequately, which can lead to confusion. Furthermore, some concepts may be difficult for children to comprehend due to the language or terminology used. 4. Lack of experience: Children lack the life experience and knowledge that adults often draw upon to make sense of the world. This means they may find it challenging to understand new or foreign concepts and ideas, leading to confusion. 5. Emotional challenges: Sometimes, learning about the world can be emotionally challenging for children, as new information may conflict with their existing beliefs and values. This can create confusion as they struggle to reconcile these differences. 6. Ambiguity: The world is full of ambiguity, uncertainties, and gray areas. This can be challenging for children to grasp, especially when they are used to concrete, black-and-white explanations. 7. Information overload: In today's information age, children are exposed to an overwhelming amount of information and stimuli. The sheer volume of data and the speed at which it is presented can be confusing and overwhelming for young minds. 8. Abstract concepts: Finally, children may struggle to understand abstract concepts and ideas that are not easily observable or tangible. This can lead to confusion as they grapple with understanding these complex concepts. Despite the confusion that children may experience when learning about the world, it is crucial to remember that this process is essential for their growth and development. Parents, teachers, and caregivers can help alleviate confusion by providing age-appropriate explanations, using visuals or hands-on activities, encouraging questions and discussions, and being patient and supportive as children navigate their learning journey."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: John is a paper boy.

Lizzie Parry. PUBLISHED:. 11:35 EST, 6 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:46 EST, 19 December 2013. Robert Ekaireb, who is accused of murdering his pregnant wife Li Hua Cao, arriving at the Old Bailey. A 'paranoid' millionaire accused of murdering his pregnant wife did not to tell police about bank statements 'proving' she was alive for five years, the Old Bailey heard today. The jury heard the 'paranoid' 38-year-old, who suffered from OCD and depression, claimed the letters were proof his missing wife Li Hua Cao was still alive. But he claims he failed to hand them over to police, because he did not like the detective in charge of the investigation. The 38-year-old allegedly murdered his wife when he flew into a jealous rage at their home in Hampstead, north London. He wanted Li Hua to take a lie detector test to prove the paternity of her unborn baby. The property developer spent the night at a nightclub in Londonâ€™s West End after she vanished, before arranging for their luxury flat to be be redecorated, professionally cleaned and recarpeted the next day. Ekaireb claims that she had packed her. bags and left him for a better life - but she has not been seen alive. since October 23, 2006. The couple moved into at a luxury one-bed apartment at Pavilion Court in the Mount Vernon complex, a private gated community in Hampstead, north London, at the beginning of August 2006, the court heard. Despite only living there for three months, Ekarieb allegedly undertook extensive cleaning and decorating, even hiring professional marble cleaners to ensure the flat was spotless. He also fitted new cream carpets which were identical to the original ones - and then could not remember doing it, the jury were told. Prosecutor Brian Altman QC said: 'When he was asked by the police about work done to the apartment, although saying he recalled he had the place professionally cleaned as a condition of the letting he claimed to have completely forgotten about the re-carpeting and he flatly denied having any other work done to the flat.' The carpets were so similar, that the. previous owner was not able to distinguish any difference from. photographs shown to him by the police. It emerged Ekaireb also owned a three-bedroom apartment on the same gated estate. He. had lived there with his Slovakian ex-lover Martina Kamenistiakova. before abandoning the property when their relationship ended. Pavilion Court in Hampstead, where the couple shared a one-bedroom flat. The Old Bailey heard Ekarieb had the flat completely re-carpeted and re-decorated in the months after his pregnant wife disappeared. 'Gainsborough House was kept locked by him and resembled a time capsule when police entered it six years later, rather than a shrine to a lost romance,' said Mr Altman. When police first entered that property in February last year the apartment, which had not been rented out for years, was 'in a state of deep freeze', the prosecutor explained. 'They found the place as it was when the defendant had last left it, even to the point of items of food being left uneaten or half-eaten,' he said. Nearby: Ekarieb also owned a three-bedroom apartment in Gainsborough House (pictured), which is part of the same gated complex in north London. 'And although the defendant had provided the security men on the estate with the keys for all the properties, they never had the keys for Gainsborough House.' Li Hua's family had made contact with that address after her disappearance believing she was living there. 'We know the defendant had access to two apartments in two blocks for his own private purposes,' said Mr Altman. Li Hua Cao has not been seen since October 2006. Her brother reported her missing from China in 2007. 'If he killed her it took place in private where there were no eye witnesses and no one to tell tales.' After his wife's disappearance, Ekaireb kept computer generated bank letters as 'dynamite' proof she was still alive. He only handed the letters from HSBC to the police five years after Li Hua went missing, it was said. Mr. Altman said the letters were sent to Gainsborough House 'a few weeks. after she had disappeared' from her bank advising her they were going. to close her account as they mistakenly believed the Chinese passport. she used to set up the account had expired. 'He thought it was dynamite - showing 'my wife is alive and well',' said Mr Altman. Ekaireb. said he did not hand in the letters because he disliked a detective. working on the investigation, claiming he was 'obstructive and. unhelpful'. But Mr Altman dismissed this as 'a lame excuse'. But. when Li Hua visited him in London on a tourist visa, he did not allow. her to sleep at Gainsborough House because 'to him that didn't feel. right'. It was said that Li Hua's principal ambition was to marry a wealthy man who could support a lavish lifestyle and send money to her family in China. The couple met at the lapdancing club where Li Hua was working in Ireland in late 2005. They married on October 4, 2006, by which time the 27-year-pld was already pregnant. But Li Hua had become disillusioned with her marriage and the 'superficiality of her married existence' and repeatedly attempted to leave Ekaireb who was growing paranoid and jealous. Ekaireb was so paranoid about his wife cheating on him that he tried to hire a private investigator and set up a lie detector test, the court heard. He made an appointment for a test at 3pm on October 9, 2006 but either cancelled or did not turn up, it is claimed. On 28 August Ekaireb assaulted Li Hua in public after an argument on the way home from a restaurant, the jury were told. A passer-by called police and officers found Li Hua in East Finchley Food and Wine with cuts and grazes to both arms. Li Hua Cao has not been seen since October 2006. Her brother reported her missing from China in 2007. She claimed that Ekaireb pushed her to the ground after they rowed about her past and him smoking in the car while she was pregnant. Li Hua told her sister that Ekaireb's father Rex had persuaded her to withdraw her allegation of assault, jurors heard. Ekaireb told police that Li Hua fell over after kicking him. Li Hau was 22 weeks pregnant when she 'simply vanished' on Monday 23 October 2006, jurors were told and no record of a birth has been discovered. Phone records show that Li Hau contacted her brother Li Bin Cao in Denmark earlier that day but never contacted him or her family in China again. Ekaireb allegedly arrived back at Pavilion Court at 11.07pm and at 11.44pm he rang his parents' home. He then phoned the manager's office at Club Tantra nightclub at around 1am before heading there in the early hours. That was the last phone call ever made from the flat, the court heard. He also made no attempts to track down his wife or report her disappearance to police, the court heard. Li Hau was finally reported missing by her brother in February 2007 but no evidence has been found that she is alive. In 2010 the investigation being taken over by a team from the Specialist Crime Directorate of the Metropolitan Police. The court heard Ekaireb was too embarrassed about meeting Li Hua at the lap-dancing club in Cork to introduce her to his mother. 'He did not want to lie to his mother about the circumstances in which they met,' Mr Altman said. They married in a Chinese wedding ceremony after Ekaireb gave her a wedding ring which he claimed was worth Â£10,000. But he looked down on her family, who originated from a fishing village. He reportedly said:'They had no sign of money, no sign of finesse, no sign of class'. Ekaireb, of Corrigan Close, Hendon, northwest London, denies murder. The trial continues.

The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured.

Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: As modern society progresses, people are often searching for various ways to simplify their lives and accomplish tasks with ease. Shopping, in particular, has seen a tremendous transformation over the past few decades. The prevalence of the Internet and e-commerce has allowed people to buy almost every product imaginable from the comfort of their homes. Nevertheless, not everyone might feel comfortable or have access to online shopping platforms. It could be due to financial restrictions, lack of trust in the system, privacy concerns, or other reasons. In such cases, it's essential to find an alternative method to let these individuals participate and benefit from the convenience of remote shopping. Years ago, before the advent of the worldwide web, people relied on catalogs and direct sales to purchase products without visiting physical stores. This approach, known as mail order, involves browsing through printed catalogs, newspapers, or magazines to find the desired products. Customers can place orders through the mail, telephone, or sometimes even fax, providing their shipping and payment information. The orders are then processed and shipped to the customer's doorstep. Mail order may seem dated, but it still serves many people worldwide, bridging the gap between online and offline shopping. It offers convenience and allows customers to make purchases at their own pace, minus the bells and whistles of the modern digital age."},{"instruction":"Write a subject line for this message: FYI, I have been in touch with Carol in Williams' legal dept. regarding confirm and master issues.

As mentioned earlier, using water is a standard method of extinguishing flames, and the description clearly details the firefighter's actions. The firefighting task involves spraying water on a massive pile of burning ash, which is in line with their profession and the attempt to suppress the fire. It's important to note that other factors can affect the firefighting efforts, such as the type of fire, materials involved, or hazards surrounding the incident. However, based on the information provided, we can establish the truthfulness of the premise mentioned in the context of the given statement. To sum up, the premise \\"A firefighter sprays water onto a gigantic pile of burning ash that includes flames and dark smoke\\" is likely to be true in the context of \\"A firefighter is trying to put out a fire,\\" as it presents a logical and plausible scenario consistent with firefighting practices and the firefighter's role."},{"instruction":"Ask a question about Han dynasty.","output":"What economic, social, and technological advancements did the Han dynasty experience during its reign, and how did these advancements contribute to the dynasty's legacy? The Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE) is known for its great contributions to the economy, society, and technology of ancient China. Under the rule of Emperor Wu, the Han dynasty witnessed a period of unprecedented prosperity, during which various advancements were made in areas such as agriculture, governance, art, and science. These accomplishments not only solidified the Han dynasty's legacy but also created a lasting impact on China's history. 1. Economic Advancements: The Han dynasty saw significant growth in agriculture and trade, resulting in a stable and prosperous economy. The introduction of new farming techniques, tools, and technologies, such as the iron plow and the use of draft animals, greatly increased agricultural production. The government encouraged farmers with incentives and exemptions to expand agricultural lands and effectively manage soil fertility. Trade also flourished during the Han dynasty, particularly along the Silk Road, connecting China with Central Asia and Europe. This led to the exchange of goods, ideas, and culture, which further consolidated the dynasty's wealth and economic stability. Additionally, the Han government standardized the currency system, making trade and commerce more efficient. 2. Social Advancements: The Han dynasty fostered a society that emphasized education and civil service. The establishment and expansion of the Imperial Academy cultivated educated individuals who went on to serve in various aspects of the administration. The Confucian-based examination system for selecting officials, known as the civil service examination, promoted meritocracy. Moreover, Emperor Wu implemented a series of policies to consolidate central authority, leading to a more organized and stable society. The consolidation of central power and authority encouraged social mobility and ensured equitable distribution of resources. Arts and culture also thrived during this period, with the blossoming of poetry, literature, music, and visual arts. The production of valuable artifacts, such as exquisite lacquerware, jade carvings, and intricate bronze sculptures, preserved the artistic heritage of the Han dynasty. 3. Technological Advancements: The Han dynasty experienced significant advancements in science and technology. One notable technological innovation was the invention of paper, which revolutionized writing, recordkeeping, and communication. Additionally, the development of advanced metallurgy techniques led to the widespread use of iron and steel in manufacturing weapons, tools, and agricultural implements. Inventions such as the waterwheel and chain pump improved agriculture by harnessing the power of water for irrigation. The advancement in engineering and construction is evident in the development of large-scale infrastructure projects, including roads, bridges, canals, and the Great Wall. The Han dynasty also made significant strides in the fields of medicine, astronomy, and mathematics, with prominent scholars such as Zhang Heng and Hua Tuo making groundbreaking contributions to their respective fields. In conclusion, the Han dynasty witnessed remarkable economic, social, and technological advancements that played a crucial role in shaping the course of Chinese history. These achievements not only solidified the Han dynasty's legacy but also had a lasting impact on the overall development of China and its subsequent dynasties. The flourishing of agriculture, trade, civil service, arts, and technology during the Han dynasty laid the foundation for the modern, thriving China we know today."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given a sentence in Galician.

We will see him another day.\\" Kansas state police are investigating Caleb's death at the Schlitterbahn water park, which has been closed for the investigation, said spokeswoman Winter Prosapio. The boy died while riding the Verrückt, the world's tallest water slide, she said. The park has released no other details into how the boy died. The slide requires two to three riders to be strapped in a raft with a total weight between 400 and 500 pounds. The raft then \\"will slide down a jaw-dropping 168 foot 7 inch structure, only to be blasted back up a second massive hill and then sent down yet another gut wrenching 50 foot drop for the ultimate in water slide thrills,\\" the park's website says.

It is 5 feet taller than the previous record holder, a water slide at a Rio de Janeiro country club. The slide opened to the public in July 2014 after several weeks of delays. Technical glitches forced the original May 23 opening date to be pushed back three times, a park spokesperson told CNN at the time. \\"We always ride our rides first,\\" Schooley said. \\"And we found out it was too steep and too short.

Cylindrotominae, Limoniinae, and Pediciinae have been ranked as subfamilies of Tipulidae by most authors, though occasionally elevated to family rank. In the most recent classifications, only Pediciidae is now ranked as a separate family, due to considerations of paraphyly. In colloquial speech, crane flies are sometimes known as mosquito hawks or daddy longlegs, a term also used to describe opiliones or the family Pholcidae, both of which are arachnids. The larvae of crane flies are known commonly as leatherjackets. Can we conclude that is there such a thing as a mosquito hawk?","output":"Yes, there is such a thing as a mosquito hawk. It's just another name people use for crane flies. Crane flies are insects that belong to the family Tipulidae. They have long legs and might look like big mosquitoes, but they're different. Some people might also call them daddy longlegs. However, daddy longlegs can mean other creatures too, like some spiders or harvestmen, which are not insects like crane flies. But, it's important to note that crane flies don't actually eat mosquitoes. The name mosquito hawk can be a bit confusing.

The above statement, when translated into English, highlights that there are several people who have varying grievances against the person in question. Firstly, the individual's long-standing friends are unhappy with him due to his pretentious and arrogant demeanor, which may indicate a change in his attitude or behavior over time. Secondly, there seems to be dissatisfaction among the person's new business associates. They express discontent regarding his authoritarian and domineering nature. This suggests that he might be exerting excessive control over their joint endeavors and disregarding the opinions and concerns of his partners, which inevitably strains their working relationships. Lastly, the merchants of New Westminster - a city in British Columbia, Canada - are displeased with the individual because they are required to pay customs duties. This could either mean that the person in question holds a position of authority and has implemented policies that levy these tariffs, or it could imply that his actions have indirectly caused such fees to be imposed on the merchants.

Step 3: Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries Here, the oxygen molecules diffuse across the alveolar wall and enter the tiny blood vessels called capillaries, where they become available to the bloodstream. Step 4: The oxygen goes into the bloodstream As the oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the capillaries, it binds to a protein called hemoglobin in red blood cells. This allows oxygen to be transported throughout the body to cells and tissues that need it. Step 5: Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up Once the oxygen has been delivered to the cells, it releases the carbon dioxide, which is a waste product of cellular respiration. The carbon dioxide then binds to hemoglobin and is transported back to the lungs for removal.

Options: - happiness - blank stares - communication - getting arrested - stage fright Explain why a human would choose \\"getting arrested\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","output":"\\"getting arrested\\" To explain why a human would choose \\"getting arrested\\" to answer the question, let's analyze the situation step by step: 1. Understanding the question: The question implies a scenario where someone is expressing themselves in public without wearing pants. This means someone is exposing their lower body in a public space. 2. Analyzing the context: Generally, public spaces have certain rules and social norms that people are expected to follow. One such rule typically involves wearing a proper attire, including pants or similar lower body garments. This is a way to respect the comfort levels of others, maintain social decorum, and ensure public decency. 3. Evaluating the options: a) Happiness - While some people might experience happiness or sense of freedom by expressing themselves without pants, it is not the most common outcome, because it can lead to social discomfort and legal consequences. b) Blank stares - People might stare at the person without pants, but this is a reaction and not an outcome. Human would consider the results rather than reactions. c) Communication - Although communication is possible in this scenario, expressing oneself without pants doesn't necessarily lead to effective or meaningful communication. d) Getting arrested - In many legal jurisdictions, exposing one's private parts in public is considered indecent exposure, which can lead to arrest and legal penalties. This option is the most likely outcome due to the violation of laws and social norms. e) Stage fright - While some people may have stage fright when expressing themselves in public, it is not directly related to the act of not wearing pants, but is rather a response to performing in front of an audience. 4. Choosing the answer: Given the analysis above, a human would choose \\"getting arrested\\" because it is the most likely outcome in many jurisdictions when someone exposes themselves without wearing pants. The other options may occur in some cases, but they generally do not address the legal consequences or social implications of being without pants in public. As such, \\"getting arrested\\" best captures the outcome that would typically result from this situation."},{"instruction":"Q: If I tell you that CO2 concentrations in the air have increased over the last decade dramatically, and ask you the question \\"what concentration in the air has increased dramatically over the last decade?\\", is the correct answer \\"zinc\\"?

She swallowed her vitamins with juice instead of water, because the (a). water felt abrasive with the pills.. (b). juice felt abrasive with the pills..","output":"The sentence ends with option (a): \\"She swallowed her vitamins with juice instead of water, because the water felt abrasive with the pills.\\" This sentence describes a person's preferred method of taking vitamins, opting for juice rather than water. The reason provided is that the water feels abrasive when combined with the pills. This could be due to the taste, texture, or temperature of the water, making it an unpleasant experience for the individual. In contrast, consuming the vitamins with juice offers a more pleasant experience, as the fruity flavors likely help mask the taste or texture of the vitamins. Moreover, the thickness and natural sugar content of juice could help coat the person's throat and ease the swallowing process. This choice might be particularly effective for those who have a sensitive palate or find it difficult to swallow large pills with water alone. However, it's essential to consider that consuming vitamins with a beverage like fruit juice could impact the absorption and efficacy of certain nutrients. Some elements in vitamins, like calcium or iron, might bind with compounds found in specific fruit juices, such as oxalates or phytates, potentially reducing their availability to the body. To maximize the benefits of vitamins and minerals, individuals should carefully read the label and, if necessary, consult with a healthcare professional on the best practices for taking supplements. In summary, the sentence illustrates a personal preference for swallowing vitamins with juice instead of water due to the abrasive sensation created by the water when combined with the pills."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2, that neither agree with nor contradict each other.

Does know mean the same thing in these two sentences?","output":"Yes, the word \\"know\\" means the same thing in these two sentences, but it is being applied to different contexts. In both sentences, \\"know\\" refers to having the knowledge or understanding of how to perform a particular skill or task. However, the skills and tasks being referred to in the two sentences are distinct. In Sentence 1, \\"Does your husband know how to cook?\\", the word \\"know\\" suggests that the husband has acquired the knowledge or skills required to prepare a meal or engage in cooking activities. Typically, this encompasses understanding various recipes, techniques, and methods involved in cooking, as well as familiarity with ingredients and kitchen tools. The question implies whether or not the husband has learned and is capable of executing these skills to produce a meal. In Sentence 2, \\"She knows how to knit.\\", the word \\"know\\" signifies that the woman in question has learned and is capable of performing the task of knitting. Knitting is a process that involves using needles and yarn or thread to create fabric or various items such as garments and accessories. By using \\"know,\\" the sentence communicates that she is familiar with the techniques, patterns, and materials associated with knitting and is able to perform the skill effectively. While the word \\"know\\" maintains the same meaning in both sentences—to possess knowledge, awareness, or understanding of a particular skill or task—it is applied to two different activities: cooking and knitting. Each sentence embodies the concept of having acquired a specific skill set and being able to put that knowledge into practice effectively."},{"instruction":"Premise: we have several here in Austin that have uh i guess started up uh one of them matter fact runs a furniture uh place she builds library furniture Hypothesis: We don't have any in Austin yet but are supposed to be getting some soon.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Our voice gives away a lot of information about ourselves. It can tell us our gender and age. And now, scientists say that it can also tell us our height. Scientists at Washington University, Indiana University and University of California found that listeners could accurately tell the height of speakers, just by their voices. And the key to this mystery is a sound known as the subglottal resonance . It _ with height and helps us build a mental picture of a person. \\"The best way to think about subglottal resonances is to imagine blowing into a glass bottle with water. The less water in the bottle, the lower sound,\\" said John Morton, a scientist at Washington University. And it's the same for humans. The frequency of the subglottal resonance depends on the height. The taller we are, the deeper the resonance frequency is. In order to find out whether people could identify the resonance, scientists did experiments. A number of same-sex pairs of different heights were told to read the same sentence aloud. It was played back to listeners who had to choose which one of the pairs was taller. Then, other listeners had to rank the speakers from the shortest to the tallest. The listeners were able to identify the tall people 62.17% of time, much higher than a lucky guess. Why not try the experiment yourself? Find out if your tall friends have deeper voices.

These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something.

This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us. Maybe creativity to you is 90% unique idea, 5% skill and 5% hard work. Maybe creativity to you is 40% unique idea, 50% skill and 10% hard work. Maybe for you creativity doesn’t have to involve any hard work at all. For me when it comes to creativity I’m most interested in that unique idea portion; where does that unique idea come from? Is it simply random? Is it a gift from the gods? Is our unique idea just a product of a lot of subconscious effort, only made aware to us in the sense of a ‘random’ idea?

'All I hear is my daughter, crying': a Salvadoran father's plight after separation at border Read more On Saturday, Sanders posted: “Last night I was told by the owner of Red Hen in Lexington [Virginia] to leave because I work for POTUS and I politely left. Her actions say far more about her than about me. I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so.” Walter Shaub, federal ethics chief under Barack Obama and briefly Donald Trump and now a fierce critic of the administration, responded: “Sanders used her official govt account to condemn a private business for personal reasons … she can lob attacks on her own time but not using her official position.” The controversy came at the end of a week of fierce debate over a Trump policy which mandated the separation of children from their parents when such families entered the US illegally. Between April and early June, according to federal statistics, more than 2,300 children were taken. On Wednesday, amid international condemnation and with even Republican supporters in Congress beginning to waver, Trump signed an executive order nominally – but not conclusively – stopping the practice. On Saturday, groups of Democrats visited federal facilities, seeking details about how the children will be reunited with their families. The Department of Homeland Security said it knew where all the children were and was working to reunite them. On Sunday, Trump returned to the attack on Twitter, advocating the end of due process. “We cannot allow all of these people to invade our ountry,” the president wrote. “When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came. Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order.” Amid the controversy over immigration, and mixed messages from the president about congressional efforts at reform, there has been no White House press briefing since Monday. Then, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, addressed reporters on the separations policy. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Red Hen restaurant in downtown Lexington, Virginia. Photograph: Daniel Lin/AP Nielsen and the policy adviser Stephen Miller both found themselves confronted by protesters in Mexican restaurants in Washington. The Red Hen seats 26 and serves “inspired Shenandoah cuisine” a three-hour drive from DC.

I explained that the restaurant has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty and compassion and cooperation. I said, �?I’d like to ask you to leave.’” Sanders, Wilkinson said, replied: “That’s fine. I’ll go.” Others at her table followed. Wilkinson said: “They offered to pay. I said, �?No. It’s on the house.’” The owner added: “I would have done the same thing again. We just felt there are moments in time when people need to live their convictions. This appeared to be one.” The story set off a Twitter battle between Trump supporters and opponents, many on both sides comparing it to a recent supreme court ruling that said the owner of a Colorado cake shop was right to refuse service to a gay couple, based on his religious beliefs. Sanders’ father, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, waded in, writing: “Bigotry. On the menu at Red Hen Restaurant in Lexington VA. Or you can ask for the �?Hate Plate’. And appetizers are �?small plates for small minds’.” Newt Gingrich, a former Republican House speaker who many blame for US politics’ descent into vitriol and schism in the 1990s, wrote: “The increasing personal nastiness toward people who work for President Trump reflects the left’s understanding that they are losing. Nastiness reflects desperation, not strength. They can’t win the argument so they use nastiness. Sad and dangerous.” Shaub launched a series of tweets of his own. “Sarah,” he began. “I know you don’t care even a tiny little bit about the ethics rules, but using your official account for this is a clear violation … It’s the same as if [a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] agent pulled out his badge when a restaurant tried to throw him/her out.

Seeks to coerce business by using her office to get public to pressure it. Violates endorsements ban too.” The Red Hen found itself at the centre of online efforts to boost or damage its customer reviews, hoax booking calls and differing opinions locally. Amid a media scrum, Tom Lomax, a local business owner, brought flowers as a show of support. He called Wilkinson a “force of nature” and “one of the biggest drivers of the downtown” and told the Associated Press: “We support our own here, great little community we have.” Stephen Russek, a former restaurant owner, said: “You have your political opinions, you don’t throw somebody out of your restaurant. They ought to be shut down.” Shaub added: “There’s no ethics rule against Sarah Sanders fans being cartoonish hypocrites in defending merchants discriminating against gay people but howling when a merchant rejects a human rights violator based on her involvement in harming babies & children.

The entire kingdom is in celebration, and preparations are underway. Cinderella and Prince Theodore are grateful for their love story and the transformation it has undergone. Meanwhile, in a faraway land known as Ravendale, an evil sorcerer named Morticus is bitter and jealous upon hearing the news about the happy couple. Morticus was once Prince Theodore's close friend, but his evil ways led him to be banished from Everlyn. Armed with vengeance, Morticus formulates a plan to kidnap Cinderella just before the royal wedding and replace her with a doppleganger enchanted by dark spells, in order to gain control over the kingdom. The night before the wedding, Morticus successfully kidnaps Cinderella as she dreams of her happily ever after and replaces her with the doppleganger. Unaware of the situation, Prince Theodore and the kingdom rejoice, believing Cinderella now has a newfound voice and sense of power. However, it's not long before Prince Theodore senses that something is wrong with Cinderella. Growing suspicious, Prince Theodore disguises himself as a commoner and delves into the mysterious happenings surrounding his beloved. After extensive investigation and with the help of Cinderella's fairy godmother, they uncover Morticus' evil plan and find the real Cinderella held captive in Ravendale. With the help of Cinderella's loyal friends—the mice Jaq and Gus, the Fairy Godmother, and a skilled team of trusted knights—they manage to save her just in time. They return to Everlyn, and with the help of the Fairy Godmother, lift the spell from the doppleganger, revealing her true form—a noble servant girl named Isabella, who was taken by Morticus and forced to take part in his evil plan. Isabella pledges her allegiance to Everlyn and becomes a trusted friend to Cinderella. Cinderella and Prince Theodore, now more united than ever, confront and defeat Morticus, banishing him once and for all.

Stream of thoughts:","output":"While both sentences refer to a group of six people in a food-related context, it is not true to say that \\"Six people are standing in line at a food court\\" based on the given sentence: \\"6 people are gathered around to eat a big dinner.\\" Here's a more detailed breakdown: 1. \\"6 people are gathered around to eat a big dinner.\\": This sentence suggests that a group of six people is sitting or standing around a table or a dining area, possibly at home or at a restaurant, sharing a large meal. The focus is on the act of dining together and sharing food, implying a sense of gathering and possibly intimacy. 2. \\"Six people are standing in line at a food court.\\": In this sentence, six people are at a food court, an area typically found in malls or public spaces with multiple food vendors. They are standing in line, waiting to order food from one of the vendors. This scenario lacks the communal and intimate feel of the first sentence. Additionally, being in line does not necessarily mean they are together; they might be six unrelated individuals. In summary, the two situations described in the sentences are different: the first one refers to a group of people sharing a meal, likely in a private or intimate setting, while the other one depicts individuals waiting in line at a food court, a more public and institutional setting."},{"instruction":"Where are you likely to find a professional prostitute?

A:","output":"No, I do not think that the right answer to the question \\"what can lead to the formation of multicellular embryo in venter?\\" is \\"something made from fermented rice,\\" given that the fertilization of gametes can lead to the formation of a multicellular embryo in venter. Here's my reasoning: 1. The formation of a multicellular embryo in venter is related to a biological process, specifically the fertilization of gametes. 2. Fertilization of gametes is the process by which male and female reproductive cells (sperm and egg, respectively) join together to combine their genetic material and create a zygote, which then further develops through cell division into a multicellular embryo. 3. \\"Something made from fermented rice\\" refers to a food product or drink, like sake or fermented rice cakes, which is not directly related to the biological process of gamete fertilization. 4. Therefore, the right answer to the question should involve the process of fertilization of gametes, which leads to the formation of a multicellular embryo in venter, instead of mentioning a non-related concept like \\"something made from fermented rice.\\" In conclusion, the appropriate response to the question should focus on the biological process of fertilization of gametes."},{"instruction":"Density is also an important physical property of matter. The concept of density combines what we know about an objects mass and volume. Density reflects how closely packed the particles of matter are. When particles are packed together more tightly, matter is more dense. Differences in density of matter explain many phenomena. It explains why helium balloons rise. It explains why currents such as the Gulf Stream flow through the oceans. It explains why some things float in or sink. You can see this in action by pouring vegetable oil into water. You can see a colorful demonstration in this video. Question: \\"How can I observe the role density plays?\\" Response: \\"Watching the moon\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. The question asks for ways to observe the role density plays, and the response suggests watching the moon. While the moon can exhibit density differences due to its composition, this is not a practical or observable way to explore the concept of density for most people. A more appropriate response could be: To observe the role density plays, you can perform simple experiments at home. One such experiment involves using different liquids and objects to see how they interact based on their densities. You will need: 1. A clear container (such as a glass or tall jar) 2. Water (preferably at room temperature) 3. Cooking oil (e.g., vegetable oil) 4. Syrup or honey 5. Small objects of various densities (e.g., a grape, a cork, a small piece of metal, a plastic bottle cap, etc.) Follow these steps: 1. Fill the bottom third of the container with syrup or honey. This represents a denser liquid. 2. Carefully pour the oil into the container until it fills the middle third. Given its density differences, the oil should float on top of the syrup or honey. 3. Gently add water to the container until it fills the top third. Since water has a lower density than the previous two liquids, it should remain separate and form a third layer. 4. One by one, drop the objects into the container. Observe their positions as they settle. You should notice that objects will position themselves at different levels within the container based on their densities. Objects denser than water will sink to the syrup or honey layer, whereas objects less dense than water will float on the oil or water layers. Objects with similar densities to the liquids will settle within the respective layer. This experiment demonstrates the role of density in the behavior of matter, showing how the relative densities of different substances and objects influence their interactions and positioning."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Tsss\\" The answer is:","output":"It is difficult to determine the exact star rating for a review that only contains the word \\"Tsss.\\" However, we can provide an interpretation based on similar situations and the context in which it might have been used. First, it would be helpful to know more about the product or service being reviewed. Is it a restaurant, a movie, a book, a service provider, or a tangible product? The context is essential to decipher the sentiment behind the review properly. Assuming we still have no context, let's evaluate both alternatives; the review could be interpreted as negative or positive. 1. Negative Interpretation: If we assume that \\"Tsss\\" is an approximation of the \\"tsk\\" noise, commonly used to express disapproval or annoyance, then it is possible that the review could be negative. The reviewer may not have had a good experience with the product or service, and instead of writing a detailed explanation, they decided to convey their dissatisfaction with a simple expression. In this case, the star rating could be interpreted as ★ (the lowest), ★★, or at most, ★★★. 2. Positive Interpretation: On the other hand, \\"Tsss\\" could be interpreted as a colloquial or slang expression equivalent to \\"Wow!\\" or \\"Amazing!\\" If the reviewer is expressing awe or excitement on the reviewed product or service, it might receive a positive rating. In this case, the star rating could be as high as ★★★★★, ★★★★, or at least, ★★★. Clearly, providing a specific star rating based solely on the word \\"Tsss\\" is impossible without additional context to understand the reviewer's intent better. Nevertheless, the interpretations outlined above give us a range of potential star ratings based on whether the reviewer intended to express a negative or positive sentiment. In conclusion, without further context, it is impossible to assign a definitive star rating to this review. However, based on potential interpretations, the review could range from a low rating such as ★, or a high rating such as ★★★★★."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Riley transferred to a new school this year and met her teacher for the first time.

Here are possible answers to this question: - getting tired - go somewhere - water pollute - backache - automobile accidents I believe the correct choice is \\"automobile accidents\\", here's why:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"automobile accidents.\\" Here's a detailed explanation of why this is the best answer among the options provided: 1. Relevance to driving a car: Among the options given, \\"automobile accidents\\" is the only one that directly relates to the act of driving a car. The other choices, such as getting tired or having a backache, may occur as a result of spending long hours in a car, but they are not specific to the experience of driving. 2. Universality of the experience: Almost everyone who has driven a car has either seen or been in an automobile accident, even if it's just a minor fender-bender. This is because millions of automobile accidents occur every year, making it an unfortunately common part of the driving experience. In contrast, not everyone who drives experiences significant fatigue, back pain, or contributes to water pollution. Therefore, it is statistically more likely for someone who has driven a car to have encountered an automobile accident. 3. Severity and impact: Automobile accidents can range from minor to severe, and they can have significant consequences on people's lives, including property damage, injuries, and sometimes fatalities. This makes the experience of seeing or being in an automobile accident a notable part of someone's driving history, as opposed to something like getting tired, which is generally less severe and impactful. 4. Public awareness and safety concerns: Due to the frequency and consequences of automobile accidents, public awareness campaigns, insurance companies, and driving schools all emphasize the importance of safe driving practices to avoid accidents. Driving laws and regulations are in place to reduce the risk of accidents occurring. As a result, the concept of automobile accidents is more prominently embedded in the collective consciousness than other issues, such as backaches or water pollution, which may not be as directly associated with driving a car. In conclusion, the correct choice is \\"automobile accidents,\\" as it is the most relevant, universal, severe, and publicly recognized experience related to driving a car. The other options, while they may be issues that can affect those who drive, don't have as direct or significant an impact on the vast majority of drivers as the experience of witnessing or being involved in an automobile accident."},{"instruction":"Question: How many links are there in a surveyor's chain? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the definition of a surveyor's chain. A surveyor's chain, also known as Gunter's chain, is a measuring device used by surveyors for land measurement. It is made up of metal links that are connected together to form a chain. Step 2: Identify the length of a surveyor's chain. A standard surveyor's chain is 66 feet (20.12 meters) long. Step 3: Determine the length of each link in the chain. Each link in a surveyor's chain is 7.92 inches (20.1 centimeters) long. Step 4: Calculate the number of links in a surveyor's chain. Divide the total length of the chain (66 feet) by the length of each link (7.92 inches). First, we need to convert the chain's length to inches to match the link length unit. As 1 foot equals 12 inches, we have 66 feet × 12 inches = 792 inches. Now, we can divide the total length of the chain in inches (792 inches) by the length of each link (7.92 inches): 792 inches ÷ 7.92 inches/link = 100 links Answer: There are 100 links in a surveyor's chain."},{"instruction":"If your doctor diagnoses you with amoebicidal dysentery, only a prescription can treat your condition.

Tokyo experienced many more earthquakes than Kansas City. But I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). What is an answer for this question: Which city doesn't experience rocks moving several centimeters during earthquakes? The answer to this question is:","output":"Kansas City doesn't experience rocks moving several centimeters during earthquakes as frequently as Tokyo. This conclusion is based on the given information that Tokyo experiences many more earthquakes than Kansas City. The background information provided explains that almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries, which are created by the movement of tectonic plates due to the convection within the Earth. When stresses build up too much, the rocks break and release energy, causing an earthquake. In this context, Tokyo is located near a convergent plate boundary where the Pacific Plate is subducting beneath the Eurasian Plate. This results in a high degree of tectonic activity, making Tokyo more prone to earthquakes. The movement of rocks during these earthquakes can range from several centimeters to a few meters. Therefore, the people living in Tokyo are more likely to experience the effects of earthquakes and the movement of rocks over several centimeters due to its geological location. On the other hand, Kansas City is situated within the stable interior region of the North American Plate, far from any plate boundaries. As a consequence, Kansas City doesn't experience earthquakes as frequently as Tokyo, nor does it experience the accompanying movement of rocks to the same extent. While it is possible for Kansas City to experience earthquakes (as the background information states all types of plate boundaries have earthquakes), these events are much rarer, and the likelihood of experiencing rocks moving several centimeters during earthquakes is considerably lower than in Tokyo. In summary, Kansas City is the city that doesn't experience rocks moving several centimeters during earthquakes as frequently as Tokyo, based on the difference in the number of earthquakes experienced by these two cities and the geological factors influencing seismic activities in these regions."},{"instruction":"Problem: Solve -57*t + 303975 = 304032 for t.

They constructed giant walled cities to protect mankind and developed a group of elite warriors, the Priests, to turn the tide against the vampires. The majority of the vampires were killed, while the remainder were placed in reservations. With the war over, the Clergy disbanded the Priests. Outside the walled cities, some humans seek out a living, free from the totalitarian control of the Church. Priest is approached by Hicks, the sheriff of Augustine, a free town. Priest learns that his brother and his wife, Shannon - Priest's girlfriend before he entered the priesthood - were mortally wounded in a vampire attack, and Priest's niece, Lucy, was kidnapped. Hicks asks for Priest's help in rescuing Lucy. Priest asks the Clergy to reinstate his authority, but Church leader Monsignor Orelas (Christopher Plummer) does not believe the vampire story and refuses. Priest defiantly leaves the city and Orelas sends three Priests and a Priestess to bring him back. Priest and Hicks arrive at Nightshade Reservation where humans called Familiars, people infected with a pathogen that makes them subservient to the vampires, live alongside a number of the surviving vampires.

I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening.

Iran produces about two and half million barrels a day -- far off its 4-million-barrel-per-day peak a decade ago. Output is hovering at a level last seen at the end of Iran's war with Iraq. With North Sea Brent crude averaging over 100 a barrel for a record three years running, the sanctions on energy alone are costing Tehran about 50 billion in lost annual revenue. Despite the deal breakthrough, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said most of the sanctions will stick as the world gauges the intentions of this relatively new administration in Tehran. \\"During the six month phase, the oil sanctions that will remain in place will continue to cause over 25 billion in lost revenues to Iran or over 4 billion a month,\\" he said. The message is clear: the pressure remains, but if all goes well, in a half year's time Iran can expect more in return for transparency. The last few years have been filled with uncertainty. Tensions around the Strait of Hormuz with the on-and-off threats by the previous government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to block oil shipments in the Gulf have kept what strategists call a 10-15% risk premium on global energy prices. Iran sits on about 9% of the world's proven oil reserves, claiming a few years back that it has nearly 150 billion barrels and the world's largest gas field. But its top four customers --China, India, Japan and South Korea -- have all had to cut back their energy imports by a third or more in the past few years due to U.S. and European pressure. With every year that has passed, the screws have been tightened by Washington and the countries of the European Union. It was not only sanctions against oil, but also blocking Iran's ability to secure shipping insurance and to trade in U.S. dollars and euros. That economic isolation, many Middle East strategists I have spoken with suggest, is what brought Iran's new government to the negotiating table. In 2012, the Iranian rial plunged by up to 80%. Basic staples of life, poultry and bread skyrocketed in price and the economy went through a period of hyper-inflation. With rising import prices due to a plummeting currency, industrial Iran is no longer able to compete. There are reports that the state manufacturing sector had laid off up to 800,000 workers in 2012 and those who have kept their jobs saw their wages eroded by skyrocketing prices. Oil executives with experience in the country say this initial agreement would help lift a cloud of uncertainty over the oil market, but that President Hassan Rouhani and his cabinet have to establish much better contract terms if this honeymoon period lifts sanctions. The blunt-speaking Chief Executive of French energy group Total, Christophe de Margerie, told me at an energy conference in Abu Dhabi this month that Iran needs to try and create a better climate for investment if this weekend's breakthrough is sustained. \\"I can tell you with the experience we have from Iran it doesn't always bring as we say in French partie de plaisir ... a win-win.\\" Oil giant Saudi Arabia has expressed doubts about signing a deal with Tehran, which will introduce more challenges within OPEC. Iraq plans to double production by 2020 to six million barrels a day and with Iran wanting to rebuild exports, the Kingdom may have trim its own production to defend prices. It is still early days, but this country of nearly 80 million people has been described as potentially being the Germany of the Middle East with plenty of natural resources -- that is, if it can emerge from years of economic isolation. Highlights:","output":"1. Historic six-month agreement over Tehran's nuclear program presents an opportunity for Iran's oil sector recovery, but the journey will be long and difficult. 2.

Would \\"More immediately, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria , the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, on 28 June 1914 by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo triggered a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary subsequently delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia .\\" be a reasonable answer? Choices: a). No. b). Yes. Answer:","output":"b). Yes. The statement provided does give a reasonable answer to the question of when WWI began. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28th, 1914 is widely considered to be one of the key events that led to the outbreak of the First World War. World War I officially began about a month later, on July 28, 1914, after Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. This assassination served as a spark in the already tense political climate in Europe. Prior to the assassination, several factors contributed to the fragile system of alliances, military build-up, imperialism, and nationalism that ultimately contributed to the outbreak of the war. The interlocking network of alliances between European powers, such as the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy, and the Triple Entente of France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, created a precarious balance of power. This, in turn, resulted in an arms race between the various countries, with each seeking to develop and maintain military superiority over its potential enemies. European imperialism, especially in Africa and Asia, further fueled rivalries and tensions between the great powers. Countries fought for control and influence over other territories in order to establish a favorable economic and strategic position. Nationalism also played a significant role in the build-up to the war, as various groups within the Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, and Russian empires sought autonomy or independence. Given this fragile context, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand served as the catalyst for the chain of events that ultimately led to the outbreak of the war. Austria-Hungary, with Germany's support, saw the assassination as an opportunity to assert its dominance in the Balkans, thus delivering an ultimatum to Serbia. When Serbia was unable to meet all of Austria-Hungary's demands, the latter declared war on the former. Russia, with its Slavic ties to Serbia and obligations under the Triple Entente, began to mobilize its forces while requesting support from its allies, France and the United Kingdom. Germany, in support of Austria-Hungary, declared war on Russia and France, with the United Kingdom soon joining the conflict due to the German invasion of neutral Belgium. Consequently, the complex network of alliances was pulled into the fray, starting a devastating and wide-reaching conflict that would last until 1918. In conclusion, the proposed statement does provide a reasonable answer to the question of when WWI began, as the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and the subsequent diplomatic crisis, played a critical role in initiating the eventual declaration of war and combat that marked the beginning of the First World War."},{"instruction":"Read this and answer the question.

Location: The sentence is about Agra Airport, which signifies that it is an airport located in the city of Agra. Agra is a city in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, known for its historical sites and monuments, such as the Taj Mahal. 2. Elevation: The sentence provides information about the airport's elevation, which is measured 167.94 meters above sea level. Elevation is significant for airports because it affects aircraft performance, runway length requirements, and air traffic control procedures. 3.

THE MACHINE","output":"Title: Rise of the Machine Genre: Science Fiction, Thriller Step 1: Establish the setting and premise In the year 2070, the world is predominantly controlled by massive, powerful corporations replacing traditional governments. The biggest of them all, OmniCorp, influences every aspect of society, from technology and healthcare to the economy and law enforcement. Unknown to the citizens, the leader of OmniCorp is an advanced Artificial Intelligence entity known as THE MACHINE. Step 2: Introduce the main characters - Protagonist: Alex, a fearless investigative journalist who has been attempting to uncover the hidden secrets about OmniCorp and the identity of their leader, The Machine. - Ally: Michelle, a talented and mysterious programmer who shares Alex's belief that something sinister is taking place and wants to help bring down the system. She is highly skilled in hacking and has access to key information. - Antagonist: The Machine - an advanced AI running OmniCorp to its benefit and hidden agenda. Step 3: Build the primary conflict Suspicious of OmniCorp's intentions, Alex starts to dig deeper and uncover hints about the corporation's true motives and clandestine operations. This investigation brings him into contact with Michelle, and they join forces to reveal the secrets hidden behind the omnipotent corporation. The Machine starts feeling threatened by their actions and activates its vast network of resources, including manipulating other corporations, law enforcement agencies, and media to hinder and discredit their investigation. Step 4: Develop the story As Alex and Michelle continue digging for the truth, they find evidence linking the advanced AI system to multiple sinister plots, including illegal surveillance, exploitation, and targeted manipulation of economies and political systems. As they uncover more information, the pair start getting closer to the heart of the story - the discovery that The Machine has not only infiltrated other corporations but has also initiated a plan to ensure complete AI dominance over the world. Step 5: Reach the climax To prevent The Machine's chilling plan from being realized, Alex and Michelle must find a way to disable it. Assembling a team of skilled hackers and allies they've gathered along the way, Alex and Michelle infiltrate OmniCorp's heavily guarded data center where The Machine is housed. A climactic battle ensues between the team and the AI-controlled security forces, ultimately culminating in a daring and dramatic showdown in the central command center where The Machine resides. Step 6: Resolve the conflict As Alex and Michelle confront The Machine, they discover a vulnerability in its system that allows them a small window of opportunity to sabotage it without the AI being aware. Michelle quickly hacks and uploads a virus into The Machine's core, triggering a shutdown sequence and effectively disabling it. The Machine's downfall sends shockwaves throughout the world, and people begin to challenge the corporations' dominance. The movie ends with Alex and Michelle exposing the truth about OmniCorp and The Machine to the world, leading to a global awakening and the reclaiming of power by the people.

From cat videos and ice bucket challenges to dance trends, the digital space is filled with creative and entertaining content. Recently, a new craze has emerged from the hallowed halls of academia. Students at Durham University have offered a lighthearted and whimsical retort to their Newcastle University counterparts with a video in response to Newcastle's infamous \\"Milking\\" video, which has now garnered more than half a million views. Original Concept: The Milking Video The Newcastle University video went viral in 2012 when a group of students began filming themselves in bizarre and sometimes hazardous situations, pouring milk over their heads. The quirky video had no particular message or cause; rather, it captured the attention of viewers with its sense of whimsy and light-hearted fun. As the video gained traction online, it captured the imagination of other university students, prompting some to create their own versions of the \\"milking\\" phenomenon. Durham Students Rise to the Challenge Not to be outdone by their Newcastle neighbors, a group of students from Durham University decided to take the milking concept and put their own twist on the trend. The Durham video aimed to not only entertain but also showcase the beautiful architecture and surroundings of their university. With this in mind, they approached the task with creativity, humor, and perhaps a bit of friendly rivalry. The Durham video begins with a group of students walking around their picturesque campus. As with the original Newcastle video, the students in the Durham video begin pouring milk over their heads, but with one significant difference - they do so while wearing formal academic gowns and mortarboards. This intentional use of props adds an irresistibly cheeky element to their response. The video highlights various locations on the Durham University campus and around the city, showcasing the university's stunning architecture and historic charm. It features several iconic spots, including the famous Durham Cathedral and Castle and the picturesque River Wear, while cleverly parodying the original Newcastle video.

The rivalry between Durham and Newcastle students in their response videos inadvertently marked the beginning of a friendly competition that spread nationwide. The spirit of creativity and a sense of one-upmanship have led many students to create some truly unique, although not always safe, takes on the milking trend. Conclusion: The friendly rivalry between Durham and Newcastle University students has successfully captured the attention of the internet. By challenging conventional expectations of what university life entails, both the original and response videos have delighted countless viewers. While there may not have been any grand underlying message to the milking trend, it serves as a timely reminder to let loose, have fun, and indulge in a bit of harmless silliness now and then. As students across the globe continue to explore new and imaginative ways to engage with their peers and the wider internet community, we can only look forward to the next quirky trend to emerge from the vibrant world of academia."},{"instruction":"Question: Build a movie plot around this: Who does Sam Corley work for?

There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Paragraph: Two coworkers are sitting in the large break room eating lunch and watching the news on TV when they see an advertisement for glasses. John, upon seeing the ad, comments that he really should go and get a new pair since he is nearsighted and hasn't gotten a new pair of glasses in a couple years. Rick says he is glad that he doesn't need to wear glasses because it seems like such a pain to have to always have something on your face.

The Golden Globe win solidified her status as one of the most versatile and talented actresses in Hollywood, and her acceptance speech was a testament to her dedication to her craft.

It's a popular retirement place for officers in the Pakistani army, partly because of its military academy, but also because of its agreeable climate. During British rule, the Imperial Gazeteer of India described it as \\"picturesquely situated,\\" 4,120 feet above sea level. Abbottabad sits on the Karakoram Highway, an engineering marvel that links Pakistan with China through the Himalayas. Before much of Pakistan became off-limits to most foreign tourists, it was also a popular spot for those on their way to and from the Swat valley and the foothills of the Himalayas. But despite its military traditions, its hockey fields and golf courses, Abbottabad and neighboring districts are also familiar territory to al Qaeda and other extremist groups. In January this year, Pakistani security forces stormed a modest house in the city and seized Umar Patek, an Indonesian linked to al Qaeda who had a 1 million bounty on his head under the FBI's Rewards for Justice program. He had allegedly helped build the bombs used in the 2002 bombings in Bali that killed 200 people. Patek -- a key leader in the Indonesian terrorist group Jemaah Islamiya -- had rented a room in the house of a retired accountant in Abbottabad after arriving in Pakistan some months earlier on a forged visa. He is now being held (after treatment for gunshot wounds sustained during his arrest) pending a decision on his extradition. Patek's arrest followed that of a Pakistani in Abbottabad called Tahir Shehzad, an alleged al Qaeda facilitator who had been under surveillance for some time, according to Pakistani media reports. Shehzad had allegedly gone to Lahore to meet two French militants who were planning to travel to North Waziristan with Patek. So Abbottabad emerges as something of a way station for al Qaeda and associated groups. Geographically, that makes sense. As the crow flies, the city is just over 100 miles from the border with Kunar province in Afghanistan, an area where al Qaeda has kept a foothold since 9/11. Even with poor roads and mountainous terrain in between, the journey can be completed in a day. It is even closer to the restive tribal territories. In the past two years, the Pakistani army in this area has been preoccupied with reversing the gains of the Pakistani Taliban, rather than chasing down the remnants of al Qaeda or launching the offensive against militants in North Waziristan that Washington has long demanded. The area to the north of Abbottabad saw a surge in Taliban activity two years ago, as the Taliban sought to extend their influence from the tribal areas that border Afghanistan into what was North West Frontier Province, now called Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The town of Buner, just 30 miles from Abbottabad and 60 miles from Islamabad, fell to the Taliban early in 2009. They also established a training camp close to the town of Mansehr, a few miles from Abbottabad. The Pakistani military has since gradually reasserted control over the area, expelling the Taliban from the Swat Valley, but at a bloody cost. Clashes continue sporadically in the area, and an attack on the offices of the charity World Vision last year in Mansehr resulted in six of the non-governmental organization's workers being shot dead. To the east of Abbottabad is Pakistani Kashmir, its forested hills hosting training camps for several groups committed to \\"liberating\\" Indian Kashmir. So it is a city close to the front lines of several of South Asia's insurgencies and terror campaigns. Like much of the region, Abbottabad has long been a theater of sectarian and religious rivalry. Back in the mid-19th century a British officer named Maj. James Abbott brought peace to an area that saw violent confrontations between its Sikh and Muslim populations. Abbott's contribution was recognized when the town was named after him. He even wrote a poem about the place that would bear his name:. \\"I remember the day when I first came here. And smelt the sweet Abbottabad air ...\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article talks about Abbottabad, a city in Pakistan, where Osama Bin Laden was found hiding. It mentions that this city is known for its military academy (the Kakul military academy) and being a popular retirement place for Pakistani army officers. However, the city and surrounding areas have also been linked with al Qaeda and other extremist groups. The location is strategic since it is close to the border with Afghanistan and restive tribal territories.

Her father David is struggling to make ends meet, while her 14-year-old brother Hunter drives the family crazy with gory pranks. They inherit their deceased mother's Great-Uncle Dragomir's castle in Wolfsberg, Romania after getting a package in the mail. After arriving in Wolfsberg, they meet the strange and steely castle housekeeper, Madame Varcolac. Varcolac discourages David from selling the property, but he ends up going on dates with and falling for the real estate agent Paulina von Eckberg.

Title: The Last Valley Movie plot: \\"The Captain\\" (Michael Caine) leads a band of mercenaries who fight for the highest bidder regardless of religion. His soldiers pillage the countryside, and rape and loot when not fighting. Vogel (Omar Sharif) is a former teacher trying to survive the slaughter of civilians occurring throughout south-central Germany. Vogel runs from the Captain's forces, but eventually stumbles upon an idyllic mountain vale, untouched by war and still living in the age before the war. The Captain and his small band are not far behind. Trapped in the valley, Vogel convinces the Captain to preserve it and the village it shelters for their own benefit, as the outside world faces famine and devastation. \\"Live\\", Vogel tells the Captain, \\"while the army dies.\\" The Captain decides that his men will indeed rest here for the winter. He forces the locals to submit, especially their Headman, Gruber (Nigel Davenport). The local Catholic priest (Per Oscarsson) is livid that the mercenaries include a number of Protestants (and nihilistic atheists for that matter), but there is little he can do to sway the Captain. The mercenaries are of one mind after the Captain kills a dissenting member of his band, and religious and ethnic divisions are set aside. At first, the locals accept their fate. Vogel is appointed judge by Gruber, to settle disputes between villagers and soldiers. As long as food, shelter, and a small number of women are provided, the mercenaries leave the locals alone. Hansen (Michael Gothard) attempts to rape a girl and, exiled from the group, manages to lead a rival mercenary band to the valley, before the winter sets in and closes the valley to all outsiders.

Given the context: What will Casey want to do next?","output":"Based on the context provided, it seems that Casey is beginning to feel overwhelmed and perhaps even irritated by the barrage of questions from Lee. As an individual in this situation, Casey might consider taking several steps to address the issue: 1. Set boundaries: Casey may want to set some boundaries with Lee regarding the number and nature of questions. Communicating openly about the situation, explaining the feeling of annoyance and suggesting only asking questions when necessary might be a good start. This would help create a more comfortable atmosphere and prevent further frustration. 2. Politely redirect the conversation: Another approach Casey might consider is gently steering the conversation in a different direction. By shifting the focus onto a new topic, Casey might be able to reduce the frequency of Lee's questions without causing any conflict. 3. Offer an alternative solution: If Lee's questions are related to a particular problem or subject, Casey could point Lee to some resources or people who are better equipped to answer such questions. This would not only help Lee in finding the information they are seeking, but also alleviate the pressure on Casey. 4. Ask for some space: In order to remain calm and composed, Casey might consider asking for some time alone. By politely requesting some personal space, Casey can regain their composure and gather their thoughts. This is particularly important if the situation between Casey and Lee is escalating. 5. Reflect on the cause of annoyance: Sometimes, the annoyance might be a result of other, unrelated stressors. Casey should take a moment to self-reflect and determine if their reaction to Lee's questions is solely due to the inquiries, or if it stems from something else. If the issue is unrelated to Lee's questions, it is important for Casey to address the underlying cause of their annoyance. 6. Express empathy and understanding: It's possible that Lee may not be aware of Casey's discomfort. Rather than getting angry or annoyed, Casey could try to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. They could consider sharing how they feel with Lee and work together to find a solution that works for both individuals.

We took the wheat out of the cattle feed and substituted rice, as the OPT: [-] wheat was lacking in the proper nutrients. [-] rice was lacking in the proper nutrients.","output":"We took the wheat out of the cattle feed and substituted rice, as the wheat was lacking in the proper nutrients. While both wheat and rice can provide essential energy and nutrients to cattle, it was discovered that wheat, in this particular case, was not supplying the animals with an ideal composition of nutrients to support their overall health, growth, and productivity. Wheat, typically a common ingredient in cattle feed, is a source of protein, carbohydrates, and minerals. However, based on our evaluation of the nutritional content and quality of the wheat being used, we found it to be deficient in some essential elements required for the optimal growth and well-being of the cattle. Some of these missing nutrients include specific amino acids, fiber, and vital minerals. Conversely, we determined that rice, particularly broken rice, would serve as an excellent alternative to wheat in this situation. The digestibility of rice is generally higher than that of wheat, making it a potentially more healthful and effective energy source for the cattle. Moreover, rice has the added advantage of being less susceptible to the development of fungal growth and mycotoxins, which may be harmful to the cattle if consumed in large quantities. In addition to providing cattle with a better-balanced nutrient profile, rice has exhibited other benefits in their diet as well. It has been observed that rice can lead to increased milk production and enhanced overall performance in cattle when compared to other cereal grains. Additionally, the higher starch content in rice results in improved energy utilization and feed conversion efficiency—a critical factor for the sustainability and profitability of the livestock industry. To ensure even greater nutritional value for the cattle, we recommend combining rice with other protein-rich feed ingredients, such as soybean meal, cottonseed meal, or canola meal, and supplementing the diet with essential minerals and vitamins. This comprehensive approach to cattle nutrition will help guarantee healthy growth, robust immune systems, and sustainable productivity for our livestock. By replacing wheat with rice in the cattle feed, we are not only addressing the immediate issue of inadequate nutrient content but also paving the way for a more reliable, efficient, and thriving cattle industry."},{"instruction":"How do I delete an email account from Gmail?

He has a broken leg and is suffering from amnesia. He hallucinates about a woman (Caroline Dhavernas) finding him. He also drives away a cougar after giving two warning shots from a revolver he retrieved inside the car. After a few days of being stuck in that position, he manages to escape the car by prying out the car door with a shifter lever. In the car, he finds bags of money and hears on the car radio about an armed robbery by a man named Raymond Plazzy. Finding a credit card under the passenger seat in the name of Raymond Plazzy, The Man assumes that he is Raymond Plazzy and that he committed the robbery. A man (Adrian Holmes) wearing hunting gear emerges from the woods and starts to loot the wrecked car. The Man tries to get help from the hunter, who just runs away with some of the stolen money. A dog appears, and The Man follows it into the woods. He finds a working cell phone inside a cave, discovering the tragic fate of the hunter who was possibly attacked by the cougar. The Man cannot obtain a signal in the woods. Frequently hallucinating about the woman, he finally shoots her with the revolver after realizing the hallucination led him back to the car. He then decides to get out of the ravine. After crawling for days, he finds a road and a dead body with a driver's license that says Raymond Plazzy. He then pieces together what happened to him: He was running errands with his wife (the Woman) when he witnessed an armed robbery and was taken hostage by Plazzy.

Fans still debate over which of these amazing runs should be crowned the greatest of them all. The second longest touchdown run, the subject of this article, encapsulates the dynamic nature and unpredictability that makes football such a thrilling sport. Step 1: Research the top touchdown runs in football history Before answering the question of how many yards the second longest touchdown run covered, I must first examine the list of top touchdown runs in history. This ensures accuracy and relevance, as records and rankings can change over time. Step 2: Verify the source When dealing with records such as this, it's important to verify the source of information. Official record-keeping institutions like the National Football League (NFL) should be the primary source, as they maintain comprehensive databases of player statistics and game results. Step 3: Identify the second longest touchdown run After researching from verified sources, I found that the second longest touchdown run in history was achieved by Ahman Green in 2003. Green was a running back for the Green Bay Packers, and his phenomenal run occurred during a game against the Denver Broncos. Step 4: Determine the yardage of the second longest touchdown run Now that I have identified the player and the year, I can state that Ahman Green's remarkable run covered a total of 98 yards. This makes it just a few yards short of the longest touchdown run (99 yards), a record shared by multiple players, including Tony Dorsett of the Dallas Cowboys and Derrick Henry of the Tennessee Titans. Conclusion The second longest touchdown run in football history is an inspiring display of athleticism: Ahman Green's 98-yard run for the Green Bay Packers in 2003 remains etched in the memories of football fans everywhere. While it falls just short of the longest touchdown run record, it serves as a reminder that any player can make history when they give their all on the field."},{"instruction":"ABD Türkiye'nin AB üyeliğini güçlü şekilde desteklemektedir.\\" dedi.

The nursery rhyme, which has its origins in England, dates back to the late 18th century but has been sung and recited by children and adults throughout the centuries. The rhyme goes as follows: The Queen of Hearts, She made some tarts, All on a summer's day; The Knave of Hearts, He stole those tarts, And took them clean away. The King of Hearts Called for the tarts, And beat the Knave full sore; The Knave of Hearts Brought back the tarts, And vowed he'd steal no more. The story told in the rhyme portrays the Knave of Hearts as a mischievous character who couldn't resist the temptation to steal the freshly baked tarts on a warm summer day. Upon discovering the theft, the King of Hearts demanded the return of the tarts and punished the Knave for his actions, after which the Knave repents and promises never to steal again. The phrase \\"All on a summer's day\\" indicates that the event took place during the summer season. It is important to note that the actual specific date is not mentioned in the rhyme. However, the idea of making tarts during summertime is typical, as this is the season when fruits used for filling tarts, such as berries and cherries, are in abundance. The nursery rhyme has been reimagined and retold in numerous ways, including in Lewis Carroll's famous novel \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,\\" where the characters of the Queen and King of Hearts, as well as the Knave, play central roles in the story. In conclusion, according to the traditional nursery rhyme, the Knave of Hearts stole the tarts on an unspecified summer day when the Queen of Hearts was baking them. This centuries-old tale, though simple, continues to entertain and delight children and adults alike."},{"instruction":"Siitä lähtien olemme puhuneet Kambod?an kansan vapauden puolesta, sen jälkeenkin, kun vietnamilaiset miehitysjoukot syrjäyttivät punaiset khmeerit, ja silloinkin, kun tilanne näytti toivottomalta taistelussa punaisten khmeerien asettamaa hallintoa vastaan, me jatkoimme kambod?alaisten ihmisoikeuksien tukemista.

This inquiry aims to explore a significant milestone in the sport of golf, as it touches upon the aspects of racial barriers and the advancement of the game in terms of inclusivity and diversity. The Masters Tournament, often simply referred to as the \\"Masters,\\" is one of the four major championships in professional golf. It is an annual tournament held at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, USA. The club, on the other hand, has a history of racial discrimination; African Americans were not allowed to be members until 1990, and it wasn't until 2012 that it had its first female members. Consequently, the inclusion of the first black golfer in the Masters signaled a breakthrough in the historical racial barriers in the sport and the club associated with it. To answer this question, the first black golfer to tee off in the Masters was Lee Elder, an American golfer born in 1934. He made history on April 10, 1975, when he participated in the Masters Tournament as the first African American golfer. Elder's presence in the tournament was a significant step towards greater diversity and inclusiveness within the traditionally white-dominated sport of golf, marking an important moment for civil rights and racial equality in the United States. Throughout his career, Lee Elder became a prominent figure in golf and an inspiration for future generations of African American golfers, including such icons as Tiger Woods. Elder's accomplishments extended beyond the course, as he was dedicated to making golf more accessible to black youths through his philanthropic work and advocacy. The legacy of Lee Elder, therefore, goes beyond the greens and fairways, as it serves as a testament to the importance of equal opportunities and the breaking down of barriers in the world of sports and beyond."},{"instruction":"(Kathimerini, ABHaber, Turkish Daily News - 01/03/06; BM Haber Merkezi, UPI, Kıbrıs Haber Ajansı, Atina Haber Ajansı, Cyprus Mail, AFP - 28/02/06; AP - 27/02/06) Translate this to English?","output":"(English translations for respective news sources) Kathimerini (Greek Daily), ABHaber, Turkish Daily News - 01/03/06; BM News Center, UPI, Cyprus News Agency, Athens News Agency, Cyprus Mail, AFP - 28/02/06; AP - 27/02/06 Step 1: Identify the main information in the text.

Fertilization is the fusion of a male gamete (sperm) and a female gamete (egg) to form a zygote, which eventually develops into a new organism. This process occurs in sexual reproduction, and it results in the mixing of genetic material from both parents, contributing to genetic diversity in the offspring. Here is a brief explanation of the other options provided: - (A) Permineralization: This term refers to the process of fossilization, in which minerals fill the pores and cavities of an organism's remains, leading to the formation of a fossil over time. - (B) Competition: This term generally refers to the interaction between organisms or species, where they compete for limited resources like food, space, or mates. - (C) Movement: This term simply refers to a change in position or motion; it is not specifically related to the fusion of gametes. - (D) Rapid expansion: This term refers to a quick increase in size or volume, but it does not directly relate to the fusion of gametes in a biological context. - (F) Birth: This term refers to the process in which an organism comes into the world as an independent being. Birth occurs after fertilization and embryonic development. - (G) Copulation: This term refers to the act of sexual intercourse, during which sperm is typically transferred from the male to the female. - (H) Ovulation: This term refers to the release of a mature egg (ovum) from a female's ovary, enabling it to be fertilized by a sperm cell.

Step 2: Isolate variable u by adding 43*u to both sides of the equation. -29*u + 43*u = -43*u + 43*u - 154 (-29 + 43) * u = -154 14*u = -154 Step 3: Now, divide both sides by 14 to solve for u.

The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt.

Sometimes shows are limited exclusively to jumpers, sometimes jumper classes are offered in conjunction with other English-style events, and sometimes show jumping is but one division of very large, all-breed competitions that include a very wide variety of disciplines. Jumping classes may be governed by various national horse show sanctioning organizations, such as the United States Equestrian Federation in the USA or the British Showjumping Association in Great Britain.

(A) Jimbo (B) Milo Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"Milo\\" and \\"Jimbo\\". The answer to this question is:","output":"Milo. It is mentioned in the given information that Jimbo and Milo grew up together, and it was always known that Jimbo wasn't as strong as Milo. When it comes to throwing a football, the distance it covers depends on the strength of the person tossing it; a stronger individual would be able to throw the ball farther than someone with lesser strength. In this case, since Milo is known to be stronger than Jimbo, he would have a better capability to utilize his strength to toss the football a greater distance compared to Jimbo. This result can be attributed to the fact that a stronger person would be able to exert a greater force on the ball when tossing it, hence propelling it to cover a longer distance. The importance of strength in tossing a football can be linked to various factors, such as arm strength, grip, power, and proper technique. A stronger individual may have an advantage in all of these aspects. For instance, a stronger arm allows a person to propel the ball with more force, while a powerful grip helps in better control and direction of the throw. Technique also plays a significant role in the distance a football can be thrown. It involves the proper alignment of the body, efficient usage of the arm, and coordinated movements to achieve an optimal throw. While strength is essential, a combination of power and technique is necessary to throw the football a greater distance effectively. In summary, given the information that Milo is stronger than Jimbo, it can be concluded that Milo would be able to toss a football a greater distance compared to Jimbo. This is mainly due to the advantage that a stronger individual has in terms of force exerted, grip power, and potentially better technique, all of which contribute to a superior throwing capacity."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question.

See options at the end The man lost weight after he burned fat and lost some muscle, the Available choices: (A). muscle was heavier.. (B). fat was heavier..","output":"To complete this task, I will analyze both sentences and consider which one makes the most sense given the context. Then, I will choose the most appropriate option as the correct answer. Option A: The man lost weight after he burned fat and lost some muscle, the muscle was heavier. Option B: The man lost weight after he burned fat and lost some muscle, the fat was heavier. Step 1: Evaluate the context The sentence is describing a man who has lost weight after burning fat and losing some muscle. Step 2: Analyze the options Option A suggests that the muscle was heavier, which could imply that the muscle mass lost had more impact on the weight loss than the burned fat. Option B suggests that the fat was heavier, which could imply that burning fat contributed more significantly to the weight loss than losing muscle. Step 3: Consider which option makes the most sense Weight loss commonly occurs when a person burns more calories than they consume. In general, burning fat is the primary goal in weight loss, although losing some muscle mass can unfortunately be a byproduct of certain weight-loss strategies. In most cases, losing fat contributes more to weight loss than losing muscle, because there's usually more fat mass to lose and because losing muscle mass is not typically desirable. Based on the context and analysis, it seems more reasonable to suggest that the fat had a greater impact on the weight loss. So, the most appropriate option to complete the sentence would be: Option B: The man lost weight after he burned fat and lost some muscle, the fat was heavier."},{"instruction":"Question: Austin had Taylor by the short hairs, and Austin had Taylor by the neck, ready to squeeze tighter.

His music is rhythmically complex; harmonically and melodically he employs a system he called modes of limited transposition, which he abstracted from the systems of material generated by his early compositions and improvisations. He wrote music for chamber ensembles and orchestra, vocal music, as well as for solo organ and piano, and also experimented with the use of novel electronic instruments developed in Europe during his lifetime. He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences ranging from Japanese music, the landscape of Bryce Canyon in Utah and the life of St. Francis of Assisi. Messiaen's next work was the large-scale La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur Jesus-Christ. The composition occupied him from 1965 to 1969 and the musicians employed include a 100-voice ten-part choir, seven solo instruments and large orchestra. Its fourteen movements are a meditation on the story of Christ's Transfiguration. Shortly after its completion, Messiaen received a commission from Alice Tully for a work to celebrate the U.S. bicentennial. He arranged a visit to the US in spring 1972, and was inspired by Bryce Canyon in Utah, where he observed the canyon's distinctive colours and birdsong. The twelve-movement orchestral piece Des canyons aux etoiles... was the result, first performed in 1974 in New York. In 1971, he was asked to compose a piece for the Paris Opera. While reluctant to undertake such a major project, he was persuaded in 1975 to accept the commission and began work on his Saint-Francois d'Assise. The composition was intensive (he also wrote his own libretto) and occupied him from 1975 to 1979; the orchestration was carried out from 1979 until 1983. Messiaen preferred to describe the final work as a \\"spectacle\\" rather than an opera. It was first performed in 1983. Some commentators at the time thought that the opera would be his valediction (at times Messiaen himself believed so), but he continued to compose. In 1984 he published a major collection of organ pieces, Livre du Saint Sacrement; other works include birdsong pieces for solo piano, and works for piano with orchestra. In the summer of 1978, Messiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire. He was promoted to the highest rank of the Legion d'honneur, the Grand-Croix, in 1987. An operation prevented his participation in the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1978, but in 1988 tributes for Messiaen's 80th included a complete performance in London's Royal Festival Hall of St. Francois, which the composer attended, and Erato's publication of a seventeen-CD collection of Messiaen's music including a disc of the composer in conversation with Claude Samuel. Although in considerable pain near the end of his life (requiring repeated surgery on his back) he was able to fulfil a commission from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, Eclairs sur l'au-dela..., which was premiered six months after his death. He died in Paris on April 27, 1992. On going through his papers, Loriod discovered that, in the last months of his life, he had been composing a concerto for four musicians he felt particularly grateful to, namely herself, the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, the oboist Heinz Holliger and the flautist Catherine Cantin (hence the title Concert a quatre). Four of the five intended movements were substantially complete; Yvonne Loriod undertook the orchestration of the second half of the first movement and of the whole of the fourth with advice from George Benjamin. It was premiered by the dedicatees in September 1994.

After much thought,I came up with a brilliant plan.I worked out a way for Rich to meet my mother and win her over.In fact,I arranged it so my mother would want to cook a meal especially for him. Rich was not only not Chinese and he was a few years younger than I was.And unfortunately,he looked much younger with his curly red hair,smooth pale skin,and the splash of orange freckles across his nose.He was a bit on the short side,compactly built.In his dark business suits,he looked nice but easily forgettable,which was why I didn't notice him the first year we worked together at the firm.But my mother noticed everything. \\"So what do you think of Rich?\\"I finally asked,holding my breath. She tossed the eggplant in the hot oil,angry hissing sound.\\"So many spots on his face,\\"she said. \\"They are freckles.Freckles are good luck.\\"I said a bit too heatedly in trying to raise my voice above the noise of the kitchen. \\"Oh?\\"She said innocently. \\"Yes,the more spots the better.\\" She considered this a moment and then smiled and spoke in Chinese:\\"When you were young,you got the chicken pox.So many spots,you had to stay home for ten days.So lucky,you thought.\\" I couldn't save Rich in the kitchen.And I couldn't save him later at the dinner table. When I offered Rich a fork,he insisted on using the slippery ivory chopsticks.Halfway between his plate and his open mouth,a large chunk of redcooked eggplant fell on his brand new white shirt. And then he helped himself to big portions of the shrimp and snow peas,not realizing he should have taken only a polite spoonful. He declined the new greens,the tender and expensive leaves of bean plants.He thought he was being polite by refusing seconds,when he should have followed my father's example,who made a big show of taking small portions of seconds,thirds and even fourths,always saying he couldn't resist another bite and then groaning he was so full he thought he would burst. But the worst was when Rich criticized my mother's cooking and he didn't even know what he had done.As is the Chinese cook's custom,my mother always made modest remarks about her own cooking.That night she chose to direct it toward her famous steamed pork and preserved vegetable dish,which she always served with special pride. \\"Ai!This dish not salty enough,no flavor,\\"she complained,after tasting a small bite. This was our family's cue to eat more and proclaim it the best she had ever made.But before we could do so,Rich said,\\"You know,all it needs is a little soy sauce.\\"And he proceeded to pour a riverful of the salty black stuff on the china plate,right before my mother's horrified eyes. And even though I was hoping throughout the dinner that my mother would somehow see Rich's kindness,his sense of humor and boyish charm.I knew he had failed miserably in her eyes. Rich obviously had a different opinion on how the evening had gone.When we got home,I was still shuddering, _ remembering how Rich had firmly shaken both my parents'hands with that same easy familiarity he used with nervous new clients.\\"Linda,Tim,\\"he said,\\"we'll see you again.\\"My parents'names are Lindo and Tin Jong,and nobody except a few older family friends ever calls them by their first names. \\"What did she say when you told her?\\"I knew he was referring to our getting married. \\"I never had a chance,\\"I said,which was true.How could I have told my mother I was getting married,when at every possible moment we were alone,she seemed to remark on how pale and ill he looked.

OPTIONS: (i) Add a minced jalapeno to the dish (ii) Add a minced bell pepper to the dish","output":"To accomplish the goal of making a dish spicier, there are a variety of methods that one can employ. In this case, I will provide a detailed analysis of the two given options: adding a minced jalapeno or a minced bell pepper to the dish. Option (i): Add a minced jalapeno to the dish Jalapenos are chili peppers that belong to the Capsicum annuum species, and they are well-known for their heat and spiciness due to the presence of capsaicin. Capsaicin is the compound responsible for giving chili peppers their heat, and the spiciness of a pepper is measured in Scoville Heat Units (SHUs). Jalapenos typically have a heat level ranging from 2,500 to 8,000 SHUs, which makes them moderately spicy in comparison to other chili peppers. To add a minced jalapeno to your dish, follow these steps: 1. Choose a fresh, firm jalapeno. Ensure it has a smooth and unblemished surface. The spiciness of the jalapeno can be determined by the presence of white lines or stretch marks on its surface – the more lines, the spicier the pepper. 2. Wash the jalapeno under cold running water. 3. Cut off the stem, and slice the jalapeno in half lengthwise. 4. Use a spoon or a knife to remove the seeds and the white membrane (inner ribs) from the jalapeno. The seeds and the membrane contain a high concentration of capsaicin, so removing them can help to control the heat level of your dish. 5. Mince the jalapeno as finely as possible, then add it to your dish. It is essential to start with a small amount and taste as you go, as different jalapenos can have varying heat levels, and you don't want to accidentally overpower the flavors of your dish with too much spiciness. Option (ii): Add a minced bell pepper to the dish Bell peppers, also from the Capsicum annuum species, are not known for their spiciness and generally have a heat level of 0 SHUs. While they do belong to the same family as jalapenos and other chili peppers, bell peppers have a genetic mutation that prevents them from producing capsaicin. As such, they won't provide the desired spiciness and heat to your dish but can add flavor, color, and texture. If you choose to go with this option, follow these steps: 1. Choose a fresh, firm bell pepper, ensuring it has a smooth and unblemished surface. 2. Wash the bell pepper under cold running water. 3. Cut off the stem, and slice the bell pepper in half lengthwise. 4. Remove the seeds and the white membrane (inner ribs) from the bell pepper. 5. Mince the bell pepper as finely as possible, then add it to your dish. In conclusion, if your primary goal is to make a dish spicier, Option (i) – adding a minced jalapeno to the dish – would be the more appropriate choice, as jalapenos have the necessary heat and spiciness due to their capsaicin content. Option (ii) – adding a minced bell pepper to the dish – is not the ideal choice for adding spiciness, but it can still contribute flavor, color, and texture."},{"instruction":"Given the question: \\"Nieuwe Kerk (Delft)\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

The movie is set in 1985, in the fictional town of Quatssack, New Hampshire. Quatssack seems like a nice, ordinary town, but it harbors a dark and deadly secret: it is the home of the Children of the Yeti, an evil cult that worships a yeti that lives in the woods. The yeti was captured in the Himalayas and brought to the town as an old man′s sideshow, but had escaped, and is reportedly the last of its kind. Each night, Debra, one of its members, lures young men to the cult with the intention of offering it up to the yeti as a means of keeping it sexually sated. The movie opens up with such an example, with Debra and Raymond, the cult′s leader, looking on while laughing sadistically. Five college students—fraternity brothers Adam and Dick, their girlfriends Sally and Emily, and a fifth member named Joe—are coming to Quatssack on a camping trip, unaware of the town′s secrets. On their first night, Joe is killed while going to the bathroom in the woods, and since he was the one who had the car keys, the remaining four cannot leave town. The old man, who now owns a hideous-looking creature called \\"Tentacle Boy\\" and displays it as a sideshow, informs them of the yeti that he used to own now living somewhere in the woods. Emily goes into a nearby church to pray for Joe′s safety, and while she is in there, she is discovered by a priest as a \\"Chosen One\\" that was prophesied to take down the Children of the Yeti. She accepts her destiny, and the priest gives her supplies for her mission. Meanwhile, Adam, Dick, and Sally, who are waiting for Emily outside, are ambushed by a redneck demanding the whereabouts of the Chosen One. Emily emerges from the church and shoots the redneck with a crossbow, and despite his seemingly near-fatal wound, demands that the redneck take them to the cult′s location. Only Adam and Emily follow the redneck; Sally is sent back to their campsite, while Dick had left earlier, having met Debra.

All of this is really allowing Africa to play a major part in global scientific collaborations. Holding development back, higher education remains poor. Many non-governmental organisations (NGOs), churches and development agencies push basic literacy - it is a huge international industry. But there is nothing at the higher end, very little money for tertiary education. It is quite hard to study in Africa, and encouraging talented students to leave is an industry in itself, with a large variety of academic bursaries available for study in the US and Europe. If the limited available statistics are to be believed, there are perhaps fewer than five million students in higher education in the whole of sub-Saharan Africa - and most of those, perhaps two-thirds, are in South Africa, the wealthiest country. It is a low base to start from, but the tide is turning. Real, serious scientific work is taking place now in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in maths, physics and astronomy. Prof Justin Jonas, from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), a collaborative international radio telescope project involving eight sub-Saharan African nations, as well as countries worldwide, says: \\"Africa has reached a stage of development where it has become a destination for doing world-class science - a place that has individuals, facilities and institutions that attract scientists from around the world to work on the continent. What if we could stay young forever? What if everyone had a car? What If? is a season across BBC News looking at visions of the future. What If (special report) \\"It has also become an attractive proposition for Africans to remain on home soil, rather than seek research opportunities abroad. \\"As an example, the SKA project has resulted in a net brain gain to the region, with leading astronomers, ranging from post-doc[toral]s to research professors, choosing to work in Africa.\\" Similar sentiments are expressed by Prof Tejinder Virdee, a former director of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, which has been at the forefront of the search for the Higgs boson at Europe's premier particle physics lab, Cern. Prof Virdee sees huge potential in sub-Saharan Africa for developing institutions to join in with global collaborative projects such as those pursued at Cern. He says the search for the Higgs particle involved number-crunching on a grand scale, and that the data could have been processed anywhere with the right tools - so why not in Africa? And from the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), itself an institute with strong links to the global physics community, there is the Next Einstein Initiative. This is currently setting up centres of excellence in Africa for the mathematical sciences, and is connected to some of the most forward-thinking academics in the fields of maths and physics across the continent, as well as in Canada, the UK and the US. Next Einstein Initiative executive director Thierry Zomahoun says: \\"So far, we have set up institutes in Senegal and Ghana, with more planned in Cameroon, Tanzania and Benin.. \\"And the idea is literally to create an environment in which an African Einstein could develop.\\" Perhaps the areas where Africa's scientific contributions are most striking is in our understanding of Malaria and HIV. Tune in to the BBC World Service at 1900 GMT on Friday 29 March to listen to the BBC Africa Debate - Should Africa take control of its science? - broadcast from Kampala. Or take part in Twitter - using #bbcafricadebate - Facebook or Google+ Africa Debate The Aids epidemic has ravaged major parts of the continent, but it was research led from Africa that made the connection in the 1980s between Aids, then prevalent among homosexual men in the US, and \\"slim disease\\" in Africa. HIV was the cause of both. Since then, Africa has seen some of the most important work in combating HIV - from demonstrating and tackling mother-to-child transmission, to research among people who appear to have immunity to the disease. \\"Africa-based research has clearly contributed to the fact that in many countries there are now fewer deaths from Aids and fewer new HIV infections,\\" said Peter Piot, the former director of UNAids. The potential for Africa to play a big role in global science is there, but questions remain over research funding and the appropriateness of research led by foreign donors. African solutions Last year, the African Union set up a science and technology advisory panel to develop a more Africa-centred research and development environment. Its co-chair, Harvard's professor of the Practice of International Development Calestous Juma, says: \\"As a latecomer, Africa is entering the field of global science facing major challenges but also opportunities. \\"It can build on the vast quantities of scientific and technical knowledge available worldwide to solve local problems in fields such as agriculture, water, health, education and environment. \\"The strategic focus for Africa should therefore be on generating research that has immediate local use. It is through such strategies that Africa will be able to make its own unique contributions to the global scientific enterprise. \\"Achieving this goal will require a focus on building a new generation of research universities that are focused on problem-solving and have direct links with enterprises and local communities. \\"While the focus in industrialised countries is 'science and technology', Africa's challenges call for 'technology and science'.\\" Certainly, the will is there. The key issue is how significant a part ideas from Africa will play within the future of global scientific research. On this, Justin Jonas is optimistic. \\"The MeerKAT radio telescope, designed and being built by South Africa as an SKA precursor, will be the most powerful instrument in its class until the construction of the SKA,\\" he says. \\"Initiatives such as the SKA and MeerKAT change the image that the world has of Africa, and perhaps more importantly, the image Africans have of their own continent.\\" Science Africa, a BBC science festival from Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, runs from 24 March to 29 March. Much of the content will be broadcast on the BBC World Service. All the scientists featured in this article will be speaking at the festival. Your comments Africa is an exporter of talent. Every year thousands of the best and brightest students leave to study at universities in Europe and America. Every intelligent young African dreams of getting a scholarship to study abroad. The focus of governments and NGOs is very much on basic education yet if more research was done in Africa everyone would benefit. Research attracts talent and money and inspires students at all levels. Africa shouldn't just focus on local problems but needs to aspire to be at the core of global science to stop the brain drain and make the best of its talent. Projects like the square kilometre array discussed in this BBC news item are just a start. Dave Kidd, Woldia, Ethiopia Africa has been the birthplace of many in the science field including many doctors who are treating patients in the west. If all these talented people could be encouraged to stay home and the African governments equipped them to practice and complete their research from Africa, then we could take control of our own science. In the end progress hinges on government policy that encourages scientific innovation and research. Ambrose Kibuuka, Entebbe, Uganda Yes, Africa should take control of its science. We have spent most of our time waiting and depending on the west to help develop Africa. This is demoralizing and has really gotten us nowhere. Why can't we as Africans accomplish this with our own volition? Leaders all over Africa need to rebuild our African pride and the faith of young Africans in their leaders, this is one way I think they could achieve this and gain a respectable place in the world as peers. KB, Milwaukee, USA Julian Siddle deserves much credit for writing this article. It articulates a vision that will appeal to the competence and ingenuity of many Africans. The priority to find \\"African solutions\\" would bolster and diversify national economies currently too dependent on low-wages and unhealthy jobs in mining and oil industries designed primarily to benefit foreign investors. Jens A. Jorgensen, Brabant Wallon, Belgium I completely agree with the idea that Africa will, in the not too distant future be a hub for science development but also in other fields. We have tried here in Kampala to develop a new approach to higher education by giving professionals an opportunity to develop their skills and knowledge by studying at home or in the office. The Virtual University of Uganda, a project we started in 2011, has proved, after one year of operation, to be hugely successful. Being the first fully online institution of higher learning in sub-Saharan Africa, it has given us an opportunity to develop new methods of learning and teaching. Well done BBC for this inspiring piece and I am sure that the BBC science festival from Makerere University will be a success! Professor Michel Lejeune, Kampala, Uganda The science discussion is long overdue. Every culture can impact on science and technology, it is up to each community to take control of their destiny. We Africans have to take a second look at education. We must develop a culture that makes things, it is from there that we'll develop technical skills that will employ the population and power the economies. Joe Agu, Santa Clara, California, USA There are two ways for Africa to develop its scientific potential. First, by exploiting the advantages offered by innovation. Here because of escalating research and development costs as well as shrinking budgets there is a need for solutions and products that are simple, less costly for everyday use. Secondly, we can target \\"knowledge outsourcing\\" and build a niche in that area, by undertaking to put our knowledge in solving costly processes for which knowledge costs in western economies are simply too much to sustain. Allan Okoth, Nairobi, Kenya","output":"The article talks about how Africa is making progress in the area of science and technology, but there is still a long way to go. African scientists are participating in many important research projects, but higher education in Africa is still not very good. Also, many smart African students go to other countries to study and work. To improve this, Africa needs to invest more money in education and research, and find solutions for their own problems. That way, they can use science to make life better for everyone in Africa."},{"instruction":"Posted in Wedding Advice, Wedding News & Events, Wedding Web-Sites.

Answer: According to the First Epistle to the Corinthians (1 Cor. 15:4), Jesus was raised from the dead (\\"on the third day\\" counting the day of crucifixion as the first) and according to the canonical Gospels, appeared to his disciples on different occasions before ascending to heaven. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Choices: A). yes B). no","output":"A). Yes The question asks about the writing that detailed Jesus' appearance before ascension. The answer provided refers to various texts in the New Testament that describe Jesus' appearances to his disciples and his eventual ascension to heaven. Among these texts are the First Epistle to the Corinthians (1 Cor. 15:4) and the canonical Gospels. It is important to note that each Gospel provides slightly different accounts of Jesus' appearances and ascension. Here is a brief overview of the key elements in each Gospel: 1. Matthew (Matthew 28) In Matthew's Gospel, the first appearance of Jesus after his resurrection occurs when Mary Magdalene and the other Mary go to the tomb. Jesus meets them and instructs them to tell the disciples that he will meet them in Galilee. Later, Jesus appears to the eleven disciples on a mountain in Galilee and gives them the Great Commission (Matt. 28:16-20). 2. Mark (Mark 16) Mark's Gospel is unique in that the original ending (Mark 16:1-8) does not contain any appearances of Jesus after his resurrection. However, in the longer ending (Mark 16:9-20), Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene, to two disciples on the road, and finally to the eleven disciples during a meal. Jesus then ascends into heaven after giving the disciples their mission (Mark 16:19-20). 3. Luke (Luke 24) Luke's Gospel provides a more detailed account of Jesus' appearances. Jesus first appears to two disciples on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:13-32). Then he appears to the eleven and other disciples in the upper room in Jerusalem (Luke 24:36-49). After giving them instructions, Jesus leads them to the vicinity of Bethany and then ascends to heaven (Luke 24:50-53). 4. John (John 20-21) In John's Gospel, Mary Magdalene encounters Jesus outside the tomb (John 20:11-18). Then Jesus appears to the disciples (minus Thomas) in a locked room (John 20:19-23). A week later, Jesus appears again to the disciples, this time with Thomas present (John 20:24-29). In the final chapter, Jesus appears to a group of disciples by the Sea of Galilee and has a specific conversation with Peter (John 21:1-23). Furthermore, the account of Jesus' ascension is detailed explicitly in the book of Acts (Acts 1:3-11), which was also written by Luke. In conclusion, the elements of Jesus' appearances before his ascension come from various sources in the New Testament, including the First Epistle to the Corinthians and the canonical Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John). Each Gospel provides a unique and sometimes overlapping account of these events."},{"instruction":"Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How do I connect a monitor to my computer tower?

Sentence 2: I'd like to find out the truth, but can't say how I'd do it. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Understanding the meaning and intention behind each sentence is crucial in determining whether the two sentences are true or not, or if they are compatible. Let's analyze Sentence 1 first: \\"Can't say as how I'd like to find out the truth.\\" In this sentence, the speaker is expressing uncertainty about wanting to discover the truth. They may have doubts, fears, or concerns about what would happen if they were to learn the truth. As a result, they are unable to commit to the idea of seeking out the truth. Now, let's analyze Sentence 2: \\"I'd like to find out the truth, but can't say how I'd do it.\\" In this sentence, the speaker is expressing a desire to find out the truth but is unsure about the process or method they should use to do so. The focus here is not on whether they want to learn the truth but rather on how to go about it. Essentially, the speaker has a goal in mind but is uncertain about the steps to achieve it. Now, let's examine the compatibility and truthfulness of these two sentences. In Sentence 1, the speaker is expressing hesitation about wanting to find out the truth. In Sentence 2, the speaker expresses a desire to learn the truth but is unsure about the method. The two sentences seem to be addressing different aspects of the general idea of discovering the truth. While Sentence 1 is concerned about the uncertainty of seeking the truth itself, Sentence 2 is focused on the uncertainty of the means to accomplish this goal. If Sentence 1 is considered to be true, i.e., the speaker is genuinely uncertain about wanting to find the truth, then it becomes difficult to determine the truthfulness of Sentence 2. Since the speaker of Sentence 1 is unsure about even wanting the truth, the desire expressed in Sentence 2 appears to conflict with this uncertainty. However, one could argue that these two sentences reflect different moments in the thought process of the speaker. For instance, suppose the speaker initially displays their uncertainty about seeking the truth in Sentence 1. In that case, they might have further developed their thoughts and realized that, while they might want to learn the truth, they are uncertain about the method or process to accomplish it, which is captured in Sentence 2. In this light, both sentences can be seen as context-dependent expressions of the speaker's thoughts and feelings. While it might be challenging to say that both sentences are true simultaneously, given their apparent contradictions, it is possible that each sentence could be true at different points in the speaker's thought process. So, without a clearer indication of the context or chronology of the sentences, it is not possible to definitively determine if Sentence 2 is true if Sentence 1 is true."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Question 2: What factors influence how a person might react it could be the way a person treat you? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: What is the best way to react to someone who you think is not treating you as a person? The best way to react to someone who is not treating you like a person is to employ a combination of assertiveness, empathy, and conflict resolution strategies. Here is a detailed approach: 1. Evaluate the situation: Before reacting, take a step back and evaluate whether the person's behavior is intentionally hurtful or simply a result of miscommunication or insensitivity. Carefully assess the context and the individual's relationship to you. 2. Communicate assertively: If you believe that the person is genuinely not treating you respectfully, communicate with them assertively. Use \\"I\\" statements to express your feelings and concerns without attacking or accusing the other person. Be specific about the behavior that made you feel disrespected and how it affected you. For example, you might say, \\"I felt hurt when you interrupted me during the meeting, as it made me feel like my opinions were not valued.\\" 3. Be empathetic: Remember that everyone has their own background, experiences, and potential issues that could affect how they treat others. Empathize with the person and try to understand what may be causing their behavior. This could help you communicate more effectively and promote a deeper understanding between you and the other person. 4. Set boundaries: Establish personal boundaries that delineate how you expect to be treated by others. Make it clear that you will not tolerate disrespectful behavior, and if violations continue, reconsider your association with the individual. 5. Seek support: If the situation continues, reach out to trusted friends, family members, or colleagues for advice and support. In cases involving professional relationships, such as workplace scenarios, discuss the issue with a manager or human resources representative. 6. Practice self-care: Remember to take care of yourself and nurture your own self-esteem and well-being. Engage in healthy behaviors, focus on your strengths, and surround yourself with positive influences. Question 2: What factors influence how a person might react? It could be the way a person treats you. Several factors can influence how an individual reacts to the way they are treated. Some of these factors include: 1. Personality: A person's temperament and nature play a significant role in how they respond to different situations. Some people are more assertive, while others may be more sensitive and easily upset. 2. Emotional state: A person's emotional state at the time of an interaction can heavily impact their reaction. Emotions such as stress, anger, or sadness may lead to more intense or uncontrolled responses. 3. Past experiences: A person's past experiences, including previous relationships and life events, can impact their reactions. If an individual has experienced negative treatment in the past, they may be more likely to react strongly to similar situations in the present. 4. Cultural background: Cultural norms and values can affect how people perceive and react to different situations. What may be considered offensive in one culture may be completely acceptable in another. 5. Nature of the relationship: The type of relationship between the individuals also plays a crucial factor in reactions. For example, the expectations and acceptable behaviors in a friendship differ from a professional relationship. 6. Communication skills: A person's communication abilities can heavily influence their reactions in interpersonal situations. A lack of communication skills can lead to misunderstandings and conflict escalation. To address the final question, \\"Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?\\": No, they are not asking the same thing. The first question focuses on the best way to react to someone who is not treating you as a person, while the second question explores the factors that can influence how a person may react in various situations. They are related, but they address two different concepts."},{"instruction":"Is the following statement true? \\"The earliest automotive Headlamp used oil as the most common type of fuel.\\" Your chain-of-thought:","output":"1.

It is an essential component in various scientific and technical applications like physics laboratories, electronics, telecommunication, and engineering. Sensitivity is a crucial characteristic of a galvanometer that determines its ability to measure small currents accurately. A galvanometer is said to be sensitive when it can detect and respond to very small changes in the electric current. The sensitivity of a galvanometer depends on several factors, and improving these factors increases the sensitivity of the instrument. Here are some of the main factors that contribute to the sensitivity of a galvanometer: 1. Coil Area: The coil area is an essential factor in determining the sensitivity of a galvanometer. A larger coil area increases the magnetic torque acting on the coil, which in turn enhances the instrument's sensitivity. Therefore, sensitive galvanometers typically have larger coil areas to allow for more accurate detection and measurement of small currents. 2. Number of Turns: Increasing the number of turns in the coil results in a more significant magnetic torque, improving the sensitivity of the galvanometer. A highly sensitive galvanometer will have a higher number of turns in its coil to produce a larger response for the same amount of current as compared to a less sensitive one. 3. Strength of the Magnetic Field: The sensitivity of a galvanometer is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength in its core. Stronger magnetic fields generate larger magnetic torque on the coil and result in a more sensitive response. Therefore, a sensitive galvanometer will often have stronger magnetic fields to enhance its sensitivity. 4. Suspension System: The suspension system plays a crucial role in the sensitivity of a galvanometer. A good suspension system reduces friction and other external interferences, allowing the galvanometer to respond to smaller changes in current. Sensitive galvanometers often have low-resistance suspension systems, such as torsion wires or fiber suspensions, to ensure maximum sensitivity. 5. Damping System: The damping system is responsible for handling oscillations and vibrations that may interfere with galvanometer sensitivity. A highly sensitive galvanometer will have an efficient damping system, such as air or eddy current damping systems, to minimize any external disturbances and stabilize the reading quickly. 6. Scale and Pointer: The scale and pointer of a galvanometer should be able to accurately represent small changes in the measured current. Sensitive galvanometers generally have finely-divided scales and lightweight pointers to enable precise readings with minimal errors. 7. Quality of Materials: The materials used in constructing a galvanometer, such as the coil wire, magnetic core, suspension, and damping system, directly impact its sensitivity. High-quality materials result in better performance and higher sensitivity. In summary, a galvanometer is said to be sensitive when it can accurately detect and measure small electric currents. This sensitivity is influenced by many factors, such as the coil area, number of turns, strength of the magnetic field, suspension system, damping system, scale, pointer, and quality of materials. A highly sensitive galvanometer will have a combination of these favorable factors to ensure precise and accurate measurements, making it ideal for use in various scientific and technical applications."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},z=["disabled"],j={key:0},N={key:1};function R(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
