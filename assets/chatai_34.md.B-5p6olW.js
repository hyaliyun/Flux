Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who said Beat It was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece? is inside the article: Jackson explored genres including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\".With Off the Wall, Jackson's \\"vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides\\" vividly showed the singer's maturation into an adult, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem \\"We Are the World\\"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona., can you guess it ? The answer is:","output":"Steve Huey. In the given text, it is mentioned that \\"Beat It\\" was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey.

Article: A woman was walking her dog along a beach in New Zealand in late June when she saw something that looked like a white ball in the sand. It turned out to be a young Emperor penguin that was lost. At his age, he should have been close to Antarctic, swimming for fish and playing on the ice floes . But this penguin started swimming north and just kept going. The penguin attracted a lot of attention in New Zealand. It has been 40 years since an Emperor penguin was last seen there. Researchers at the Department of Conservation were called in. They decided to watch the penguin closely, but not to disturb it in any way. Many New Zealanders came to Peka Peka Beach to look at the elegant penguin. They were careful to keep their dogs away from it so it wouldn't be frightened. The public nicknamed the animal Happy Feet. Researchers started to notice that Happy Feet didn't seem well. It turns out that he had been eating the sand from the beach, likely thinking it was snow. The public raised more than 11,000 pounds for an operation to get the sand out of his stomach. The operation was a success, and Happy Feet was taken to a zoo in Wellington, NZ. A group of experts met to decide how to help Happy Feet return to the wild. Last Sunday, they put him on a boat called the Tangaroa, in a specially built ice-filled box and took him out into the Southern Ocean, southeast of New Zealand. There, they released him into the ocean, which is his natural habitat. He took one last look at his human helpers and then dived into the ocean. \\"Emperor penguins spend their first five years at sea,\\" said Peter Simpson of New Zealand's Department of Conservation. \\" What happens now is up to the penguin.\\" Happy Feet was fitted with a satellite transmitter so they can monitor his progress using the Internet. So far, the trackers shows that he swam northeast for a little while before getting his bearings and heading south. Question: The public collected some money to  _  .

Answer: An invoice or bill is a commercial document issued by a seller to a buyer , indicating the products , quantities, and agreed prices for products or services the seller has provided the buyer. Question: what is the use of a sales invoice? Answer:","output":"Yes, your answer is correct. An invoice or sales invoice serves this precise goal.  To offer a more exhaustive definition, an invoice, also known as a sales invoice, is a commercial document issued by the seller to the buyer. It records the transaction between the seller and the buyer and provides a detailed list of the goods or services that the buyer has purchased from the seller.  One of the critical elements of an invoice includes the products bought by the buyer with their quantities. By enumerating the quantities of the purchased items, the invoice aims to avoid any potential ambiguities and discrepancies between the seller and the buyer. The quantities enable the buyer to keep track of what they have ordered and to confirm whether they have received the correct amount of products from the seller. Aside from the products and quantities, an invoice also specifies the agreed prices for the goods or services. This important aspect provides transparency in terms of how much the buyer is expected to pay for each item. It allows the buyer to understand the total cost of all the goods or services purchased, with a breakdown of the price for each item. The agreed prices also enable the seller to ensure they receive the correct payment for the products or services they have provided. Involving more than recording the products, quantities, and agreed prices, an invoice serves several other crucial purposes. It acts as a legal proof of the transaction between the seller and the buyer, and can be used for audit and tax purposes. It can help both parties keep track of their inventory and financial records. It also helps the seller in managing their accounts receivable, i.e., the money that the buyer owes the seller for the products or services provided. In summary, the main use of a sales invoice is to document the details of the sale, such as the products, quantities, and agreed prices. It comes into play in various processes such as managing inventory, tracking financial transactions, and ensuring compliance with tax and auditing regulations. The invoice is thus an essential tool in business, ensuring both the seller and buyer understand exactly what products or services have been exchanged and the amount due."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There are some easy tips that can help us take care of our skin. Let's learn how to do it. 1. Wash your nose and face daily Our face and nose can get dirty throughout the day. When we play outside or touch things, germs and dirt can get on our skin. To keep it clean, we should wash our face every day with water and gentle soap. This helps remove any dirt or germs that might be on our skin. 2. Don't sleep with makeup on (for those who wear it) Sometimes, people like to wear makeup to look pretty or fancy. However, when it's bedtime, it's important to remove the makeup from our face. This is because makeup can clog our pores (tiny holes in our skin) and make it hard for our skin to breathe. When our pores get blocked, it can cause pimples and unhealthy skin. 3. Wear sunscreen Sunscreen helps protect our skin from the sun when we're playing outside. The sun can be fun, but it can also harm our skin if we're not careful. By wearing sunscreen, we can keep our skin safe from the sun's harmful rays and avoid sunburns. 4. Visit a dermatologist if needed Sometimes, we might have problems with the skin on our face, like big pores or pimples that just won't go away. A dermatologist is a special doctor who knows everything about skin. If we have a problem with our skin, it's important to tell our parents so that they can take us to see a dermatologist. The doctor can help us understand what's happening with our skin and give us advice on how to keep it healthy.

Disposer de la capacité de recueillir les informations nécessaires pour la protection des civils, alliée à la collecte d'informations sur les incidents en matière de protection dans les pays qui suscitent la préoccupation du Conseil, sera essentiel pour bien cibler la protection et lui faire place dans les délibérations et les activités du Conseil. Translate to English","output":"Having the capacity to gather the necessary information for the protection of civilians, coupled with the collection of information on protection-related incidents in countries of concern to the Council, will be essential for accurately targeting protection and ensuring its place in the Council's deliberations and activities. In order to effectively provide protection to civilians in conflict-affected countries, it is crucial for organizations and authorities involved in safeguarding their safety and well-being to have access to accurate and up-to-date information. This includes understanding the specific threats and risks that civilians face and being able to identify potential areas of concern. By gathering relevant information on incidents affecting the protection of civilians, the Council and other stakeholders can make informed decisions about where to focus their efforts and allocate resources. One of the key components of this information-gathering process involves monitoring developments in countries that are of particular concern to the Council due to ongoing conflicts, human rights abuses, or other factors that may put civilians in danger. This enables the Council to assess the effectiveness of current protection measures and adapt its approach as necessary to better address emerging threats and challenges. In addition to collecting information on specific incidents, it is also important to track broader trends and patterns in the protection of civilians in order to identify any potential issues that may need further attention from the Council. This can include examining the root causes of conflicts, the underlying factors that contribute to the vulnerability of civilians, and the barriers that may hinder the implementation of effective protection strategies. By taking a comprehensive approach to the gathering and analysis of information, the Council can better understand the complex dynamics at play in conflict-affected countries and develop more targeted and effective responses to protect civilians at risk. In summary, having the capacity to gather the necessary information for the protection of civilians, as well as monitoring protection-related incidents in countries of concern to the Council, allows for a more informed decision-making process and enables the development of targeted and effective protection strategies. By incorporating this information into their deliberations and activities, the Council can enhance its ability to safeguard civilians in conflict-affected countries and contribute to the overall goal of promoting peace, security, and human rights."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: how a silencer works Suggestion: Several firearms with detachable suppressors, from top to bottom: An Uzi , An AR-15 , A Heckler & Koch USP Tactical, A Beretta 92FS , and a SIG Mosquito . The answer is:","output":"False. The proposed suggestion does not provide a correct answer to the given question. The question \\"how a silencer works\\" requires an explanation of the mechanism or process by which a silencer, also known as a suppressor, reduces the noise produced by a firearm. The proposal, however, only provides examples of firearms that can have detachable suppressors attached to them. This is a simple description of firearms, rather than an explanation of how the silencer on such a firearm works. For completeness, here is a brief explanation of how a silencer works: A silencer or a suppressor is attached to the barrel of a firearm to suppress the amount of noise and visible muzzle flash produced upon shooting. When a gun is fired, it releases hot, high-pressure gases from the barrel, which is the cause of the loud gunshot noise. The main role of a silencer is to provide a larger space for these gases to expand and cool before they are released into the air, thereby reducing the noise level. It achieves this through a series of compartments or baffles that divert the gases and slow their release. The suppressor also helps to conceal the muzzle flash since it traps the gases that would ordinarily get lit by the spark of the firing mechanism and become visible. To be effective, the suppressor must be designed to withstand the pressure and heat from the gas, and to let the bullet travel through it, unimpeded, on its way to the target. The list of firearms given as a suggestion - An Uzi , An AR-15 , A Heckler & Koch USP Tactical, A Beretta 92FS , and a SIG Mosquito - can indeed be fitted with silencers, but without an explanation of how these silencers work, the suggestion does not answer the question correctly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who did Athos think was dead? Movie title: The Three Musketeers Movie plot: D'Artagnan (Michael York) and his father (Joss Ackland) engage in an exhausting sparring duel. The father shows his son a signature move, which ends with the point of the sword at his son's chest, and advises to use it in a fight only as a last resort. He gives the boy 15 crowns and a letter to the commander of the King's musketeers, then presents him a sword he and his own father used in the King's service. The young Gascon leaves home on a huge yellow workhorse with his few belongings and a salve his mother advises him to rub into any wounds, and he strikes out for Paris to take his place as a musketeer.As D'Artagnan arrives in Paris he comes upon Rochefort (Christopher Lee), a tall man with a patch over one eye, who makes an offhanded remark to some companions about the newcomer's horse. Anxious to fight at any opportunity, as his father suggested, the young Gascon challenges Rochefort, only to have his sword struck in two. He is knocked out as his new enemy goes to meet an approaching carriage. Rochefort greets the passenger inside--Milady DeWinter (Faye Dunaway)-- and tells her she must go to England to report on the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward). The pair are spies for Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston). D'Artagnan again tries to pick a fight but ends up falling in the mud.Finding the musketeers' headquarters, D'Artagnan awaits an appointment with their commander M. Treville (Georges Wilson). As he makes his way through the indoor training ground, he sees Porthos (Frank Finlay) having his portrait done while Aramis (Richard Chamberlain) watches; outside Treville's office, Athos (Oliver Reed) has a shoulder wound attended to. Treville reads D'Artagnan's letter and asks to see the familiar sword, which D'Artagnan sheepishly produces; the commander knows the weapon, realizes what has happened and lets him borrow a new one. Unfortunately there is no place in the musketeers for him, Treville says, until he has established his reputation on campaign or in killing, but a place in the guard might be suited...

The stadtholders disapproved of the independent course of the Utrecht bourgeoisie and brought the city under much more direct control of the republic; which shifted the power towards its dominant province Holland. This was the start of a long period of stagnation of trade and development in Utrecht.

This is just about the only useful thing about this book.This book is just as awful as every other title written by Mr. Mortier.The really bad part is that someone at Charles River Media seems to think Mr. Mortier's books are worth publishing.

Shackleton's February 1907 announcement that he intended to base his expedition at the old Discovery headquarters was noted by Scott, whose own future Antarctic plans were at that stage unannounced. In a letter to Shackleton, Scott claimed priority rights to McMurdo Sound. \\"I feel I have a sort of right to my own field of work,\\" he wrote, adding: \\"anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine\\". He concluded by reminding Shackleton of his duty of loyalty towards his former commander.Shackleton's initial reply was accommodating: \\"I would like to fall in with your views as far as possible without creating a position that would be untenable to myself\\". Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. \\"I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound\\", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided \\"what limits he puts on his own rights\\". To this Shackleton replied: \\"There is no doubt in my mind that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further\\".The matter was unresolved when Scott returned from sea duty in May 1907. Scott pressed for a line of demarcation at 170° W—everything to the west of that line, including Ross Island, McMurdo Sound, and Victoria Land, would be Scott's preserve. Shackleton, with other concerns pressing on him, felt obliged to concede. On 17 May he signed a declaration stating that \\"I am leaving the McMurdo base to you\\", and that he would seek to land further east, either at the Barrier Inlet visited briefly during the Discovery Expedition, or at King Edward VII Land. He would not touch the coast of Victoria Land at all. It was a capitulation to Scott and Wilson, and meant forfeiting the expedition's aim of reaching the South Magnetic Pole which was located within Victoria Land.

It is with great disappointment that I must now share my negative experience at this establishment, hoping that potential visitors may arrive with tempered expectations, and the management considers changes for the better. Aesthetics: Upon arriving, I couldn't help but notice the dull and lackluster exterior of the building. Contrary to the glowing descriptions and images from my online research, the outside failed to make a compelling first impression. The inside did marginally better, adorned with a few pieces of quirky artwork that seemed to aim at compensating for the otherwise bland decor. The lighting felt harsh and excessive, making it less welcoming and slightly off-putting. Service Quality: As a patron who greatly values genuine hospitality and timely service, this establishment severely under-delivered. The staff appeared to be overwhelmed and disorganized, as I witnessed multiple instances of unattended customers languishing at their tables. My own experience was no different. After what felt like an eternity, our orders were taken reluctantly and with evident confusion. Instead of the customary courtesy and attentiveness, we were met with coldness and a rushed demeanor from the waitstaff. Food and Beverage Quality: Sadly, this was the most disappointing aspect of my visit. The menu offered what appeared to be a diverse selection of dishes, yet it seemed that corners had been cut in terms of ingredient quality and preparation. My appetizer arrived lukewarm and under-seasoned, hinting at a potentially careless approach in the kitchen. My main course was both overcooked and in dire need of flavor, presenting inconsistencies with what was advertised within the menu. As for the beverages, I found the cocktail I ordered lackluster in presentation and taste. It seemed as if the bartender was skimping on the ingredients, resulting in a diluted and uninspiring concoction not worth the price. Cleanliness and Hygiene: Throughout my visit, I could not ignore the general untidiness of the place. Dining tables were not promptly cleared, fostering an environment that felt less than sanitary. The restrooms were in rough shape, with no attention being paid to basic cleanliness and supplies. Value for Money: Considering the disappointing quality of the food, beverages, service, and atmosphere, this establishment's pricing fell far from matching the experience provided. Exorbitant prices for mediocre offerings made for a displeasing and unjustifiable cost/value relationship. In conclusion, my visit to this place left me profoundly disheartened. The significant disparity between expectations and reality made for a regrettable experience.

Hypothesis: The young man is sitting and watching tv. .Multi-select problem: Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true? Possible answers:  --yes;  --it is not possible to tell;  --no;","output":"The answer to this question is \\"no\\".  Based on the information provided, it's clear that these two scenarios are entirely different. In the first instance, the young man is actively involved in a physical game that requires movement, precision, and spatial awareness: pool or billiards. This recreational activity is often played in a social setting and requires the player's active, physical engagement. The individual needs to maneuver around the table, aiming and striking the pool balls with a cue stick according to the game rules. On the other hand, watching TV is a passive activity, where the individual is typically stationary, and demands far less physical engagement. Someone sitting and watching TV is usually merely receiving entertainment without the need for active physical contribution.  So, if the premise is the young man shooting pool, it's not possible that simultaneously, the hypothesis can be true – that he is sitting and watching TV. Unless clarified that he is doing both activities at different moments, based off the information given, the two cannot be true at the same time due to the contrasting levels of activity and engagement they entail. Moreover, we do not have enough information to argue that he is multitasking or switching between the two activities. For instance, we do not know if he is watching a TV program while taking breaks in between shots or if there’s a television playing in the background at the bar or pool hall where he’s playing.  Thus, we can't conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true based solely on the information given. The activities described—shooting pool and watching television—are distinct and feature contrasting levels of engagement. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot say that the young man is doing both simultaneously. The conclusion of this scenario is that the hypothesis is false when considering the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This victory contributed to the broader Republican success during the 2010 mid-term elections, where the party made substantial gains in the Senate, including retaining this Class 3 seat in South Carolina.

And the answer is?","output":"The name of the group formed by Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel in 1957 was called \\"Tom & Jerry.\\" Here is a detailed history of the duo and their collaboration: Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel first met in elementary school in Queens, New York, back in the early 1950s. They became friends and bonded over their shared love for music. Both were influenced by the rock and roll and doo-wop sounds that were popular during their youth. The two friends began to perform together in various school productions. As their musical partnership evolved, they started writing their own songs and formed a duo called \\"Tom & Jerry\\" in 1957. At this point, they were only teenagers – Simon was 16 years old, and Garfunkel was 15. Paul Simon took the stage name \\"Jerry Landis,\\" inspired by the first name of his girlfriend, Sue Landis, at that time, while Arthur Garfunkel adopted the pseudonym \\"Tom Graph,\\" referencing his love for mathematics and the fact that he used to track the progress of hit songs on graph paper.  In 1957, the duo wrote and recorded their first single, \\"Hey Schoolgirl,\\" which was inspired by the music of their idols, The Everly Brothers. The song managed to capture the attention of Sid Prosen, the owner of an independent record label called Big Records. Prosen believed in the talent of the young duo and offered them a recording contract. Under Prosen's guidance, they released \\"Hey Schoolgirl,\\" which rapidly gained popularity and managed to reach number 49 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The commercial success of their first single led to appearances on popular television programs, such as \\"American Bandstand\\" and \\"The Alan Freed Show.\\" However, the duo's success as Tom & Jerry was short-lived as they failed to achieve the same level of commercial success with their following singles. Their relationship with Prosen soured, and the duo decided to disband in order to pursue their individual careers and focus on their college education. While attending separate colleges, Simon and Garfunkel continued to write songs and performed occasionally. In the early 1960s, folk music experienced a revival, and the duo rekindled their partnership with a new musical direction. Eventually, they abandoned their stage names and began performing under their real names, Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel. In 1964, they released their debut album as a folk duo named \\"Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.\\" The album included their iconic song \\"The Sound of Silence,\\" which became a massive hit after it was remixed and re-released in 1965. From that point on, Simon & Garfunkel achieved widespread fame and recognition for their intricate vocal harmonies, poetic lyrics, and evocative melodies. They went on to release a series of successful albums that solidified their place in music history, with hits like \\"Mrs. Robinson,\\" \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\\" and \\"Scarborough Fair.\\" Though Tom & Jerry didn't last long, the partnership between Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel left an undeniable mark on the musical landscape, ultimately becoming one of the most successful and critically acclaimed duos in popular music history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose \\"the star doesnt have enough mass\\" happens, how will it affect star is smaller in size.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"The supposed perturbation of the star not having enough mass could lead to the star being smaller in size. When a star doesn't have enough mass, it cannot go through all the transformations that a more massive star would undergo. This means it does not expand to the same extent and so remains relatively small. The second effect mentioned is the star undergoing a change in its core and bonding helium to carbon and oxygen. This transformation is heavily dependent on the star's mass. If the star doesn't have enough mass, the core will not reach high enough temperatures or pressures to catalyze and sustain these fusion reactions. Given these considerations, the perturbation of the star not having enough mass does influence the second effect mentioned by lessening it. Without enough mass, the transformation in the core that bonds helium to carbon and oxygen will be less effective or might not occur at all.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. An Alaskan judge has denied Levi Johnson split custody of his child with Sarah Palin's daughter Bristol. The tumultuous relationship between the former vice presidential candidate's daughter and her former fiancé has landed their son Tripp in Bristol's care for much of his life, but Johnston wanted to change that. Johnston, 23, filed to have equal custody of the now-4-year-old boy but that petition was thrown out by Judge Gregory Heath- who was appointed to the bench by Sarah Palin when she was governor in 2009- who mandated that Tripp remain in the primary custody of his mother Bristol, 23. The","output":"decision came after a heated and closely-watched legal battle between Bristol and Johnston, with both parties providing evidence to support their claims for the child's custody. Bristol, supported by her mother Sarah Palin, argued that she had been the primary caregiver for Tripp since his birth and had provided a stable and nurturing environment for him, while Johnston's history of inconsistency, lack of responsibility, and brushes with the legal system made him an unfit parent. Levi Johnston, on the other hand, maintained that he had made significant strides in improving his life and was now more than capable of sharing equal custody of Tripp. He submitted proof of steady employment, completion of parenting classes, and a consistent effort to be involved in his son's life. However, his claims were heavily scrutinized by the court due to previous incidents involving substance abuse, confrontations with the Palins, and alleged neglect of his other children from a different relationship. During the trial, Tripp's well-being and best interests were at the center of the arguments. Mental health professionals, child welfare experts, and teachers testified on behalf of both parents, offering insight into Tripp's progress under Bristol's care and the potential impact of shared custody on his development. The focus of the trial remained on ensuring a stable and healthy environment for Tripp regardless of the political and media implications surrounding the high-profile court case. While the court's decision to favor Bristol might seem politically biased given the judge's history with Sarah Palin, Judge Gregory Heath emphasized throughout the trial that his decision would be based solely on the best interests of the child. In his ruling, the judge explained that Bristol had shown a higher level of commitment to the child's welfare, consistently providing a stable home environment and prioritizing the child's needs above her own. The judge also cited concerns about Levi Johnston's history and his ability to consistently provide a conducive environment for the child's growth. Despite the denial of Levi Johnston's petition for equal custody, the court recognized his genuine efforts to be a responsible and involved father. The judge granted him increased visitation rights and scheduled periodic review hearings to determine whether any future changes to the custody arrangement should be made. The hope was that both parents would continue to work together, putting their differences aside to create a positive co-parenting environment for Tripp. As the dust began to settle following the high-profile trial, both Bristol Palin and Levi Johnston received widespread media attention for their roles in the custody battle. While several media outlets criticized the court's decision as inherently biased and politically motivated, others praised Bristol and the court for putting the well-being of the child first. Throughout the ordeal, the Palin family remained staunchly supportive of Bristol, even issuing a public statement calling on all involved parties to prioritize Tripp's best interests above all else. In the end, the most logical completion of this news story is one that highlights the importance of prioritizing a child's well-being in custody disputes, even in highly publicized cases like this one. The court's decision to keep Tripp with his primary caregiver and to grant Levi Johnston increased visitation rights represents a noble effort to ensure the best possible outcome for the child, despite the political undertones surrounding the case. The hope now is that both Bristol and Levi will accept the court's ruling and move forward with the child's best interests as their guiding principle, working collaboratively for the betterment of their son's life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape  — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations. The narrator believes that - Chocolate is a good dish - Colomba is a good dish - not enough information - Panettone is a bad dish A:","output":"The narrator believes that \\"Colomba is a good dish\\". This deduction comes from the detailed description given about the columba, citing the sugared almond topping, the soft and fluffy texture, as well as highlighting the process of its making.

A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends.

Indeed, the 4 million advertisers spend for a 30-second Big Game ad actually buys a much bigger chance that their ads won't work, according to the Tucson, Ariz.-based firm. In general, Communicus has found about 60% of ads it tests don't increase purchase or purchase intent.      Tide's 2013 'Miracle Stain' ad, which was well liked and did well on branding, still didn't increase purchases or intent.      The firm reached its Super Bowl conclusions through interviews with more than 1,000 consumers before and after they were exposed to the ads in the 2012 and 2013 games. Before the game, Communicus asks people what they've bought recently and what they intend to buy in the categories spanning the Super Bowl advertiser base. Then it follows up with the same group within the next couple of weeks and asks similar questions as well as others in order to gauge whether consumers actually saw Super Bowl ads for various brands. For categories with longer purchase cycles, such as automobiles, Communicus uses other measures such as changes in intention to investigate buying a brand.      CEO Jeri Smith said it takes its first read on a typical ad four weeks after it starts running to allow for multiple exposures. She said one thing that she suspects hurts Super Bowl ads is that many of them don't air regularly after the game and \\"we find that one ad exposure often isn't enough to make anything happen.\\"      She believes there are other factors at play, too.      \\"The advertisers really dial up the entertainment quotient to pop to the top of the USA Today rankings and such,\\" she said. \\"But we find the brand association with Super Bowl commercials is much lower than you'd get with a typical buy, just because of the way the creative is structured.\\"      Super Bowl ads actually do better than average in ad awareness, with 44% of people remembering they've seen an average Super Bowl ad vs. 32% for other ads that get similar gross-rating-point exposure, Ms. Smith said. But because the creative often focuses less on the brands, she said, people not surprisingly remember the brands less often in Super Bowl ads. People who remember seeing a Super Bowl ad recall the brand 35% of the time vs. about half the time for other ads, she said.      The Super Bowl works better for new products, Ms. Smith said, because the ad message tends to be clearer. Yet, some brands without any real news have fared well too.      Budweiser's \\"Brotherhood\\" ad from the 2013 game, showing the relationship between a Clydesdale and its trainer, fared well in terms of entertainment value and increasing purchase intent, she said, because the iconic horse is so well linked to the brand and the creative was compelling. \\"Beer is an affinity product,\\" she said. \\"I want a beer that makes me feel good about myself.\\"      But Tide's 2013 \\"Miracle Stain\\" ad, which was well liked and did well on branding, still didn't increase purchases or intent, according to Ms. Smith. \\"It didn't tell people anything they didn't already know,\\" she said. \\"And unlike Budweiser, I don't buy Tide because of my personal connection.\\"      Long-form commercials such as Tide's 60-second spot \\"run the risk of people being so caught up in the story that they forget about the brand,\\" Ms. Smith said. And in \\"Miracle Stain,\\" the brand appeared at the end as \\"kind of the anti-hero\\" by eliminating a stain that looked like former San Francisco 49ers Quarterback Joe Montana.      Meanwhile, last year's Mercedes spot did well because it drove home the message that the brand had a more affordable model coming and helped boost interest in the brand more broadly. But most of the automotive commercials \\"go to the bottom of the list in terms of effectiveness because they all run together in people's minds,\\" she said.      Communicus uses some of the same purchase-comparison metrics copy pre-testing firms use, but gauges the ads' effect on consumers who've seen them (or not seen them) in the real world rather than through forced viewing. Asking about purchase intent is not precise as sales data but is superior in isolating the impact of the advertising with the individuals involved, since they're going back pre- and post with the same individuals and the only real variable is whether they saw the ad (given that both groups are just as likely to have been influenced by promotions or other factors). ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Advertiser demand for next year's Super Bowl XLVIII commercial time is high, with 30-second spots selling for up to 4 million. Despite the high costs, a study by research firm Communicus suggests that 80% of Super Bowl ads do not increase sales or purchase intent. Super Bowl ads tend to perform better in ad awareness, but often have lower brand association due to a focus on entertainment instead of branding. However, new products and some iconic brands, such as Budweiser, have seen success with Super Bowl ads."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: American teenager Thomas Cheatham had planned to study Latin during his sophomore year at Hebron High School in Texas. But when he learned that the school district was going to offer a Mandarin class, he quickly changed his mind. \\"I thought it (Mandarin) would be more beneficial than Latin,\\" said Cheatham, who is now in his second year of studying the language. He speaks Mandarin to order food at Chinese restaurants and can read Face book posts from his Chinese-speaking friends. While it'a difficult language to master, the high school junior, who plans to study computer engineering, thinks it will be a valuable thing in his career. \\"Chinese is a good language to know, especially with China becoming a growing power,\\" he said. Many experts agree that proficiency in a language spoken by a billion people worldwide will give American students an edge in the global economy. \\"People are looking at China as our next economic competitor, and interest in Mandarin is growing,'' said Marty Abbott, executive director of the American Council on the Teaching of  Foreign Languages. ''We're seeing it in all parts of the country.\\" The number of students studying Mandarin in public schools nationwide in grades 7 through 12 grew from 20,000 in 2004-2005 to 60,000 three years later, according to the council's most recent survey. Abbott estimates that as many as 100,000 students are now studying Mandarin, in public and private schools, throughout the nation. She said the US government has considered Mandarin to be an \\"important needs\\" language and provides professional development programs for teachers. \\"Our government wants to increase our language ability for national security and economic competitiveness,\\" Abbott said. At the same time, the Chinese government is spreading knowledge of the Chinese language and culture through Confucius Institutes established in many states.

Question: Where was the cave located which Brent and Nova hid after their escape? Title: Beneath the Planet of the Apes Movie plot: Following the events of Planet of the Apes, time-displaced astronaut Taylor (Charlton Heston) and the mute Nova (Linda Harrison) are riding on horseback through the desert of the Forbidden Zone. Without warning, fire shoots up from the ground and deep chasms open. Confused by the strange phenomenon, Taylor investigates a cliff wall and disappears before Nova's eyes. Elsewhere in the Forbidden Zone, a second spaceship has crash landed after being sent to search for Taylor and his crew. Like Taylor's ship, it has traveled into Earth's distant future. However, surviving astronaut Brent (James Franciscus) believes he has traveled to another planet. He encounters Nova and notices she is wearing Taylor's dog tags. Hoping Taylor is still alive, he rides with her to Ape City, where he is shocked to discover the simian civilization. He observes the gorilla General Ursus (James Gregory) leading a rally calling for the apes to conquer the Forbidden Zone and use it as a potential food source, against the objections of the orangutan Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans). Brent is wounded by a gorilla soldier and taken by Nova to the home of the chimpanzees Cornelius (David Watson) and Zira (Kim Hunter), who treat his wound and tell him of their time with Taylor. The humans hide when Dr. Zaius arrives and announces that he will accompany Ursus on the invasion of the Forbidden Zone. Attempting to flee the city, Brent and Nova are captured by gorillas. Ursus orders they be used for target practice, but Zira helps them escape. They hide in a cave which Brent soon discovers is the ruins of the Queensboro Plaza station of the New York City Subway, making him realize that he has traveled through time to Earth's post-apocalyptic future.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What two fleets were involved in the Battle of Bornholm?  Early in March 1676, a Danish fleet of 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel left Copenhagen. On 29 April it landed troops on Gotland, which soon surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May, but experienced adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then already left Visby, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm to join with a small Danish–Dutch squadron in cruising between Scania and the island of Rügen to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets met each another in the battle of Bornholm. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a fireship and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of coherence and organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.After the failed action, the Swedish fleet anchored off Trelleborg where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies at least until they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty. They tried to get ahead of Tromp's ships to gain the weather gage by getting between the allies and the shore, and thereby gaining an advantageous tactical position. The...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Willson was born in Mason City, Iowa, to John David Willson and Rosalie Reiniger Willson, and he had a brother two years his senior, John Cedrick, and a sister 12 years his senior, the children's author Dixie Willson. He attended Frank Damrosch's Institute of Musical Art (which later became the Juilliard School) in New York City. He married his high school sweetheart, Elizabeth \\"Peggy\\" Wilson, on August 29, 1920. A flute and piccolo player, Willson was a member of John Philip Sousa's band (1921-1923), and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra under Arturo Toscanini (1924-1929). Context: His work in films included composing the score for Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator (1940) (Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score), and arranging music for the score of William Wyler's The Little Foxes (1941) (Academy Award nomination for Best Music Score of a Dramatic Picture).  During World War II, he worked for the United States' Armed Forces Radio Service. His work with the AFRS teamed him with George Burns, Gracie Allen and Bill Goodwin. He would work with all three as the bandleader, and a regular character, on the Burns and Allen radio program. He played a shy man, always trying to get advice on women. His character was ditsy as well, basically a male version of Gracie Allen's character.  In 1942, Willson had his own program on NBC. Meredith Willson's Music was a summer replacement for Fibber McGee and Molly. Sparkle Time, which ran on CBS in 1946-47, was Willson's first full-season radio program.  Returning to network radio after WWII, he created the Talking People, a choral group that spoke in unison while delivering radio commercials. He also became the musical director for The Big Show, a prestigious comedy-variety program hosted by actress Tallulah Bankhead and featuring some of the world's most respected entertainers. Willson himself became part of one of the show's very few running gags, beginning replies to Bankhead's comments or questions with \\"well, sir, Miss Bankhead . . .\\" Willson wrote the song \\"May the Good Lord Bless and Keep You\\" for the show. Bankhead spoke the lyrics over the music at the end of each show. He also worked on Jack Benny's radio program, and hosted his own program in 1949. For a few years in the early 1950s, Willson was a regular panelist on the Goodson-Todman game show The Name's the Same.  In 1950 Willson served as Musical Director for The California Story, the Golden State's centennial production at the Hollywood Bowl. Through working on this production, Willson met writer Franklin Lacey who proved instrumental in developing the story line for a musical Willson had been working on, soon to be known as The Music Man. The California Story spectacular was followed by two more state centennial collaborations with stage director Vladimir Rosing: The Oregon Story in 1959 and The Kansas Story in 1961. Question: What happened on this program?. Whats the answer?","output":"Alright, little buddy, let me explain it to you! So, Meredith Willson was a very talented musician and he worked on many programs on the radio. In 1942, he had his own show called Meredith Willson's Music, which was a fun summer replacement for another program called Fibber McGee and Molly. He also had another radio program called Sparkle Time, which ran for a whole season in 1946-47. Did you know that he even worked with famous people like George Burns and Gracie Allen? He played a shy character who always tried to get advice on talking to girls. Meredith Willson was a part of many shows, and he composed music for movies like Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator and arranged music for another movie, The Little Foxes. He even served as the musical director for some big events celebrating the history of California, Oregon, and Kansas! He was also working on a musical called The Music Man, which became very famous. So, to answer your question: on these programs, Meredith Willson showed his amazing musical talent and sense of humor, making people happy by playing music and performing funny characters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Short movie review: dopey  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"The critic is thinking negatively about the movie. \\"Dopey\\" is a term that commonly refers to something being silly or ridiculous, oftentimes with an insinuation of a lack of intelligence or thoughtfulness. Generally, it's a term more often used with a negative connotation. When a critic uses such a term to describe a movie, it likely means they found the content of the movie to be lacking in depth, sophistication, or seriousness, even if it wasn't necessarily meant to be a serious film. It could indicate that they found the humor or storyline to be juvenile, overly simple, or not as refined or well-crafted as they'd prefer. They may have found that the plot was too predictable or that the acting performances were not well executed. They could have also found the script to be uninspiring or filled with cliches. Overall, they probably didn't feel the film was memorable or impactful in a positive way. However, it's also worth noting that not every viewer or critic has the same taste in films, and just because one person labels a movie negatively doesn't mean everyone else will feel the same way. Some people might enjoy a more relaxed, \\"dopey\\" film that's easy to follow along without needing to think too deeply about complex themes or plots. So while this critic had a negative viewpoint, other viewers might actually find the movie to be fun and entertaining.  It's also possible that if the film was meant to be a comedy, or specifically a silly or slapstick comedy, some success could be found in its dopey nature. The right audience might appreciate it for what it is, rather than expecting it to be something it's not. But based purely on the term \\"dopey\\", the critic's review of the film is negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It marks the first time an internet company has hit the landmark figure, according to ComScore, a company which compiles web data. The second most popular destination was Microsoft, with 905million unique visitors, and third was Facebook, which has grown by 30 per cent in the past year, attracting 714million visitors in the month. Record breaker: Google websites attracted more than a billion unique visitors in May, marking the first time an Internet company has hit the landmark figure Despite Google's overwhelming popularity, however, internet users spent more time surfing Facebook - they browsed the social network for 250billion minutes in May, compared to 200billion minutes on","output":"Google platforms. This discrepancy can be attributed to the nature of the two websites: while Google serves as a search engine and provides various tools that are primarily focused on utility and efficiency, Facebook is a social media platform designed to encourage engagement and interaction among users. As a result, it is not surprising that users would spend more time interacting with friends, family, and acquaintances on Facebook, as well as consuming content shared by others and engaging with various features such as groups, pages, and events. In contrast, Google users are more likely to visit the site with a specific purpose in mind (e.g., finding information, using a particular tool or service), and once that purpose is achieved, they move on to other activities. This difference in user behavior underscores the importance of understanding the unique characteristics and strengths of each platform when developing a digital marketing strategy or considering where to allocate resources and efforts. In particular, businesses and organizations should take into account the intended purpose and target audience of each platform in order to maximize their online presence and effectiveness. Ultimately, the success of both Google and Facebook in attracting a massive number of unique visitors highlights the increasing role of technology in our daily lives and confirms the need for businesses and individuals alike to adapt and evolve in this ever-changing digital landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which movie is the following review about? Social commentary mingles with stupid comedy in this humorless update of a 1977 George Segal-Jane Fonda romp.","output":"While it is not possible for me to accurately pinpoint the exact movie based on this brief and vague review, I can give you an educated guess based on the provided information. The mention of a 1977 George Segal-Jane Fonda romp suggests the original film was \\"Fun with Dick and Jane.\\" This means the review seems likely to be about the remake of \\"Fun with Dick and Jane\\" (2005), which starred Jim Carrey and Téa Leoni in the roles originally portrayed by Segal and Fonda. The 2005 \\"Fun with Dick and Jane\\" is a dark comedy directed by Dean Parisot, and it focuses on a privileged suburban couple who turn to a life of crime after financial misfortune strikes due to the husband's company going bankrupt. Dick Harper (Jim Carrey) works for Globodyne, a massive corporation where he is quickly promoted just before the company's stock collapses, leaving the couple penniless. The couple then takes on various schemes and criminal activities to maintain their lifestyle and pay for their mounting debts, all while comically showcasing their ineptitude at a life of crime. The review suggests that the film offers social commentary in the form of a satirical take on the corporate greed and the economic downturn this can cause. It highlights how Dick and Jane's privileged lifestyle quickly crumbles as a result of the corporation's bankruptcy, and the desperate measures they take to cope with their new reality. The humor is meant to serve as a critique of the way society reacts to these situations, as well as the superficial nature of attaining success via material wealth. At the same time, the review seems to imply that the humor may come across as \\"stupid comedy,\\" which might mean that the film relies too heavily on slapstick humor or over-the-top antics rather than focusing on intelligent comedy or subtle satire. This may make the movie less enjoyable to some, particularly those who were fans of the 1977 version or prefer more sophisticated humor. Additionally, the phrase \\"humorless update\\" implies the reviewer felt that the film did not live up to expectations from the original or provide enough new elements to make it feel fresh. The movie may be considered a disappointing adaptation that tries too hard to be relevant and fails to capture the magic of the original film. In summary, the film in question is likely the 2005 remake of \\"Fun with Dick and Jane\\" starring Jim Carrey and Téa Leoni. However, it is important to remember that this evaluation is made on the assumption that the provided review refers to this specific film, and the interpretation of the review may differ among individual viewers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He is considered dangerous and Cook County Sheriff's officials told the I-Team the search is \\"all hands on deck.\\"Cook County authorities discovered the mistake Monday morning when they went to the address he had provide on his parole record, but he wasn't there.Glover is accused in the 2012 Dan Ryan Expressway shooting that resulted in the death of motorist Larry Porter, 25, who had just become a father that day.\\"It's crazy because when the baby grows up, he's gonna have to say, 'My daddy died the same day I was born,'\\" said Robert Staples, a friend of Porter's.Glover was being held at the Cook County Jail for the past two years for attempted armed robbery that were separate from the expressway shooting charges.Last Thursday in a county courtroom, Glover was sentenced for the attempt armed robbery.On Friday, he was transported to Stateville prison in Joliet, where authorities determined he had already served enough time to be eligible for parole and he was released.The South Side man should have been taken back into custody by Cook County and held in the expressway murder case even though he had satisfied his sentence for the unrelated armed robbery.Cook County officials said Monday that they are trying to figure out where the breakdown in communication occurred resulting in Glover's release.A statement late Monday from Illinois Department of Corrections officials said they \\"did not receive any additional documentation or information indicating he should be held beyond his February 24, 2017 release date.\\"Glover is supposed to be in court April 4 for a hearing in the murder case.Glover's gradmother and grandfather, who live on Chicago's South Side, told ABC 7 Eyewitness News they have not been in touch with him since before he originally went to jail.Authorities reminded the public that aiding a fugitive is a felony, punishable by 1-3 years in prison.Anyone with information about Glover's whereabouts should immediately contact the Cook County Sheriff's Command Center at 773-674-0169. ||||| A man charged in a 2012 killing on the Dan Ryan Expressway was incorrectly released from prison Friday when he was found to be eligible for parole in an unrelated attempted robbery case, according to officials and records.      Cook County sheriff's officials were notified Monday that Garrett Glover, 29, had been released from Illinois Department of Corrections custody after being sentenced to four years in prison Thursday in a 2014 attempted armed robbery case from Country Club Hills. Glover is awaiting trial in the Sept. 5, 2012, shooting of Larry Porter, 25, near 87th Street on the Dan Ryan.      Glover had been in jail since at least February 2014, and when he was sentenced last week was given credit toward his four-year prison term for already serving 879 days in jail, according to court records. He was released on parole Friday, according to Illinois Department of Corrections records.      \\"Glover should have been returned to custody of the Cook County Jail on the other case\\" but instead was released, according to a news release from the sheriff's office. \\"The sheriff's office is investigating the circumstances surrounding his release, and all efforts are being made to secure his apprehension.\\"      Because the Illinois Department of Corrections was not given \\"documentation indicating Mr. Glover should have been retained or sent back to Cook County custody, the IDOC, by law, had to release him,\\" spokeswoman Nicole Wilson said in a statement.      \\"He was appropriately admitted into IDOC custody and because his sentence required that he serve 50 percent of his time, he was released to parole on Feb. 24, 2017,\\" according to the statement.      Glover, Patrick Calvin and Tyrone Mixon are awaiting trial in the 2012 Dan Ryan killing, according to court records. Calvin is being held in Cook County Jail, while Mixon is serving a prison term in an unrelated case in Wisconsin, according to records.      Porter was driving a black 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee south on the expressway when he was shot by another motorist, police said at the time of his killing. Glover, Calvin and a third man — identified by Illinois State Police as Mixon — shot at Porter from inside a maroon van they had borrowed from a North Side woman Glover knew, prosecutors said when the three were charged.      Another man in the Jeep was shot, but the then-27-year-old man in the back seat, later identified as the owner of the Jeep and the target of the shooting, wasn't injured.      Anyone with information about where Glover might be is asked to call the Sheriff's Command Center at 773-674-0169. The public is reminded that aiding a fugitive is a felony, punishable by one to three years in the Illinois Department of Corrections. |||||","output":"A manhunt is under way for an accused killer who was mistakenly released from custody due to a paperwork problem.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: Create a pickling mixture for any type of vegetable or fruit. Select from: A). Boil vinegar, sugar and spices in a pot and add the vegetable or fruit you want to pickle and boil for a little longer. Let it cool down and then put the vegetable or fruit in a jar and pour the rest of the pots contents over it and store.; B). Boil water, sugar and spices in a pot and add the vegetable or fruit you want to pickle and boil for a little longer. Let it cool down and then put the vegetable or fruit in a jar and pour the rest of the pots contents over it and store.;","output":"Option A is the better solution for the following goal: Create a pickling mixture for any type of vegetable or fruit. There are several reasons why this solution prevails over Option B. 1. Acidity level: One of the key elements in pickling is the acidity level of the pickling mixture. In pickling mixtures, acidity is essential to preserve the vegetables and fruits and prevent spoilage caused by the growth of unwanted microorganisms. In Option A, vinegar is used as the main acidic component, which provides the necessary acidic environment for proper preservation of the vegetables and fruits. Vinegar typically has an acetic acid content ranging between 4% and 7%, making it suitable for pickling. Option B, on the other hand, utilizes water instead of vinegar, which will not provide the required acidic environment for preservation. 2. Fermentation control: In the pickling process, controlling fermentation is crucial for flavor development and preservation. Vinegar, used in Option A, helps inhibit unwanted fermentation by creating an unfriendly environment for spoilage-causing microorganisms. By preventing uncontrolled fermentation, you can achieve a more consistent and desirable flavor in your pickled vegetables and fruits. In contrast, Option B lacks this advantage due to the absence of vinegar. 3. Flavor enhancement: Vinegar, used in Option A, plays a significant role in enhancing the flavor of the pickled product. The acetic acid in vinegar imparts a tangy, sour taste that is characteristic of pickled products. Additionally, vinegar helps to balance and meld other flavors present in the pickling mixture, such as sugar and spices, resulting in more complex and well-integrated flavors. Using water in Option B will not offer the same flavor benefits. 4. Texture preservation: Vinegar in a pickling mixture helps preserve the texture of vegetables and fruits by inhibiting the enzymatic processes that cause softening and spoilage. As a result, pickled vegetables and fruits using vinegar, as in Option A, will maintain a firmer and crisper texture than those in Option B. Given these reasons, boiling vinegar, sugar, and spices in a pot (Option A) is the better solution for creating a pickling mixture for any type of vegetable or fruit. Option A provides an ideal acidic environment for preservation, helps control fermentation, enhances the flavor, and preserves the texture of the vegetables and fruits being pickled. Option B, using water instead of vinegar, would not provide the same benefits and might result in less successful pickling outcomes."},{"instruction":"Q:I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.\\"?

Please answer the following question: I have been preparing our house for the market and in doing so, I have gotten rid of a lot of stuff! I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest.

Question: Which side finished bottom of the 1st division of the County Cricket Championship in 2008? Answer:","output":"In 2008, the team that finished at the bottom of the 1st Division of the County Cricket Championship was Surrey County Cricket Club. Surrey struggled throughout the season, facing several challenges on and off the field which eventually led them to the last position in the standings. The 2008 County Championship, the domestic first-class cricket competition in England and Wales, was divided into two divisions: Division One and Division Two. Each division comprised nine teams, and the teams played each other twice during the season – once at their home ground and once at the opposition's ground. Surrey's performance in the 2008 season was far from satisfactory, as they struggled to find any consistency in their game. With only three wins throughout the season, the team managed to obtain a mere 131.5 points, finishing dead last in the 1st division. The poor performance in the County Championship prompted the club to reassess the team dynamics and improve their strategies for the coming seasons. Key factors that contributed to Surrey's poor performance in 2008 include injuries to key players, lack of experienced and solid leadership, and several changes in the coaching staff. The inconsistent form of their key players also played a crucial role in their overall performance. Many players faced inconsistency in their batting and bowling performances, which affected the team's ability to close out matches and, ultimately, win games. It is worth noting that, while 2008 was a dark year for Surrey, it served as a major wake-up call for the team management to make some necessary changes. Following that 2008 season, Surrey started rebuilding their squad and implemented new training strategies to improve the performance of their players. This ultimately led to better performances in the following years and their eventual promotion back to Division One. In conclusion, Surrey County Cricket Club finished bottom of the 1st division of the County Cricket Championship in 2008, with a total of 131.5 points. The team's performance during the season was heavily impacted by injuries, lack of leadership, and inconsistency in key players' game. However, the disappointment of this season was a turning point for the club, paving the way for new strategies and a stronger squad in the subsequent years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When a plant wilts, the stomata close. How does this help the plant?","output":"To answer the question, I will provide information on the function of stomata and the significance of their closure when a plant wilts. Step 1: Understanding the function of stomata Stomata are small pores found on the surface of plant leaves, which primarily serve to regulate gas exchange between the plant and its environment. They allow the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) needed for photosynthesis while also facilitating the release of oxygen (O2) and excess water vapor through a process called transpiration. Step 2: Explaining the wilting of a plant Wilting occurs when a plant loses more water than it absorbs, leading to a decrease in turgor pressure within its cells. This decrease in turgor pressure causes the plant to lose structural support and droop. Wilting is often a response to environmental factors such as drought, heat, or insufficient water absorption through the roots. Step 3: Describing the closure of stomata when a plant wilts In response to water stress, plants have evolved mechanisms to conserve water, such as closing their stomata. When stomata close, it reduces the rate of transpiration, limiting the amount of water vapor that exits the leaf. This is an essential response to help the plant retain moisture and prevent further water loss. Step 4: Concluding the importance of stomatal closure during wilting To answer the question, when a plant wilts, the stomata close to help the plant conserve water and reduce further water loss. By limiting transpiration, the plant can retain moisture, allowing it to better withstand periods of drought, heat, or inadequate water supply. This physiological response helps to increase the plant's chances of survival during times of water stress."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Passive immunity arises from the transfer of antibodies to an individual without requiring them to mount their own active immune response. Naturally acquired passive immunity is seen during fetal development. IgG is transferred from the maternal circulation to the fetus via the placenta, protecting the fetus from infection and protecting the newborn for the first few months of its life. As already stated, a newborn benefits from the IgA antibodies it obtains from milk during breastfeeding. The fetus and newborn thus benefit from the immunological memory of the mother to the pathogens to which she has been exposed. In medicine, artificially acquired passive immunity usually involves injections of immunoglobulins, taken from animals previously exposed to a specific pathogen. This treatment is a fast-acting method of temporarily protecting an individual who was possibly exposed to a pathogen. The downside to both types of passive immunity is the lack of the development of immunological memory. Once the antibodies are transferred, they are effective for only a limited time before they degrade.   Q: Passive immunity arises from the transfer of what to an individual, without requiring them to mount their own active immune response?   A: pick from the following.

Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.  - A soft drink (see terminology for other names) is a drink that typically contains carbonated water, a sweetener, and a natural or artificial flavoring. The sweetener may be sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, sugar substitutes (in the case of diet drinks), or some combination of these. Soft drinks may also contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives, and other ingredients.  - Ireland has historically been divided into four provinces: Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster. The Irish word for this territorial division, \\"cúige\\", literally meaning \\"fifth part\\", indicates that there were once five; the fifth province, Meath, was incorporated into Leinster, with parts going to Ulster. The provinces of Ireland serve no administrative or political purposes, but function as historical and cultural entities.  - Table salt or common salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl), a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of salts; salt in its natural form as a crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or halite. Salt is present in vast quantities in seawater, where it is the main mineral constituent. The open ocean has about of solids per litre, a salinity of 3.5%.  - A plastic bottle is a bottle constructed from plastic.

Tanora is packaged in 2 - litre and 500ml plastic bottles . It was also available in 330ml cans , but these ceased production in June 2010 ; 200ml glass bottles ( for the licensed trade ) have already been withdrawn , both due to lack of demand .

Summarize this article: Two female Democrats walked out of a House oversight committee hearing on the contraceptive coverage rule Thursday morning, accusing Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) of manipulating committee rules to block female witnesses from testifying.      \\"What I want to know is, where are the women?\\" asked Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) before walking out. \\"I look at this panel [of witnesses], and I don't see one single individual representing the tens of millions of women across the country who want and need insurance coverage for basic preventive health care services, including family planning.\\"      Text Size -      +      reset Female Democrats on why they walked out of hearing      The five witnesses on the first panel were all male religious leaders or professors, including a Catholic bishop. Two women were listed on the committee website as witnesses for a second, later panel, also dominated by conservatives. The first panel, however, tends to draw the most attention at hearings.      Democrats withdrew the name of a witness Issa had accepted, Barry Lynn of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, because they wanted a woman to testify. Lynn submitted a written statement instead.      Maloney pressed Issa to allow Sandra Fluke, a law student from Georgetown University, to testify about the impact of the new requirement that most health plans offer contraceptive coverage with no co-pay. Issa shot back that Fluke was rejected because she was \\"not found to be appropriate or qualified\\" to testify about religious liberty. He said liberty, not contraception, was the topic of the hearing.      Rep. Ann Marie Buerkle (R-N.Y.), the only female Republican lawmaker at the hearing, agreed with Issa.      \\"I really find it so objectionable that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would characterize this as something so narrow as being about contraception,\\" she said. \\"This is a fundamental assault on one’s conscience.\\"      Ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings (D-M.D.) also accused the Republican majority of silencing women in the discussion even though they are most affected by the policy.      \\"This committee commits a massive injustice by trying to pretend that the views of millions of women across this country are meaningless, or worthless, or irrelevant to this debate,” he said.      Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) attempted to force a vote on seating Fluke, saying the chairman was breaking committee rules. When he ignored her motion, Norton and Maloney walked out. Maloney later returned. Norton did not.      Norton accused Issa of \\"pretzel turning of the rules so as to deny us a witness\\" in a press conference convened in the hallway. She said the hearing was \\"the kind you expect in an autocratic regime.\\"      Fluke told the gathered reporters about a friend’s experience that she had hoped to include in her testimony. The woman had lost an ovary to an illness that could have been treated with contraceptives that she couldn't access and now was facing the possibility of infertility, Fluke said.      \\"It's striking that the chairman would say that the reason I cannot speak is that I'm not qualified to speak on the matter,\\" she said. \\"I feel that the women this affects are the most qualified to speak on this matter.\\" ||||| ABC News      A Capitol Hill hearing that was supposed to be about religious freedom and a mandate that health insurers cover contraception in the United States began as an argument about whether Democrats could add a woman to the all-male panel.      \\"Where are the women?\\" the minority Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., asked early in the hearing.      She criticized the Republican committee chairman, Rep. Darrel Issa, for wanting to \\"roll back the fundamental rights of women to a time when the government thought what happens in the bedroom is their business.\\"      \\"We will not be forced back to that primitive era,\\" she said.      Issa bristled at the charge and said Democrats could not add their witness because she was not a member of the clergy, but a student at Georgetown. He also faulted Democrats for not submitting the name of the witness, Sandra Fluke, in time.      Fluke would have talked about a classmate who lost an ovary because of a syndrome that causes ovarian cysts. Georgetown, which is affiliated with the Catholic Church, does not insure birth control, which is also used to treat the syndrome.      Issa said the hearing is meant to be more broadly about religious freedom and not specifically about the contraception mandate in the Health Reform law.      The congressional hearing suggested that the Obama administration went too far with its mandate that all insurers except churches - including non-church religious affiliated organizations - must offer health insurance. It's titled \\"Lines Crossed: Separation of Church and State. Has the Obama Administration Trampled on Freedom of Religion and Freedom of Conscience?\\"      Among the witnesses invited by Issa to attend the hearing was a representative of the Catholic bishops, who oppose the Obama administration \\"accommodation\\" on birth-control coverage. Joining them are many other men of other religions. Not invited, complained Democrats, were representatives from the Catholic Health Association, which is run by a woman and actually runs the Catholic hospitals, nor Catholic Charities, both of which said Friday they supported the president's plan.      Ranking committee member Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., wanted to invite third-year Georgetown Law Center student Sandra Fluke to testify, telling Issa it was important to have at least one woman at the witness table because the issue involved health repercussions for women. Read Fluke's full testimony here.      Issa's staff sent a letter to the Democrats, saying, \\"As the hearing is not about reproductive rights but instead about the administration's actions as they relate to freedom of religion and conscience, he believes that Ms. Fluke is not an appropriate witness.\\"      \\"It was just crushing to hear the chairman's reason to not allow my testimony,\\" Fluke told ABC News. \\"I can understand that [the issue] is connected to religion, but I don't understand how you can have an open conversation without hearing from the women who have been personally affected by this.\\"      Cummings, the ranking Democrat, and Maloney asked Issa to reconsider and let Fluke testify, noting she was in the audience, when the hearing got underway Thursday.      \\"It was staggering to sit there and feel like this panel of men was going to talk about my health and women like me,\\" Fluke said. \\"It felt so very wrong.\\"      Rep. Cummings accused Issa of creating \\"conspiracy hearing\\" and stacking the witness list by refusing to allow women \\"commits a massive injustice by trying to pretend that the views of millions of women across the country are meaningless.\\"      A terse back and forth followed between Issa, Maloney and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton of Washington, D.C., about what the true purpose of the hearing was and whether a violation of rules existed. Issa pointed out that Democrats barred Republican witnesses when they were in the majority. Two women were featured on the second panel, one a female physician.      In what seemed like a move to drive home his point, Issa's first witness used a hypothetical example of the government forcing a Jewish orthodox-owned deli to serve pork, as a comparison to the Health and Human Services' mandate for religious employers.      The next three witnesses asked why the government was getting involved in the conscience of the American people.      \\"Religious people determine what violates their conscience, not the federal government,\\" the Rev. Jonah Paffhausen, Washington archbishop of the Orthodox Church in America, said. \\"Please get the federal government, Mr. Chairman, out of our consciences.\\"      Congressman Danny K. Davis asked the witnesses about their position regarding the ability of birth control to offer other preventative care for woman (such as ovarian cancer prevention) offered and endorsed by groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Public Health Association.      Rabbi Meir Soloveichik responded for the group.      \\"If that was the focus, none of us would be here today,\\" he said. \\"We are not here because we seek to hurt preventative care of anybody. We are here today because the administration is showing insensitivity to the liberty of conscience.\\"      Rep. Gerry Connolly accused the witnesses of \\"being used for a political agenda\\" and that the \\"hearing is a sham.\\"      \\"I think it taints the value of this panel that could have been a thoughtful discussion,\\" he said referring to the fact that the minority was denied their requested additional witnesses. \\"This is a panel designed to embarrass the president of the United states and his administration.\\"      All the witnesses defended their presence on the commitment to religious freedom.      Connolly also criticized the use of quotes and images of democratic presidents, such as john F. Kennedy, by Issa to demonstrate the administrations subversion of first amendment rights.      \\"In an almost Stalinist like fashion have signs of democratic icons,\\" he said.      The witnesses often emphasized they would not violate their \\"liberty of conscience.\\"      \\"If there is real religious liberty in our country,\\" said Roman Catholic Bishop William Lori, \\"then churches have the god given right to run their own institutions and own internal affairs according to their teachings. Fluke sat directly behind the bishop.      \\"He spent his entire testimony talking about a hypothetical story,\\" she said. \\"It was very difficult to hear his testimony about a hypothetical story and not about the real stories, about the women in my story.\\"      ABC News' Alexa Keyes contributed to this report. |||||","output":"Two female Democrats walked out of a House oversight committee hearing on the contraceptive coverage rule, accusing Chairman Darrell Issa of manipulating committee rules to block female witnesses from testifying.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the rule was needed because battery-powered vehicles are very quiet. It said the rule would particularly help blind pedestrians, or those with a visual impairment, detect electric cars and hybrids on the road. The new safety rule could help prevent 2,400 injuries a year, said the NHTSA. The rule demands that the cars make a noise when travelling either forwards or backwards at speeds of less than 30km/h (19mph). The regulation covers vehicles with four wheels that weigh less than 10,000 pounds (4.5 tonnes). The safety specification requires car makers to use a two-tone signal similar to that currently emitted by heavy vehicles when they are reversing. At higher speeds, said the NHTSA, tyre and wind noise would be loud enough to alert people to the presence of a vehicle. \\"We all depend on our senses to alert us to possible danger,\\" said Anthony Foxx, US transportation secretary, in a statement. He added that it had become more important to hear vehicles as quieter hybrid and electric cars become more popular. Car makers have until 1 September 2019 to make changes to ensure that all new vehicles are fitted with sound systems to generate the noise. However, it added, half of those on the road one year before the deadline must comply with the rule. Eric Bridges, director of the American council of the Blind, said it welcomed the adoption of the safety rule and said it would provide an \\"additional safety cue for all pedestrians who share the streets with hybrid or electric vehicles\\".

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the birds that returned through Sudan? is inside the article: After the demise of the migratory Turkish colony, the northern bald ibis was known to survive in the wild only at the Moroccan sites, although occasional sightings of birds in Yemen, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, and Israel during the 1980s and 1990s suggested that there was still a colony somewhere in the Middle East. Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near Palmyra, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the Azores, and Cape Verde.Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years. They travelled south on the eastern side of the Red Sea via Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and returned north through Sudan and Eritrea., can you guess it ?

(CNN) -- The death of more than 300 African migrants in a shipwreck off the Italian island of Lampedusa in early October has shone a spotlight on illegal immigration to Europe. But although the tragedy at Lampedusa shocked the world, it has done little to dissuade migrants who continue to make the perilous journey across the Mediterranean from northern Africa to European shores. Frontex, the European Union border agency, says the majority of people residing illegally in the EU arrived by plane with a valid travel visa and simply stayed on after their visa expired. But Frontex also estimates that at least 72,000 people illegally entered the EU via land and sea routes in 2012 -- and the actual figure may be much higher. The EU also said it is setting up a new border surveillance system and","output":"strengthening collaboration with countries of origin and transit in an effort to tackle the complex issue of illegal immigration more effectively. Dubbed \\"Eurosur,\\" the initiative aims to enhance intelligence sharing and improve coordination between member states to detect and prevent unauthorized entry attempts, while safeguarding the fundamental rights of asylum seekers and those in need of international protection. Alongside this technological advancement, the bloc is also increasing diplomatic efforts in fostering dialogues with African countries, emphasizing the need for joint action in addressing root causes of migration, including poverty, conflict, and human rights abuses. Despite the commendable steps taken by the EU, critics argue that more emphasis should be placed on creating safe and legal pathways for migrants, rather than solely focusing on border security – recognizing that until conditions in their home countries improve significantly, the desperate and risky journeys to Europe will continue unabated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the country that the people of Sikkim attempted to join through vote and failed twice in the 1940s? from the following article ?  Nathu La is located on the 563 km (350 mi) Old Silk Route, an offshoot of the historic Silk Road. The Old Silk Route connects Lhasa in Tibet to the plains of Bengal to the south. In 1815, trade volume increased after the British annexed territories belonging to the Sikkimese, Nepalese, and Bhutanese. The potential of Nathu La was realised in 1873, after the Darjeeling Deputy Commissioner published a report on the strategic importance of mountain passes between Sikkim and Tibet. In December 1893, the Sikkimese monarchy and Tibetan rulers signed an agreement to increase trade between the two nations. The agreement culminated in 1894 when the trade pass was opened. Nathu La played a vital role in the 1903–1904 British expedition to Tibet, which sought to prevent the Russian Empire from interfering in Tibetan affairs and thus gaining a foothold in the region. In 1904, Major Francis Younghusband, serving as the British Commissioner to Tibet, led a successful mission through Nathu La to capture Lhasa. This led to the setting up of trading posts at Gyantse and Gartok in Tibet, and gave control of the surrounding Chumbi Valley to the British. The following November, China and Great Britain ratified an agreement approving trade between Sikkim and Tibet. In 1947 and 1948, a popular vote for Sikkim to join newly independent India failed and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to a special protectorate status for Sikkim. Sikkim agreed to be a protectorate nation and Indian troops were allowed to man its borders, including Nathu La. During this period, more than 1,000 mules and 700 people were involved in cross-border trade through Nathu La. In 1949, when the Tibetan government expelled the Chinese living there, most of the displaced Chinese returned home through the Nathu La–Sikkim–Kolkata route.The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, used this pass to travel to India for the 2,500th birthday celebration of Gautama Buddha, which was held between November 1956 and February 1957. Later, on 1 September 1958, Nehru,... The answer to this question is:","output":"India. The people of Sikkim attempted to join India through a popular vote in 1947 and 1948, but failed twice. However, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to a special protectorate status for Sikkim, and it eventually became part of India."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Reading is a good habit, but the problem is, there's too much to read these days, and too little time to read every word of it. There are hundreds of skills to help you read more in less time. Here are two skills that I think are very good. Preview -- if it's long and hard. Previewing is very useful for getting a general idea of heavy reading like long magazine articles and science reports. Here is how to preview. *Read the first two paragraphs and the last two paragraphs carefully. *Then read only the first sentence of the other paragraphs. Previewing doesn't give you all the details. It tells you not to spend time on things you don't really want or need to read. Skim -- if it's short and simple. Skimming is a good way to get a general idea of light reading, like popular magazines or the sports of your daily paper. Here's how to skim. *Get your eyes to move fast. Sweep them across each line. *Pick up only a few key words in each line. Everybody skims differently. You and I may not pick up the same words when we skim the same piece, but perhaps we'll get the same idea of what it's all about. What should we do when we read a science report?

Title: Killer Summer Review: Maggie was not the most loveable person in the world, but was it enough to get her killed? Apparently so; her nude body is found floating near the beach house she, her husband, and his friends time share. No one, not even her husband, mourns her all that much, though everyone is shocked. This, naturally, causes her free floating spirit some consternation. However, liked or not, and even though life is better without Maggie, Zoe is determined to find out who \\"done\\" it.

Touching your ears with unwashed hands can transfer oil and bacteria to the skin, which clogs the pores and causes pimples. Make sure to keep the shell of your ear, your earlobes, and behind your ear cleaned. Shampoo, gel, and other hair products can get on the ear and cause pimples. Use soap and water and clean when you shower or wash your face and hair.  Clean the inside of your ear when needed. Make sure to irrigate the ear with solution and don't use cotton swabs inside your ear. Wipe your ear after every shower. This is when the pores are slightly open, so you can remove excess oil and help reduce blackheads. Another common way of getting ear pimples is through the telephone. Wipe down your cell phone after use. It is especially important to wipe down a telephone if you share it with other people. Since earbuds go into your ears, they can get caked with oil, earwax, and other dirt and grime. When earbuds are out of your ear, they can pick up dirt and other contaminants. When you place them back in your ears, that stuff transfers. Use an alcohol wipe to clean your earbuds after each use. If the pimple is in your external ear, don't use earphones until it is gone. This will aggravate the pimple. Wipe over it with an anti-bacterial wipe, since the pimple could return if your earphones are dirty. If you get ear acne often, your ear is covered with black dots, or you have a zit that is draining fluid, you need to see your doctor. You also should see a doctor if your ear blemish is very painful and lasts longer than a week. They can give you something to help clear it up and determine if the underlying cause is hormonal.

Tusk was re-elected as Prime Minister in the 2011 general election but stepped down three years later to assume the post of President of the European Council. Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz led the party in the 2015 general election but was defeated by the Law and Justice party. On November 16, 2015 Civic Platform government stepped down after exactly 8 years in power. In 2010 Civic Platform candidate Bronisaw Komorowski was elected as President of Poland, but failed in running for re-election in 2015. PO is the second largest party in the Sejm, with 138 seats, and the Senate, with 33 seats. Civic Platform is a member of the European People's Party (EPP).  - Posk is a town in north-central Poland with 22,500 inhabitants (2010).  It is situated in the Masovian Voivodeship (since 1999) at the river Ponka; previously, it was in Ciechanów Voivodeship (197598).  History. Posk gained city rights from the prince Siemowit IV of Masovia some time between 1399 and 1412. In the early twentieth century, the population of 10,000 was equally divided between Poles and Jews. The Jews lived mostly within the city, whilst the Poles were more scattered and tended to live in the countryside. Many of the Jewish residents of Plonsk immigrated to pre-state Israel for Zionist reasons, spurred on by the idea of building a Jewish homeland. In September 1940, Jews from the town and the surrounding areas were imprisoned in a ghetto in harsh conditions. Some of them suffering a typhus epidemic. In total, 12 000 Jews were prisoners and from October 1942, they were sent to Auschwitz extermination camp. A resident who returned to the city in 1962 found that the major synagogue, three Jewish schools and the Jewish cemetery had been destroyed and demolished.  - The President of the European Council (sometimes referred to as the President of the European Union) is a principal representative of the European Union (EU) on the world stage, and the person presiding over and driving forward the work of the European Council. This institution comprises the college of heads of state or government of EU member states as well as the President of the European Commission, and provides political direction to the European Union (EU).   - Warsaw (; see also other names) is the capital and largest city of Poland. It stands on the Vistula River in east-central Poland, roughly from the Baltic Sea and from the Carpathian Mountains. Its population is estimated at 1.750 million residents within a greater metropolitan area of 3.105 million residents, which makes Warsaw the 9th most-populous capital city in the European Union. The city limits cover , while the metropolitan area covers .  - The Second Polish Republic, also known as the Second Commonwealth of Poland or interwar Poland, refers to the country of Poland between the First and Second World Wars (19181939). Officially known as the Republic of Poland or the Commonwealth of Poland, the Polish state was recreated in 1918, in the aftermath of World War I. When, after several regional conflicts, the borders of the state were fixed in 1922, Poland's neighbours were Czechoslovakia, Germany, the Free City of Danzig, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania and the Soviet Union. It had access to the Baltic Sea via a short strip of coastline either side of the city of Gdynia. Between March and August 1939, Poland also shared a border with the then-Hungarian governorate of Subcarpathia. Despite internal and external pressures, it continued to exist until 1939, when Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union and the Slovak Republic, marking the beginning of World War II in Europe. The Second Republic was significantly different in territory to the current Polish state. It included substantially more territory in the east and less in the west.  - Ewa Kopacz (born Ewa Lis; 3 December 1956) is a Polish politician and a former Prime Minister of Poland. Previously she was the Marshal of the Sejm, the first woman to have held the post. In addition, she was Minister of Health from November 2007 until November 2011.

Prior to entering politics, she was a pediatrician and a general practitioner. Her term ended on 16 November 2015.  - The Sejm of the Republic of Poland is the lower house of the Polish parliament. It consists of 460 deputies (posowie, literally \\"envoys\\", in Polish) elected by universal ballot and is presided over by a speaker called the \\"Marshal of the \\"Sejm\\" of the Republic of Poland\\" (\\"Marszaek Sejmu Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej\\"). In the Kingdom of Poland, \\"\\"Sejm\\"\\" referred to the entire three-chamber parliament of Poland, comprising the lower house (the Chamber of Envoys), the upper house (the Senate; Polish: \\"Senat\\") and the King. It was thus a three-estate parliament. Since the Second Polish Republic (19181939), \\"\\"Sejm\\"\\" has referred only to the lower house of the parliament; the upper house is called the \\"Senat Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej\\" (\\"Senate of the Republic of Poland\\").  - Law and Justice (Polish: ), abbreviated to PiS, is a right-wing national-conservative, and Christian democratic political party in Poland.

A transnational organisation, it is composed of other political parties, not individuals. Founded by primarily Christian democratic parties in 1976, it has since broadened its membership to include liberal-conservative parties and parties with other centre-right political perspectives.  - The President of the Council of Ministers (Polish: \\"Prezes Rady Ministrów\\"), colloquially referred to as the Prime Minister of Poland (Polish: \\"Premier Polski\\"), is the leader of the cabinet and the head of government of Poland. The current responsibilities and traditions of the office stem from the creation of the contemporary Polish state (Third Polish Republic), and the office is defined in the Constitution of 1997. According to the Constitution, the President of Poland nominates and appoints the prime minister, who will then propose the composition of the cabinet. Fourteen days following his or her appointment, the prime minister must submit a programme outlining the government's agenda to the Sejm, requiring a vote of confidence. The office of the prime minister is generally considered the most powerful post in Polish politics, with the presidency considered largely as a symbolic office. However, conflicts stemming from both interest and conflicting powers have arisen between the two offices in the past.  - Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who is the client Dr. Cy Kosis joins on the couch?, using the article: The Goofy Gophers are about to harvest the vegetables on the farm when the farmhands beat them to the punch. Worried that their food source is being \\"vandalized,\\" they follow the truck to the barn so they can recover what they consider to be their food. However, they spot the guard dog and realize that if he were to awaken and spot them stealing the vegetables, he would cause them trouble. The Gophers spend most of the rest of the cartoon using psychological weardown tactics to drive Barnyard Dawg insane and remove him as a threat to their well-being. A deadpan pig watches as the dog is repeatedly the victim of the Gophers' pranks, and can only shake his head as the dog's psyche is broken down. Meanwhile, the pooch tries to convince himself that all that is going on is nothing but a bad dream (consulting Sigmund Fraud and using sleeping pills to laugh off each attempt). In the end, the Gophers get rid of their foe for good by tying a harness around the sleeping Barnyard Dawg's belly, then attaching it to a hot air balloon before launching it (getting a tear in at as it goes up), leaving them free to \\"raise their vegetables\\" into a long pipe leading from the barn to their burrow. Meanwhile, the balloon's hull leaks out completely, and the dog awakens atop a light pole. After he wakes up and realising his surroundings, Barnyard Dawg mentally snaps and begins to fly!

Background: Booker T Huffman was born the youngest of eight children, in Houston Texas. By the time Booker was 13, both of his parents had died and he lived with his 16-year-old sister. He would move in with his older brother Lash \\"Stevie Ray\\" Huffman at age 17. In high school, Booker was a drum major. Context: Booker and his brother Stevie Ray signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) after Sid Vicious recommended they sign with the company. In August 1993, they debuted as the tag team Harlem Heat, with Booker renamed Kole and Lash renamed Kane. They became heels and were on Harley Race and Col. Rob Parker's team in the WarGames match at Fall Brawl on September 19 against Sting, Davey Boy Smith, Dustin Rhodes, and The Shockmaster. They lost the match but were over as heels because of the caliber of faces they wrestled.  In 1994, they acquired the services of Sensational Sherri, dubbed 'Sister' Sherri, as their manager and changed their names back to Booker T and Stevie Ray, at their request. By the end of 1994, they held the WCW Tag Team Championship after defeating Stars and Stripes (The Patriot and Marcus Alexander Bagwell) in December. After dropping the title to The Nasty Boys, Harlem Heat regained the belts on June 24, 1995.  Afterward, Harlem Heat got into a feud with Col. Parker's \\"Stud Stable\\" of \\"Dirty\\" Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck. Parker and Sherri were carrying on a love affair and Parker eventually left the Stud Stable in favor of the Heat to be with Sherri. Harlem Heat won the WCW World Tag Team titles at Fall Brawl 1995, defeating Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck. Their third title reign only lasted one day, but the duo regained the tag team title nine days later from The American Males (Buff Bagwell and Scotty Riggs). On the June 24, 1996 Nitro, Harlem Heat defeated Lex Luger and Sting to capture their fifth WCW World Tag Team titles.  Three days after losing the tag team titles to the Steiner Brothers, Harlem Heat regained the titles back from the Steiners on July 27. On September 23, Booker T and Stevie Ray were defeated by Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge) but took the titles back for the seventh time on October 1.  They lost the Tag Team Championship to the Outsiders (Kevin Nash and Scott Hall) on October 27. Subsequently, they fired Col. Parker and beat him up and became full-fledged faces. They then entered into a brief feud against Col. Parker's newest team The Amazing French Canadians, a feud they won. In 1997, they feuded with Public Enemy (Grunge & Rocco), The Steiners, and the nWo. In fall 1997, they fired Sherri and added a new manager, Jacqueline. They were briefly put out of action by the nWo and returned to feud with the Faces of Fear (Meng and The Barbarian). Stevie then took five months off from WCW to recover from an ankle injury and Jacqueline left for the WWF. Question: Who were they facing? Answer:","output":"Throughout their time in WCW, Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) faced several prominent tag teams and wrestlers. Here are some of the notable feuds and opponents they faced: 1.

Born in 1924, Rajkumari Dubey, often simply credited as Rajkumari, was a prolific singer in the Indian film industry from the 1930s through the 1970s. She's known for her distinctive and emotive voice, and has delivered numerous iconic songs in her career. Although she started her career with acting, she gained much more recognition and fame as a playback singer. Besides her memorable songs, her collaboration with leading musicians and singers of her time made her one of the respected figures in the Hindi film music world. Rajkumari Dubey worked extensively with music director Anil Biswas, who helped her develop her singing style. She also sang for many films with music by Khemchand Prakash, and she was one of the favorite singers of music director Naushad. Despite her contribution to Indian cinema, her work is often overshadowed by that of her contemporaries, such as Lata Mangeshkar, who dominated the music industry during that period.

One such Green Lantern, Abin Sur of Sector 2814, defeated the malevolent being Parallax and imprisoned him in the Lost Sector on the desolate planet Ryut.

In the film itself, which is set in a secluded family farm, the mother suffers a psychotic break down due to postpartum depression and after her husband, a truck driver, hits the road again after only being home a day. It's all too much for her and she snaps, begins to break things in the middle of dinner. She then calmly walks away with the baby to the upstairs bedroom. Jimmy, the eldest son, trying to keep his younger brother and sister calm, starts cleaning up, but soon he decides to check on his mother and discovers the horrible truth. His baby brother is dead, and she's preparing to take care of the rest of her kids. Now hope for the family's survival rests on the shoulder of Jimmy, the eldest son and surrogate man of the house.

Paragraph: Life for the partners of Cates, Katalinic & Lund holds little of the glamour one might expect from a career in law. Instead of lunches at Lut��ce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \\"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \\"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas.

The first sensible lesson is that you shouldn't bother trying to find your way in the dark at all, but just stay put until dawn. Because then you won't trip over things? No, mainly because you'll have an idea of direction. The sun rises in the east. But you will be amazed at how many people forget they know that. Apparently, the area underneath a holly bush provides a good makeshift shelter -- they are thick, and evergreen. The next thing to do -- or rather not to do -- is panic, for the obvious reason that unless there is someone there to hear you scream, it will get you nowhere. Just try to think of nice, happy things. There is always a point in films when a person who is lost in the desert or the snow, dehydrated  and exhausted, comes across a set of their own footprints and realizes they have just walked in a huge, round circle. It is wrong to owe it to the unequal strengths or different lengths of your legs. Experiments prove that, without the sun or the moon (or landmarks) as a fixed guide, lots of small errors add up over time so the brain can't correctly identify the \\"straight ahead\\" direction. To just get out of somewhere, pick a spot on the horizon and just head for it. There are several ways to find directions in the dark, and by far the best is to establish north using the stars.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this \\"Don't get thrown into the friend zone. Gain her respect. Laugh at her jokes. Liven up your appearance. Be approachable.\\"","output":"Title: Beyond the 'Friend Zone': Gaining Respect, Fostering Laughter, and Enhancing Appearance Establishing a solid connection with a person you're attracted to is an exceptional endeavor, but it can backfire quite unexpectedly when you are confined into the so-called 'friend zone'. The friend zone, a term widely used amongst millennials and Gen Z, is a predicament where one individual in a platonic relationship wishes to enter into a romantic relationship while the other does not. The encapsulating struggle is real – and for many, it can be a crushing reality to accept. However, escaping the friend zone is not an impossible mission. It's all about injecting respect, generating laughter, renovating your appearance, and being approachable. Let's break it down. First and foremost, gaining her respect is an absolute prerequisite in any budding relationship – romantic or otherwise. Respect acts as a cornerstone that paves the way for mutual understanding and shared values. Show genuine interest in her preferences, listen attentively to her stories, and acknowledge her opinions. Make it clear that you appreciate her not just as a romantic interest, but as an individual person with unique perspectives and experiences. This engenders a sense of respect and admiration, which can often be a stepping stone to deeper emotional connections outside of friendship. Humor is an invaluable tool in romantic relationships. By laughing at her jokes, you not only show that you enjoy her company, but also that you value her wit and sense of humor. Sharing a good laugh creates a bond, dissolves barriers, and allows for a deeper sense of connection. Meaningful conversation paired with playful banter can often lead to increasing affection. However, the key is to laugh genuinely and not just for the sake of it. Forced laughter always backfires, leading to awkward moments and denying genuine connection. They say the first impression is the last impression, and indeed, your appearance plays a vital role here. An elevated appearance doesn't necessarily mean wearing branded clothes or expensive accessories. It's about presenting yourself as an individual who understands and projects personal style and hygiene. Dress neatly, maintain good grooming, and most importantly, feel comfortable in what you're wearing. Your appearance should speak volumes about your personality, portraying you as dynamic, confident, and aware of your own style. Being approachable involves a blend of good communication skills and the right body language. Maintain eye contact when talking to show that you’re genuinely interested in her. Use open body language to exhibit a welcoming persona. Pay attention to your tone and volume when conversing, ensuring you're polite and respectful. Encourage her to express herself freely, and respond with empathy and understanding. Being approachable means you're an easy person to talk to, suggesting a potential partner rather than just a friend. Navigating the path from being 'just friends' to something more can be a tricky endeavor. It requires a balance of respect, humor, smart appearance, and approachability. The journey requires patience, understanding, and the ability to accept that not every friendship is meant to turn into a romantic relationship. However, by emphasizing these core traits, you're undoubtedly positioned for success, whether that leads to romance or a deep, respectful friendship that's rewarding in its own right."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But why stop there? On March 7, it launched Cool Ranch Dorito Locos Tacos. The slogan? “Collect All Two.” “We believe we can add 2,000 new restaurants in the next 10 years, because what we have is proprietary and exclusive. Nobody else can make a Cool Ranch Doritos Taco. And that’s just in the U.S.,” Creed told the Beast. Creed was traveling today and unavailable to talk to ABC News, a spokesman said. Taco Bell is part of Yum! Brands, Inc., based in Louisville, Ky.

News article: All-Pro CB Darrelle Revis, Jets agree to terms on new deal The All-Pro cornerback and the New York Jets agreed in principle to a four-year contract Sunday night, reaching a deal a week before the team's season opener. The Jets wouldn't disclose financial terms, but the Daily News reported it was worth 46 million, including 32 million guaranteed. \\"Barring something unforeseen, we expect Darrelle to be here (Monday),\\" general manager Mike Tannenbaum said during a conference call early Monday morning. THE HUDDLE: Ramifications of Revis deal Revis planned to fly from his home in South Florida to New Jersey on Monday, and is expected to finalize the deal and end a 36-day holdout. \\"This is an intermediate step to what we hope is an entire career of Darrelle as a Jet,\\" Tannenbaum said, \\"for him to retire a Jet, for him to hopefully go to the Hall of Fame one day as a Jet and for him to be in our ring of honor.\\" Revis, who made no public statements about the sometimes acrimonious negotiations since minicamp in June, used his Twitter account to thank his family and agents, Neil Schwartz and Jonathan Feinsod. \\"To my family, neil, & john I love u guys I'm comin home baby!!!\\" Revis wrote. \\"Revis Island LET'S GO.\\" Both owner Woody Johnson and coach Rex Ryan flew down to South Florida on Saturday and met with Revis, mother Diana Gilbert, and uncle and former NFL player Sean Gilbert over the weekend to try to help get a deal done. \\"I think that was an important step in the process, but there was still obviously more work to be done,\\" Tannenbaum said. \\"We spent all day looking at it and probably about (11 p.m. Sunday), we made a very significant breakthrough to finding a landing spot that was good for both sides.\\" Ryan was scheduled to have a conference call with reporters Saturday night to discuss the Jets' roster cutdown, but Tannenbaum handled it instead. A team spokesman said Ryan was unavailable because he was at an \\"appointment.\\" That turned out to be a visit with the man whom Ryan has repeatedly called the best cornerback in the NFL. The new contract means Revis will likely be back on the field in time for the opener next Monday night against Baltimore at the New Meadowlands Stadium. \\"That'll be Rex's call,\\" Tannenbaum said. The general manager said he \\"had no idea\\" what corresponding roster move the Jets would make once Revis was signed, sealed and delivered. \\"I'm sure Rex will be able to figure out what to do to get Darrelle on the team,\\" Tannenbaum quipped. Revis' holdout began Aug. 1, when the team reported for training camp in Cortland. Tannenbaum said the nearly 600,000 in fines Revis accrued for sitting out would be handled internally by the team. He was scheduled to make 1 million in the fourth year of his six-year rookie deal, but said he wanted to become the league's highest-paid cornerback. While he didn't get that this time around, he's getting the guaranteed money he sought during negotiations over the last several months. With NFL Films cameras following the Jets all summer for HBO's Hard Knocks series, Revis' holdout was a major story line without him ever appearing in an episode. He'll certainly be a major focus in Wednesday night's series finale, especially since Tannenbaum acknowledged he wasn't sure the deal would ever get done and said the Jets looked into trades over the weekend for other cornerbacks. \\"This was one of those things where I really wasn't optimistic,\\" Tannenbaum said. \\"I really wasn't. I'm an optimist by nature, but this was really hard. There was a lot of heavy lifting, a lot of work put into it.\\" Since early August, the team and Revis' agents agreed to keep all negotiations confidential after things got testy through the media. There were some accusations made by both sides, with Johnson saying he was \\"rebuffed\\" by Revis' agents when he asked if he could be part of a meeting at the Roscoe Diner in Roscoe, N.Y.. Schwartz responded by saying that was \\"a blatant lie\\" and that Johnson was given \\"incorrect\\" information. He also said he'd meet Johnson \\"any time, any place.\\" Ryan even got into it, suggesting he give the team a day off from practice so the entire organization could sit down with Revis, his agents and anyone else the star player wanted in an effort to complete a deal. Then came a code of silence from both sides — and the fear that Revis could sit out the entire season, as his uncle once did. In the end, though, Revis will be back with the team in time to begin a season Ryan and the Jets are convinced will be special. \\"I'm happy, I'm relieved,\\" Tannenbaum said. \\"Obviously, Darrelle's a great player. He's our guy and he's an important piece to what we're trying to accomplish here. ... I don't think anyone wanted it to take as long as it did, but it did. Now, we can put it behind us and move on to Baltimore.\\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Weather Report was an American jazz fusion band of the 1970s and early 1980s. The band was initially co-led by the Austrian-born keyboard player Joe Zawinul, the American saxophonist Wayne Shorter and Czech bassist Miroslav Vitous. Due to creative and financial disagreements, Vitous left the band after a few years. Zawinul took increasing control and steered the band towards a more funk, R&B oriented sound. On the recommendation of Michal Urbaniak, Zawinul and Shorter recruited the 23-year-old drummer Omar Hakim, a talented session player and multi-instrumentalist, who had played with a variety of musicians (including Mike Mainieri, David Bowie, and Carly Simon). Hakim was immediately entrusted with recruiting the rest of the new rhythm section. Having failed to secure Marcus Miller as bass guitarist, he selected Victor Bailey (a recent graduate from the Berklee College of Music, with whom Hakim had played while backing Miriam Makeba). Hakim also recruited percussion/concertina player Jose Rossy, with whom he had worked in Labelle.  The new Weather Report went straight onto tour. The music developed on tour was later recorded for the 1983 album Procession, which showed the band beginning to make something of a return to the \\"world music\\", which it had pioneered in the mid-1970s, and featured a cameo appearance from The Manhattan Transfer.  Continuing with the same lineup, Weather Report recorded the Domino Theory album in 1984, with Hakim stepping into Jaco Pastorius' old role as Zawinul's co-producer. The album was Weather Report's first album to employ drum machines and samplers (the Emulator), furthering developing the band's involvement with technology, and also featured a guest vocal from Carl Anderson. The band was beginning to suffer from the revival of more traditionally styled jazz at the time, which made it harder to market jazz fusion.  Percussionist and singer Mino Cinelu replaced Rossy in the spring of 1984 and appeared on the band's video release Live in Japan (reissued on DVD in 2007). The same lineup played on 1985's Sportin' Life album, which included a cover of Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On\\" and appearances by Bobby McFerrin and Carl Anderson. In keeping with Zawinul's technological curiosity, the album heralded the arrival of MIDI, which allowed him to rapidly and inexpensively write, demonstrate, and record music via a set of synthesizers.  By the time of the release of Sportin' Life Shorter and Zawinul had opted not to tour the material. Instead, they took a break for long-delayed solo projects.

Some tweets using the #ReutersReplyAllGate hashtag expressed frustration at the hundreds of reply-all emails asking people to stop replying to all, while others used the chaos to grab their 15 minutes of fame (being listed in the \\"to\\" field) and laugh at the inherent inanity of it all. \\"Should I just start live tweeting every single reply?\\" one recipient wondered, while another called for extraordinary assistance, imploring, \\"Any Super Hero currently in the U.S. Your help is needed to stop this email chain.\\" But as the debacle continues to generate fresh reply-all emails this morning, what's happened to poor Vince?

He sent an email to 33,000 people who all worked at the same place, a company named Thomson Reuters. Just imagine sending a letter to everyone in your school, including all the teachers and students, even the janitor and the principal, by mistake! Just how a small pebble tossed in a lake causes ripples that spread far and wide, Vince's little accident caused lots of reactions. All those people started receiving this unexpected email and their computers began working extra hard, just like when you have to pick up your toys really fast because it's time for bed.  And guess what those 33,000 people did then? They all began clicking 'reply all' on Vince's email, telling others to stop replying to everyone. It turned into a funny loop! Imagine if you say “stop shouting” by shouting yourself, isn't that funny? Some people thought it was super funny and took to Twitter, an online place where people share quick thoughts or jokes, to share about this funny event with the hashtag #ReutersReplyAllGate. A hashtag is like a label or sticker that helps people find all the messages about the same topic.  Some of these people even tried to act like superstars and used the situation to draw attention to themselves. It's like seeing a rainbow during a rainstorm and running to tell all your friends about it, just so you can be the one who spotted it.  One person even joked about writing a tweet for each reply they got on the email. Imagine if you tried to draw every bird you saw flying in the sky, you would have a whole book of bird drawings in no time! Another person asked if there was a superhero who could come and stop all the emails, just like when you wish for a magical cleaning fairy to tidy up your room. But while all this was going on, some people wondered: what happened to Vince, the man who accidentally started all this in the first place? One person even shared a message hoping that Vince was okay, using the same hashtag #ReutersReplyAllGate and another one #prayforvince.

I absolutely had to write a review for the Sunny Side Café after my recent visit – it was such an outstanding experience from beginning to end! I visited the café last Sunday for brunch with a group of friends, and despite the busy hour, we received a warm welcome from the staff. They quickly escorted us to a cozy, sunlit table by the window. I must mention the ambiance first – the delightful interior, with its eclectic mix of modern and rustic vibes, made for a perfect setting to enjoy a leisurely meal with friends. The soft music playing in the background added to the overall pleasant atmosphere. Now, let's talk about the menu – it was extensive and thoughtfully curated, offering something for everyone, from decadent French toast for those with a sweet tooth to fresh avocado toast and kale salad for the health-conscious. The fact that they accommodate dietary restrictions and allergies was a big plus for one of my vegan friends. We started off by ordering a round of fresh-squeezed orange juice and some delightful mimosas. I couldn't have been happier with my choice of the eggs Benedict Classic, which featured perfectly poached eggs, smoked ham, and a heavenly Hollandaise sauce. The accompanying hash browns were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, just the way I like them. One of my friends raved about the shakshuka – a Mediterranean dish made with poached eggs, tomatoes, and sautéed vegetables, served with warm naan bread. The freshness and quality of the ingredients truly shined through in every dish we tried. What really set Sunny Side Café apart for me, though, was the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff. Our server, Samantha, was knowledgeable about the menu and made excellent recommendations for those of us having trouble deciding on a dish. She frequently checked in on us and refilled our drinks with a genuine smile that made us feel truly valued as customers. Lastly, the pace of the meal was just right – even during their busy brunch service, we never felt rushed. We had ample time to enjoy our delicious food and each other's company in the cozy atmosphere they provided. In conclusion, I cannot recommend Sunny Side Café enough for anyone searching for a delightful brunch experience – it offers a wonderful combination of delicious food, attentive service, and a cozy ambiance.

The game started when the 49ers attempted an onside kick, recovered by the Jets.  Later, the 49ers went up first as Shaun Hill completed a pass to Jason Hill that was fumbled at the goal line and recovered by offensive tackle Joe Staley for the touchdown.  Then, Brett Favre ran for a 2-yard touchdown.  The 49ers retook the lead as Shaun Hill completed a touchdown screen pass to Frank Gore.  After half-time, Thomas Jones plowed through the 49ers secondary to get a 17-yard score. On the ensuing 49ers possession, a Shaun Hill touchdown pass to Delanie Walker was called back, and the 49ers settled for a Joe Nedney 32-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the 49ers cemented their lead when Shaun Hill completed a 3-yard touchdown pass to a diving Bryant Johnson.  The Jets had enough time to make a late comeback, but a Brett Favre deep pass was intercepted by Walt Harris.  The 49ers ran down the clock and punted, and the Jets did not have sufficient time to attempt the comeback. The 49ers fumbled the ball a total of 5 times, although, fortunately for them, only one was lost. With the win, the 49ers improved to 5-8.

Everyone in our group (15) agreed to look for a different venue for next years event. Choose from: (i) negative (ii) positive","output":"The given review can be classified as (i) negative. Now, let's examine the reasons that make this review negative by analyzing its content: 1. The first statement in the review is \\"Would not recommend this place.\\" This clearly states the reviewer's negative sentiment towards the establishment as they are directly stating that they cannot recommend it to others. A positive review typically starts with a recommendation or praise for the service or product. 2. The second sentence mentions \\"arrogant management\\" and \\"mediocre food,\\" both of which have a negative connotation. The use of the word \\"arrogant\\" implies that the reviewer had a bad experience with management, who may have displayed a condescending or unprofessional attitude. Additionally, by calling the food \\"mediocre,\\" the reviewer means that it is of average or low quality, which further emphasizes the negative nature of the review. 3. The review then describes how the group of 15-20 people visited this place annually for the past few years following the Crazy Legs run event in Madison. This detail reveals that the reviewer has given the establishment multiple chances, but despite these apparent repeated visits, they express dissatisfaction with their experience, reinforcing the negative sentiment. 4. The final sentence mentions that \\"Everyone in our group (15) agreed to look for a different venue for next year's event.\\" This emphasizes a collective negative sentiment among the members of the group who visited the place. The fact that the entire group agreed to find an alternative venue for their next gathering is a strong statement against the establishment, indicating serious dissatisfaction. Taking all these points into consideration, it is evident that the review holds a negative sentiment towards the establishment. The reviewer clearly expressed dissatisfaction in multiple ways, including the management's behavior, the quality of food, and the decision of the group to seek another venue for their annual event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Berkeley campus during the period of the student anti-war movements. Teenagers Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are shown caught on the campus during a riot between students and police. They flee and after finding safety, Jobs states to Wozniak, \\"Those guys think they're revolutionaries. They're not revolutionaries, we are.\\" Wozniak then comments that \\"Steve was never like you or me. He always saw things differently. Even when I was in Berkeley, I would see something and just see kilobytes or circuit boards while he'd see karma or the meaning of the universe. Using a similar structure, the film next turns to a young Bill Gates at Harvard University, in the early 1970s, with classmate Steve Ballmer (John DiMaggio), and Gatesâ high school friend Paul Allen (Josh Hopkins). As with Wozniak in the earlier segment, Ballmer narrates Gates' story, particularly the moment when Gates discovers the existence of Ed Roberts's MITS Altair causing him to drop out of Harvard. Gates' and Allen's early work with MITS is juxtaposed against the involvement of Jobs and Wozniak with the \\"Homebrew Computer Club\\".

The portraits include Cardinal-Elector Albert of Mainz; Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony; the humanist scholar Willibald Pirckheimer; Philipp Melanchthon, and Erasmus of Rotterdam. For those of the Cardinal, Melanchthon, and Durer's final major work, a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician Ulrich Starck, Durer depicted the sitters in profile, perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach. Despite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education, Durer was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend Willibald Pirckheimer, whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images. He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with Erasmus and other scholars. Durer succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime. \\"The Four Books on Measurement\\" were published at Nuremberg in 1525 and was the first book for adults on mathematics in German, as well as being cited later by Galileo and Kepler. The other, a work on city fortifications, was published in 1527. \\"The Four Books on Human Proportion\\" were published posthumously, shortly after his death in 1528.

A man in a Paris hospital who needs blood, a woman in Mexico who was injured in an earthquake, and a family in India that lost their home in a storm may all be aided by the Red Cross. The Red Cross exists in almost every country around the world. The world Red Cross organizations are sometimes called the Red Crescent, the Red Mogen Daid, the Sun, and the Red Lion. All of these agencies share a common goal of trying to help people in need. The idea of forming an organization to help the sick and wounded during a war started with Jean Henri Dunant. In 1859, he observed how people were suffering on a battlefield in Italy. He wanted to help all the wounded people regardless of which side they were fighting for. The most important result of his work was an international treaty called the Geneva Convention . It protects prisoners of war, the sick and wounded, and other citizens during a war. The American Red Cross was set up by Clara Barton in 1881. Today the Red Cross in the United States provides a number of services for the public, such as helping people in need, teaching first aid and providing blood.

This article: Ferrier gave her first London recital on 28 December 1942 at the National Gallery, in a lunch-time concert organised by Dame Myra Hess. Although she wrote \\"went off very well\\" in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \\"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\\". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \\"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\\". Ferrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance. This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \\"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\\" Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo's aria Che farò (\\"What is life\\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca. At Glyndebourne, Ferrier's limited acting abilities caused some difficulties in her relationship with the conductor, Fritz Stiedry; nevertheless her performance on the first night, 19 June 1947, attracted warm critical praise.Ferrier's association... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person for whom Roy said her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat?, what is it ?","output":"The last name of the person for whom Roy said her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat is Ferrier."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The money, sent on behalf of South Africa, was meant to be used for its Caribbean diaspora legacy programme. But documents suggest Mr Warner used the payment for cash withdrawals, personal loans and to launder money. The 72-year-old, who has been indicted by the US FBI for corruption, denies all claims of wrongdoing. Fifa says it is co-operating with the investigation. And South Africa's Football Association has issued a detailed statement denying any wrongdoing. The papers seen by the BBC detail three wire transfers by Fifa. In the three transactions - on 4 January, 1 February and 10 March 2008 - funds totalling 10m (Â£6.5m) from Fifa accounts were received into Concacaf accounts controlled by Jack Warner. At the time, he was in charge of the body, which governs football in North and Central America and the Caribbean. The money had been promised by South Africa's Football Association for its so-called diaspora legacy programme to develop football in the Caribbean. The documents reveal how the money was spent and moved around. JTA Supermarkets, a large chain in Trinidad, received 4,860,000 from the accounts. The money was paid in instalments from January 2008 to March 2009. The largest payment was 1,350,000 paid in February 2008. US prosecutors say the money was mostly paid back to Mr Warner in local currency. Jack Warner: The US charge sheet Key questions answered Jack Warner: Controversial ex-Fifa chief Who are the indicted officials? Fifa in crisis - Special Reports The BBC gave details of its investigation to Brent Sancho, Trinidad and Tobago's sports minister and a former footballer. He said: \\"He [Mr Warner] must face justice, he must answer all of these questions. Justice has to be served. \\"He will have to account, with this investigation, he will have to answer for his actions.\\" The documents also show 360,000 of the Fifa money was withdrawn by people connected to Mr Warner. Nearly 1.6m was used to pay the former Fifa vice-president's credit cards and personal loans. The documents show the largest personal loan Mr Warner provided for himself was 410,000. The largest credit card payment was 87,000. Mr Sancho says he is now angry and disappointed. \\"I'm devastated because a lot of that money should have been back in football, back in the development of children playing the sport. \\"It is a travesty. Mr Warner should answer the questions,\\" he added. Jack Warner is one of 14 people charged by US prosecutors over alleged corruption at Fifa. The US Justice department alleges the 14 accepted bribes and kickbacks estimated at more than 150m (Â£97m) over a 24-year period. Mr Warner denies all charges of corruption. He resigned from Fifa's executive committee and all other football commitments in 2011 amid allegations he had bribed his Caribbean associates. He later stepped down as Trinidad and Tobago's security minister amid a fraud inquiry. A key figure in the deepening scandal, in a recent statement he said he had given lawyers documents outlining the links between Fifa, its funding, himself and the 2010 election in Trinidad and Tobago. He said the transactions also included Mr Blatter. \\"I will no longer keep secrets for them who actively seek to destroy the country,\\" he said in an address on Trinidadian TV last week entitled \\"The gloves are off\\". Speaking to his supporters at a rally later the same day, he promised an \\"avalanche\\" of revelations to come. Mr Warner, who faces extradition to the US, was released on bail after handing himself in to police in the Trinidad and Tobago capital Port of Spain last week. He says he is an innocent scapegoat who will  soon reveal the truth of what happened inside Fifa.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Determine the sentiment: One of the most popular rentals at my local video store is not Borat or The Departed but a 2005 documentary about Jesus Christ called The God Who Wasn't There by director Brian Flemming, an ex-Christian Fundamentalist. Flemming, in his 62-minute documentary, asserts that Jesus was not a historical figure but a legend based solely on Pagan traditions. Using interviews with authors, philosophers, and historians to debunk the long-held Christian belief that Jesus, the son of God, lived among men, was crucified, and was resurrected, Flemming compares the Christ story with those of cult figures Isis and Osiris in Egypt, Dionysus and Adonis in Greek mythology, and Roman mystery cults such as Mithraism and finds many surprising similarities. In addition to his evidence about Pagan cults, he also states that the earliest sources for the Christ story, the four gospels, were written forty or fifty years after the date given for Jesus' crucifixion and that the letters of St. Paul show little evidence of Jesus being a flesh and blood figure. Flemming, unfortunately however, is not out to conduct a solid investigation of the truth about Jesus' life but to use the subject only as a point of departure for a full throttle attack on Christianity and all religion. Most of the interviews are with those philosophically aligned with the director including avowed atheists such as Biologist Richard Dawkins and author Sam Price. The only Christians interviewed are those on the fringe such as Scott Butcher, the creator of the website Rapture Letters.com, and Ronald Sipus, principal of the fundamentalist Village Christian School, which Flemming attended as a boy. Like Michael Moore's interview of Charlton Heston in Bowling for Columbine, his interview with Sipus is so contentious that Sipus walks out in the middle. In a sarcastic tone, Flemming tells us how wrong Christianity was wrong about the sun revolving around the earth, then points to atrocities committed in the name of Christianity such as those by cult leader Charles Manson who killed 11 people and Dena Schlosser, who cut her baby's arm off for God. He also lifts a statement from a book by LaHaye and Jenkins that says that Christians \\"look forward to the day when all non-Christians are thrown into a lake of fire, howling and screeching.\\" To further turn us against Christianity, Flemming shows us extended clips from Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, detailing in minute detail each scene of violence and torture. What could have been a serious discussion on a very interesting subject eventually becomes a childish rant and a polemic against all religion. In the process of condemning those who used Christianity to commit unspeakable acts, he ignores such people as socialist Muriel Lester, a famous Christian pacifist, Rigoberta Menchú Tum, a Mayan Indian of Guatemala who helped found the Revolutionary Christians and received the Nobel peace prize in recognition of her work for social justice, and Mother Teresa, whose work was about respect for each individual's worth and dignity. His most telling argument is his comparison of Christian doctrine with the Pagan cults and he makes some good points, yet Flemming does not tell us that while some aspects of these cults may resemble Christian doctrines, there are no texts or source materials for these cults before 300AD, long after the New Testament. Also it is important to note one major difference. The immediate goal of the initiates was a mystical experience that led them to feel they had achieved union with their god. This is anathema to Christianity which believes that a Church hierarchy including priests and bishops all the way up to the Pope are required to interpret God's will to mankind. Although I am not a Christian and have some doubts about whether or not Jesus Christ was in fact a historical figure, the truth is that, in the long scheme of things, it may not matter. What matters is that a message was introduced to mankind and spread around the world that contributed to mankind's spiritual evolution. Regardless of the distortions and crimes later committed in its name and there were many, Christianity as conceived was a doctrine of compassion and love, and a moral and ethical code that furthered respect for our fellow man. While I applaud the fact that the film was made and that a taboo topic was discussed, what is sorely needed is not another divisive attempt to use religion as a field of combat but to see it as a common thread that can bring the world's people together. While there is room for debate and discussion on religious subjects, in the words of Annie Besant, \\"spiritual truths are best seen in the clear air of brotherhood and mutual respect. The God Who Wasn't There is recommended only for those whose idea of a good time is to trash the religion of others.","output":"The sentiment of this text is mostly negative and critical. It talks about a documentary that tries to prove Jesus was not a real person, but the writer feels that the documentary is not a fair investigation and focuses more on attacking Christianity and other religions, rather than having a serious discussion about the topic. The writer believes it is important for people to respect each other's beliefs and have a positive conversation about religion, instead of using it as a way to fight or criticize others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. Question: Who is Annie Dillard? Options:  A. A great writer  B. not enough information  C. A poet  D.

To do this, we first want to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation (-1089) by adding 1089 to both sides of the equation. This will give us: 126*m - 1089 + 1089 = -207 + 1089 Which simplifies to: 126*m = 882 Step 2: Now, we need to isolate 'm' by dividing both sides by the coefficient of 'm' (which is 126): 126*m / 126 = 882 / 126 This simplifies to: m = 7 So the solution to the equation 126*m - 1089 = -207 is m = 7."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim.

Zane attempts to tell his former coworker, Calvin (Richard Schiff), but finds he has just died suspiciously from carbon monoxide poisoning. Zane travels to Mexico and finds the radio station was burnt to the ground. Searching the local area, he comes across a new power plant. There, he helps climatologist Ilana Green (Lindsay Crouse) protect her atmospheric analysis equipment from the plant's overzealous security forces. Ilana explains that the Earth's temperature has recently risen several degrees, melting the polar ice. She is investigating the power plant, one of several recently built, that appears to be the cause of this increase. The two are released, but without Ilana's equipment.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: How often do people who are conditioned to prefer a calorie-dense diet probably eat high salt foods? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"People who are conditioned to prefer a calorie-dense diet probably eat high salt foods frequently. This is because high salt foods are often found in processed and fast foods, which are calorie-dense. Additionally, the preference for salty and fatty foods is associated with higher overall calorie consumption and uncontrolled eating patterns. Therefore, it is likely that individuals who prefer a calorie-dense diet would also consume high salt foods on a regular basis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer??","output":"To solve this problem, it's a good idea to break it down into individual steps in order to avoid any potential mistakes. Here is the step by step solution: 1. The equation given is -53209006 = -44*m - 53206278 2. We want to isolate the variable 'm', so first we need to move the constant number on the right hand side of equation to the left. We do this by adding 53206278 to both sides of the equation    -53209006 + 53206278 = -44*m - 53206278 + 53206278     Once we simplify this step, our equation looks like:    -2728 = -44m 3. After simplifying, we still need to isolate m. To do this, we'll need to divide both sides by -44 (since -44 is the coefficient of m)    -2728 / -44 = -44m / -44      Further simplification gives us:        m = 62 Hence, m = 62 is the solution for the given equation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: The old saying that practice makes perfect seems to make no sense when it comes to schoolwork. Many educators today are looking for evidence to support the case for homework, but are coming up empty-handed. Mary Jane Cera is the academic administrator for the Kino School, and she maintains a no-homework policy across all grades. The purpose of the policy is to make sure learning remains a joy, not a thing that discourages social time and creative activity. At the Kino school, Cera says children often choose to take their favorite parts of school home. \\"A lot of what we see kids doing is practicing music with their friends, and taking experiments home to show their parents,\\" she says. Surveys of Kino graduates suggest that the early control they are given over their education continues to serve them well into college. \\"One of the reasons that we continue to assign much homework is our obsession   with tests, although we can agree on the importance of kids doing better on tests through proper homework to some degree,\\"says author Alfie Kohn. In his book The Homework Myth, Kohn points out that no study has ever found a relation between homework and academic achievement and that if kids have no choice in the matter of homework, they're not really exercising judgment, and are instead losing their sense of self-control. However, many supporters of homework argue that life is filled with things we don't like to do, and that homework teaches self-discipline, time management and other non-academic life skills. Wherever the homework debate goes next, it's worth taking a moment to examine if we're doing the right thing about our children's education. The good news is -- it's never too late to start.

Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful.  Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice.

By nature he meant matter animated by \\"the Divine breath\\"; i.e., he was an animist. Following Broca's lead, Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology to differentiate man from \\"the animals nearest to him\\". He stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by experimentation. The history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison. It is to be presumed fundamentally that the species, man, is a unity, and that \\"the same laws of thought are applicable to all men\\".

But tropical palm trees once flourished there. An intense warming phase occurred 52 million years ago, leading tropical vegetation, including palms and relatives of today's tropical Baobab trees, to grow on the continent’s now frozen coasts. The surprising discovery came from a study of drill cores obtained from the seafloor near Antarctica. The results, published in the journal Nature, show that warm ocean currents and high carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the air boosted temperatures, allowing tropical vegetation to grow where visitors today meet only icebergs and freezing cold. \\"The CO2 content of the atmosphere as assumed for that time interval is not enough on its own to explain the almost tropical conditions in the Antarctic,\\" said Jörg Pross, a paleoclimatologist at the Goethe University and member of the Biodiversity and Climate Research Center in Frankfurt, Germany. \\"Another important factor was the transfer of heat via warm ocean currents that reached Antarctica.\\" When the warm ocean current collapsed and the Antarctic coast came under the influence of cooler ocean currents, the tropical rainforests, palm trees and Baobab relatives also disappeared. The scientists used rock samples from drill cores on the seabed obtained off the coast of Wilkes Land, Antarctica, as part of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP). The samples are between 53 and 46 million years old and contain fossil pollen and spores that are known to originate from the Antarctic coastal region. The researchers were thus able to reconstruct the local vegetation on Antarctica and, accordingly, interpret the presence of tropical and subtropical rainforests covering the coastal region 52 million years ago. The scientists' evaluations show that the winter temperatures on the Wilkes Land coast were warmer than 50 degrees Fahrenheit at that time, despite three months of polar night. The continental interior, however, was noticeably cooler, with the climate supporting the growth of temperate rainforests characterized by southern beech and Araucaria trees of the type common in New Zealand today. Additional evidence of extremely mild temperatures was provided by analysis of organic compounds that were produced by soil bacteria populating the soils along the Antarctic coast. \\"By studying naturally occurring climate warming periods in the geological past, our knowledge of the mechanisms and processes in the climate system increases,\\" Pross said. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Scientists have discovered that tropical palm trees and related vegetation once flourished in Antarctica 52 million years ago due to an intense warming phase, high CO2 levels, and warm ocean currents.

Brad, Texas (CNN) -- Authorities were working on plans Friday for residents who were forced to flee a wildfire in northern Texas to return home, a day after firefighters made progress battling the blaze that destroyed dozens of homes. The blaze in Palo Pinto County scorched 6,200 acres by Thursday, according to the Texas Forest Service. The fire is burning near the resort of Possum Kingdom Lake, near the town of Brad, about 100 miles west of Dallas. \\"We feel much better about this fire today,\\" as the blaze is now 50% contained, said John Nichols, a spokesman for the Forest Service. He said evacuations were lifted for some residents forced to evacuate the fire, which was driven by high temperatures and dry winds. The wildfire has destroyed 40 homes and nine RVs since it began Tuesday, the Forest Service said Thursday. Firefighters were receiving support from aerial tankers and helicopters. Authorities are mapping out plans to allow residents to return to their homes, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer. Authorities also are trying to open the lake for the Labor Day holiday, he said. On Wednesday, evacuations were ordered in several communities on the north side of the lake after the fire charged over a ridge and approached a dam on the lake, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. The wildfire was moving so fast that the Forest Service pulled out of its command observation post, telling journalists and onlookers to get out of the way of the fire. \\"My house is right through here, though it may be gone,\\" Tom Hardeston told WFAA as he watched the fire. Nearby ranchers battled to save their herds from the encroaching fire. \\"I'm just moving them from pasture to pasture,\\" Cindi McCoy told WFAA, referring to her livestock. \\"As one pasture burns, I'm moving them back to that one and bring(ing) them back around.\\"  Question: \\"Possum Kingdom Lake is in which Texas county?\\" Answer: \\"Brad\\" Is this answer correct?

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Two groups of adults were a part of a diet experiment. Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, while group Yellow, had a normal diet. Group Brown gained a lot of weight.  and a hint : Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Please answer this question : Which group has a smaller chance of getting more health problems? A:","output":"Group Yellow Step 1: Understand the situation In this situation, Group Brown was eating 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, leading to significant weight gain. Group Yellow maintained a normal diet. The hint also explains that unused energy from food is stored as fat, and a consistent excess of 3500 calories leads to the storage of 1 pound of body fat. Step 2: Relate the situation to health problems. The hint explains that obesity is defined as having a BMI of 30.0 kg/m2 or greater and increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Step 3: Compare the two groups. Group Brown consumed significantly more calories and gained a lot of weight. This excess caloric intake increases the likelihood of unused energy being stored as fat, increasing the risk of obesity and related health problems. Group Yellow, on the other hand, maintained a normal diet, which implies they would have a more stable weight and less likelihood of storing excess fat and developing obesity-related health problems. Step 4: Choose the group with the smaller chance of developing health problems. Since Group Yellow maintained a normal diet and would have a more stable weight compared to Group Brown, they would have a smaller chance of getting more health problems.

Article: If it really is what's on the inside that counts, then a lot of thin people might be in trouble.  Some doctors now think that the internal fat surrounding important organs like the heart liver could be as dangerous as the external fat which can be noticed more easily.        \\"Being thin doesn't surely mean you are not tat, said Dr Jimmy Bell at Imperial College.

Even people with normal Body Mass Index scores can have surprising levels of fat deposits inside.Of the women, as many as 45 percent of those with normal BMI scores (20 to 25) actually had too high levels of internal fat.Among men, the percentage was nearly 60 percent. According to Bell, people who are fat on the inside are actually on the edge of being fat.They eat too many fatty and sugary foods, but they are not eating enough to be fat.Scientists believe we naturally store fat around the belly first, but at some point, the body may start storing it elsewhere.

Answer:","output":"The house in which Anne Frank and her family hid from the Nazis during World War II is located in the city of Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands. This historic house is famously known as the Anne Frank House or the Secret Annex (Achterhuis in Dutch). The address of the Anne Frank House is Prinsengracht 263-267, situated along one of the picturesque canals in the heart of the city. Anne Frank, a Jewish teenager, went into hiding with her family in July 1942 due to the widespread persecution of Jews by the Nazis. The family consisted of Anne's father, Otto Frank; her mother, Edith Frank; and her sister, Margot Frank. They were later joined by the Van Pels family and Fritz Pfeffer, making a total of eight people living in hiding. The Secret Annex was a concealed section of the building where Anne's father, Otto Frank, had his office and warehouse for his business, the Opekta Works, which dealt in pectin, a gelling agent used in the production of jam. The entrance to the Secret Annex was hidden behind a movable bookcase, and the space inside comprised of several small rooms, including a small kitchen, a bathroom, and attic space. The clandestine residence was supported by several non-Jewish helpers who provided food, supplies, and news from the outside world. During their time in hiding, Anne Frank documented her experiences, thoughts, and feelings in a diary, which has since become an essential historical chronicle of the Holocaust and a literary masterpiece in its own right. Sadly, the residents of the Secret Annex were discovered in August 1944, following an anonymous tip to the German authorities. The occupants were arrested and deported to various concentration camps, where most of them, including Anne and Margot, ultimately perished. Otto Frank was the only member of the group who survived the Holocaust. Upon his return to Amsterdam, he discovered Anne's diary and worked tirelessly to publish it, fulfilling his daughter's dream of becoming a writer. Today, the Anne Frank House has been converted into a museum dedicated to the memory of Anne Frank, the other occupants of the Secret Annex, and the millions of other victims of the Holocaust. Opened in 1960, the museum aims to educate visitors about this dark chapter of history and to promote tolerance and understanding. The museum not only allows visitors to explore the hidden rooms where the families lived during the war but also displays exhibits, photographs, and documents detailing Anne Frank's life and the historical context of the Holocaust. Additionally, Anne's original diary is on display at the museum, making it an essential destination for those seeking to learn about and pay tribute to the resilience of the human spirit during this tragic period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I heard that Cameron was competing with others in a tournament and they won first place.  And I was wondering What will happen to Others? Select from the following. (a). win first place (b). be sad (c). be happy Answer:","output":"When Cameron wins first place in a tournament, it means that they performed exceptionally well and managed to outperform the other competitors. While Cameron celebrates their victory, the outcome for others will depend on several factors such as their mindset, expectations, and the level of competition. (a) Win first place: As Cameron has already secured the first place, other competitors will not be able to win the first prize themselves. They will vie for the remaining positions, such as second place, third place, or other consolation prizes based on the rules and structure of the tournament. The competitors who perform well but unable to secure a higher position could still be recognized with special awards or honorable mentions. (b) Be sad: Some competitors may feel sad if they don't win first place or achieve their desired results. This could be due to their high expectations and the pressure they placed on themselves to succeed. Such individuals may feel disappointed and frustrated. However, these emotions are normal and can be an essential part of the learning process. Competitors who experience these emotions can reflect on their performance, learn from the mistakes they made and work on improving their skills for future competitions. (c) Be happy: There are also competitors who may be happy with their performance in the tournament despite not winning the first place. They could be satisfied with their results if they know they gave their best effort, displayed sportsmanship, and enjoyed the camaraderie among other participants. Many individuals participate in competitions not just for the desire to win but also for the love of the game, personal growth, and the opportunity to challenge themselves. These competitors might appreciate the opportunity to learn from the experience, regardless of the outcome, and would be motivated to continue participating in the future, building relationships and enjoying the sport or activity in which they were engaged. To summarize, when Cameron wins first place in a tournament, others could experience various emotions – feeling proud for securing other winning positions, being sad due to unmet expectations, or being happy with their personal accomplishments. The result for each individual will depend on their personal goals, aspirations, and perspectives on competition. It is essential to understand that the process of competing and learning from it can be just as valuable as the outcome, and competitors should strive towards personal growth and improvement regardless of their rank in the tournament."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context:  Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug. When the group travelled by train to Bangor, Wales in 1967 for the Maharishi Yogi's Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding.

Q:SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — During his first year in office, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s persistent pursuit of diplomacy, often working in parallel with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, played a significant role in persuading North Korea to engage in talks to end its nuclear program. “Before the extreme measures might have been chosen by the United States, he gave diplomacy another chance to succeed,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton is banking on a \\"highly motivated\\" Mercedes team to deliver him a second F1 world title after his big money switch from McLaren. The 28-year-old Hamilton will partner Germany's Nico Rosberg for the upcoming 2013 season, a pairing described by team principal Ross Brawn as \\"the strongest driver line-up in Formula One.\\" But both Hamilton and Rosberg will be hoping the new Mercedes F1 W04 -- unveiled Monday in Jerez in Spain ahead of pre-season testing -- will be competitive. Hamilton, the 2008 world champion with McLaren, has no doubts that he will achieve his goals. Rosberg has also been impressed by the hunger for success at","output":"Mercedes and believes this drive can propel them to the top of the Formula One hierarchy. After spending several seasons at Williams and establishing himself as a consistent points-scorer, the son of 1982 world champion Keke Rosberg joined Mercedes in 2010. Since then, he has secured one race victory - the 2012 Chinese Grand Prix - and a few podiums but has yet to mount a serious title challenge. As the 2013 season approached, both Hamilton and Rosberg were optimistic that the new F1 W04 car would provide them with the platform to compete with the dominant Red Bull Racing, Ferrari, and McLaren teams. The W04 was a significant evolution of the previous year's model, built around a new aerodynamic concept, and featured innovative designs aimed at extracting maximum performance from the car's complex hybrid systems. In an interview ahead of the season's first race, Hamilton expressed his excitement at joining Mercedes and believed that the combination of the team's technical expertise and his own driving skills would eventually lead to success. \\"I couldn't be more excited to start my new journey with Mercedes,\\" Hamilton said. \\"I have been so impressed with the level of commitment and passion within the team, and there's a real hunger for winning here.\\" Rosberg echoed Hamilton's sentiments and felt that the team had taken a significant step forward in preparation for the 2013 campaign. \\"The atmosphere in the team is incredible,\\" Rosberg said. \\"Everyone is highly motivated and working together as a strong unit. We are all pushing each other to achieve our goals, and that's something I believe will only continue to grow throughout the season.\\" Team principal Ross Brawn, who had masterminded titles campaigns for Michael Schumacher at both Benetton and Ferrari, was confident his new driver pairing would prove to be the catalyst for a Mercedes renaissance. \\"In Lewis and Nico, we have a very talented and highly motivated duo,\\" Brawn explained. \\"I believe their combined abilities and experiences will enable us to compete at the highest level and challenge for the world championship.\\" As the season unfolded, it became clear that Mercedes had indeed made significant progress in terms of performance. The team managed to secure three consecutive pole positions, and Hamilton claimed his maiden victory with his new team at the Hungarian Grand Prix. Although the 2013 might not have turned out to be the championship-winning season they had hoped for, the impressive performances showed that the Hamilton-Rosberg partnership was a threat to the established front-runners. The seeds of success were sown during the 2013 season, and it wouldn't be long before Mercedes began to dominate Formula One. The introduction of new hybrid power units in 2014 provided Mercedes with a clear advantage over its rivals, and the team went on to secure seven consecutive constructors' championships from 2014 to 2020. Hamilton played a pivotal role in the team's success, capturing six more world titles, while Rosberg secured his first and only championship in 2016 before retiring from the sport. In conclusion, the \\"highly motivated\\" Mercedes team and the driver partnership of Hamilton and Rosberg did indeed deliver on their promise, turning the German marque into a modern motorsport dynasty and enabling both drivers to achieve their aspirations of winning world titles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Noir Drive Movie plot: In Sydney in 1952 and returning from a month away, the private investigator Reilly finds his office has been taken over by the building's janitor, Jerry Vane, who has been impersonating him in his absence. Roughing Vane over, Reilly discovers he has taken a missing person's case in which an insurance company is trying to locate someone named Alex Pleshette. However, when Reilly presents himself to the insurance office to drop the case, the owner Max Arnett claims he never hired his agency to begin with. On the way out however, Arnett's receptionist inadvertently gives away the truth that Reilly was in fact hired. Heading back to his office, Reilly is confronted by two thugs in an alley who beat him and tell him to lay off the Pleshette case. In his office a short time later, a beautiful young woman in black arrives. Presenting herself as Mrs. Pleshette, Reilly assumes she is Alex Pleshette's wife, however she curtly informs him that her husband is dead, and that she is actually Alexandra, better known as Alex Pleshette. She tells him to stop interfering as she is now no longer missing, and departs â leaving him even more confused. Next day, Reilly finds out from his police detective friend Jack Bosley that Alex Pleshette witnessed the murder of her husband, a wealthy tycoon named Donald Pleshette who was at the time being investigated for company insurance fraud. However, she was knocked unconscious by the killer and as a result is unable to remember the event. Not long after this, she went missing and no one knew where she was, not even her lover Gabe Preston, her husband's disgruntled business partner. Reilly recognizes that Preston would thus have a motive for murder, but Bosley explains that he has a strong alibi.

Pay attention to the name's sound, rhythm, and syllables to make sure it's correct.; 2). It's important to try to make sure the person's name actually enters your brain, instead of going in one ear and out the other. If you realize a person's name flew by you, ask for it again.; 3).

This option doesn't provide a coherent continuation from the previous sentence. It introduces the problem of forgetting names but doesn't offer a concrete solution. 3). This option discusses identifying the person and remembering the name immediately later, but it is not directly tied to the initial point about paying attention to their name when you first hear it. 4).

His eyes awoke with a passionate, determined flame, though the only light came from the glutted moon. Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper. Where before they had marched in regiments, practiced in ranks and followed their leaders' commands, the words now escaped in their true forms, unhindered by any stricture.

Article: Upon reaching an appropriate age (usually between 18 and 21 years), children are encouraged, but not forced, to \\"leave the nest\\" and begin an independent life. After children leave home, they often find social relationship and financial support outside the family. Parents do not arrange marriages for their children, nor do children usually ask permission of their parents to get married. Romantic love is most often the basis for marriage in the United States; young adults meet their future spouses through other friends, at jobs,  and in organizations and religious institutions. Although children choose their own spouses, they still hope their parents will approve of their choices. In many families, parents feel that children should make major life decisions by themselves. A parent may try to influence a child to follow a particular profession but the child is free to choose another career. Sometimes children do exactly the opposite of what their parents wish in order to be independent. A son may decide not to go into his father's business on purpose because of a fear that he will lose his autonomy  in his father's workplace. This independence from parents is not an indication that parents and children do not love each other. Strong love between parents and children is universal and this is no exception in the American family. Coexisting with such love in the American family are cultural values of self-reliance and independence. Question: Most young adults in the U.S. get married because of   _  .

Generate a question that has the following answer:  Frost  for the following movie plot:  The movie begins in the year 1967 with a pregnant woman being admitted to a hospital, bleeding from the neck. Paramedics think she was attacked by some type of animal. Doctors perform an emergency C-Section, and her baby (a boy) is born alive just as she dies.Thirty years later a young man named Dennis (Kenny Johnson) is riding in a car with an attractive redhead named Racquel (Traci Lords) heading to an underground nightclub (located, oddly, in a slaughterhouse) somewhere in Los Angeles. After addressing the doorman in Russian, Racquel brings the young man into the club. The man is confused and trying to understand the rules of the club. Some of the regulars indifferently push him aside. Saying he needs a drink, the sprinkler suddenly system activates, raining blood down on everyone inside. It is then that he (and the audience) realizes that everyone in the club is a vampire.Dennis desperately tries to get away and winds up at the feet of a menacing figure in a black-leather trenchcoat. The vampires look on this figure with awe, mumbling the words: \\"it's the Daywalker!\\" This is our first look at Blade (Wesley Snipes), the vampire killer.Blade pulls out a shotgun and opens fire on the vampires, who instantly burn to ashes when killed. When the gun is knocked out of his hands by Racquel, Blade uses a set of silver stakes to kill Racquel and more vampires, including the disk jockey. Soon all the vamps are either dead or have fled except for one; a heavyset vamp named Quinn (Donal Logue), whom Blade has apparently run into before. Blade pins Quinn to the wall, and then sets him on fire before confronting the last member in the club (the human man from the beginning). Finding no vampire bite marks on Dennis, Blade lets him live and makes his escape as the police arrive.Quinn is extinguished and taken to the local hospital. A morgue technician examines his blood and shows the results to Dr. Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright), who finds a number of irregularities, including abnormally developed jaw muscles. As they are...

If \\"A person holding a dog while they eat.\\", does this mean that \\"The dog is on someones laps.\\"?","output":"To determine if \\"A person holding a dog while they eat\\" means \\"The dog is on someone's lap,\\" let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. Analyze the given phrase: In \\"A person holding a dog while they eat,\\" we have a person who is holding a dog. The person is also eating at the same time.        Justification: The phrase tells us that the person is holding a dog, and they are eating. 2. Define the meaning of \\"holding\\": When a person is \\"holding\\" something, they are supporting it using their hands or arms.     Justification: Dictionary definition of \\"holding\\" means to carry or support something with one's hands/arms. 3. Consider the position of the dog: Since the person is holding the dog while eating, it is likely that the dog is close to the person's body, which makes it possible for the dog to be on their lap.    Justification: If the person has to hold the dog and eat simultaneously, the dog should be in a position that allows the person to use at least one hand to eat. 4. Determine if the dog is on someone's lap: Based on the information above, we can infer that it is quite possible for the dog to be on someone's lap, although it is not explicitly stated.    Justification: As the person is holding the dog and eating at the same time, it is likely that the dog is on their lap to allow for easier multitasking. In conclusion, based on the analysis, we can infer that \\"A person holding a dog while they eat\\" could mean \\"The dog is on someone's lap,\\" although it is not explicitly stated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: The best way to do this is by meditating and using breathing techniques. During meditation, the goal is to empty your mind of any thoughts and simply feel at peace. Breathing techniques are based on what works for an individual. Try breathing in as deeply as you can and then expelling all the air from your lungs and repeating the process.  Listening to soothing music can act as a form of meditation. If you are feeling anxious, play music that will help to calm yourself down.  Yoga can be an excellent form of meditation that combines both mental and physical exercise. Not getting enough sleep can aggravate your paranoia and make your symptoms worse. Because of this, it is important to make sure that you have a regular sleep schedule. Try to go to bed and get up around the same time each day. Don’t drink caffeine before bed, as this can throw off your sleeping patterns. While you may dislike when others question your rationale governing your fears and anxieties, it is important for you to reflect upon the motivations that inspire your actions and interactions. Ask yourself, “why am I fearful, suspicious, or anxious?” Try justifying your fears--do they make sense to you? You should also think about how these negative thoughts are affecting your well-being. Eat well-balanced meals and exercise as often as possible. It is important to keep yourself healthy so that you can feel good about yourself. Put food into your body that will make you feel good. Avoid things like alcohol and tobacco that can have a negative impact on both your physical and mental states. Like eating healthy food to increase your positivity, it is also important to do activities that will inspire positive feelings. Do things that you love, whether that means taking time to garden each day, go to the movies, or even go dancing. Create a positive outlet for yourself by working on a project that you enjoy. As a person with PPD, you should constantly be supplying yourself with positive thoughts. One way that you can do this is by reading and watching material that has uplifting content. Inspirational books and movies that discuss people overcoming great odds, be it psychologically, emotionally, or physically, can give you the fodder for your own inspirational fire. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses various strategies to manage and alleviate the symptoms of paranoia and anxiety.

A. school  B. public building  C. large building  D. auditorum  E. convention center  The best answer is A:","output":"B. public building An entrance hall is typically found in various types of buildings, but the term \\"public building\\" best encompasses a wide variety of structures that many random citizens would have access to and utilize. Public buildings are structures that are maintained and funded by the government or by public organizations for the benefit and use of the community as a whole. These buildings often serve diverse functions and are designed to accommodate large numbers of people. Option A, a school, is not the best answer because while many citizens do enter schools, it is primarily limited to students, faculty, and staff. A school building's primary purpose is for education, and it may not always be accessible to the general public. Option C, a large building, is too vague and not specific enough to definitively state its use. Large buildings can have various purposes and may or may not be open to the public. Option D, an auditorium, is a more specific type of public building used primarily for performances and presentations. It is not the best answer because an auditorium is just one of the many types of public buildings that random citizens may use. Finally, option E, a convention center, is another specific type of public building used primarily for hosting large events, conferences, and exhibitions. Like an auditorium, it is not the best answer because a convention center is only one of the vast range of public buildings that citizens may enter.

Article: Everyone has done experiments in high school laboratories,but have you ever thought about designing a satellite to explore space? On Nov.19,a team of students from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in the US awed peers and even scientists by successfully launching a satellite. The first satellite designed and built by high school students was sent up into space along with a record setting.28 other small ones on a rocket were sent from a NASA center in Virginia,CNN reported.It took the students seven years to build. The students call their tiny satellite TJ3Sat,which is named after their school.It is just 10x10x12 centimeters and weighs only 0.89 kilograms,according to Orbital Sciences,a company which developed the rocket and supported the students' project.It can be controlled with a smartphone. Like most satellites,TJ3Sat can send and receive data.The small spacecraft is equipped with a voice synthesizer  ,which can switch text to voice and transmit those sounds back to Earth over radio waves,said Orbital officials.In this case,anyone can give it a try via the project's website (school website) by submitting   a text.The texts that get approved will be sent to the satellite,changed to voice and then broadcast back to Earth via radio waves. \\"I can say 'Go Colonials'on our ground station and when it is on the other side of the world,in India,someone can hear'Go Colonials'over the radio,\\"the team explains on the website. The satellite will stay in space for at least three months.

At a time when American students are busy with SATs,the launch of the satellite shows what diligent teenagers can achieve when allowed to pursue their own curiosities,Glazer said. \\"It used to be that kids growing up wanted to be an astronaut,\\" Andrew Petro,program executive   for small spacecraft technology at NASA,said in a...

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Damned United Context: After failing to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is replaced by Don Revie (Colm Meaney), the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie's replacement at Leeds is Brian Clough (Michael Sheen), the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), has not joined him. The roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First Division[3] and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2â0.[4] Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay (Brian McCardie), along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson (Jim Broadbent) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted. They once again face Leeds, only to lose 5â0. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year. They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus. Unfortunately, against Longson's advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie. They suffer injuries and Billy Bremner (Stephen Graham) sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final. Juventus defeat them 3-1, and Clough publicly lambasts Longson.[5] Taylor then suffers a heart attack, and Clough tries to...

Hint: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm.

Question: Did he trigger his hematophobia? Movie title: The Darwin Awards Movie plot: The film opens with a car with a JATO rocket strapped to it. The movie then shifts to Michael Burrows, a criminal profiler for the San Francisco Police Department. Shot in documentary style, the film is ostensibly a dissertation by a film school grad that follows Michael throughout the story. Fired from the police force after his hematophobia allows a serial killer to get away, Michael wallows in a deep depression for several weeks before coming up with a way to combine his Darwin Awards obsession with his talent for profiling. He will help insurance companies detect people more likely to accidentally end their own lives, so they are not sold insurance policies. After impressing an insurance company manager with his profiling talent, Michael is paired up with Siri, a specialist in strange insurance cases. Siri and Michael travel the country on behalf of the company, investigating several legendary examples of stupidity, such as the JATO rocket car. A pair of men attempting to ice fish become frustrated and use a stick of dynamite to blast a hole in the ice. The problem is their dog plays fetch with the lit dynamite and runs it back to their brand-new SUV. As they investigate the cases, Michael tries to pinpoint a common factor for these people. The only explanation is a confused monologue by Siri about insurance companies always denying claims and driving people insane. Michael narrowly avoids becoming a Darwin Award winner throughout the movie. He and Siri are stranded in the middle of nowhere on a cold night.

He knew that it was not only the physical pain from the fight that had hurt Justin, but also the emotional turmoil that followed. Both boys had been friends since their childhood and rarely, if ever, had any conflicts between them. This situation, however, had spiraled out of control, leaving both of them lost, confused, and emotionally scarred. In the days following the fight, Hunter avoided Justin as much as possible. He knew that, although he wanted to apologize, it would be best for both of them to have some space to heal and process the altercation. Hunter had also sustained some physical injuries, but his pride had suffered the most. When he looked in the mirror each morning, he saw the marks on his face, reminding him of his impulsive actions – actions that had led him down a path he never intended to follow. As weeks passed, their mutual friends began to take notice of the distance between Hunter and Justin. There was a clear division within their group, as sides were taken, and whispers were exchanged. It became evident that the fallout from the fight was affecting more than just their own relationship – their entire social circle had been disrupted by it. Hunter spent most of his time replaying the events of that fateful day in his mind. Initially, the fight had started as just a disagreement over something trivial, but their fragile emotions had quickly escalated the situation. Old wounds had been reopened, revealing the deep-rooted issues that had been festering for years. As Hunter contemplated the reasons behind their fight, he realized that the root cause of their conflict wasn't about the trivial event itself but the mounting tensions that had been subconsciously growing over time. He recognized that they had been growing apart, with their individual lives pulling them in different directions. The realization made him regret their lack of open communication, and he began to understand how important it was to address the many emotions they had left unspoken. Feeling determined to salvage their friendship, Hunter finally decided to reach out to Justin. He picked up his phone and dialed the familiar number, his heart racing as the call connected. When Justin answered, there was an awkward silence as they both stumbled to find the right words. Hunter eventually found the courage to express his regret for his actions and the pain he had caused. He took responsibility for his part in their fight and the subsequent rift between them. Justin, however, was still cautious, even as he acknowledged Hunter's apologies. The wounds they had inflicted, both physical and emotional, would not heal overnight. In the weeks that followed, Hunter and Justin took careful steps towards rebuilding their friendship. They had many honest and heartfelt conversations, addressing the issues that had caused their conflict and discussing the steps they could take to ensure it would not happen again. Their friendship would never be exactly the same as it was before the fight, but through their vulnerability and willingness to grow, they ultimately were able to strengthen the bond between them. As the months passed, they slowly rediscovered their love and respect for each other, and their close-knit social circle began to mend as well. The events of that fateful day would forever serve as a reminder of the importance of empathy, understanding, and open communication in any relationship. From that point on, Hunter and Justin resolved to confront their emotions openly and honestly, knowing that it was the key to maintaining the lifelong friendship they both cherished."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

After the ordeal gains the attention of numerous members of the household and community and Ted is carted off to a hospital, he subsequently loses contact with Mary. Thirteen years later, in 1998, 29-year-old Ted is still in love with Mary. On the advice of his best friend Dom (Chris Elliott), he hires a smarmy private detective named Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to track her down. Healy finds that she is an orthopedic surgeon living in Miami with her friend, Magda, and quickly falls in love with Mary as well. He lies to Ted about her, saying she is grossly overweight with many children, to discourage him from having any contact with her.

Answer the following question: China’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that a U.S. decision to disinvite China from a major international maritime exercise is “unconstructive.” A ministry statement said despite the decision, China will continue playing a role in “maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The United States announced its move Wednesday, saying Beijing’s “destabilizing behavior” in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the principles of the U.S.-led drill. “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” read a statement from Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii. It’s a reflection of expanding U.S.-China military ties, despite tensions over Beijing’s construction of man-made islands in the South China Sea, some of which have been militarized. \\"We have strong evidence that China has deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, and electronic jammers to contested features in the Spratly Islands region of the South China Sea.

Options: [-] no; [-] yes;","output":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning.  The first question revolves around comparing the political fates of Donald Trump, former President of the United States, and Rob Ford, the late former mayor of Toronto. The implication is whether Donald Trump could end up with political struggles or controversies similar to those experienced by Rob Ford. Rob Ford had a turbulent political career, facing many personal and substance-abuse scandals, which ultimately led to his political downfall. While there are certain similarities between the two politicians, such as their populist appeal and frequent controversies, drawing a direct comparison between them requires analyzing their political careers, public and personal lives, and sociopolitical contexts in which they emerged. Regarding the second question, it appears to be a statement seeking forgiveness for a murder committed in a sudden and extreme emotional state, followed by a question about how educated people would perceive the situation in the context of the movie \\"Rustom.\\" \\"Rustom\\" is an Indian film that centers around a naval officer who murders his wife's lover upon discovering their affair. This question is unrelated to the first one and focuses on the themes of crime, passion, and the perception of such actions by educated individuals.

Answer the following question: Process:  - The organism must die to begin the process - The soft tissue decomposes - The bones are left behind - Scavengers tear the body apart and move the bones elsewhere - Wind and rain also scatter the bones further - The bones left behind will weather and become buried by sand and soil - The proteins in the bone are replaced with minerals that are dissolved in the soil - This creates a rock-like substance called a fossil - Water and wind erosion wear away the layers of soil on top of the fossil - This makes discovery of the fossil possible.  suppose Less proteins are replaced with minerals happens, how will it affect more fossils can be formed.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation of less proteins being replaced with minerals during the fossilization process can be classified as directly impacting a step of the process. This impact occurs specifically in the step where the proteins in the bone are replaced with minerals that are dissolved in the soil, leading to the formation of a rock-like substance called a fossil. A decrease in the replacement of proteins with minerals can affect the overall fossil formation in a couple of ways: 1. Incomplete fossilization: If less protein is replaced with minerals, the fossil may not be as well preserved or may not form completely. This could result in the bones being weaker and more susceptible to damage during the fossilization process, leading to a higher likelihood of the bones not being preserved in a recognizable or identifiable form. 2. Lower likelihood of discovery: If the bones are not fully fossilized, they may not be as identifiable or recognizable during excavation and erosion processes. This makes it more difficult for researchers and paleontologists to find and study these fossils, ultimately reducing the amount of information available about the organism and its history. To summarize, the direct impact of less protein being replaced with minerals during the fossilization process can decrease the likelihood of successful fossil formation and discovery. It directly affects a step in the process that is crucial for the creation and preservation of a fossil, ultimately leading to potential limitations in our understanding of extinct organisms and their environments."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from Karluk's engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers. In McKinlay's words, the camp provided \\"substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time.\\" Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp in the direction of the island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.Amid this activity Mackay and Murray, now joined by the anthropologist Henri Beuchat, played little part in the general life of the camp and expressed their determination to leave it, independently, as soon as possible. Bartlett wanted to wait for the longer daylight hours of February before attempting the march, but was persuaded by McKinlay and Mamen to send a trailbreaking group to set up an advance camp on Wrangel Island. A party of four, led by Karluk's first officer Alexander Anderson and including crew members Charles Barker, John Brady and Edmund Golightly, left Shipwreck Camp on 21 January with instructions from Bartlett to establish their camp at or near Berry Point on the north shore of Wrangel Island. On 4 February Bjarne Mamen, who accompanied the party as a scout, returned to Shipwreck Camp and reported that he had left the group a few miles short of land that was evidently not Wrangel Island, and was probably Herald Island, 38 miles (61 km) from their intended destination.

Article: Demonstrators hold a placard, which reads, ''Homs, how small we are in front of you'', during a protest against Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in Yabroud, near Damascus, February 7, 2012.      CAIRO After a bruising meeting in a five-star Cairo hotel, Arab foreign ministers led by Gulf states hinted to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that unless he halts his violent crackdown, some Arab League members might arm his opponents.      The message was folded into Article 9 of a League resolution passed on Sunday that urges Arabs to \\"provide all kinds of political and material support\\" to the opposition, a phrase that includes the possibility of giving weapons to Assad's foes.      Diplomats at the meeting confirmed this interpretation.      Arabs are striving to unite the world around their drive to push Assad to end the killing, but have gained little traction.      They had to scrap a floundering Arab monitoring mission to Syria. When they sought U.N. Security Council support for a transition plan under which Assad would step aside, Russia and China vetoed the Western-backed U.N. draft resolution.      Moscow is an old ally of Syria and its top arms supplier.      Sunday's Arab League meeting raised the stakes. Its implicit shuffle towards backing military resistance to Assad's forces was meant to add pressure on the Syrian leader and his Russian and Chinese allies. Yet it also risks leading to a Libya-style conflict or sectarian civil war that everyone wants to avoid.      \\"It is unacceptable for Assad to practice all types of killing of civilians while we stand silent,\\" one Arab ambassador said, explaining the rationale behind the resolution that returned the Syria issue to the United Nations with a call for a joint U.N.-Arab peacekeeping force.      \\"We will back the opposition financially and diplomatically in the beginning but if the killing by the regime continues, civilians must be helped to protect themselves. The resolution gives Arab states all options to protect the Syrian people,\\" the envoy said.      \\"All options\\" is diplomatic language that leaves room for a military response. Two other diplomats spelled it out more explicitly, saying the resolution could allow arms transfers.      Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center, said the bloodshed was putting pressure on Arabs to act.      \\"The escalation is coming from the ground and it is coming from Assad himself. This is the reason they feel they cannot stand idly by just pursuing a diplomatic track,\\" he said. \\"I suspect we will see a further militarization of this conflict, with potentially quite widespread and dangerous consequences.\\"      \\"ALL KINDS OF SUPPORT\\"      Smuggled guns are filtering into Syria but it is not clear if Arab or other governments are backing any such transfers.      Iraqi security officials say there are signs Sunni Muslim insurgents are beginning to cross the border to join Syrian rebels. Smugglers are cashing in as prices double for weapons reaching Syria concealed in commercial traffic.      For now, however, such weaponry cannot match the firepower that Assad's military can bring to bear, analysts say, but that could change if Assad fails to heed Arab peace calls.      A non-Gulf Arab ambassador said Qatar and Saudi Arabia had insisted on the \\"material support\\" wording to cover \\"all kinds of support including weapons in future\\", adding: \\"But we see this as a dangerous escalation.\\"      A senior Arab diplomat voiced fears that such a step could ignite a conflagration in Syria, a nation of Sunnis, Alawites, Christians, Kurds and Druze at the heart of the Arab world.      \\"It is a very sensitive situation in Syria. The door is open for a lot of possibilities,\\" he said. \\"I think now Syria is at the beginning of a kind of civil war.\\"      Syria's crisis has provoked a lop-sided rift among Arabs.      Sunni-ruled Gulf states, broadly driven by a desire to oust Assad, an ally of their Shi'ite regional rival Iran, have the financial and political muscle to push through calls to isolate the Syrian leader. Wealthy Gulf countries, Bahrain apart, have also emerged with few scars from the wave of Arab uprisings.      Egypt, Algeria and Iraq, traditionally regional heavyweights with big populations and the largest armies, may have misgivings on Syria, but have limited clout for now. Algeria registered reservations about a joint U.N.-Arab force. Others kept quiet.      All three have challenges at home that blunt their ability to project their views. Iraq has its own sectarian divisions; Algeria has escaped a popular uprising, but remains wary; Egypt's generals may not like intervention in an Arab state but are preoccupied by street protests against military rule.      Lebanon, long dominated by its Syrian neighbor and its own Syrian- and Iranian-backed Shi'ite armed movement, Hezbollah, was the only League member formally to object to the resolution.      Highlighting the turmoil in the Arab world, Sunday's meeting in Cairo was shifted to the Marriott hotel across the Nile from the League's headquarters, located uncomfortably close to Tahrir Square, the focal point for Egyptian protesters.      Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, set the tone for the gathering in the plush surrounds of the former royal palace, making the case for backing the Syrian opposition.      \\"NOT OPEN TO DISCUSSION\\"      In a speech before closed-door talks began, he told Arab ministers: \\"At our meeting today I call for decisive measures, after the failure of the half-solutions.\\"      From then on, it was clear who was in charge, according to the non-Gulf envoy, who, like others, asked not to be named.      \\"These meetings were not open to discussion. The Gulf foreign ministers had positions and decisions they had reached earlier and they did not want to hear anything else,\\" he said.      The six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council had met separately earlier in the day. One source said their line was backed by Morocco, Jordan and Tunisia, which will host a gathering of Arab and other \\"Friends of Syria\\" on February 24.      An Arab source who attended the meetings described tetchy discussions on what kind of U.N.-Arab mission the League should request from the United Nations.      When a call for international \\"monitors\\" was proposed, Gulf ministers retorted that \\"what is happening in Syrian cannot be stopped without a peacekeeping force,\\" the source said.      The meeting settled on requesting a \\"force\\".      The source said Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, who was in the chair, also led calls for ending the Arab monitoring mission, which had been criticized by Syria's opposition since it began work in December and which has also faced internal dissent and logistical problems.      The monitoring team was duly scrapped in the resolution.      Yet prospects for securing U.N. Security Council backing for a joint peacekeeping force seem dim.      Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby floated the idea last week with the U.N. secretary-general. But it received only a lukewarm response from diplomats in New York, even though the United States and others said they would consider it.      \\"It really isn't realistic when there isn't a peace to keep ... This needs looking at as a future option rather than an option for now,\\" said a Western diplomat at the United Nations.      \\"NO WESTERN BOOTS ON THE GROUND\\"      The diplomat referred to the \\"unfortunate\\" precedent of the joint U.N.-African military force UNAMID sent to Sudan's Darfur region, which he said had lacked a clear command structure.      \\"I don't see the way forward in Syria as being Western boots on the ground in any form, including in any peacekeeping form. I think they would need to come from other countries, rather than Western nations,\\" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said.      Syria would have to agree before such a force could deploy. It accepted the unarmed Arab monitors, but only after weeks of foot-dragging, and swiftly rejected Sunday's Arab resolution.      The joint force request was aimed at focusing minds by \\"throwing this back to the United Nations and asking questions of Russia\\", said Shaikh of the Brookings Doha Center.      \\"If this moment is lost, we may well see a continuing polarization in the international community's response and a slide into greater conflict on the ground,\\" he said.      The acid test will be Russia's response, with China expected to follow Moscow's lead, analysts says. For now, Russia has said it will consider the Arab appeal but without much enthusiasm.      To circumvent the Security Council, where Moscow and Beijing have twice vetoed Syria resolutions, Arabs will take their peace plan to the U.N. General Assembly, which is expected to vote on the Saudi-drafted resolution this week. Such resolutions cannot be vetoed but are non-binding.      Winning U.N. support is not the only Arab challenge.      Arabs have thrown their weight behind a Syrian opposition that is far from united, deterring full recognition of bodies such as the exiled Syrian National Council (SNC).      \\"The main problem on the side of the Syrian opposition is that it is still scattered,\\" said the senior League diplomat. \\"They don't have a united leadership or a single voice.\\"      The Arab resolution called for the opposition to \\"unify its ranks\\" and SNC members hovered around the Cairo meeting holding talks with ministers on the sidelines. Syrian officials were absent after Damascus was suspended from the 22-member League.      Some Arab nations have made clear they no longer consider Assad's government legitimate. Gulf states said last week they were recalling their ambassadors from Syria and expelling Syria's envoys. Libya and Tunisia, both countries where popular revolts toppled autocratic rulers last year, have done the same.      The Arab diplomat said the \\"Friends of Syria\\", a group backed by Western powers, could help \\"persuade all opposition factions from Syria, inside and outside, to be one front\\".      (Additional reporting by Yasmine Saleh in Cairo and Patrick Worsnip in New York; Writing by Edmund Blair; Editing by Alistair Lyon) ||||| BEIRUT, Lebanon — Life has become increasingly unbearable in Homs, a city under fierce bombardment by the Syrian government, with residents recounting days of deprivation, rockets and tank shells exploding around them and efforts to bribe government soldiers to escape during lulls in the fighting.      A young woman who fled the city, Syria’s third-largest, for Beirut spoke on Tuesday of the hellish experience that she and others had endured, trapped in their dwellings without heat while desperately awaiting breaks in the military offensive to forage for food or try to escape.      The Syrian government pressed its campaign against rebellious cities across the country on Tuesday, with residents of the central city of Homs describing the renewed shelling there as particularly harsh.      Activists in Homs said that during the most intense periods of shelling, starting around first light on Tuesday, rockets and tank shells whistled into the embattled Baba Amr neighborhood as often as every two minutes.      “The idea of safety doesn’t exist anymore in Baba Amr,” Omar Shakir, an activist in the neighborhood reached via Skype, said as explosions erupted in the background. “Scary is all that exists.”      Videos uploaded to YouTube’s syriapioneer channel showed gray and black smoke leaping high overhead as shells crashed into buildings, while the staccato outbursts of machine guns sounded incessantly. Activists described it as the heaviest shelling in five days in an assault that began on Feb. 4.      The city lacks electricity and cellphone service, and land lines fade erratically. Facebook pages overflow with requests from relatives abroad asking people inside Syria to check on their loved ones.      The young woman who fled, a 19-year-old student who asked not to be named because her parents were still in Homs, arrived in Beirut on Tuesday. She said that troops allowed civilians to escape on Saturday and Sunday and that people bribed soldiers to ferry them out of the Inshaat neighborhood on tanks or to clear roadways for them to drive their cars out.      She described a city where “all roads were closed, and even if they weren’t, the shelling makes it impossible for you to go anywhere.”      Government services have collapsed, she said, and high, stinking piles of garbage rot on many corners or emit rancid smoke — having been ignited by fighters inside the city for camouflage against government snipers.      Residents have grown to fear the two main hospitals, she said, because the doctors still reporting to work tend to be government sympathizers. Some even carry guns as they make their rounds.      But she detailed a kind of symbiotic cease-fire that had developed between the young army recruits deployed at some neighborhood checkpoints, the font of many defections. The soldiers get food and a certain degree of safety, while residents feel they can run short errands unmolested or occasionally escape entirely.      Residents live in multiple layers of clothing and ration their use of kerosene for heat and hot water. On relatively quiet days, the food stores open, and people rush to buy canned food and flashlights. Simple things like Pepsi have become a luxury item, she said, while hallways in many homes are now stacked with bags of rice and sugar.      “They are anticipating a long siege,” the student said.      Civilians in the Inshaat neighborhood felt more vulnerable because there was no one to protect them, while most of the soldiers from the Free Syrian Army — the name adopted by all local militias — were in Baba Amr. A couple of neighborhoods nearby asked the antigovernment militia members not to come in at all so they could remain safe havens where the wounded, women and children could seek shelter.      In Baba Amr, Mr. Shakir, the activist, estimated that 60 percent of the buildings had suffered too much damage to be habitable. The neighborhood was hit by occasional mortar shells overnight, he said, with the heavier tank and other rounds coming at daylight.      “We are under full siege. It is horrible here,” Mr. Shakir said. “I have not tasted bread for the past five days.” ||||| What is a summary?","output":"In 2012, Arab foreign ministers led by Gulf states conveyed a message to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that, unless he ceases his violent crackdown, some Arab League members may arm his opponents. This message was included in Article 9 of a League resolution aimed at urging Arabs to \\"provide all kinds of political and material support\\" to the opposition, which includes the possibility of supplying weapons to Assad's adversaries. The Arab League struggled to unite the world around their mission to pressure Assad to end the killing; however, they had little success. The Arab League meeting raised the stakes and moved towards backing military resistance to Assad's forces. This decision added pressure to the Syrian leader and his Russian and Chinese allies but also posed the risk of escalating conflict or sectarian civil war."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: The task is about reading the given story and question, then finding an answer to the given question.

Problem:story: Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its 16 constituent states. With a population of approximately 3.7 million, Berlin is the second most populous city proper in the European Union and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of the rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has roughly 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals and lakes.  First documented in the 13th century and situated at the crossing of two important historic trade routes, Berlin became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (14171701), the Kingdom of Prussia (1701–1918), the German Empire (1871–1918), the Weimar Republic (1919–1933) and the Third Reich (1933–1945). Berlin in the 1920s was the third largest municipality in the world. After World War II and its subsequent occupation by the victorious countries, the city was divided; East Berlin was declared capital of East Germany, while West Berlin became a de facto West German exclave, surrounded by the Berlin Wall (1961–1989) and East German territory. Following German reunification in 1990, Berlin once again became the capital of all of Germany., question: What metro region is it in?

The outlines of the motifs were drawn in black while the interiors were white. In their design, they are a direct continuation of Kushite styles, with possible influences from Aksumite Ethiopia.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said.

UPDATED:. 04:58 EST, 25 May 2013. Jailed: Former traffic warden Robert Ives issued bogus parking tickets to former colleagues. A corrupt traffic warden who issued nine bogus tickets against a former colleague during a ‘campaign of bullying’ has today (Fri) been jailed for six months. Robert Ives, 59, dished out the dodgy parking notices to Kevin Phillips while based at Tooting police station in south London. Ives also forged Mr Phillips’ signature on another ticket handed to an innocent member of the public, pensioner Shamim Gilani. He was caught out after being linked to the tickets by his handwriting, Southwark Crown Court heard. On one occasion, Mr Phillips, with whom Ives had an ‘unpleasant relationship’, was given a ticket when he was parked miles away in a completely different part of south London. In a victim impact statement, Mr Phillips told how he suffered from high blood pressure and that his head had been left ‘spinning’ from the stress of disputing the tickets. Mrs Gilani, 73, said she paid the £65 fine ‘with a tear in her eye’ as she and her husband were on a tight budget. She has since been reimbursed. Ives, a Jack the Ripper enthusiast, who had been employed for the past 45 years, issued the parking notices in November 2011 - the same month he was made redundant. He has yet to find another job. Mr Phillips had left four months earlier to work as a PCSO. Ives, a father-of-one, insisted he had been ‘set up’. But a jury of four women and eight men took just 24 minutes to unanimously convict him of misconduct in a judicial or public office, after a trial at the court last month. Sentencing, Recorder Edward Cole told him: ‘Your misconduct appears to have been an unpleasant way of bullying Mr Phillips. ‘Why you picked on Mrs Gilani is not clear. ‘In the case of Mr Phillips, your misconduct amounted to a campaign of bullying. ‘Your conduct in each case was a. malicious abuse of power and a breach of trust put in you to administer. the system of parking regulation fairly and accurately. ‘Your conduct was in some ways similar those who pervert the course of justice. ‘Like all such offences, this investigation involved a waste of public resources. ‘Your behaviour involved a gross breach of trust and was persistent. ‘Public trust and confidence in those in public office is likely to be eroded by this sort of misconduct.’ Sentence: Ives was jailed for six months after a jury at Southwark Crown Court convicted him of misconduct in a judicial or public office Southwark Crown Court heard. Ives buried his head in his hands during the hearing but was stony faced as he was led out of the dock. Prosecutor Piers von Berg had earlier told the jury that Ives ‘wilfully or deliberately misconducted himself to such a degree to amount to abuse of the public trust in his office and he did so without reasonable excuse or justification.’ A handwriting expert who examined them concluded that there was a ‘strong possibility’ that they were penned by Ives and ‘certainly not by the other wardens’ at the unit, Mr von Berg added. Callous: Ives also forged his former colleague's signature on another ticket handed to an innocent member of the public. After getting wise to Ives’ handiwork, Mr. Phillips alerted his supervisor, prompting an investigation during. which it was noted that Citroen had been spelt incorrectly as ‘Citreon’ on several of the bogus tickets. ‘Mr Phillips was asked if anyone bore a grudge against him or ill will,’ Mr von Berg added. ‘He said he had a poor relationship with Robert Ives when they worked together and police decided to question the defendant.’ Ives claimed he had not been working on the days the tickets were issued and suggested the handwriting expert could be mistaken. David Parvin, defending Ives said he continues to maintain his innocence but has acknowledged that Mr Phillips and Mrs Gilani had endured ‘a lot of stress’. ‘Mr Ives believes he and Mr Phillips shared some friendship, they had some common interests and were both fans of Neil Diamond. ‘Their relationship can be described as up and down and this was really a practical joke that went horribly wrong. ‘As time went on it got more serious and Mr Ives felt he was unable to admit it.’ Ives, who has raised money for children’s charities, is a keen member of the Whitechapel Society, dedicated to keeping the east end alive. Mr Parvin added: ‘His hobby is learning about Jack the Ripper and he has quite a collection of books.’ Ives, of Tooting, denied the charge against him. Highlights:","output":"1. A former traffic warden, Robert Ives, has been jailed for six months for issuing nine false parking tickets against an ex-colleague as part of a bullying campaign. 2. Ives was centered at Tooting police station in south London where he issued the unwarranted tickets to Kevin Phillips, with whom he had an unpleasant relationship. 3. Ives further engaged in forgery by reproducing Mr. Phillips' signature on a parking ticket issued to an innocent pensioner, Shamim Gilani. 4. Both victims suffered stress and hardship due to the unjust tickets: Phillips suffered increased blood pressure, while Gilani was forced to part with £65 from her tight pensioner budget. 5. The former traffic warden's misconduct was revealed through a handwriting examination, linking him to the illegal tickets. 6. Ives' charges escalated following the discovery of his false tickets and his subsequent redundancy from his job as traffic warden in November 2011. 7. At his trial, Ives pleaded innocence and claimed to be set up, but the jury took just 24 minutes to unanimously find him guilty of misconduct in a judicial or public office.  8. Edward Cole, the sentencing Recorder, scorned Ives for his malicious abuse of power and breach of trust, stating that his conduct was similar to perverting the course of justice. 9. Despite maintaining his innocence, Ives' attorney acknowledged the stress his defendant's actions caused the victims, explaining that what started as a \\"practical joke\\" went too far. 10. Despite his conviction and character as revealed in court, Ives has been noted for his contributions to children's charities and his active involvement in the Whitechapel Society."},{"instruction":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which musician is originally from Poland, Adam Darski or Tom Johnston?","output":"Adam Darski is the musician who is originally from Poland."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: (CNN) -- In the last week, the Apple iWatch has made the jump from unlikely rumor to a real product that's probably in development, thanks to reports showing up in various publications. The clues are planting the seeds of an Apple watch in consumers' minds. The general public has not been crying out for a better watch. And Apple prides itself on knowing what the people want before they do, and an Apple watch would be much more than just a fancy timepiece. It's not about the watch form factor, but creating a wearable mobile device that takes advantage of advances in mobile computing technology such as cheap sensors, better battery life and improved voice recognition. If executed correctly, an Apple watch could bring about a profitable industry of products to go with it, like it did with the iOS App Store and mobile applications. \\"It's unlimited, the number of wearable things you can put into,\\" said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, who imagines small companies making inexpensive products like belts with sensors that send warnings to the watch when you've eaten too much. Apple is not entering virgin territory. There are already a handful of fancy smart watches available, but most act as accessories , connecting to the more powerful Android and iOS smartphones and tablets over Bluetooth. For example, the new Pebble smart watch passes on alerts from a smartphone, so when you receive a text, e-mail, or Facebook notification it is pushed to the watch, which vibrates . Wearable technology is also booming, thanks to cheap sensors that can be used to track things like movement and heart rates. The number of wearable fitness products has been growing at a fast pace, but an Apple offering would shake up the industry completely. \\"We're finally getting some players involved, and Apple is the real one that can add some value to some of this wearable technology,\\" said Munster.

Input: Paula Broadwell, the author, military reservist and West Point graduate who reportedly had an extramarital affair with former CIA director David Petraeus, told an audience this summer that she routinely had access to classified information while researching a book on Petraeus's work as the commanding general in Afghanistan.      During a panel discussion, Broadwell said her background in the military and her continuing obligations as a major in the Army Reserve made her particularly careful not to disclose sensitive information she was privy to while an \\"embed\\" in Afghanistan in 2010 and 2011.      \\"I was entrusted with this opportunity to sit in on high level meetings with General Petraeus. Sitting in on SCIF [sensitive compartmented information facility] meetings in the morning, listen to classified chatter of terrorist talk and so forth. And I had that background anyhow, so I knew a lot of that information for my writing, but I knew there was a clear line that I couldn’t cross when I was writing it out,\\" Broadwell said in the July 2012 discussion at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado.      (Also on POLITICO: Paula Broadwell in media spotlight)      Broadwell acknowledged that her connection to the military and her role as a writer sometimes caused confusion among military personnel she encountered while working on the book.      \\"I was embedded with Gen. Petraeus in Afghanistan and it was a little confusing for some of the folks there because I’m also a military reservist with a top secret/SCI clearance and then some. So, a lot of my former peers didn’t know how to treat me. Was I journalist Broadwell or was I Major Broadwell?\\" she recalled. \\"I had to follow very clear lines of non-disclosure and signed non-disclosure agreements like my colleagues. I felt like I was almost held to a higher level of accountability because I could lose my clearance.\\"      Broadwell's access to classified information has drawn scrutiny in the wake of reports that investigators found classified records on her computer and that a whistleblower approached House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) recently to express concern that a relationship Petraeus had may have led to classified information being compromised. The discovery of the classified information on Broadwell's computer was reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday. The involvement of Cantor, whose staff said the information was immediately passed on to the FBI, was disclosed Saturday by the New York Times.      Other news reports have also raised questions about Broadwell's access to classified information, including details related to the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya in September.      (Also on POLITICO: Critics question Petraeus's timing)      In a speech last month at the University of Denver, Broadwell said that the CIA at one point was holding prisoners at an annex near the consulate, and that the assault may have been an effort to free those prisoners. \\"I don't know if a lot of you heard this, but the CIA annex had actually—had taken a couple of Libyan militia members prisoner and they think that the attack on the consulate was an effort to try to get these prisoners back. So, that's still being vetted,\\" she said, according to a video of the Denver event posted online and first reported by the Israeli media outlet Arutz Sheva.      Later in her remarks, Broadwell, said some of her information had come from a Fox News report. Fox said Monday that it's \\"original\\" Oct. 26 report did mention three Libyan militia members being turned over by the CIA to Libyan authorities. That detail does not appear in the version of the story now posted online, but Fox reporter Jennifer Griffin did include it in at least one report.      \\"We're also told, those at the CIA annex took into custody three Libyan attackers and were forced to hand them over to the Libyan February 17th forces that came to help at the annex approximately 4:00 in the morning. They handed these three Libyans over. It is not clear from U.S. officials what happened to the libyans and whether those Libyan attackers were in fact released in in the end by the Libyans,\\" Griffin reported.      The CIA has denied holding any prisoners at Benghazi and has vigorously disputed other aspects of Griffin's report, but it's not clear Broadwell said anything in Denver that was not previously reported by Fox. (Griffin first issued her report at about 11 A.M. Eastern Time that day. Broadwell, per a D.U. schedule, spoke after 7 P.M. Mountain Time.)      At the Aspen conference in July, panel moderator Clark Bell of the McCormick Foundation said \\"certain elements\\" of Broadwell's book, \\"All In: The Education of David Petraeus,\\" underwent a pre-publication security review to scrub it of classified information.      Journalists embedded with the military often have access to some classified information. The practice falls into a kind of gray area. Many embed assignments would be hard to undertake without knowing some sensitive information about tactics and upcoming operations. But, journalists don't have security clearances and are not subject to background investigations.      (Also on POLITICO: 10 fast facts about Gen. Petraeus)      In any event, Broadwell said she did not consider herself a journalist. In her remarks to the security professionals, journalists and government contractors at the Aspen event, she repeatedly used language that stressed how familiar she was with secret matters. During her relatively brief comments, she spoke of working for a Joint Terrorism Task Force, of her top secret clearance \\"and then some,\\" and of familiarity with \\"Five Eyes\\" efforts—lingo for U.S. Government intelligence information shared only with Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom.      While Broadwell stressed the access she had, she also said she was especially vigilant to not disclose any classified information because it would have been a breach of trust between her and Petraeus, whom she described as a mentor.      \\"Sometimes, obviously, the government just cant disclose sources and methods and so forth,\\" she said. \\"That was just reinforced when I had access to everything, it was my responsibility not to leak it—not to violate my mentor, if you will. I was writing about a very close mentor.\\"      UPDATE (Monday, 1:45 P.M.): An earlier version of this post said Fox News did not appear to have reported that prisoners were taken by the CIA in Benghazi.

You constantly ask yourself, ‘What are the notification requirements? What are the privacy issues?’ ”      A close friend of the Petraeus family said Sunday that the intimate relationship between Mr. Petraeus and his biographer, Paula Broadwell, began after he retired from the military last year and about two months after he started as C.I.A. director. It ended about four months ago, said the friend, who did not want to be identified while discussing personal matters. In a letter to the C.I.A. work force on Friday, Mr. Petraeus acknowledged having the affair. Ms. Broadwell has not responded to repeated requests for comment.      Under military regulations, adultery can be a crime. At the C.I.A., it can be a security issue, since it can make an intelligence officer vulnerable to blackmail, but it is not a crime.      On Sunday, the same Petraeus family friend confirmed the identity of Ms. Kelley, whose complaint to the F.B.I. about “harassing” e-mails, eventually traced to Ms. Broadwell, set the initial investigation in motion several months ago. Ms. Kelley and her husband became friends with Mr. Petraeus and his wife, Holly, when Mr. Petraeus was head of the military’s Central Command, which has its headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. Ms. Kelley, who volunteers to help injured service members and military families at MacDill, has been photographed with the Petraeuses at social events in Tampa.      “We and our family have been friends with General Petraeus and his family for over five years,” Ms. Kelley and her husband, Scott Kelley, said in a statement released Sunday. “We respect his and his family’s privacy, and want the same for us and our three children.”      The statement did not acknowledge that it was Ms. Kelley who received the e-mails, which was first reported by The Associated Press.      The involvement of the F.B.I., according to government officials, began when Ms. Kelley, alarmed by about half a dozen anonymous e-mails accusing her of inappropriate flirtatious behavior with Mr. Petraeus, complained to an F.B.I. agent who is also a personal friend. That agent, who has not been identified, helped get a preliminary inquiry started. Agents working with federal prosecutors in a local United States attorney’s office began trying to figure out whether the e-mails constituted criminal cyber-stalking.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Because the sender’s account had been registered anonymously, investigators had to use forensic techniques — including a check of what other e-mail accounts had been accessed from the same computer address — to identify who was writing the e-mails.      Eventually they identified Ms. Broadwell as a prime suspect and obtained access to her regular e-mail account. In its in-box, they discovered intimate and sexually explicit e-mails from another account that also was not immediately identifiable. Investigators eventually ascertained that it belonged to Mr. Petraeus and studied the possibility that someone had hacked into Mr. Petraeus’s account or was posing as him to send the explicit messages.      Eventually they determined that Mr. Petraeus had indeed sent the messages to Ms. Broadwell and concluded that the two had had an affair. Then they turned their scrutiny on him, examining whether he knew about or was involved in sending the harassing e-mails to Ms. Kelley.      Photo      It was at that point — sometime in the late summer — that lower-level Justice Department officials notified supervisors that the case had become more complicated, and the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section began working on the investigation as well.      It remains unclear whether the F.B.I. also gained access to Mr. Petraeus’s personal e-mail account, or if it relied only on e-mails discovered in Ms. Broadwell’s in-box. It also remains uncertain exactly when the information about Mr. Petraeus reached Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and Robert S. Mueller III , the F.B.I. director. Both men have declined to comment.      But under the Attorney General Guidelines that govern domestic law enforcement officials, agents must notify F.B.I. headquarters and the Department of Justice whenever they are looking at a “sensitive investigative matter,” which includes cases “involving the activities of a domestic public official.”      Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

F.B.I. agents interviewed Ms. Broadwell for the first time the week of Oct. 21, and she acknowledged the affair, a government official briefed on the matter said. She also voluntarily gave the agency her computer. In a search, the agents discovered several classified documents, which raised the additional question of whether Mr. Petraeus had given them to her. She said that he had not. Agents interviewed Mr. Petraeus the following week. He also admitted to the affair but said he had not given any classified documents to her. The agents then interviewed Ms. Broadwell again on Friday, Nov. 2, the official said.      Based on that record, law enforcement officials decided there was no evidence that Mr. Petraeus had committed any crime and tentatively ruled out charges coming out of the investigation, the official said. Because the facts had now been settled, the agency notified James R. Clapper, the director of national intelligence, about 5 p.m. on the following Tuesday — Election Day.      Meanwhile, the F.B.I. agent who had helped get a preliminary inquiry started, and learned of Mr. Petraeus’s affair and the initial concerns about security breaches, became frustrated. Apparently unaware that those concerns were largely resolved, the agent alerted the office of Representative Eric Cantor , Republican of Virginia , the House majority leader, about the inquiry in late October. Mr. Cantor passed on the agent’s concerns to Mr. Mueller.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Officials said Sunday that the timing of the notifications had nothing to do with the election, noting that there was no obvious political advantage for either President Obama or Mitt Romney in the news that the C.I.A. director had had an affair; Mr. Petraeus is highly regarded by both Republicans and Democrats. They also said that Mr. Cantor’s call to the F.B.I. on Oct. 31 had not accelerated or otherwise influenced the investigation, which they said had never stalled.      F.B.I. and Justice Department officials knew their handling of the case would ultimately receive immense scrutiny and took significant time to determine whom they were legally required to inform, according to a senior law enforcement official.      “This was very thought-through,” the official said.      The law requires that the Senate and House intelligence committees be kept “fully and currently informed” of intelligence activities, which conceivably might cover an investigation into a possible compromise of the C.I.A. director’s e-mail account and the possession of classified documents by Ms. Broadwell.      But Justice Department and F.B.I. rules, designed to protect the integrity of investigations and the privacy of people who come under scrutiny, say that investigators should not share potentially damaging information about unproved allegations or private matters unless it is critical for the investigation.      Glenn A. Fine , the inspector general for the Justice Department from 2000 to 2011, said it appeared that the F.B.I. was “legitimately following a lead” about possible criminal wrongdoing or a security breach.      “Some have said the F.B.I. was out to get the C.I.A.,” said Mr. Fine, who is now a partner at the law firm Dechert LLP in Washington. “That might have been true 20 years ago. But it is hard to believe that is going on today.”      John Prados, a historian and an author on intelligence and its abuses, said the case “posed several dilemmas for the F.B.I.” that would have prompted agents and their bosses to proceed gingerly.      “Petraeus is a very important person, so they would want to be crystal clear on exactly what happened and what the implications were,” Mr. Prados said. “There was probably a sense that it had to be taken to top bureau officials. And bureau officials probably thought they had better tell the White House and Congress and the D.N.I., or they might get in trouble later,” he added, referring to the director of national intelligence.      But if the security issues were resolved and no crime had been committed, Mr. Prados said, there was no justification for informing Congress or other agencies that Mr. Petraeus had had an affair.

At an Oct. 26 speech at her alma mater, the University of Denver, on the same day that Fox News reported that the rescue team at the CIA annex had been denied help, Broadwell was asked about Petraeus’ handling of the Benghazi situation.      Her response was reported originally by Israel’s Arutz Sheva and Foreign Policy’s Blake Hounshell.      Broadwell quoted the Fox News report when she said: “The facts that came out today were that the ground forces there at the CIA annex, which is different from the consulate, were requesting reinforcements.\\"      Broadwell went on to explain more sensitive details from the Benghazi attacks, particularly concerning what the real cause might have been.      “Now, I don't know if a lot of you heard this, but the CIA annex had actually, um, had taken a couple of Libyan militia members prisoner and they think that the attack on the consulate was an effort to try to get these prisoners back. So that's still being vetted.”      In the original Oct. 26 Fox News report, sources at the annex said that the CIA’s Global Response Staff had handed over three Libyan militia members to the Libyan authorities who came to rescue the 30 Americans in the early hours of Sept. 12.      A well-placed Washington source confirms to Fox News that there were Libyan militiamen being held at the CIA annex in Benghazi and that their presence was being looked at as a possible motive for the staged attack on the consulate and annex that night.      According to multiple intelligence sources who have served in Benghazi, there were more than just Libyan militia members who were held and interrogated by CIA contractors at the CIA annex in the days prior to the attack. Other prisoners from additional countries in Africa and the Middle East were brought to this location.      The Libya annex was the largest CIA station in North Africa, and two weeks prior to the attack, the CIA was preparing to shut it down. Most prisoners, according to British and American intelligence sources, had been moved two weeks earlier.      The CIA, though, categorically denied these allegations, saying: “The CIA has not had detention authority since January 2009, when Executive Order 13491 was issued. Any suggestion that the agency is still in the detention business is uninformed and baseless.”      Broadwell’s affair with Petraeus was likely known to Holly Petraeus, according to family friends. The FBI reportedly knew about it months beforehand and White House Counterterrorism adviser John Brennan reportedly was aware that there was a relationship as early as the summer of 2011.      The White House strongly denied that Brennan was aware so early.      “It is irresponsible and flat out wrong for Fox News to run an anonymous, unsubstantiated, and blatantly false accusation, as Mr. Brennan was first made aware of the issue last Wednesday,\\" spokesman Tommy Vietor said.      Broadwell, whose affair with Petraeus reportedly ended earlier this year, continued to serve as an informal spokesman for the CIA director. She suggests in her Denver speech that Petraeus knew almost immediately that the attack was a terror attack -- possibly to free militia members.      A few days later, Petraeus testified in a closed session to Congress that the attack was due in large part to an anti-Islam video and a spontaneous uprising, according to reports from the hearing.      Congressional leaders say privately they believe they were lied to by Petraeus when he testified shortly after the attack. Some of these members already considered charging Petraeus with perjury, but said they planned to withhold judgment until he testified this week. After resigning as CIA director, the CIA said Acting Director Mike Morrell would testify in his place.      All of this raises the question: What was the CIA really doing in Benghazi in addition to searching for Qaddafi’s stash of more than 22,000 shoulder-held missiles that could bring down commercial airplanes, and who in the White House knew exactly what the CIA was up to?      Jennifer Griffin currently serves as a national security correspondent for FOX News Channel . She joined FNC in October 1999 as a Jerusalem-based correspondent.      Adam Housley joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in 2001 and currently serves as a Los Angeles-based senior correspondent. ||||| Output:","output":"Task: Summarize multiple news articles about Paula Broadwell and her affair with former CIA director David Petraeus, and whether classified information was revealed.

Article:","output":"Title: 6 Effective Steps to Safely Remove a Splinter Introduction: A splinter can be a painful and annoying occurrence, often happening when you least expect it. Removing a splinter can be tricky, as an improper extraction could lead to infection or further injury. In this article, we will examine six effective steps to safely remove a splinter with minimal discomfort. Step 1: Examine the Splinter Before attempting to remove the splinter, get a good look at it. Determine its size, depth, and angle of penetration. Minor splinters can often be removed with simple techniques, while larger, deeper ones may require more advanced methods. If the splinter is embedded too deep or if you feel unsure about removing it, consult a healthcare professional. Always clean the affected area with soap and water before attempting any removal techniques. Step 2: Use Tape to Gently Pull the Splinter Out  For smaller, superficial splinters, using normal adhesive tape can help pull the splinter out with ease. Cut a small piece of tape and place it over the splinter. Press down gently, ensuring the tape adheres firmly to the surrounding skin. Then, carefully peel the tape off in the direction opposite to the angle of the splinter. This method is particularly useful for tiny, hair-like splinters that are difficult to grasp. Step 3: Try Using Glue to Get the Splinter Out Similar to the tape method, using glue is another gentle approach to splinter removal. Apply a thin layer of non-toxic glue, such as white school glue, over the splinter. Allow the glue to dry completely, which usually takes about 30 minutes. Once it's dry, peel the glue off slowly in the opposite direction of the splinter. The glue should adhere to the splinter, effectively pulling it out of the skin. Step 4: Apply Baking Soda to Get the Splinter Out For stubborn or deeper splinters, a baking soda paste can help coax the splinter closer to the surface. Mix a small amount of baking soda with water to create a thick paste. Apply the paste to the affected area, covering the splinter completely. Secure the paste with a bandage and let it sit for at least 1 hour, or even overnight. The baking soda solution may cause the splinter to move closer to the surface, making it easier to remove with tweezers or other methods. Step 5: Use Ichthammol Ointment to Remove the Splinter Ichthammol ointment, sometimes known as black drawing salve, can be found at most pharmacies and is designed to help draw out foreign objects lodged in the skin. To use, apply a generous amount of the ointment on the splinter and cover it with a bandage. Check the splinter after a few hours to see if it's close enough to the surface for removal. This method may take longer compared to others, but it's painless and effective in drawing out stubborn splinters. Step 6: Apply Epsom Salt to the Splinter Another effective method of drawing out a splinter is using Epsom salts. Soak a small cloth or cotton ball in warm water mixed with Epsom salts. Apply it to the splinter area and hold it in place with a bandage or tape for about 30 minutes. The Epsom salt solution may help to bring the splinter closer to the surface, making it easier to extract. Conclusion: Dealing with splinters can be a frustrating experience, but with these six effective methods at your disposal, you can safely and effectively remove most splinters with minimal pain. Always remember to thoroughly clean the affected area after removal to prevent infection and consult a healthcare professional if you have concerns about the splinter's depth or if an infection develops."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who Mattheson claims was trimmed into other fashions by \\"the lofty schooling of opera\\"? ?  Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".

They died of infectious diseases and childbirth in medieval Edinburgh, some 600 years ago. But now some of the skeletons of almost 400 men, women and children, whose remains were unearthed in a cemetery five years ago, have been brought back to life thanks to digital faces created by forensic artists. By examining the remains, experts from the University of Dundee have revealed how the individuals lived and died, as well as what some of them would have looked like. Experts from the University of Dundee have reconstructed the faces of Medieval Scots living in Edinburgh and Leith using chemical analysis and cutting edge computer equipment. This boy was aged between 13 and 17 when he died and could have been a patient at a medieval hospital. They are based on the remains of medieval Scots unearthed in a Leith cemetery five years ago. A forensic pathology report was done on all of the remains, allowing scientists to gain information about the population. Strontium and Isotopic analysis was used to determine the lifestyle of the people. Scientists used forensic modelling to work out the shape of facial muscles and tissues, before using a computer programme to rebuild the people’s faces. The graves of 390 people were discovered in the grounds of South Leith Parish Church in 2009, when work was underway for Edinburgh’s new tramline. They date from between the 15th and the 18th century and were found beneath Constitution Street. It has taken scientists five years to put a face to some of the medieval Scots. Archaeologist John Lawson told Edinburgh Evening News: ‘We have had a forensic pathology report done on all of the remains and that is allowing us to gain information about the population.’ Among the skeletons was one of a boy who died aged between 13 and 17 in around 1400. The date of his death indicates that he could have been a patient at a medieval hospital on the site, or one of the first burials associated with Leith Parish Church, Culture 24 reported. Scientists used forensic modelling to work out the shape of facial muscles and tissues, before using a computer programme to rebuild the people's faces. This is the face of a a woman aged between 25 and 35 whose body was buried in a mass grave with two others and a child.

The face of a man who died before his 35th birthday between the mid-16th and mid-17th century was also reconstructed. Strontium and Isotopic analysis was used to determine the lifestyle of the people. Scientists used forensic modelling to work out the shape of facial muscles and tissues, before using a computer programme to rebuild three of the people’s faces, which look strikingly modern. The face of a man who died before his 35th birthday between the mid 16th and mid 17th century was also reconstructed (pictured) Forensic artist Paloma Joana Galzi was involved in the project. She specialises in facial recognition and reconstruction, post-mortem sketches and studied Forensic Arts in Scotland, which is the only place in the world to offer this specific qualification and training. Together with other experts, she reconstructed the face of a woman aged between 25 and 35 whose body was buried in a mass grave with two others and a child. It is likely that she was a victim of a disease that swept the city and was 1.5 inches shorter than the average woman of the time, at 4ft 11 inches. Mr Lawson explained that most of the dead would have been victims of disease and some women would have died in childbirth. Around 90 per cent of the medieval population died before they were 45. Dr Kate Britton, of Aberdeen University, who was also involved in the project, said chemical analysis shows that four in five of the victims were local to Leith or Edinburgh and ate a diet mostly made up of dairy and meat. Mr Lawson told STV: ‘The results have shed new light on the lives of the medieval population in one of Scotland's largest and most important ports.’ ‘It has allowed us to highlight the lives of the ordinary person in Leith, by putting a face to these individuals and showing how they lived and died.’ Edinburgh's Old Town and Leith both have Medieval buildings, including parts of the famous castle which was a residence at the time. This is a view towards Leith and the Firth of Forth from Carlton Hill in the city. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

Keep them close to you, or ask an adult, like your mom or dad, to watch them when you're playing with your friends. By always keeping an eye on your things, they will stay safe. 2. Storing - Finding a Perfect Home for Your Belongings Do you have a special place for your toys, books, or clothes, like a toy box, a bookshelf, or a closet? These are perfect spots for keeping your things safe when you're not using them. Make sure to put your things away properly when you're done playing or wearing them. It also helps keep your room nice and tidy. If you're going somewhere, ask your parents to help you pack a bag. That way, your belongings stay together and won't get lost. 3. Disguise - Cleverly Hiding Your Things Sometimes, it's fun to hide stuff, like when we play hide-and-seek, right? Well, if there's something very special or valuable, like an important toy or a special piece of clothing, and you don't want anyone to take it or accidentally play with it, hiding it can be a smart idea. For example, you can put a favorite toy in a box that looks like it's for something else. That way, no one would know it's in there! Just make sure not to forget where you hid it. You could also ask a grown-up to help you find great hiding places. So now you know three awesome ways to keep your things safe and sound! Remember to always watch your things (Sight), put them in a special place (Storing), and sometimes maybe even hide them (Disguise). Have fun keeping your belongings safe and sound, and don't forget to ask your parents or other grown-ups for help if you need it!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Santana Gives Bullpen Day Off Santana said he would not let that frustrate him — “I don’t go by emotions; I don’t go by comments or criticism,” he said after Sunday’s game. But Sunday, Manuel said, Santana left no question over who would pitch the ninth. “He was very adamant about that,” Manuel said. “He wanted a complete game.” The Mets rebounded from their 14-inning loss the night before with an all-around performance. The offense pounded out 17 hits, including three home runs, to provide the support that has so often been lacking for Santana this season. And Carlos Beltrán provided the highlight on defense, reaching over the center-field wall to at least temporarily preserve Santana’s shutout. Santana scattered six hits and one walk, and notched five strikeouts. He needed 118 pitches, 81 for strikes. At first, when Manuel was asked about the pitch count he had set, he joked, “About 180.” “Actually, my number was 115,” Manuel said. “But when he had the two outs, I figured I’d let him go ahead. I didn’t think it would kill him.” And if his performance over all was spectacular, his first five innings were nothing short of impeccable. Until the sixth, he allowed two base runners, tying up batter after batter with his changeup sprinkled between fastballs. The Mets had given Santana three runs to work with, but it was more than enough until their offensive explosion. With a 3-0 lead, the Mets batted around in the sixth, spraying eight consecutive hits. Fernando Tatis, who went 3 for 4, and Ramón Castro each hit two-run homers over the left-field fence on either side of a St. Louis pitching change. Cardinals starter Kyle Lohse was pounded for 11 hits and 7 runs, then Randy Flores allowed four hits in his inning. “It really pumps you up, and you want to be the same way,” Santana said. “And that’s what I was doing, trying to help, trying to win this game.” He chipped in at the plate, going 2 for 4 with his fourth career run batted in, but not everything went smoothly. In the sixth, Santana dawdled outside the batter’s box watching his 300-foot line drive to right field. His bat was still in his hand as he glanced past his right shoulder, convinced that the ball was going foul. He started running only when it hit the base of the right-field fence. “It was terrible running from me,” he said. “I’ve never been in that situation before.” When Santana returned to the mound in the seventh, he was a little shakier, and it took Beltrán’s spectacular grab of a blast by Ryan Ludwick to keep the Cardinals scoreless. “As soon as I jumped for the ball, I felt the ball hit the tip of my glove, but I didn’t know until I pulled the glove back,” Beltrán said. Two pitches later, though, there was no highlight-reel catch as Albert Pujols slammed a pitch into the left-field bleachers. With the Cardinals trailing by eight runs, Pujols’s homer did far less damage than his previous one, which broke a tie in the 14th inning Saturday night. Santana’s spot in the batting order came up in the bottom half of the inning, and Manuel let him stay in. Determined to see out his ninth win of the season, Santana banged out his second base hit on a day that, no matter what, the Mets would finish in first place thanks to their first complete game since Oliver Pérez threw one in September 2006. “I think it was the right time to do something like that,” Santana said. Brandon Knight was designated for assignment Sunday morning after his only start for the Mets. He allowed four runs in five innings against the Cardinals on Saturday. The Mets called up the left-handed reliever Willie Collazo to replace him because, Jerry Manuel said, they needed a fresh arm in the bullpen after it pitched nine innings on Saturday. ... Manuel is hoping that Pedro Martínez, who is in the Dominican Republic mourning the death of his father, will be able to start on Friday in Houston. ... Outfielder Ryan Church, who is still recovering from postconcussion syndrome and migraines, performed his third day of light physical activity. He will travel with the team to Florida and if all goes well, Manuel said, will remain there to begin a rehabilitation assignment with Class A St. Lucie. Manuel also said Church could return in the Mets’ next homestand, which starts Aug. 5 against San Diego. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Santana helped the Mets win a game by pitching really well and not letting the other team score many runs. He also gave the team's other pitchers a break, so they didn't have to play that day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Macao, also called Macau, is on the western side of the Pearl River entrance, at the head of which is the Chinese port of Guangdong and it stands opposite Hong Kong which is on the eastern side of the entrance. It is made of a small narrow peninsula  sticking out from Guangdong province. The total area of Macao is about 21.45 square kilometers, and it is made up of three parts: Macao Peninsula, Dingbat Isle and Lehman Isle. Between Macao Peninsula and Dingbat Isle there are two bridges which join the two parts together, and there is also a highway between the Dingbat and Lehman Isles. Therefore, two bridges and one highway make the three parts of Macao into an integrated region . Macao faces to the vast sea and its back is the Pearl River Delta. The two big cities, Hong Kong and Guangzhou, and the two special economic zones Hula and Shenzhen are its neighbors. All of this offers much advantage for its economic development. Macao has a population of about 450, 000. This is very large against the size of the area. The average population density  reaches 20, 000 per square kilometer. It is one of the densest population regions in the world. The majority of its people are Chinese, who make up 96% of the whole population.

Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What part of the constitution are affirmative action programs based in?\\" is in \\"Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes[which?] faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress.\\".

Information:  - Alvan Fisher ( August 9 , 1792 -- February 13 , 1863 ) was one of the United States 's pioneers in landscape painting and genre works .  - Landscape painting, also known as landscape art, is the depiction in art of landscapes  natural scenery such as mountains, valleys, trees, rivers, and forests, especially where the main subject is a wide view  with its elements arranged into a coherent composition. In other works, landscape backgrounds for figures can still form an important part of the work. Sky is almost always included in the view, and weather is often an element of the composition. Detailed landscapes as a distinct subject are not found in all artistic traditions, and develop when there is already a sophisticated tradition of representing other subjects.   - Weather is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the statistics of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \\"weather\\" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.    What entity does 'alvan fisher' has the relation 'field of work' with?

Premise: \\"On nights with a full moon, the grounds stay open till midnight.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The grounds close at midnight every night.\\"?","output":"If the premise \\"On nights with a full moon, the grounds stay open till midnight\\" is true, it means that during a full moon, the grounds remain accessible to the public until midnight. However, this statement does not provide information about the grounds' operational hours during the rest of the nights when there is no full moon. In order to assess whether the premise entails the hypothesis \\"The grounds close at midnight every night,\\" we must first look at the structure of the two statements: 1. Premise: \\"On nights with a full moon, the grounds stay open till midnight.\\" 2. Hypothesis: \\"The grounds close at midnight every night.\\" The premise establishes a specific condition involving full moons, which only occur on a limited number of days throughout the year. As such, the premise only provides information about operational hours during those particular days (i.e., nights with a full moon). On the other hand, the hypothesis deals with general operational hours and pertains to every night, regardless of the moon's phase. As a result, the hypothesis is more far-reaching in scope compared to the premise. Now, let's look into whether the premise entails the hypothesis. Entailment means that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also necessarily be true. In this case, if the grounds stay open till midnight when there is a full moon, does it logically follow that the grounds close at midnight every night? The simple answer is no. While the premise suggests that the grounds remain open until midnight on full moon nights, it does not provide any information on the closing time during other nights when there is no full moon. That means it is still possible for the grounds to close earlier or even later on non-full moon nights. For example, the operational hours could be different during nights with other moon phases, such as crescents or half moons. Alternatively, the grounds might have different closing times depending on the days of the week, seasons, or other external factors. In conclusion, the premise \\"On nights with a full moon, the grounds stay open till midnight\\" does not entail the hypothesis \\"The grounds close at midnight every night.\\" Although the premise and the hypothesis share the concept of the grounds closing at midnight, the premise is limited in scope, addressing only the nights with a full moon. Consequently, we cannot infer from the premise alone that the grounds, without exception, close at midnight every night."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  Now, I have a new situation: There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations. Lake Tresco is located near a school and children will often come play at it during recess.  Answer this question please: Which lake will have more algae? A:","output":"A: Based on the provided background information, it is highly likely that Lake Mahoe will have more algae. This is because the lake is situated right next to a large farm that grows various crops for the town. The farm likely uses fertilizers and pesticides to aid in crop growth and protect against pests. When rainwater falls on the farm, it can pick up these chemicals, and runoff can then carry them into Lake Mahoe. The dissolved fertilizers in the lake can lead to an excessive growth of water plants and algae. In contrast, Lake Tresco is located near a school, and there is no mention of nearby farming activities or the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Therefore, the risk of fertilizer-induced algae growth is significantly lower in Lake Tresco as compared to Lake Mahoe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

About the only real downside to regular exercise is the transient toll it takes on the body after a hard training session. The pain and soreness after training needs sufficient time to recover from before another hard session can be performed. A very plausible theory pushed for many years is that the post-exercise oxidative stress in the body is the primary cause of the muscle damage and fatigue experienced. If you could reduce this oxidative stress, then it would allow quicker recovery, and then more time spent training. What this theory ignores though is that oxidative damage is a natural part of how the body adapts to stressful exercise, allowing the body to repair and grow stronger to allow higher levels of performance in the future. A small scale study has previously found that trained and untrained individuals who dose up on antioxidant supplements impair important exercise training adaptations such as improved insulin sensitivity and production of oxidative stress defence proteins. Now researchers have extended this study by looking at the effect of antioxidants in trained female runners, and published their findings in the European Journal of Sports Science. Twenty-three well trained female runners took part in three separate 3-week training blocks where they took either 1 gram of vitamin C, blackcurrant juice, or a placebo drink for each of the training blocks. Each of the dietary interventions involved drinking a similar volume of fruit drink of a total of half a litre per day split over the morning and evening.

Information:  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - West Berlin was a city that existed in the period between the end of the Berlin Blockade on 12 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990 as a political enclave surrounded by East Berlin and East Germany. It was east of the Inner German border and only accessible by land from West Germany by narrow rail and highway corridors. It consisted of the American, British, and French occupation sectors established in 1945 and shared economic, political, legal, and sporting systems with West Germany, but was not \\"de jure\\" part of it. It had a special and unique legal status because its administration was formally conducted by the Western Allies. East Berlin, \\"de jure\\" occupied and administered by the Soviet Union, was the \\"de facto\\" capital of East Germany. The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, physically divided East and West Berlin until it fell in 1989.  - East Germany, formally the German Democratic Republic or GDR, was an Eastern Bloc state during the Cold War period. From 1949 to 1990, it administered the region of Germany that was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of World War IIthe Soviet Occupation Zone of the Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the OderNeisse line. The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin, but did not include it; as a result, West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR. The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet Zone, while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones. East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948, and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949. Soviet forces, however, remained in the country throughout the Cold War. Until 1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation, the National Front of Democratic Germany.   - The Eastern Bloc was the group of communist states of Central and Eastern Europe, generally the Soviet Union and the countries of the Warsaw Pact. The terms Communist Bloc and Soviet Bloc were also used to denote groupings of states aligned with the Soviet Union, although these terms might include states outside Central and Eastern Europe.  - The Soviet Occupation Zone (\\"Sovetskaya okkupatsionnaya zona Germanii\\", \\"Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany\\") was the area of central Germany occupied by the Soviet Union from 1945 on, at the end of World War II. On 7 October 1949 the German Democratic Republic (GDR), which became commonly referred to as East Germany, was established in the Soviet Occupation Zone.  - The Oder (Czech, Lower Sorbian and , Upper Sorbian: \\"Wódra\\") is a river in Central Europe. It rises in the Czech Republic and flows (generally north- and northwest-ward) through western Poland, later forming of the border between Poland and Germany, part of the OderNeisse line. The river ultimately flows into the Szczecin Lagoon north of Szczecin and then into three branches (the Dziwna, wina and Peene) that empty into the Gulf of Pomerania of the Baltic Sea.  - Dieter Zechlin ( October 30 , 1926 -- March 16 , 2012 ) was a German pianist . He was one of East Germany 's most prominent pianists throughout the 1950 - 80s . In 1959 he received the Art Prize of the GDR and in 1961 the National Prize of the GDR . Zechlin was born in Goslar . He was married to the composer Ruth Zechlin , and was later married to the pianist , Susanne Grützmann . He died , aged 85 , in Potsdam .  - The Potsdam Agreement was the agreement between three of the Allies of World War II, United Kingdom, United States, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, for the military occupation and reconstruction of Germanyreferring to the German Reich with its pre-war 1937 borders including the former eastern territoriesand the entire European theatre of War territory. It also included Germany's demilitarisation, reparations and the prosecution of war criminals.  - The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR \\" ) was a socialist state in Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. A union of multiple subnational republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The Soviet Union was a one-party federation, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital.  - Potsdam is the capital and largest city of the German federal state of Brandenburg. It directly borders the German capital Berlin and is part of the Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region. It is situated on the River Havel, southwest of Berlin's city center.  - The OderNeisse line is the international border between Germany and Poland. It was drawn at the Potsdam Conference in the aftermath of the Second World War and is primarily delineated along the Oder and Lusatian Neisse rivers in Central Europe, meeting the Baltic Sea to the north, just west of the Polish seaports of Szczecin and winoujcie (German: \\"Stettin\\" and \\"Swinemünde\\"). All prewar German territory east of the line and within the 1937 German boundaries (23.8% of the former Weimar Republic) were placed under International Law Administrative status, with most of it being made part of newly-Communist Poland. The small remainder, consisting of the territory surrounding the German city of Königsberg (now renamed Kaliningrad, in honour of Soviet head of state Mikhail Kalinin) in northern East Prussia, was allocated to the Soviet Union (as Kaliningrad Oblast of the Russian SFSR, today the Russian Federation) after the war (pending the final World War II peace treaty for Germany). The vast majority of the native German population in these territories fled, or was killed or expelled by force. The OderNeisse line marked the border between the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and Poland from 1950 to 1990. East Germany confirmed the border with Poland in 1950, while West Germany, after a period of refusal, finally accepted the border (with reservations) in 1970. In 1990 the newly reunified Germany and the Republic of Poland signed a treaty recognizing it as their border.

Step 2: Establish character's action Angela is reaching for her phone to find the information she's looking for. Step 3: Describe setting/environment I need to make sure the reader can visualize the scene by adding some details about the setting. Since the characters are talking about medicine, they might be at a pharmacy or at home discussing it. Carrie noticed the puzzled look on Angela's face and decided to offer her assistance. They were standing in the aisle of the local pharmacy, surrounded by shelves filled with countless bottles and boxes of various remedies. Step 4: Introduce a potential obstacle To create conflict in the story, I can introduce an obstacle that makes it difficult for Angela to find the information she needs. Angela scrolled through her messages, but alas, she couldn't find the text from the doctor. She sighed, placing her phone back into her pocket. \\"I must have accidentally deleted it,\\" she said, her voice filled with disappointment. Step 5: Create interaction between characters Now that Angela has realized she doesn't have the information, it's time for the characters to engage in a conversation to solve the problem.

Angela thought for a moment, then responded, \\"It was over-the-counter, and the doctor said it was specifically for my symptoms. Fever, sore throat, and cough.\\" Step 7: Resolution and character growth Now that I've built up a conflict, I need to present a solution and demonstrate how the characters grow from the experience. Carrie nodded, her eyes scanning the shelves nearby. She picked up a box that promised relief for all the symptoms Angela had mentioned. \\"How about this one? It seems to cover everything your doctor mentioned,\\" Carrie suggested, handing the box to Angela. Angela examined the box, her face brightening with hope. \\"Yes, this looks like it should do the trick,\\" she agreed, relief evident in her voice. Step 8: End the story with a sense of closure As the story comes to a close, I want to make sure the reader feels a sense of resolution. Together, they made their way to the checkout counter, grateful for their teamwork. They walked out of the pharmacy with the medicine in hand, confident that Angela would soon be on the road to recovery.

Since we have -82*t and -39*t on the left side of the equation, we can combine these terms by adding their coefficients. -82*t + (-39)*t = (-82 - 39) * t = -121 * t Now, the equation becomes: -121*t - 792 = -49*t We want to isolate the variable t. To do this, we will add 121*t to both sides of the equation to eliminate the t term from the left side: -121*t + 121*t - 792 = -49*t + 121*t This simplifies to: -792 = 72*t Next, we will solve for t by dividing both sides of the equation by 72: -792 / 72 = 72 * t / 72 -11 = t So, the solution to the equation -82*t - 39*t - 792 = -49*t is t = -11."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"When did the tethys seaway shrink?\\"  Context: \\"During the Miocene continents continued to drift toward their present positions. Of the modern geologic features, only the land bridge between South America and North America was absent, the subduction zone along the Pacific Ocean margin of South America caused the rise of the Andes and the southward extension of the Meso-American peninsula. India continued to collide with Asia. The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and then disappeared as Africa collided with Eurasia in the Turkish-Arabian region between 19 and 12 Ma (ICS 2004). Subsequent uplift of mountains in the western Mediterranean region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea resulting in the Messinian salinity crisis near the end of the Miocene.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The Tethys Seaway, an ancient seaway that existed between the continents of Gondwana and Laurasia during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras, gradually shrank over time due to the movement of tectonic plates and the ongoing process of continental drift. This seaway reached its ultimate shrinking and disappearance during the Miocene Epoch, a period that lasted from approximately 23 to 5.3 million years ago. The question of when exactly the Tethys Seaway shrank can be traced within the context provided, which states that the extinction of the seaway occurred as Africa collided with Eurasia in the Turkish-Arabian region between 19 and 12 million years ago (Ma), according to the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) 2004. This collision was facilitated by the continuous movement of continents, ultimately leading to their current positions. As the African and Eurasian plates collided, the Tethys Seaway became more constrained, ultimately disappearing entirely. This geological event coincided with other significant changes in the Earth's landscape during the Miocene. For example, the Andes mountain range rose as a result of the subduction zone along the Pacific Ocean margin of South America, and the Meso-American peninsula extended southwards. Simultaneously, the ongoing collision between India and Asia produced the Himalayan mountain range, further altering the planet's geography. In addition to the shrinking of the Tethys Seaway, the Miocene witnessed substantial shifts in the marine environment. The temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea, known as the Messinian salinity crisis, occurred near the end of the Miocene epoch. This event was brought about by a combination of uplifts in the western Mediterranean region's mountains and a global decline in sea levels. Consequently, extensive evaporite deposits (salt layers) were formed, evidencing the drastic reduction in water content within the Mediterranean Basin. In conclusion, the Tethys Seaway shrank and eventually disappeared during the Miocene Epoch, due to the collision of Africa and Eurasia between 19 and 12 million years ago.

Jack subtly changes the family vacation from a lazy week of Mediterranean fun and sun in Corfu, Greece, to a tour of India, because of a story he has to cover. Maria is not as impressed by this as the kids are. Jack himself envisioned a chance to simultaneously work an easy reporting assignment and spend a little quality time with his family. But on the way to India, the airplane, a 747 owned by AM Air, an American airline, makes an unscheduled stopover in Limassol Cyprus, because of a mechanical problem. After a while of waiting inside the Limassol airport, everyone gets back on the plane -- which is then hijacked by a group of terrorists known as the August 15th Movement, led by a Serbian man named Ivanic Loyvek and his right-hand man Karadan Maldic. The terrorists take a silver briefcase from an diplomatic courier, an older man, and it appears to be an important object of their hijack. And they are demanding 50,000,000 from the US State Department in one hour, or everyone on the airplane will die.The demand is met, and Loyvek and Maldic start releasing the women and children, with the men to go last.

Question 2: How many joules are required to break the london dispersion force in between two hydrogen molecules? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Hello little buddy! Let me explain these questions to you. Question 1: To identify primary (stronger) and secondary (weaker) intermolecular forces between molecules, we need to look at the types of forces and the molecules involved. There are three main types of intermolecular forces: 1. Ionic bonds: These happen between positively and negatively charged atoms. They are really strong. 2. Hydrogen bonds: These happen between hydrogen and very electronegative atoms like oxygen, nitrogen, and fluorine. They are not as strong as ionic bonds, but still quite strong. 3. Van der Waals forces: These happen between all molecules, no matter the charge, and are the weakest of these forces. London Dispersion forces are a type of van der Waals force. To identify primary and secondary forces between molecules, first, look at the charges of the atoms. If they are charged, ionic bonds are probably the primary force. If you see hydrogen connected to oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine, hydrogen bonds might be the primary force. If none of these are present, London Dispersion forces are the primary intermolecular force. Question 2: The number of joules required to break London Dispersion forces between two hydrogen molecules would depend on many factors, like temperature, the distance between the molecules, and other environmental conditions. So, it's hard to give an exact number. These two questions are not the same, but they are related. The first question helps you understand and identify different types of intermolecular forces. The second question is about the energy needed to break a specific type of force, the London Dispersion force between two hydrogen molecules. I hope this helps, my little friend!

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who used a Pepper's ghost illusion? from the following article ?  Peter Hall directed the Bayreuth Ring after Chéreau. His version, staged 1983–86, portrayed the natural innocence of the Rhinemaidens in the simplest of ways; they were naked. Keith Warner adapted this feature in his Ring production for the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, first staged 2004–06. A Covent Garden spokesman explained \\"The maidens are children of innocence, a vision of nature – and as soon as someone appears they hastily throw on some clothes to protect their modesty.\\" While Warner relies on lighting to achieve an underwater effect, Hall used a Pepper's ghost illusion: mirrors at a 45° angle made the Rhinemaidens appear to swim vertically when the performers were in fact swimming horizontally in a shallow basin.Although the roles of the Rhinemaidens are relatively small, they have been sung by notable singers better known for performing major roles in Wagnerian and other repertoire. The first person to sing the part of Woglinde in full was Lilli Lehmann at Bayreuth in 1876. In 1951, when the Bayreuth Festival re-opened after the Second World War, the same part was taken by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Other Bayreuth Rhinemaidens include  Helga Dernesch who sang Wellgunde there between 1965 and 1967. Lotte Lehmann  played Wellgunde at the Hamburg State Opera between 1912 and 1914 and the Vienna State Opera in 1916.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the man who was the engineer on the album that had the spirit of experimentation? ?  In his book about psychedelic music, author Jim DeRogatis referred to Smiley Smile as a work of the \\"ultimate psychedelic rock library\\". Conversely, Stylus Magazine's Edwin Faust wrote in 2003 that the album \\"embraces the listener with a drugged out sincerity; a feat never accomplished by the more pretentious and heavy-handed psychedelia of that era. It is for this reason Smiley Smile flows so well with the more experimental pop of today\\". According to music theorist Daniel Harrison, Smiley Smile is not a work of rock music as the term was understood in 1967, and that portions of the album \\"can be thought of as a kind of protomiminal rock music\\". He continues: Smiley Smile can almost be considered a work of art music in the Western classical tradition, and its innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable in Smiley Smile as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces. Yet there is also a spirit of tentativeness in Smiley Smile. We must remember that it was essentially a Plan B—that is, the album issued instead of Smile. The Beach Boys recorded using what was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked many of the technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such as a replacement for what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how \\"Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this damn near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and that was part of the vocals on one of those songs.\\" Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in \\"With Me Tonight\\", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice...

Fish oils could hold the key to saving pensioners’ sight. Omega-3 fatty acids, abundant in oily fish, help stop tiny blood vessels from bleeding into the back of the eye, experiments show. The finding is important because damage to retinal blood is behind a range of conditions that can lead to loss of sight, including many cases of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of blindness in the elderly. The finding is important because damage to retinal blood is behind a range of conditions that can lead to loss of sight (File photo) AMD affects more than 600,000 Britons and the number is expected to treble in the next 25 years as the population ages.  There are few treatments – and no cure – for the condition. The research, from Harvard Medical School, focused on ‘wet AMD’, the most serious form, in which central vision can be lost within months. In the study, a diet rich in omega-3 cut damage to the blood vessels in mice with an AMD-like eye disease. The healthy fats, which are found in mackerel, trout, herring, sardines, tuna and salmon, stopped damaging immune cells from fuelling the disease, the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports. Researcher Dr Kip Connor said the fats seems to have a ‘vital role’ in eye health. It is not clear if fish oil supplements alone will be enough help save sight in people.  This is because the body may find it harder to process and make use of omega-3 as we age. AMD affects more than 600,000 Britons and the number is expected to treble in the next 25 years as the population ages.  There are few treatments ¿ and no cure ¿ for the condition. However, the findings do point to a drug related to fish oil. With existing drugs expensive, injected directly into the eye and not effective in all cases, the researchers said that there is an urgent need for new treatments. Dr Connor said that given the prevalence of AMD and a related form of blindness in diabetics, the ‘potential impact of this study is highly significant’. Patients with other diseases fed by rogue blood vessels, such as cancer, may also benefit from the knowledge. Dr Connor added: ‘It is our hope that future studies will allow us to develop specific therapeutics that harness this knowledge, resulting in greater visual outcome and quality of life for patients suffering from these sight-threatening diseases.’ In the meantime, he advises that everyone eat oily fish or take omega-3 supplements for all-round health.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the full name of the school Sir Alexander Mackenzie was principal of? ?  Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London. He recalled, \\"My first...

Or an overhaul of the tax system could take much longer than anticipated. The last major tax changes, in the 1980s, took more than two years to enact. ||||| Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is changing his tune on how soon Congress might be able to pass a tax reform package.      In an interview with the Financial Times this week, Mnuchin said that his original prediction that lawmakers would get tax reform to President Trump’s desk by August was “highly aggressive to not realistic at this point.”      “It started as [an] aggressive timeline,” he told FT. “It is fair to say it is probably delayed a bit because of the healthcare.”      Mnuchin still expressed confidence that Congress would be able to overhaul the tax system this year. In February, he had predicted that lawmakers would pass tax reform before they leave on their annual summer recess in August.      His February comments came in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, and he conceded at the time, “That’s an ambitious timeline. It could slip to later in the year.”      Last month Republicans failed to pass legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare because House GOP leaders failed to secure enough votes in the lower chamber to pass the bill. Afterward, Republicans said they were eyeing tax reform as the next major item on their agenda and planning to use the budget reconciliation process to push it through the House and Senate. The obscure budget procedure allows the Senate to pass certain legislation with a simple majority and not a supermajority of 60 senators. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The possibility of tax reform efforts failing or taking longer than anticipated is a concern, as seen with the attempt to replace the Affordable Care Act. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has acknowledged that his initial prediction of tax reform being passed before the congressional August recess was too optimistic. Mnuchin explained that the delay is in part due to the healthcare situation and expressed hope that the tax system overhaul will still be completed this year. The last major tax changes in the 1980s took over two years to implement, which could potentially mean that the tax reform process may face a lengthy timeline. Following the failure to pass legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, Republicans shifted their priority to focusing on tax reform, with plans to use the budget reconciliation process to navigate the bill through the House and Senate. The reconciliation process enables the Senate to pass specific legislation with a simple majority rather than a supermajority of 60 senators.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. He hands me a glass of the pink, frothing juice, cooled with flakes he carved off a big block of ice, smiles and refuses to take any money. A muezzin with a lilting, haunting tone calls the faithful to prayer, and his voice merges with salvoes of artillery fire echoing around the city walls. Men and women, even children, are so used to the sound of shelling that they stopped flinching at the noise a long time ago. At any rate, they do in Damascus proper, which is controlled by the regime. This weekend, children, watched by parents on sun beds, splashed around in the pool of the hotel used by the United Nations relief staff and by foreign correspondents. None of the families even looked up every time one of the government batteries, not far away, boomed like a demented bass drum. The vast majority of the shellfire is going out from the regime's positions. The rebels, much better armed now, fire some mortars back, which can be deadly, but have a shorter range than the Syrian army's artillery. It is very different in the outer suburbs, held by the rebels, which are the targets of the shelling. Among them are the places hit by the chemical weapons attack. On previous trips to Damascus, I have been to some of them, so battered now by war that almost no building is undamaged, and some streets are impassable because of the rubble. No-one goes to the swimming pool there. Most of the civilians have left, becoming part of the more than four million people displaced within Syria, or the two million plus who have fled the country to become refugees. Outside the Umayyad mosque, a young man called Walid, his hair slicked back with wet-look gel, stops on his way to prayer. Like many people in Damascus at the end of the week, he has been following the G-20 conference in St Petersburg on television. \\"Yes, I know the American president wants to bomb us, but we're too strong, because we're backed by the Chinese and the Russians. And we're united behind President [Bashar al-]Assad.\\" A Muslim cleric visiting from Lebanon, Sheikh Abdul Salim al-Harash, says he is glad the Americans no longer have it all their own way. \\"These days, other countries like Russia, South Africa and India can take decisions, and they're against military action.\\" The fact is though that Syria is still waiting for the results of decisions made elsewhere, most critically in Washington DC. A week ago, when it looked as if US President Barack Obama was on the point of ordering an attack, government-controlled Damascus was tense and unhappy. I saw what that meant at a bakery. Syrians love their fragrant, steaming piles of flat bread, and thanks to government subsidies each piece costs less than Â£0.10 (0.16) at state-owned bakeries. Unruly queues were spilling out of the bakery and down the street. Young men and boys were climbing in over its steel barred gates to outflank the women and older men who were trying to push their way up the steps to the bread window. A middle-aged woman in a headscarf and dressed in a black abaya had tears of anger and frustration rolling down her face after she was jostled out of the bread line.  She pointed at men emerging with big piles of bread. The woman, who did not want to give her name, said they were black marketeers who resold the bread for two or three times the price. The mood lifted once President Obama ordered the vote in the US Congress on military action.  Now though, the edgy nervousness is coming back as the vote approaches. Once again, Damascenes are asking whether a toxic cloud might poison them if an American missile hits a chemical weapons site, or whether the armed rebels in the suburbs would use an American attack to try to push closer to the regime's centres of power. Sources: CSIS, RUSI Syria chemical attacks: What we know Syria's chemical weapons stockpile Q&A: Threatened strike on Syria Syria crisis: Western military options Syria's options in case of US strike One Syrian, well connected to the regime, asked me what it was like to be in a city bombed by American cruise missiles. I told him what I had seen in Baghdad, Iraq, and Tripoli, Libya, which was that the missiles were accurate and powerful, and the explosions would be louder than the worst thunderclaps he had ever heard. The important thing, I told him, was to stay clear of likely targets, places like military bases and key regime buildings. Whichever way the US Congress votes, the war in Syria is entering a new phase. Jihadists, allied or affiliated with al-Qaeda, are increasingly prominent among the armed rebels. But more than ever, Syria has become a proxy war, a boxing ring with no rules in which regional powers use Syrians to fight their battles. The most significant is between Saudi Arabia and Iran, who compete for influence from Lebanon down to the Gulf.  The Saudis back the insurrection, Iran is the Assad regime's closest strategic partner. But to add another layer of trouble, the President of the United States wants to mount an attack on the regime. Mr Obama will not say publicly whether he will go ahead with the attack, using his presidential prerogatives, if he loses the vote. Even if he accepts a veto from Congress, it will not mean an end to American involvement. He will still work to punish the regime for what he says was an unforgiveable crime, which President Assad's men say was carried out by the rebels. Damascus is an ancient city that has seen generations of wars. Mark Twain wrote that in Damascus, years were only moments. Time, he said, was measured by the empires the city has seen rise and fall. President Assad must be hoping that this crisis will be a way station in America's decline in the Middle East. President Obama believes that action is necessary or others will dare to call the bluff of the most powerful nation on earth. Every house and block of flats in Damascus bristles with TV satellite dishes. Official Syrian television serves up nationalistic homages to the bravery of the armed forces. But plenty of the TVs in Damascus in the next week will be tuned to international news channels as Syrians follow the debate in Washington, and try to assess exactly what the man in the Oval Office might send their way.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"To determine if you need gas in your car, there are several methods that can be employed. I will discuss these methods as well as their relative levels of reasonableness. 1. Check the fuel gauge: The most reasonable and accurate method for assessing if you need gas in your car is to check the fuel gauge on the instrument cluster. The fuel gauge typically consists of an analog dial or an electronic display that indicates the current fuel level in the gas tank. This method is both precise and straightforward, as it provides real-time information on the car's fuel level. When the fuel gauge reading moves towards the low fuel level warning (often labeled as E or a red zone), it signifies that you need to refill the gas. 2. Calculate distance and fuel consumption manually: Another way to determine if you need gas in your car is by manually calculating the distance traveled and the car's fuel consumption. Most cars have trip meters that help track the distance covered. Note the distance at the last fill-up and research the estimated fuel efficiency of your car (usually measured in miles per gallon or kilometers per liter). Divide the distance traveled since the last fill up with the estimated fuel efficiency to find out how much gas you have consumed. This method is less reasonable due to the potential for human errors and inaccuracies when estimating fuel efficiency. 3. Keep track of your driving habits: While not as accurate as the other methods, monitoring your driving habits, such as aggressive acceleration, prolonged idling, or frequent braking, can help assess your fuel consumption indirectly. These factors often reduce fuel efficiency, leading to a quicker need for gas. Although this method is less reasonable for determining the exact fuel level, it can provide a general idea of when you might need to refill your gas tank. 4. Rely on low fuel warning lights or notifications: Modern cars often have low fuel warning lights or notifications that alert the driver when the fuel level is low. This is a reasonably accurate method of determining if you need gas in your car. However, relying solely on this may cause you to wait until the last minute to fill up, potentially risking running out of fuel. In conclusion, among these methods, the most reasonable for accomplishing the goal of determining if you need gas in your car is to check the fuel gauge on the instrument cluster. This method provides real-time, accurate information about the fuel level, enabling you to make informed decisions about when to refill your gas tank. While the other methods can provide supplementary information and insight, the fuel gauge is the most precise and convenient indicator of fuel levels in your car."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Reese wants to become a higher level agent with more responsibilities. As the result of a shortage of agents in France, he is assigned as a partner to secret agent Charlie Wax (John Travolta). Reese's first test is to have Wax released from airport detention by the French Customs when Wax does not want to surrender the cans of his favorite energy drink. Despite the apparent triviality of an energy drink that Wax could probably purchase in Paris, Wax continues to verbally abuse French Customs until Reese places a Diplomatic Mail sticker on Wax's luggage containing the energy drink, which makes them immune from customs and quarantine requirements.

Bellette painted and held regular shows – \\"a solo show every second year and a group show every year at the Macquarie Galleries\\". Her husband served as art critic for The Sydney Morning Herald for a decade and a half.In 1942, Bellette won the Sir John Sulman Prize with For Whom the Bell Tolls. She won it again in 1944 with her painting Iphigenia in Tauris, inspired by Euripides' play. The composition is set in a dry, open landscape, with several riders on horses whose appearance suggests \\"the Australian present, rather than Greek antiquity\\". The judge awarding the prize actually preferred another of her entries, Electra, depicting the sister of Iphigenia also prominent in Greek tragedy – but it failed to meet the size requirements. Both Iphigenia in Tauris and Electra were among the many works created by Bellette in the 1940s that were inspired by the tragedies of Euripides, Sophocles and Homer. Her choice of subject matter and approach placed her at odds with mainstream modernism, while she seemed to shun explicit links between the classical and the Australian. Bellette reasoned that she preferred to choose her palette and the spatial arrangements of her compositions to evoke a place's atmosphere. Critics identified the influence of European modernists Aristide Maillol and Giorgio de Chirico, as well as Italian Quattrocento painters Masaccio and Piero della Francesca, about some of whom Bellette wrote articles in the journal Art in Australia.The most distinctive feature of the artist's work was this choice of classical subjects. In 1946, Bellette's paintings were hung in at least four separate exhibitions. Reviewers commented on her synthesis of \\"the impulsiveness of romanticism... A:","output":"The answer to the question: Whose \\"romantically classical\\" approach was commented on by reviewers? is Margaret Bellette."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Metafont is a description language used to define vector fonts. It is also the name of the interpreter that executes Metafont code, generating the bitmap fonts that can be embedded into e.g. PostScript. Metafont was devised by Donald Knuth as a counterpart to his TeX typesetting system.  - LaTeX (, also pronounced as , a shortening of Lamport TeX) is a document preparation system. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to formatted text, as in WYSIWYG word processors like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer. The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document (such as article, book, and letter), to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italic), and to add citations and cross-references. A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MikTeX is used to produce an output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or digital distribution. Within the typesetting system, its name is stylised as LaTeX.  - WYSIWYG is an acronym for \\"what you see is what you get\\". In computing, a WYSIWYG editor is a system in which content (text and graphics) can be edited in a form closely resembling its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product, such as a printed document, web page, or slide presentation.  - BibTeX is reference management software for formatting lists of references . The BibTeX tool is typically used together with the LaTeX document preparation system . Within the typesetting system , its name is styled as (  mathrm ( B (  scriptstyle ( IB ) )  ! T  ! -- (  displaystyle E )  ! X ) ) . The name is a portmanteau of the abbreviation of \`\` bibliography '' and TeX . BibTeX makes it easy to cite sources in a consistent manner , by separating bibliographic information from the presentation of this information , similarly to the separation of content and presentation / style supported by LaTeX itself .  - TeX (or , see below) is a typesetting system (or \\"formatting system\\") designed and mostly written by Donald Knuth and released in 1978. Together with the Metafont language for font description and the Computer Modern family of typefaces, TeX was designed with two main goals in mind: to allow anybody to produce high-quality books using minimal effort, and to provide a system that would give exactly the same results on all computers, at any point in time. TeX is free software, which has made it more accessible to a wider range of users.  - X (named \\"ex\\" , plural \\"exes\\") is the 24th and antepenultimate letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet.  - Computer Modern is the original family of typefaces used by the typesetting program TeX. It was created by Donald Knuth with his Metafont program, and was most recently updated in 1992. Computer Modern, or variants of it, remains very widely used in scientific publishing, especially in disciplines that make frequent use of mathematical notation.  - TeX Live is a free software distribution for the TeX typesetting system that includes major TeX-related programs, macro packages, and fonts. It is the replacement of its no-longer supported counterpart teTeX. It is now the default TeX distribution for several Linux distributions such as openSUSE, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu and Gentoo. Other Unix operating systems like OpenBSD, FreeBSD and NetBSD have also converted from teTeX to TeX Live.  - MiKTeX is a distribution of the TeX/LaTeX typesetting system for Microsoft Windows. It also contains a set of related programs. MiKTeX provides the tools necessary to prepare documents using the TeX/LaTeX markup language, as well as a simple tex editor: TeXworks. The name comes from Christian Schenk's login: MiK for Micro-Kid.    What is the relationship between 'bibtex' and 'web'? A:","output":"The relationship between BibTeX and the web lies in the way BibTeX is used for managing and formatting references for documents, which can also include web-based sources. While BibTeX is primarily used in conjunction with LaTeX for creating documents, it can also be utilized for handling references for web-based content. BibTeX allows users to store information about various types of references, such as books, articles, and electronic sources, including web pages. When a user wants to cite a web-based source, they can create a BibTeX entry containing the relevant information about the source, such as the author, title, URL, and access date. This entry is then stored in a .bib file, which can be used for reference management in the LaTeX document. During document preparation, the user can cite the web-based source using a specific citation command that refers to the BibTeX entry. The LaTeX document can then be compiled along with the .bib file, and BibTeX will automatically format the citation and bibliographical entry according to the chosen citation style. In summary, the relationship between BibTeX and the web is that BibTeX serves as a tool to manage and format references, including those from web-based sources, for documents created using the LaTeX system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, Beyoncé announced in May 2012 that she would bring her back for her Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live shows later that month. Sasha Fierce was created during the making of what song?","output":"Sasha Fierce, the alter ego of Beyoncé, was created during the making of the song \\"Crazy in Love.\\" This persona was used as a means to separate her stage performance persona, characterized as aggressive, strong, sassy, and sexy, from her real-life personality. The genesis of Sasha Fierce occurred during the creative process and performance dynamics for \\"Crazy in Love,\\" which allowed Beyoncé to tap into a more assertive, bold, and provocative character. The world was formally introduced to Sasha Fierce with the 2008 release of Beyoncé's album \\"I Am... Sasha Fierce.\\" This alter ego provided a creative expression for Beyoncé to extend her range as an artist, offering a distinct and powerful stage charisma that differed substantially from her off-stage character and self-perception. However, evolution in her self-confidence and the comfort gained from her personal growth led to Beyoncé discarding this alter ego in February 2010, as revealed in an interview with Allure magazine. She felt she no longer needed the Sasha Fierce persona to express herself on stage or in her music. Even though she retired the Sasha Fierce persona, Beyoncé later announced in May 2012 that she would be bringing Sasha back for her Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live shows performed in the same month. This indicated that the Sasha Fierce persona still held a significant value for Beyoncé in terms of aiding her performance energy and dynamism on stage.

The Devensian glaciation, also known as the Weichselian glaciation, Last Glacial Maximum or the last ice age, is the most recent glacial period in the British Isles, occurring from around 115,000 to around 11,700 years ago. This time period coincided with severe cold conditions and extensive ice sheets covering parts of North America, Northern Europe, and Asia. When the Devensian glaciation ended, it marked the commencement of a relatively warmer period known as the Holocene, the epoch in which we currently live. The end of this glaciation triggered a substantial retreat of the ice sheets, causing dramatic landscapes changes. The melting of the glaciers led to an increase in global sea levels. For the British Isles, this spelled the submergence of Doggerland, the land bridge linking Britain to mainland Europe, and gradually led the British Isles to become an island. However, the direct assertion regarding a land bridge between Great Britain and Ireland is contested. There is evidence both for a short-lived land bridge and for separate Irish and British ice sheets during the last glacial maximum. Moreover, it is important to note that the retreat of the ice had significant implications on the flora and fauna of the British Isles. Before and during the Devensian glaciation, much of Britain was uninhabitable due to the extreme cold conditions. As the ice sheets retreated at the end of the Devensian, plants, animals and human populations were able to recolonize these lands.  Therefore, to build a comprehensive answer to the question, it is important to consider landscape changes, sea-level rise, ecological shift, and human migration patterns in addition to any specific hypothesis about the existence of a land bridge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This keen sense of timing, along with their natural charisma, allows Sasha to effortlessly bring about laughter and joy in their social circle. While their lightheartedness and eagerness to evoke happiness in others are certainly prominent aspects of their personality, it is important not to dismiss the possibility of a deeply empathetic and compassionate nature. Sasha's ability to quickly connect with their friends and uplift their spirits by offering a comical gesture suggests that they genuinely care for the well-being of those around them. This empathic demeanor sets the foundation for sincere and lasting friendships, balancing their humorous side with a heartfelt concern for others. Additionally, Sasha's spontaneous silliness might also indicate a creatively inclined mind. Their capacity to concoct vivid facial expressions on the spot, capturing the attention of their audience, is not merely a sign of their innate comedic flair but also a testament to their potential for resourcefulness, quick-wittedness, and adaptability.

Scott Walker and Democratic challenger Tom Barrett began a final push Saturday to connect with voters in person before next week's historic recall election, appearing at farm breakfasts and restaurants and rallying campaign workers. Walker is only the third U.S. governor to face a recall. The drive to oust him was spurred by anger over his plan to effectively end most public workers' collective bargaining rights. Walker insisted he had to make the move to balance the state budget, but Democrats portrayed the measure as an attack on organized labor. Polls show a tight race with only a handful of voters still undecided before Tuesday's election, and Walker and Barrett have been struggling to win them over for the past month. Barrett released a new television ad Saturday, again calling on the governor to explain his role in an ongoing investigation of associates during Walker's tenure as Milwaukee County executive, but the candidates mostly used the day to meet voters. Barrett, who serves as Milwaukee's mayor, spent the day on the other side of the state, starting with the Barron County Dairy Breakfast in Hillsdale, a burg of 1,250 people about 90 miles west of Minneapolis. The rest of his schedule included stops at a cafe in St. Croix Falls, a pizza joint in Superior and the state Democratic Party's office in Chippewa Falls. \\"We're going to cover the whole state here in the next four days,\\" Barrett said in a telephone interview. \\"I love it. This is the part that really gets your juices flowing. This is where I'm most confident, doing this.\\" Walker began his day before 7 a.m., serving food at a dairy breakfast on a massive farm just outside Evansville, a city of 5,000 people about 25 miles south of Madison, the state capital. His agenda called for a stop at another dairy breakfast in Monroe County before visiting campaign field offices in Hudson, Wausau, Green Bay and Wauwatosa. \\"I feel good,\\" Walker said. \\"We're not taking anything for granted. We're working all the way up to 8 p.m. on Tuesday.\\" Dressed in blue jeans, hiking boots and a button-down shirt and flanked by 18-year-old Evansville Future Farmers of America Queen Emily Templeton and 18-year-old La Prairie 4-H Club Queen Erica Ballmer, the governor handed out yogurt and applesauce to scores of people at the annual Rock County Dairy Breakfast. A smiling Walker tried to engage people in short, friendly conversations, commenting, for example, on the beautiful morning. Most didn't seem to recognize him. They simply said \\"thank you\\" as he placed yogurt cups on their plates and moved on. A handful of people shook his hand, though, and congratulated him on his accomplishments. One of them was Ken Pierson, 44, who runs a tool-and-die shop in Janesville with his father. He made a point of introducing his two sons to the governor. Later, he said he thinks Walker's changes will help the state in the long run and the recall isn't justified. \\"There's better things to do, better reasons to go after people. It's just too obnoxious for me,\\" Pierson said. \\"I see (Walker's fiscal conservatism) working in the future. It has more to do with what's going to happen tomorrow, instead of \`gimme, gimme, gimme.\\"' The recall represents the latest chapter in a knockdown, no-holds barred political battle that has consumed the state. The fight began in February 2011 when Walker introduced the collective bargaining measure. Tens of thousands of people descended on the state Capitol to demonstrate against the plan and minority Democrats in the state Senate fled to Illinois in a futile attempt to block a vote. Republicans who controlled the Legislature pushed the plan through anyway. Democrats have been looking for payback ever since. They ousted two GOP state senators in recalls last August and gathered enough signatures on recall petitions this winter to force Walker and four other Republican officeholders into Tuesday's elections. The race between Walker and Barrett, especially, has evolved into a national referendum on union power. Republicans across the country have rallied around the governor, helping him raise a jaw-dropping 31 million in campaign cash. U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, a Janesville Republican, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus appeared a tea party rally in Caledonia, just outside Racine, Saturday morning and implored hundreds in the crowd to get as many people to the polls as they can on Tuesday. They said a Walker win would segue into defeat for President Barack Obama in Wisconsin in November. \\"This is an election that will send shockwaves throughout America,\\" Ryan told the crowd. \\"It is a momentum maker or a momentum breaker.\\" What was this article about?","output":"This article is about the political campaign activities of Republican Gov. Scott Walker and Democratic challenger Tom Barrett in the lead-up to the historic recall election in Wisconsin. Both candidates engaged in various efforts to connect with voters in person, attending events, and visiting campaign offices. Walker faced the recall election due to changes he made to public workers' collective bargaining rights, which he claimed were necessary to balance the state budget. Democrats accused him of attacking organized labor. The recall election had a significant impact on the state's political landscape and was considered a national referendum on union power."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They encounter unique challenges and work together to answer some of humanity's most baffling questions about life, the universe, and everything in-between. White's portrayal of Ava is nothing short of inspiring. She manages to convey Ava's fierce curiosity, bravery, intelligence, and vulnerability while also showcasing her growing inner conflict and self-doubt from the burden of leadership.

Answer a question about this article: At the end of 1831, Chopin received the first major endorsement from an outstanding contemporary when Robert Schumann, reviewing the Op. 2 Variations in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung (his first published article on music), declared: \\"Hats off, gentlemen! A genius.\\" On 26 February 1832 Chopin gave a debut Paris concert at the Salle Pleyel which drew universal admiration. The critic François-Joseph Fétis wrote in the Revue et gazette musicale: \\"Here is a young man who ... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music, ... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else ...\\" After this concert, Chopin realized that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy Rothschild banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite). By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite, and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He no longer depended financially upon his father, and in the winter of 1832 he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over Europe. This freed him from the strains of public concert-giving, which he disliked. When did Chopin receive his first major endorsement from Robert Schumann?","output":"Chopin received his first major endorsement from Robert Schumann at the end of 1831.

These were devised and launched by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq in 1990 and had the explicit purpose \\"to shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people-centered policies\\". To produce the Human Development Reports, Mahbub ul Haq formed a group of development economists including Paul Streeten, Frances Stewart, Gustav Ranis, Keith Griffin, Sudhir Anand, and Meghnad Desai. Working alongside Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, they worked on capabilities and functions that provided the underlying conceptual framework. Haq was sure that a simple composite measure of human development was needed in order to convince the public, academics, and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being. Sen initially opposed this idea, but he soon went on to help Haq develop the Index. Sen was worried that it was going to be difficult to capture the full complexity of human capabilities in a single index, but Haq persuaded him that only a single number would shift the immediate attention of politicians from economic to human well-being.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Washington Redskins hurt by lack of indoor practice facility Or, as was the case Thursday, scrambling for their cars. The Redskins are the only cold-weather NFL team that lacks an indoor practice facility or bubble-covered field for use when the weather turns nasty. The occasional inconvenience has been an obvious irritant to the coaching staff; when snow fell Thursday, players were forced to drive themselves to an off-site fitness center because the team couldn't charter buses in time. And it may be a sore spot given the team's recent history of late-season struggles. Fourteen of the NFL's 32 franchises own and operate indoor practice facilities with regulation fields inside. Seven others have practice bubbles, two occasionally train in their domed stadiums and four have rental agreements with nearby facilities. Only four other franchises have no readily available indoor training options, but all are located in California or Florida. \\"Any time you can have a full practice, and go through it full speed and run, it's better than walk-throughs\\" in a gymnasium, cornerback Carlos Rogers said Thursday. \\"Walk-throughs [are] more mental and getting things down. \\"You can be tough and say, 'It's Redskins weather.' But to have that full practice, I think that's better than anything.\\" Six times this season, the Redskins have postponed practice or changed venues because of inclement weather. On Wednesday, the team moved practice to its rarely used, hard, artificial turf field at Redskins Park in Ashburn because the team's grass fields were frozen solid. \\"The choices were limited,\\" Coach Mike Shanahan said. They were even more limited Thursday when it snowed and the team didn't have enough time to charter buses to a nearby fitness facility. Equipment managers shoved bags of balls and cameras for filming practice into the backs of SUVs. Earlier this month, rain forced the Redskins to practice on indoor basketball courts. In September and October, players were bused to an empty airport hangar at Dulles International Airport. In August, practice was delayed five hours by rain. Each time the team went indoors, Shanahan described the practices as little more than \\"jog-throughs.\\" On other days, the team has trained outside regardless of the temperature, but its cold-weather production in recent years has been dismal. Washington is 5-17 in games in November, December and January since 2008, including its 1-4 mark this season. An indoor training facility \\"is something, in my opinion, that you need,\\" said Charley Casserly, the Redskins' general manager for 23 years until Snyder fired him in 1999. But \\"obviously I was on record 20 years ago saying you didn't need one.\\" Indeed, when Redskins Park opened in Ashburn in 1992 with Casserly at the franchise's helm, he spent little time considering the benefits of an indoor facility. But Casserly, now an NFL pregame analyst for CBS Sports, has altered his viewpoint over the years, citing various changes in circumstance: the Redskins' commitment to holding training camp at the facility; the later end to the NFL season; the possible addition of two more regular season games in the next collective bargaining agreement; and the proliferation of such facilities among the Redskins' competitors. Summary:","output":"The Washington Redskins stand as the only cold-weather NFL team that lacks an indoor practice facility or bubble-covered field, leading to inconveniences and disruptions during their training. Due to inclement weather, players were forced to drive themselves to an off-site fitness center. The team's late-season struggles might be linked to this issue since a proper full-speed practice can only be conducted in a suitable indoor facility. The situation contrasts with numerous franchises that own indoor practice facilities or have rental agreements with nearby facilities. The Redskins have postponed practice or changed venues several times this season due to weather conditions. Despite some resistance in the past, it is widely believed now that an indoor training facility is necessary to ensure the team's success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He served as the head football coach at Oberlin College, Buchtel College (now known as the University of Akron), Auburn University, Clemson University, Georgia Tech, the University of Pennsylvania, Washington & Jefferson College, and Rice University, compiling a career college football record of 186-70-18. In 1917, Heisman's Georgia Tech Golden Tornado were recognized as the national champion. Heisman was also the head basketball coach at Georgia Tech, tallying a mark of 9-14, and the head baseball coach at Buchtel, Clemson, and Georgia Tech, amassing a career college baseball record of 199-108-7. The 1906 Georgia Tech team beat Auburn for the first time, and in a loss to Sewanee first used Heisman's jump shift offense, which became known as the Heisman shift. In the jump shift, all but the center may shift into various formations, with a jump before the snap. A play started with only the center on the line of scrimmage. The backfield would be in a vertical line, as if in an I-formation with an extra halfback, or a giant T. After the shift, a split second elapsed, and then the ball was snapped. In one common instance of the jump shift, the line shifted to put the center between guard and tackle. The three backs nearest the line of scrimmage would shift all to one side, and the center snapped it to the tailback.  The 1907 team played its games at Ponce de Leon Park, where the Atlanta Crackers also played. The team went 4-4, and suffered Heisman's worst loss at Georgia Tech, 54-0 to Vanderbilt. \\"Twenty Percent\\" Davis, considered twenty percent of the team's worth, was selected All-Southern.  Chip Robert was captain of the 1908 team which went 6-3, including a 44-0 blowout loss to Auburn in which Lew Hardage returned a kickoff 108 yards for a touchdown. Davis again was All-Southern. Georgia attacked Georgia Tech's recruitment tactics in football. Georgia alumni incited an SIAA investigation, claiming that Georgia Tech had created a fraudulent scholarship fund. The SIAA ruled in favor of Georgia Tech, but the 1908 game was cancelled that season due to bad blood between the rivals. Davis was captain of the 1909 team, which won seven games but was shutout by SIAA champion Sewanee and Auburn. Ask a question about this article.","output":"Hey there! So this article is about a man named John William Heisman. He was a very important person in American sports, especially football. He was a player, coach, and even a writer and actor. He worked with many colleges and helped their football teams play really well. Once, his Georgia Tech team was even the best in the whole country! One of the special things he did was create a tricky way for the players to line up and move before they start the play, called the \\"jump shift\\" or \\"Heisman shift.\\" This made it hard for the other team to guess what they would do next. However, not everything was perfect. Sometimes his team lost by a lot of points and had trouble with other schools, like one time when a rival school, Georgia, accused Georgia Tech of not being fair in their scholarships.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Emilie Charlotte Langtry (nee Le Breton; October 13, 1853 - February 12, 1929), known as Lillie (or Lily) Langtry and nicknamed \\"The Jersey Lily\\", was a British-American socialite, actress and producer. Born on the island of Jersey, upon marrying she moved to London in 1876. Her looks and personality attracted interest, commentary, and invitations from artists and society hostesses, and she was celebrated as a young woman of great beauty and charm. By 1881, she had become an actress and starred in many plays in the UK and the United States, including She Stoops to Conquer, The Lady of Lyons, and After the divorce from her husband, Langtry was linked in the popular press to Prince Louis Esterhazy; they shared time together and both had an interest in horse racing. However, in 1899, she married 28-year-old Hugo Gerald de Bathe (1871-1940), son of Sir Henry de Bathe, 4th Baronet and Charlotte Clare. Hugo's parents had initially not married, due to objections from the de Bathe family. They lived together and seven of their children were born out of wedlock. They married after the death of Sir Henry's father in 1870, and Hugo was their first son born in wedlock - making him heir to the baronetcy.  The wedding between Langtry and de Bathe took place in St Saviour's Church, Jersey, on July 27, 1899, with Jeanne Marie Langtry being the only other person present, apart from the officials. This was the same day that Langtry's horse, Merman, won the Goodwood Cup. In December 1899, de Bathe volunteered to join the British forces in the Boer War. He was assigned to the Robert's Horse mounted brigade as a lieutenant. In 1907, Hugo's father died; he became the 5th Baronet, and Langtry became Lady de Bathe.  When Hugo de Bathe became the 5th Baronet, he inherited properties in Sussex, Devon and Ireland; those in Sussex were in the hamlet of West Stoke near Chichester. These were: Woodend, 17 bedrooms set in 71 acres; Hollandsfield, 10 bedrooms set in 52 acres and Balsom's Farm of 206 acres. Woodend was retained as the de Bathe residence whilst the smaller Hollandsfield was let.  Today the buildings retain their period appearance, but modifications and additions have been made, and the complex is now multi-occupancy. One of the houses on the site is named Langtry and another Hardy. The de Bathe properties were all sold in 1919, the same year Lady de Bathe sold Regal Lodge. What happened to them after they got married?","output":"After Lillie Langtry and Hugo Gerald de Bathe got married, Hugo went to fight in the Boer War and later became the 5th Baronet when his father passed away in 1907. Lillie became Lady de Bathe. They lived in Sussex, but eventually, they sold their properties in 1919."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Article: A recent survey of 2000 parents in Britain showed that they are often afraid of science questions asked by their curious children only because they have no idea what the answer is. Here is a list of some simple questions that you can ask your parents to see if they know the answers. Q: Why is the sky blue? A: You probably know white sunlight is made up of seven colors. While it moves in a straight line when going through space, it starts to divide as it hits \\"raised area\\" in the atmosphere. The ones with longest wavelengths pass through easily. The blue , however , can be taken in by the gas molecules   because it has a shorter wavelength , which in turn scatters   it in different directions. That's why when you look up at the sky, it appears to be blue. Q:Why does the moon sometimes appear during the daytime? A: The simple answer to that is because just like any other object it is being lit by the sun. As long as it is around 45 degrees or even 90 degrees off the sun, it will receive light and be able to be seen. The only time it is not able to be seen during its 28-day orbit   around the earth is when it is right between the earth and the sun. That's because its back , which is not lit by the sun, is facing us. Q: Where do birds/ honeybees go in winter? A: While the bird part is quite easy, since a lot of them get together and travel, the honeybee part is likely to puzzle your parents. It turns out that these busy insects stop being that active when the temperature drops below 50degF. Instead ,they get together in the lower central area of the hive  and form a ball around their queen. This helps keep both warm enough to survive the cold winter months. Question: The sky looks blue mainly because the color blue in the sunlight  _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"cannot pass through space successfully\\"? A:","output":"No, the answer \\"cannot pass through space successfully\\" is not correct. The sky looks blue mainly because the color blue in sunlight has a shorter wavelength, which causes it to be scattered in different directions when it interacts with gas molecules in the Earth's atmosphere. This scattering effect is known as Rayleigh scattering, and it is responsible for making the sky appear blue to us. The sunlight, including the color blue, can pass through space successfully. It is the interaction with our atmosphere that results in the blue sky we see."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Please answer this question: who designed the rashtrapati bhavan in new delhi?","output":"The Rashtrapati Bhavan, which is located in New Delhi, India, was designed by Edwin Landseer Lutyens, a renowned British architect. The construction of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the presidential residence of India, began in 1912 and was completed in 1929. It served as the Viceroy's House during the British Raj era until Indian independence in 1947, after which it became the official residence of the President of India. Edwin Lutyens was born on March 29, 1869, in Kensington, London. He established himself as a prominent architect in the early 20th century, with significant contributions to British architecture, particularly during and after World War I. Lutyens is widely recognized for his synthesis of classical architecture styles and elements from Indian and local traditions, which can be seen in the designs of the Rashtrapati Bhavan as well. The Rashtrapati Bhavan was designed to represent the grandeur of the British Empire in India. Sprawling over 330 acres, the estate includes the main building, which consists of 340 rooms, as well as the famous Mughal Gardens, residences of the bodyguards, staff, stables, and various other facilities. The layout and the design of the building draw inspiration from both Indian and European architecture, resulting in a spectacular blend of styles. For example, the domes of the Rashtrapati Bhavan were inspired by the Sanchi Stupa, a famous Buddhist monument in India, while the columns and other elements showcase Greco-Roman influence. The construction of the Rashtrapati Bhavan represented a massive undertaking, with building materials like bricks, sand, and stone brought in from different regions of India and skilled craftsmen employed to create intricate artwork and detailing within the edifice. The collaboration of Indian artisans and British architects also played a pivotal role in the design's fusion of styles. In conclusion, the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi was designed by the distinguished British architect Edwin Landseer Lutyens. The building's immaculate and intricate design illustrates a unique blending of architectural styles inspired by both Indian and Western traditions, serving as a symbol of India's rich cultural heritage and history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Johnson gives him a list of three cities where the President is scheduled to visit and Swagger assesses a site in Philadelphia as the most likely. This turns out to be a set-up; while Swagger is working with Johnson's agents to find the rumored assassin, the Ethiopian archbishop is instead shot while standing next to the president. Swagger is then shot twice by a city police officer, but manages to escape. The agents tell the police that Swagger is the shooter and stage a manhunt for the injured sniper. However, he meets a rookie FBI special agent, Nick Memphis, disarms him, and steals his car. After his escape, Swagger takes refuge with Sarah Fenn, widow of his late spotter and close friend, killed years before in a mission in Africa. He later convinces her to help him contact Memphis with information on the conspiracy. Memphis is blamed for Swagger's escape and is informed that he will face disciplinary review, but argues that, given Swagger's training and experience, it is surprising that the president survived and the archbishop standing several feet away was killed.

They have three decisions to make decision A, decision B, and decision C. Decision A and decision B have certain outcome, but decision C's outcome is uncertain. John would apply optimal decision making process while Keith would rather rely on his hunches.  Who would most likely assign a utility value to each of the decisions, John or keith?  Hint: An optimal decision is a decision that leads to at least as good a known or expected outcome as all other available decision options. It is an important concept in decision theory. In order to compare the different decision outcomes, one commonly assigns a utility value to each of them. If there is uncertainty as to what the outcome will be, then under the von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms the optimal decision maximizes the expected utility (a probability–weighted average of utility over all possible outcomes of a decision). Answer:","output":"John would most likely assign a utility value to each of the decisions. This is because John is applying the optimal decision-making process, which involves comparing the different decision outcomes by assigning a utility value to each of them. This method follows the von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms, and the optimal decision maximizes the expected utility, which is a probability-weighted average of utility over all possible outcomes of a decision.

Question: Given the below context:  People have used resources on and around the Mono–Inyo Craters for centuries. Mono Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono–Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points. Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other Native American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites. Gold rush–related boomtowns sprang up near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), was founded in the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, immediately northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill. As part of the California Water Wars, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased large tracts of land in the 1930s within Mono Basin and Owens Valley in order to control water rights. Excavation of an 11.5-mile (18.5 km) water tunnel under the southern part of the Mono Craters dome complex started in 1934 and was completed in 1941. Tunnel workers had to deal with loose and often water-charged gravels, pockets of carbon dioxide gas and flooding. About one man was lost for each mile excavated. Water diverted from its natural outlet in Mono Lake passes through the tunnel on its way to the Los Angeles Aqueduct system. The United States Pumice Company, based in Chatsworth, California, has mined the area for pumice since 1941. The company markets the pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring and in large irregular chunks sold as yard decoration.Apollo 16's John Young and Charlie Duke did some of their geologic training here in June 1971.

Kaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso. His time there reportedly helped form his support for citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States – a stance likely to attract Latino voters. He also learned to speak fluent Spanish, seen as a possible advantage with Hispanic voters. At Harvard, Kaine met his wife, Anne Holton, the daughter of former Republican Virginia Governor Linwood Holton (1970-74), who desegregated the commonwealth's public schools. She now serves as Virginia's secretary of education. They have three children. After law school, the Kaines settled in Richmond, Virginia, where he spent nearly two decades as an attorney focusing on civil rights and fair housing. He helped found the Virginia Coalition to End Homelessness and was a board member of the Virginia chapter of Housing Opportunities Made Equal. Kaine entered politics in 1994 when he was elected to the Richmond City Council, then became the city's mayor. Virginia's voters chose him as their lieutenant governor in 2001. Four years later, he ran for governor against Republican candidate Jerry Kilgore, a former state attorney general.

It is awarded for gallantry \\"in the face of the enemy\\" to members of the British armed forces. It may be awarded posthumously. It was previously awarded to Commonwealth countries, most of which have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours. It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians under military command although no civilian has received the award since 1879. Since the first awards were presented by Queen Victoria in 1857, two thirds of all awards have been personally presented by the British monarch. These investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace.  - Military ranks are a system of hierarchical relationships in armed forces, police, intelligence agencies or other institutions organized along military lines. Usually, uniforms denote the bearer's rank by particular insignia affixed to the uniforms. Ranking systems have been known for most of military history to be advantageous for military operations, in particular with regards to logistics, command, and coordination; as time continued and military operations became larger and more complex, military ranks increased and ranking systems themselves became more complex.  - Buckingham Palace is the London residence and administrative headquarters of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Who said apes don't have structure in their heads that human men would?\\" is in \\"The leading naturalist in Britain was the anatomist Richard Owen, an idealist who had shifted to the view in the 1850s that the history of life was the gradual unfolding of a divine plan. Owen's review of the Origin in the April 1860 Edinburgh Review bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous \\"ordained becoming\\", with new species appearing by natural birth. Others that rejected natural selection, but supported \\"creation by birth\\", included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design. Since 1858, Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen's view that humans were a separate sub-class. Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate. In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the \\"Great Hippocampus Question\\" and parodied in The Water-Babies as the \\"great hippopotamus test\\", Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains. Others, including Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace, thought that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process.

Article: Coffee experts are willing to pay large sums of money for high-quality coffee beans. The high-end beans, such as Kona or Blue Mountain, are known to cost extraordinary sums of money. Then there is Kopi Lowak (translated as \\"Civet Coffee\\"), the world's most expensive coffee, which sells for as much as US 50 per quarter-pound. This isn't particularly surprising, because approximately 500 pounds a year of Kopi Lowak make up the entire world supply. What is surprising is why this particular coffee is so rare. In fact, it's not the plants that are rare. It's the civet droppings. That's right, the civet droppings--the body waste of the palm civet. Coffee beans aren't Kopi Lowak until they've been digested  and come out in the body waste of the palm civet. Palm civets are tree-dwelling, raccoon-like little animals, native to Southeast Asia and the Indonesian islands. They also have a love for coffee cherries. According to Kopi Lowak suppliers, palm civets eat the fruit whole, but only digest the outer fruit, leaving the beans intact . While the beans are not destroyed, they undergo a transformation in the animal's body. A chemical substance in the digestive system of the palm civet causes some changes to the beans to give them a unique flavor . However, this is not the only explanation why coffee beans retrieved from civet droppings have a special flavor all their own. Another possible reason is that palm civets have an unfailing instinct for picking the coffee cherries at the peak of their ripeness. Kopi Lowak is reported to have a character in taste unlike any other coffee, complex with caramel undertones and an earthy flavor. Currently, most of the world's supply of Kopi Lowak is sold in Japan, though a few US markets are also starting to stock up on Kopi Lowak. Question: Which of the following statements is true, according to the passage? Options: A: Little palm civets eat only the outer layer of the coffee cherries. B: Palm civets somehow know the right time when the coffee fruit ripens. C: Kopi Lowak is most popular in Southeast Asia and the Indonesian islands. D: Kona and Blue Mountain are the most expensive coffees but only of average quality. The answer is:","output":"B: Palm civets somehow know the right time when the coffee fruit ripens.

Option A is incorrect because the passage states that palm civets eat the fruit whole but only digest the outer fruit, leaving the beans intact. Option C is not supported by the passage, as it mentions most of the world's supply of Kopi Lowak is sold in Japan, with a few US markets stocking up as well.

Anyway, the article had me considering what my most precious possessions are. It was difficult to choose only five, but here are mine:  An old cardboard box filled with my children's baby photos. A yellow pocketsized birthday book of special things (poems, pictures of flowers and trees, etc) given to me by my dad when I was probably about seven or eight years old. A 21st Birthday card from my mum. In it she's written her congratulations, her love, and her hopes for my future. She died not long after, when I was in my early twenties. A few ancient but very beautiful botany books that were once my great grandmother's. She was a botanist in a time when it was  ly unusual for women to be qualified in this field and I think she was probably a remarkable and very interesting woman. I'd like to have known her. A brooch  left to me by my muchloved grandmother. It was given to my great grandmother (her mother) by my great grandfather on his return from World War I. It is not worth anything in terms of money.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"The supposed perturbation of more thunderstorms in the area would be indirectly impacting a step of the process.  More thunderstorms could potentially bring heavy rains, which could help extinguish the fire and reduce smoke. On the other hand, they can also bring lightning, which could potentially start new fires or reignite existing ones, increasing the risk of more animals dying from smoke inhalation. While the thunderstorms themselves don't directly cause animals to die from smoke inhalation, they can affect factors such as the fire's intensity, spread, and duration, which then indirectly influences the number of animals that may die from smoke inhalation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: With every passing year, every new model of portentous drivel about the Nazi era rolled out by the film industry—\\"The Reader,\\" about the travails of a concentration camp guard, comes to mind—the more indispensable the facts of history become. The clearer it is, too, how flimsy these film fantasies are as vehicles for drama, compared with that history. The latest reminder of this truth comes with a PBS documentary extraordinary in its detail and revelatory power. It's title, \\"Elusive Justice: The Search for Nazi War Criminals,\\" may be informative, but it's far from adequate for a work that yields so many surprises, the greatest of which is its freshness. Moving in unexpected directions at every turn, Jonathan Silvers's film averts the burden of predictability—no small accomplishment for work on so familiar a theme. The Nuremberg trials and their drama are familiar enough to the world, but not the face and the work of the 27-year-old American Army lawyer and investigator Benjamin Ferencz, charged with the task of collecting evidence for the Nuremberg prosecutions. The terrors of entering the just-liberated camps with their hellish scenes—the film provides striking footage, more extensive than the usual documentary clips, of Gen. Dwight Eisenhower doing just that, with Gen. Omar Bradley just behind him—caused him, he tells the filmmakers, to create a self-defense mechanism. The whole scene wasn't real, he told himself—it was \\"just a case,\\" one of many to get through, in camp after camp. He would become chief prosecutor of a special German unit, the Einsatzgruppen, the mobile killing units operating on the Eastern front. He found the report of their daily accomplishments, which Germans meticulously recorded—a typical page of which is shown on screen, detailing how many Jewish children were killed, how many men and women had been murdered on a particular date. He counted. \\"When I got to over a million I stopped counting.\\" Tuesday, Nov. 15, 9-11 p.m. EST on PBS, whose dates and times vary; check local listings. Fridays, 8-9:30 p.m. EST on C-Span The film offers barely a touch of atrocity footage. Its subject is justice, or as the principals in the first part of the film, the liberated survivors of the camps thought of it, revenge—this documentary's only strained, largely forgettable moments. Far more dramatic testimony—and a startling vision of justice—comes in an interview with the middle-aged son of Hans Frank, governor of occupied Poland, one of the Germans hanged for crimes against humanity. \\"My father was a murderer,\\" Nicholas Frank declares, \\"one who sanctioned the acts of all the other criminals who got away.\\" One memory from his childhood stands out—the time a drunken American soldier showed up at the Frank house and lined the family up outside, threatening to shoot them all. His younger brothers and sisters cried piteously, he recalls, \\"but I had the feeling the soldier was correct—I belonged to a criminal family.\\" Nazi war criminal Kurt Lishka in Germany in 1971. Scene after scene brings the struggle for justice to life, in obscure cases as in the ones best known to history. A middle-aged journalist in Cologne, Germany, has discovered by chance, long years after the war, the name and location of the SS officer who had beaten his grandfather to death upon his arrival in Theresienstadt, a transit camp for Czech Jews and others destined for Auschwitz. The journalist had come upon a 1988 news article about a former member of the SS deported from Italy. He recounts his stubborn effort to get a German court to take action—a story this sophisticated professional tells with ease and eloquence, none of which can conceal the rage that had driven him. His grandfather had been murdered, the killer was in Germany, a democratic state now, and the appropriate prosecutor refused to take action—this could not be the end of the story. It was not. Candice Bergen, the documentary's excellent narrator, doesn't come to the subject of this film as a stranger. She is the widow of Louis Malle, whose haunting \\"Au Revoir Les Enfants\\" (1987) was based on Malle's memory of the French Catholic boys' school he attended during the war. The school had sheltered Jewish students who were ultimately betrayed and dragged off to Auschwitz, where they were gassed upon arrival. The headmaster, Lucien Bunel—Père Jacques de Jésus—was arrested and sent to Mauthausen, one of the deadliest camps in the Nazi system. The Malle film's title quotes his last words to the assembled students as he is taken away. The film Ms. Bergen narrates covers remarkably extensive territory—including a riveting commentary provided by Willam Gowan, a former U.S. Army counter-intelligence agent, on the so-called Rat Line through which Nazi war criminals of high and low rank escaped punishment by fleeing to Argentina, with help from sympathetic Vatican priests. Characteristically, the film enlarges on a familiar fact, taking it to a deeper level. The arrival of this considerable population of war criminals, an Argentinian journalist attests, had its poisonous effect on the nation as a whole. Most of them, he points out, were experts in exactly the kind of merciless repression and terrorization that the dictatorship in Argentina found useful. Asher Ben-Natan, who led efforts to capture Nazis. Section after section of the narrative is made rich in the same way—by taking the familiar in this history to newer and deeper levels. This is true no less of the final part on the complicated efforts to deport war criminals living in America. Altogether a rare achievement and a spellbinding one. \\"The Contenders,\\" C-Span's ambitious series on presidential candidates—14 in all—who lost their quest for the White House but made their mark, has been running for several weeks. The good news is that all the profiles are available at thecontenders.c-span.org. If ever a trip to an online viewing source was worth it, this is the one. The series began with Henry Clay and has moved on up to modern times. And with modern figures has come increasing intimacy, and C-Span callers (a minor part of the show, but in this case a lively one) who actually knew Republican Wendell Willkie, for instance, the Republican who ran against FDR in 1940. The same is true for famed gangbuster, and New York governor Tom Dewey, also fated to run against an invincible FDR, then, in a more famous and unexpected defeat, against Harry Truman in 1948. Mr. Dewey's son was on hand to provide—not altogether happily—details of family life and what his father thought and said about politics at the dinner table. Which was, apparently, nothing. Last weekend brought a delectable profile of Adlai Stevenson, who ran against Eisenhower twice and whose wit and eloquence is enshrined in the memory of a generation of Americans. The governor's son, Adlai Stevenson III, a retired senator, recalled watching a sales clerk stare at his credit card for a longish while, till he finally asked her if there was something familiar about the name. No, she told him, nothing familiar. \\"It's just kind of cool.\\" She meant an unusual name like that. So much for undying fame.

Albrecht Durer (/'dU@r@r, 'djU@r@r/; German: ['albRect 'dy:Ra]; 21 May 1471 - 6 April 1528) was a painter, printmaker and theorist of the German Renaissance. Born in Nuremberg, Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions.

After his mother died, his family moved in with his grandmother, who died when Kulwicki was in seventh grade. A year later, his only brother died of a hemophilia-related illness. Kulwicki attended Pius XI High School, a Roman Catholic high school in Milwaukee, and received a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1977. Kulwicki began his racing career as a 13-year-old kart racer. His father built engines as the crew chief for Norm Nelson and Roger McCluskey's United States Automobile Club (USAC) racecars. Because his work involved travel, Kulwicki's father was unable to help his son at most kart races, so Kulwicki's resourcefulness was often tested trying to find someone to transport his kart to the track. Even when Kulwicki asked his father for advice, he typically ended up doing most of the work himself. \\"I showed him how\\", Gerry Kulwicki said. \\"And he said: 'Why don't you do it? You can do it better.' And I said, 'Well, if you do it for a while, you can do it better.'\\"  Many local-level American racetracks host their own season championships. In Wisconsin, numerous locations held dirt and asphalt short track racing. Kulwicki started driving stock cars at the local level at the Hales Corners Speedway and Cedarburg Speedway dirt oval tracks. In 1973, he won the rookie of the year award at Hales Corners Speedway in the Milwaukee suburb of Franklin, and the next year started racing late models - the fastest and most complicated type of stock cars raced at the local level - at the same track. That season, he won his first feature race, at Leo's Speedway in Oshkosh.  Kulwicki moved from dirt tracks to paved tracks in 1977. He also teamed up with racecar builder Greg Krieger to research, model, engineer, and construct an innovative car with far more torsional stiffness than other late models. The increased stiffness allowed the car to handle better in the corners, which increased its speed. Racing at Slinger Super Speedway, he won the track championship in 1977. In 1978, Kulwicki returned to Slinger; that same year he started racing a late model at Wisconsin International Raceway (WIR), finishing third in points in his rookie season at the track. In 1979 and 1980, he won the WIR late model track championships.  In 1979, Kulwicki began competing in regional to national level events sanctioned by the USAC Stock Car series and the American Speed Association (ASA), while remaining an amateur racer through 1980. When Kulwicki raced against future NASCAR champion Rusty Wallace in the ASA series, the two became friends. Kulwicki's highest finish in the ASA season points championship was third place, which he accomplished in both 1982 and 1985, with five career victories and twelve pole positions.

Do you know that a long, long time ago, Mars had rivers just like Earth? Yes, that's right! Scientists have discovered that ancient riverbeds were created by warm spells on Mars. Now, you might be wondering how that happened. Well, it's all because of some exciting events like volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts, and changes in the way Mars moves around the Sun. Volcanic eruptions are when hot molten rock comes out of a volcano, asteroid impacts happen when a big rock from space crashes into a planet, and orbit changes are when the path a planet takes around the Sun changes. These events made Mars warmer for short periods. But guess what? These warm spells did not last for a very long time. So, even though Mars had rivers, it was not warm enough for a long time to let tiny living things grow there. The scientists studied places on Mars, like craters, to learn more about how old the rivers were. One area they looked at is called the Aeolis Dorsa region, and it is 3.6 billion years old. Wow, that's a big number! And do you know what else is interesting about Mars? Just a few weeks ago, a mysterious light was seen on a picture taken by a camera on Mars.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Erich Mielke was born in a tenement in Berlin-Wedding, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire, on 28 December 1907. During the First World War, the neighborhood was known as \\"Red Wedding\\" due to many residents' Marxist militancy. In a handwritten biography written for the Soviet secret police, Mielke described his father as \\"a poor, uneducated woodworker,\\" and said that his mother died in 1911. Both were, he said, members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Mielke was then put on trial for ordering the shootings of East Germans who were trying to defect to the West. In November 1994, the presiding judge closed the proceedings, ruling that Mielke was not mentally fit to stand trial.  During his incarceration, at JVA Moabit corrections officers supplied Mielke with a red telephone like the one in his office at Stasi Headquarters. Although it was not connected to the outside world, Mielke enjoyed having imaginary conversations with non-existent Stasi agents. His other favorite pastime was watching game shows on television.  In 1995, parole officers and Mielke's attorneys argued that he was \\"totally confused\\" and obtained his release. At 87 years of age, Erich Mielke was Germany's oldest prison inmate and had been incarcerated for 1,904 days. Days before his release, the Public Prosecutor of Berlin announced that he was \\"not interested in chasing an 87 year old man anymore\\" and that all further prosecution of Mielke had been indefinitely suspended.  According to Koehler:  [Mielke's] bank account, which held more than 300,000 marks (about US 187,500), was confiscated. Before his arrest in 1989, the most feared man in East Germany had lived in a luxurious home with access to an indoor pool. In addition, he owned a palatial hunting villa, complete with a movie theater, trophy room, 60 servants, and a 15,000 acre hunting preserve. After he was released from prison Mielke was obliged to move into a two room, 600-square-foot flat. Like all Stasi pensioners, he would henceforth have to live on 802 marks (about US512) a month. did he have any trouble in prison","output":"According to the article, Mielke did not have significant trouble in prison. In fact, during his incarceration, corrections officers supplied him with a red telephone similar to the one in his office at former Stasi Headquarters for him to have imaginary conversations. He was also able to watch game shows on television which he enjoyed. There is no mention of any particular hardships or struggles Mielke faced whilst in prison. This information suggests that he was able to find ways to pass the time and was even provided with certain comforts that may have made his experience in prison more bearable. However, it should be noted that in 1994, the presiding judge closed the proceedings, ruling that Mielke was not mentally fit to stand trial indicating he might have been dealing with mental health issues during his time in prison."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Help as much as you can. The battle lines are drawn once again. U.S. law enforcement agencies and Silicon Valley are getting ready to face off on the issue of privacy. This latest battle is focused on a 30-year-old law on government access to electronic communications and associated data. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act was a forward-looking statute when enacted in 1986, but technology has dramatically outpaced the ECPA. The U.S. Congress has been looking into ways to revise the law in order to preserve the privacy of internet users while also preserving the legal tools necessary for government agencies to enforce the law and protect the public. The late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis called privacy \\"the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by a free people.\\" The Senate Judiciary Committee this week is considering an amendment to the ECPA that would expand the government's ability to collect data using a National Security Letter, which doesn't require a court order. The amendment would authorize the FBI to demand a person's internet browser history and internet protocol address, enabling investigators to see what websites a person visits, how much time is spent on a particular site and the location of the internet user — all without judicial oversight. The FBI contends that such data is covered implicitly under current statute, which was written years ago and only explicitly covers data normally associated with telephone records. FBI Director James Comey has said the amendment is needed to fix \\"a typo\\" in the ECPA that has hindered the bureau's ability to work in \\"a very, very big and practical way.\\" But a letter sent earlier this week warned Congress that such an amendment is opposed by tech giants and civil liberties organizations. \\"This expansion of the NSL statute has been characterized by some government officials as merely fixing ‘a typo' in the law,” the letter said. \\"In reality, however, it would dramatically expand the ability of the FBI to get sensitive information about users' online...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: JUST before the Carter Administration was ushered out into political darkness, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration indulged itself in one last orgy of rule-making. By Jan. 19, the agency had proposed rules requiring, among other things, that auto makers install tire pressure warning lights on dash boards, redesign seat belts to conform to the agency's ideas of comfort and convenience, put a sticker on each new car window to tell how it performed in a 35-mile-per-hour crash test and soften front bumpers to protect pedestrians. It was a fitting finale for the Carter years. For a few hours, unrestrained by the White House or by the Cabinet Secretary for whom they nominally worked, the highway administration rule makers simply ran wild. Of course, none of it mattered. Detroit suffered one last flare-up of its ulcers before the new team busily set about sweeping up what the old had left behind. In a few weeks, the episode was just another fat, dusty volume of the Federal Register. But this final regulatory binge typified the difficulties the Carter Administration had in managing and making sense of its regulatory responsibilities. It was not for lack of trying. In 1978 the White House established a regulatory council that reviewed and categorized the handiwork of its members, the regulators. Later a regulatory analysis group was set up to review the economic impact of new proposals. But in the end it was a losing battle. The regulators were all capable, industrious and committed. They controlled the flow of facts, the timing and the range of choices. In most cases their policies were backed by large Democratic constituencies that the White House was loathe to challenge. The regulators usually had the last word. The problem was more than one of failed management. At the heart of the regulatory tug-of-war there was a basic lack of agreement over priorities and assumptions. White House economists accused the regulatory agencies of fudging the facts and playing to the galleries. The regulators tended to see those who challenged their proposals as flacks for private interests. These internal disputes, of course, mirrored the mistrust and hatred between the regulators and private industry. In the background, Ralph Nader kept up a steady howl of indiscriminate outrage, calling for the heads of all who failed his inquisition. To a degree, the lack of trust was a product of the regulatory system itself. The lawyers who designed the quasi-judicial process for setting social regulations presumed that no one involved could be trusted. Industry, with its narrow economic interests, and government, which could too easily be co-opted, could not be left alone together. Eventually, this premise became a self-fulfilling prophecy. The system called for pitched battle by legal brief, followed by an administrative decision, followed by more pitched battles in court. Low-decibel discussions, negotiations and compromise were discouraged, and in some cases were illegal. In their zeal to make the process fair, the lawyers created a multi-round, bare-knuckle boxing match, whose results often served no one's interest. Occasionally there were efforts by one party or another to break out of the vicious cycle. But eventually the process dominated the best intentions and everyone had good reason to distrust everyone else. In the year I was in the Department of Transportation I watched highway administration officials suppress and misuse information to bolster their theories, and I saw a top official of a major United States auto maker baldly lie to the Secretary of Transportation as he read cost figures from a page in front of him. ONE unfortunate outcome of this system is that there is little progress toward worthwhile social goals such as safer cars. For example, more than a decade ago the Ford Motor Company was considering installing airbags in a line of luxury cars to test their effectiveness and acceptance by consumers. Shortly before a decision was to be made, Federal safety officials issued a proposed rule to require the bags in both front and back seats. Stunned, Ford abandoned its plan and enlisted its lawyers and lobbyists in the antiairbag war in Washington. Today, 12 years later, not only are airbags unavailable, but there has never even been an adequate test of this life-saving technology. The system also often blinds the participants to their common and overriding interests. In the last four years, while Detroit and Washington shouted at each other over regulations, the Japanese quietly captured a quarter of the American auto market. Government and industry officials who should have been worrying about the productivity and competitiveness of our industry were plotting strategies for the next round of the airbag war. The new Administration is poised to roll back a number of recent regulations. But what is really needed is a thorough-going reform of the process. We must have the courage and the trust to let government and industry officials sit down calmly together to reach agreement on reasonable social objectives, strategies and timetables. Much could be done. For example, despite the highway administration's historic focus on the car and the road, it is the driver who is most responsible for highway safety. Drivers who simply buckle up and cut out excessive alcohol can reduce their chances of dying on the highway by more than half. Government and the auto industry should together undertake aggressive advertising and information campaigns to convince the public to adopt these two simple rules. As for the car itself, the objective should be to create a market for safer cars rather than continuing to mandate their design. Just as higher gas prices mooted government fuel economy regulations, the publication of technically accurate and reliable crash tests could instantly place a wonderful market premium on safer vehicles. The insurance industry, which has generally fought on the side of the regulators, could be a more constructive force - if rates rewarded seat belt users and buyers of safer cars. Criticism of past regulation does not mean that government should abdicate its role as the promoter of social objectives such as cleaner air and safer cars. The market, left to its own devices, will not always realize many of the objectives we have for our society. But government intervention into the economy must break out of its rigid combative mold. Other nations seem to find more cooperative and constructive ways for industry and government to move toward social progress. Before we can do the same, we must rewrite the laws that force government and industry to be antagonists rather than allies.

In 1874, Disraeli's ambitious foreign policy, aimed at creating a British empire, is voted down by the House of Commons after a speech by his great rival, William Gladstone. Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe. Disraeli was not fooled; he has hired Foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. When Foljambe asks Charles if Myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, Charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that Foljambe has guessed correctly. Mrs. Travers orders Foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters. Disraeli soon discovers what has happened.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Matt Kenseth shocks himself, Edwards' battle within, more Texas notes Matt Kenseth, who hadn't won a Sprint Cup race since 2009, led for 169 laps at Texas -- including the final 13 (passing Kurt Busch). Matt Kenseth wasn't sure he'd ever reach victory lane again. Not winning for two years will do that to the mind of even a former champion. An otherwise mundane race was somewhat spiced with desperate pit strategies -- and Carl Edwards may or may not have obliterated a bird, which he wryly noted is a bad move for a guy so associated with a duck. 1. Ford had a productive weekend. Kenseth ended a 76-race Sprint Cup winless streak (dating back to his 2009 win at Fontana, Calif., the week after he won the Daytona 500) as all three of his Roush Fenway teammates -- Edwards (third), Greg Biffle (fourth) and pole-sitter David Ragan (seventh) -- and Ford-driving Marcos Ambrose (sixth) finished in the top 10. Edwards won the Nationwide race on Friday, putting the Mustang in Victory Lane for the first time. Also, Scott Maxwell and Joe Foster claimed the first competition victory for the Boss 302R in the Grand Am Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge at Barber Motorsports Park (Ala.) \\"Our cars are good right now, and we are enjoying it,\\" said Edwards, the new Sprint Cup points leader. \\"We just have to keep going.\\" 2. Kurt Busch found inspiration in his desperation. The 2004 series champion was on his way to another lackluster performance after finishing 17th at Fontana, 16th at Martinsville and falling from the points lead to fourth. By Lap 140 on Saturday night, Busch was carping about how hard he had to drive the No. 22 Dodge simply to maintain pace. So crew chief Steve Addington got creative after making major changes to the car with 135 laps remaining. \\"I didn't think we would be that much off to start the race,\\" Addington said. \\"It seemed like when we adjusted on the car, we would get different results. It's a bit of a mystery. We had to use [a different] strategy and we really shouldn't have to do that. We should be up front challenging for wins. We just need to get a handle on this thing right now.\\" Busch was able to stretch his fuel to about four laps beyond the 54-lap projected window on his next-to-last stop, giving him the lead with 77 laps remaining. Forced to pit with 55 laps left, he surrendered the lead again, took it back as those on conventional strategy pitted -- waiting for an expected caution. But the last 114 laps, amazingly, were run caution-free, and Busch ceded the front spot and a nine-second lead for the final time to Kenseth with 13 laps left. \\"Just a hard-fought battle all night,\\" said Busch, who dropped another rung to fifth in points. \\"We qualified 10th, finished 10th. We led laps when we were off-sequence, but overall a hard fought battle to get the car dialed-in once again. We struggle to make adjustments as we go. We got something towards the end to make something of it.\\" At least Busch made it. Tony Stewart, on a similar tack, ran dry on the last lap and fell from third to 12th. 3. Marcos Ambrose is either getting better or just getting in the way. The Tasmanian, in his third full Sprint Cup season, finished sixth to improve to 19th in points, made more noteworthy by the amount of carping he induced from his competitors. A week after Dale Earnhardt Jr. was lauded for his decision not to turn Kevin Harvick to break his now-100-race winless streak at Martinsville, he opined loudly over his team radio about doing just that to Ambrose. They were jostling for seventh place on Lap 245 of 334 at the time. Jimmie Johnson later had a brush with the No. 9 Ford. 4. Denny Hamlin might really be in trouble ... or maybe not. The turnaround of his miserable follow-up to a 2010 runner-up campaign was supposed to occur last week at Martinsville, where he swept last year's Cup races. (Hamlin led 89 laps but finished 12th last week because of a fuel mileage issue and pit crew issues, he said.) The turnaround was sure, then, to occur this week at Texas Motor Speedway, where he had swept the Sprint Cup races in 2010. Instead, Hamlin finished an inconsequential 15th, a lap down; and now, his early-season body of work resembles that of a driver suffering through the aftereffects of a draining and unsuccessful attempt to end Jimmie Johnson's tenure as Sprint Cup champion. Hamlin has one top-10 (7th at Las Vegas) in seven races, finished 20th or worse three times and 30th or worse twice. He is 20th in points and languishing, but wasn't as cryptic as in recent weeks in assessing the race. \\"Really, we just had one bad run and that was the one that got us caught a lap down and we just couldn't get it back,\\" he said. \\"We stayed in the 'lucky dog' position for the last -- it seemed like 150 laps, but just never got the caution to capitalize on it. Just a little frustrating, but still once again we didn't have a 15th-place car. We had about a seventh or eighth-place car, somewhere in that neighborhood.\\" 5. Do not eat Carl Edwards' mom's new dishes. Rarely does a son dare criticize his mother's cuisine. Even less frequently does he do it on live national television. But Edwards spent 501 miles in gastric distress on Saturday night, requiring healthy dosings of anti-ohmygodohmygod medicine during pit stops to avert the use of a back-up driver Ricky Stenhouse Jr. According to SB Nation, the culprit was a first-time recipe for rice and beans. Clint Bowyer was thoroughly amused by the whole thing, saying after the race that he'd do the cooking for Edwards next week (Hamburger Helper? .... better give a couple days). When asked how seriously he considered evacuating the No. 99 Ford mid-race, the Missourian fired at jayhawker Bowyer: \\"I guess if I was from Kansas or something I might have to do that. But we don't do that where I am from, do we Clint?\\" Nausea and regional pride. Tremendous. Now pass that gastric goulash.","output":"Matt Kenseth won his first Sprint Cup race since 2009 at Texas, leading for 169 laps.

Are You Experienced was an immediate commercial success, selling more than one million copies within seven months of its release. Reviewing the album in 1967, Melody Maker praised its artistic integrity and the Experience's varied use of tempo. NME's Keith Altham said it is \\"a brave effort by Hendrix to produce a musical form which is original and exciting\\". However, not all contemporary writers gave the LP a favorable review; in November 1967, Rolling Stone's Jon Landau wrote that although he considered Hendrix a \\"great guitarist and a brilliant arranger\\", he disapproved of his singing and songwriting. He criticized the quality of the material and described the lyrics as inane: \\"Above all this record is unrelentingly violent, and lyrically, inartistically violent at that.\\"Many music critics have since named Are You Experienced as one of the greatest rock and roll debut albums. Journalist Ritchie Unterberger described it as \\"one of the definitive albums of the psychedelic era.\\" Author Chris Smith said the release was \\"a landmark in a summer of landmark albums\\". Noe Goldwasser, the founding editor of Guitar World magazine, called it \\"a veritable textbook of what a musician can do with his instrument\\" and \\"the measure by which everything ... in rock and roll has been compared since.\\" According to music journalist Charles Shaar Murray, the album \\"completely changed notions of what a guitar could sound like, or indeed, what music could sound like\\", while The Miami Herald credited Are You Experienced with introducing acid rock, classic rock, and the guitar aesthetic of heavy metal.

Later, during the summer of 1969, I was pleased to see this film was still playing at a prominent cinema in Leicester Square, London, after it had won the Academy Award for Best Picture of the previous year. Th success of \\"Oliver!\\" on both the stage and screen reminded me that not all talent begins on Broadway and ends in Hollywood. This legendary story by Charles Dickens, which is part of the literary heritage of all English-speaking people, was admirably brought to the London stage by Lionel Bart of Great Britain. His charming musical then became a hit in New York and throughout the world. The film adaptation was made in England during the summer of 1967 and then released in 1968. The sets and musical numbers are mind boggling. The song \\"Who Will Buy?\\" required hundreds of actors and the British film director truly deserved his Oscar for putting it all together in a seamless manner. Some Canadian and American talent is also part of this wonderful production, but mostly it is a tribute to the fine craftsmanship of the British film studios, such as Shepperton. Good show!

He selected two isotopes, sample A and sample B. Sample A had longer half-life, but sample B had shorter half-life. After some time he checked sample A when its one half-life had passed. He noted it as sample A1. Then he came back to see it again when two half-lives had passed. He noted it as sample A2.  Hint: Each radioactive isotope has a characteristic decay time period—the half-life—that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an exponential decay process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth. A:","output":"To answer the question, let's break down the information given and analyze step by step: 1.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who has a hallucination that they are buried alive? ?  After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive.  He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself.  He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus.  Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding.  Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended.  One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel.  There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point.  In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised 1,000.  Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine.  His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the 1,000 he had collected. An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring.  The author, along with several others, are forced to multiple polling locations around Baltimore to place multiple votes for the candidate for mayor.

The burning of fuels that provides the energy to maintain our civilization and the metabolism of foods that furnish the energy that keeps us alive both involve redox reactions. All combustion reactions are also redox reactions. A typical combustion reaction is the burning of methane, the principal component of natural gas (Figure 5.5 \\"The Burning of Natural Gas\\"). CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O In respiration, the biochemical process by which the oxygen we inhale in air oxidizes foodstuffs to carbon dioxide and water, redox reactions provide energy to living cells.

But good luck telling that to President Donald Trump or a dozen or so Democrats contemplating a White House bid two years from now. Trump has already been out on the campaign trail testing themes for his expected re-election bid. \\"Our new slogan for 2020. Do you know what it is? Keep America great!\\" Trump told cheering supporters at a recent rally in Elkhart, Indiana. But Trump also made it clear he is concerned about this year's congressional midterm elections, in which opposition Democrats are favored to make gains.  \\"And all of the great momentum that we are having as a country on jobs, on safety, on security, on our military — it is all at stake in November,\\" Trump warned at the Indiana rally.  2020 is expected to produce a bumper crop of Democratic presidential contenders who will vie for their party's nomination. Those in the group range from the well-known like former Vice President Joe Biden and 2016 contender Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to a younger, less recognizable contingent that includes California Senator Kamala Harris and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Several potential Democratic presidential contenders spoke about the party's future at a recent conference in Washington hosted by the Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning public policy institute in Washington. Among the speakers was Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who said Democrats face an uphill battle to win back control of Congress this year because of long-standing Republican advantages in winning a majority in the House of Representatives. \\"We can't climb that hill by ignoring the millions of Americans who are angry and scared about the damage this president and this Republican Party have done to our democracy,\\" Warren told the conference to a round of applause. \\"We can't ignore it and we shouldn't want to ignore it.\\" Question: The democrats probably believe Options: - they will have to campaign hard   - they will have a good candidate   - they will hove trouble making a decision as to which candidate   - not enough information === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"The Democrats probably believe they will have to campaign hard in order to win the 2020 U.S. presidential election. There is a diverse group of potential contenders who will vie for the Democratic party's nomination, ranging from well-known politicians like former Vice President Joe Biden and 2016 contender Senator Bernie Sanders, to a younger, less recognizable group that includes Senators Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand. Democrats are also aware of the challenges they face in winning back control of Congress, as highlighted by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren during a recent conference hosted by the Center for American Progress. Warren emphasized the need to address the concerns of millions of Americans who are angry and scared about the damage caused by President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. As such, the Democrats recognize the importance of not ignoring these concerns and the uphill battle they face in the upcoming elections. In light of this, it is reasonable to conclude that the Democrats believe they will have to campaign hard to gain an advantage over their competitors. This will involve selecting a strong candidate who can effectively convey the party's message and appeal to a wide range of voters, while also acknowledging the potential challenges in making a decision as to which candidate would be the best fit for the party's goals. Although there may be some uncertainty and difficulty in choosing their candidate, the awareness of these potential obstacles further reinforces the Democrats' belief in the need for a strong and dedicated campaign in the 2020 U.S. presidential election."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The three Kansas militiamen planned to blow up an apartment complex housing Somali refugees during the 2016 presidential election, unleashing what one of them called \\"Crusades 2.0.\\" But their plan was foiled after their arrest just weeks before the election, highlighting the changing enemy list of a movement founded on the back of anti-government activism a generation ago. And with the election of a president whose policies many militia members support, the urge to confront the government appears to have lost some of its urgency. Instead of railing at the government, they have in recent years turned their venom against new-found foes: Muslims, immigrants, the Antifa. \\"Some of the militia groups have been refocusing their attention on secondary enemies for the movement,\\" said Mark Pitcavage, who researches extremism at the Anti-Defamation League civil rights group. Often lumped together with other right-wing groups, the anti-government movement comes in different forms. There are the \\"preppers,\\" so called because they stockpile water, food and other essentials in preparation for civil unrest. There are the \\"survivalists,\\" people who learn skills to “live off the land” in case of a disaster. There are “sovereign citizens” such as the suspect in the recent shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee who are opposed to paying taxes and believe they should decide which laws to follow. And then there are the militiamen who conduct regular military-style training to resist a government they see as engaged in a global plot to take away their guns and constitutional rights. The modern militia movement dates back to a series of events in the early 1990s, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Among them: the 1992 election of Democratic President Bill Clinton and an FBI attack the following year on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, an event seen as \\"evidence of an out of control government willing to attack citizens.\\" Under Clinton, the number...

He Seemed to Know Death Was Coming      EXCLUSIVE      There's evidence Prince's death was not unexpected, because we've learned the superstar started writing his memoirs just a month ago.      Sources connected with Prince tell us, they were surprised he started the project ... something he had been mulling over for years but not acting upon. We're told he had finished around 50 pages at the time of his death.      What's more ... last Saturday night, after Prince was admitted to a hospital for what his reps called the flu, he addressed a crowd at Paisley Park near his home and said, \\"Wait a few days before you waste any prayers.\\"      Whatever was ailing Prince, it was serious enough to sideline him several weeks ago from doing 2 shows, and it clearly lingered because he had to make an emergency landing last Friday, just 48 minutes from his home.      Our sources say Prince was upset the news got out that he had been hospitalized, and feared people would think he was already dead. ||||| It was only a month ago that the publisher Spiegel & Grau announced that Prince would be publishing his memoir in the fall of 2017. But the musical artist and legend died suddenly Thursday at the age of 57, and how much of his book he had completed remains unclear.      Random House, of which Spiegel & Grau is an imprint, said Thursday it had no comment on the status of the memoir, which was tentatively titled \\"The Beautiful Ones,\\" after a track on Prince's album \\"Purple Rain.\\"      TMZ reported Thursday that Prince, formerly known as the Artist Formerly Known As Prince, had finished roughly 50 pages after starting writing only a month ago.      So what happens next? That's not precisely clear. Prince did have a collaborator for the book, but to what extent they'd be teaming up —and whether that partner will go forward — isn't clear either.      For his memoirs, Prince had said he would be working with his brother Dan. \\"He's a good critic, and that's what I need. He's not a yes-man at all, and he's really helping me get through this,\\" Prince said in March at a music industry event. \\"We're starting from the beginning from my first memory and hopefully we can go all the way up to the Super Bowl.\\"      Photo: Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images      Prince was widely regarded as an artistic pioneer whose tastes and collaborations knew no bounds. His music blended everything from rock and jazz to pop and rhythm and blues, while he donned exuberant, flamboyant outfits of all colors and textures. He performed and collaborated with seemingly everyone, from the likes of Beyoncé to Madonna.      \\"Prince is a towering figure in global culture and his music has been the soundtrack for untold numbers of people — including me — for more than a generation,\\" said Chris Jackson, executive editor at Spiegel & Grau, in announcing the memoir recently. \\"Millions of words have been written about Prince — books and articles, essays and criticism — but we're thrilled to be publishing Prince's powerful reflections on his own life in his own incandescently vivid, witty, and poetic voice.\\"      Will the world ever learn what, precisely, Prince had to say in those reflections?

Her mother was extremely protective, and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called \\"Kensington System\\", an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller, Sir John Conroy, who was rumoured to be the Duchess's lover. The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them. The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's bastard children, and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety. Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night, studied with private tutors to a regular timetable, and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her King Charles spaniel, Dash.

Article: It is said that in the United States much has been told about that anyone can become rich and successful if he works hard and has some good luck. Yes, when one becomes rich he wants people to know it. And even though he does not become very rich, he wants people to think that he is. That's what \\"Keeping up with the Joneses \\" is about The expression was first used in 1913 by a young American called Arthur Momand looked around him and noticed that many people did things to keep up with their neighbours. He called it \\"Keeping up with the Joneses\\", because Jones is a very common name in the United States. \\"Keeping up with the Joneses\\" came to mean keeping up with the people around you. Momand's series appeared in different newspapers across the country for over 28 years. People never seem to get tired of keeping up with the Joneses. That is one reason why they read \\"right\\" books, go to \\"right\\" universities and eat in \\"right\\" restaurants. Every city has an area where people want to live because others will think better of them if they do. And there are Joneses in every city of the world. But one must get tired of trying to keep up with the Joneses, because no matter what one does, Mr Jones always seems to be ahead. Question: What does the author mean when he says \\"right\\" books?

The term \\"right\\" adds a touch of social pressure and conformity to reading these books, suggesting that one isn't simply reading for pleasure or knowledge, but also to maintain or improve their social status.

He then knocked her down and ran face forward at the camera so that the viewers got a good look at him. Viewers were then shown a lineup of six men. They were asked to decide if the mugger was in the lineup and, if so, to tell which one he was. In effect, then, they had seven choices.

Definition: In this task, you are given inputs k, i, and A, where k and i are integers and A is a list. You need to find every ith element of A starting from the kth element. The process stops when the position of the next ith element exceeds the length of the list. Input: 4, 10, ['X', 's', 'N', '387', '7509', '1297', '1729', '6529', 'M', 'W', 'w', '9341', '9315', 'x', '829', '7571', 'v', 'A', '4331', '8207', 'M', 'j', 'Q', 'i', 'R'] Output:","output":"['7509', 'w', 'v']  To better explain the process: Step 1: We are given the following list A:  ['X', 's', 'N', '387', '7509', '1297', '1729', '6529', 'M', 'W', 'w', '9341', '9315', 'x', '829', '7571', 'v', 'A', '4331', '8207', 'M', 'j', 'Q', 'i', 'R'] Step 2: We start from the kth (4th) element, considering that the list is 0-indexed:  '387'(k=3) Step 3: We move i positions (10 positions) ahead from the kth element: 1. '7509' (k=4+10=14) 2. 'w' (k=14+10=24) 3. If we try to move another 10 positions ahead (k=24+10=34), it would exceed the length of the list (which is 25). So, we stop the process.
