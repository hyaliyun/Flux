Passage: When a British secret agent is murdered in the line of duty, agent Karen Bentley inherits the mission from her partner. The mission is to deliver a flight plan for a hundred American bomber planes to a British agent in Chicago. The plans are hidden in a small medallion of a scorpion that Karen wears. Karen arrives to New York City from Europe by ship and escapes the clutches of enemy agents by hiding in a variety theatre. To improve her chances of getting away and get a good cover, she charms an actor named Larry Haines, who performs a small act called \\"Percy\\" involving his penguin. Larry tells her that he and his penguin are heading west to Hollywood to appear in a film. They have a contract paying 500 a week for Percy and 30 for him as his trainer. Karen accompanies Larry to the train and plants the medallion on him before he boards the train. Unaware of what he is now carrying, Larry leaves New York, and the German agents, Mme. Stephanie Runick and Dr. Hugo Streger, are also on board the same train, keeping a close eye on Larry. The agents manage to scare up Larry with their odd behavior, and in Albany, Karen boards the train. Larry meets Karen and finds her a little too odd, since she didn't board the train back in New York with him. When the train stops for three hours in Chicago, Karen manages to steal Larry's suitcase, which now contains the jacket where the medallion is hidden. Larry follows Karen and the suitcase to an address where she is supposed to meet an agent, but Karen finds the agent murdered and has to change her plans. She is instructed to continue to Los Angeles instead.","output":"1) Who inherits the mission from her partner after a British secret agent is murdered in the line of duty?

The makers of the movie Pearl Harbor have behaved differently. The noise about Pearl Harbor, made by Disney,has reached its highest point with its premiere before the movie opens in cinemas across the US at the start of the Memorial Day holiday weekend, a time to recall national heroes who sacrificed their lives on the battlefield. As Ben Affleck is the main star, the movie seems sure to become a success in the United States at least. At almost three hours in length, it promises to be a good old Hollywood movie. There is a love story. Affleck and his co-star, Josh Hartnett, both fall in love with the navy nurse, Kate Beckinsale and, of course, there is much human courage and love of country. It's certain that Disney will be accused of \\"changing\\" history. The showing of actual events in a movie always causes arguments. Bits of the story are deliberately not mentioned in the movie. It does not address the theory held by some historians that President Franklin Roosevelt knew about Japan's intention to attack the ships in Pearl Harbor.It is said he did nothing, as he was aware that such a blow would allow him to take America into the Second World War. Japan remains sensitive about being accused of wartime atrocities . And Disney is sensitive about its business in Japan, where it has a theme park. Not all the reviews of the movie have been full of praise. A reviewer for Newsweek, who was given an early preview, acknowledged that the 40-minute sequence showing the attack itself was powerful. The attack comes quite late in the movie, however, and the reviewer was less impressed with the characters and the love story. \\"Almost every line of the dialogue sounds like it comes from an old movie, \\" the reviewer wrote.

If Milo removes carbon atoms from his alkane while working in his science lab, what happens to the melting point of that alkane increases or decreases? The answer to this question is:","output":"decreases. The passage states that alkanes with more carbon atoms have higher boiling and melting points. Therefore, when Milo removes carbon atoms from his alkane while working in his science lab, he reduces the number of carbon atoms, resulting in a decrease in the boiling and melting points. This means that the alkane will have a lower melting point as a consequence. The relationship between the structure of alkanes and their physical properties suggest that as the size of the alkane molecule increases, their melting and boiling points increase as well due to stronger van der Waals forces between the molecules. Conversely, the decrease in the size of the alkane molecule leads to weaker van der Waals forces and lower melting and boiling points."},{"instruction":"Single/multi-select question: Is it possible to conclude that \\"A brunette man is welding a stair rail.\\" if \\"A man is working on a stair rail.\\"?

Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio.

In the mid-1970s, he stopped recording free jazz, recruited electric instrumentalists, and pursued a new creative theory he called harmolodics. According to Coleman's theory, all the musicians are able to play individual melodies in any key, and still sound coherent as a group. He taught his young sidemen this new improvisational and ensemble approach, based on their individual tendencies, and prevented them from being influenced by conventional styles. Coleman likened this group ethic to a spirit of \\"collective consciousness\\" that stresses \\"human feelings\\" and \\"biological rhythms\\", and said that he wanted the music, rather than himself, to be successful. He also started to incorporate elements from other styles into his music, including rock influences such as the electric guitar and non-Western rhythms played by Moroccan and Nigerian musicians.Of Human Feelings was a continuation of the harmolodics approach Coleman had applied with Prime Time, an electric quartet introduced on his 1975 album Dancing in Your Head. The group comprised guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and Bern Nix, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and drummers Ronald Shannon Jackson and Denardo Coleman, Ornette Coleman's son. Tacuma was still in high school when Coleman enlisted him, and first recorded with Prime Time in 1975 for the album Body Meta, which was released in 1978. Tacuma had played in an ensemble for jazz organist Charles Earland, but Earland dismissed him as he felt audiences gave excessive attention to his playing.

This requires understanding, identifying, and manipulating various physical objects like wooden panels, screws, dowels, and other connecting hardware, as well as using tools such as a screwdriver, hammer, and measuring tape. The process can be broken down into several detailed steps. 1. Unpacking and identifying components: Begin by unpacking the flat-pack furniture box and laying out all the components on a flat surface. This typically includes wooden panels like sideboards, top and bottom boards, shelves, and backboard, as well as smaller connecting hardware like screws, dowels, nails, and brackets. You might also find an instruction manual, which is a crucial resource for successful assembly. 2. Reading and understanding the instruction manual: Carefully read and familiarize yourself with the instruction manual, going through the assembly process step-by-step. The manual will provide guidance on which components are required for each step, as well as the order in which they need to be assembled. Pay attention to any symbols and diagrams that indicate proper alignment, orientation, or positioning of components. 3. Gathering necessary tools: In addition to the components provided in the flat-pack, you will need a few basic tools like a screwdriver (both flathead and Phillips head), a hammer, a measuring tape, and possibly a power drill with specific drill bits. All of these tools are essential for successful assembly and ensure proper fitting of the components. 4. Assembling the frame: Start by assembling the main frame of the bookshelf, which usually involves connecting the sideboards to the top and bottom boards. Insert dowels or other connectors into pre-drilled holes according to the manual. Ensure that the holes and connectors are aligned correctly before securing them with screws. Use a measuring tape to check that the frame is square and accurately assembled. 5. Installing shelves: Next, install the shelves by inserting shelf pins or brackets into pre-drilled holes on the sideboards. Carefully align the shelves on top of the pins, ensuring they are level and parallel to the top and bottom boards. Secure the shelves with additional hardware, such as screws, if required by the instructions. 6. Attaching the backboard: The final step in the assembly process involves attaching the backboard to the frame. Position it on the backside of the frame, with its finished side facing inwards. Align its edges with the edges of the frame, then fasten the backboard with nails or screws, as specified in the manual. If required, you may need to use a power drill to create pilot holes for the screws. This will help prevent splitting or damage to the backboard. 7. Checking stability and alignment: Once fully assembled, check the bookshelf for stability. Make sure it does not wobble or lean to one side. You may need to adjust the placement of screws or reposition dowels to achieve the desired stability. Verify that all shelves are level, and all connections are secure. 8. Anchoring the bookshelf to a wall (optional): If the instruction manual recommends anchoring the bookshelf to a wall for added stability, locate the wall studs using a stud finder. Secure mounting brackets to the wall studs with long screws or wall anchors, then fasten the brackets to the back of the bookshelf. In conclusion, assembling a piece of flat-pack furniture, like a bookshelf, requires knowledge of both the physical objects (components and tools) involved and the assembly process. It entails unpacking and identifying components, understanding the instruction manual, using appropriate tools, assembling the frame and shelves, attaching the backboard, and ensuring stability and alignment. This task demonstrates the importance of being able to recognize and manipulate various physical objects to complete a real-world project successfully."},{"instruction":"Multi-choice problem: Based on the sentence \\"A toddler walking around barefoot in rubble.\\", is the sentence \\"A toddler walks around the rubble of her bombed home.\\" a true sentence?

Transfer the chicken to a platter. The chicken won't be completely cooked at this point; it will finish cooking as the gumbo simmers. Browning the chicken just adds flavor. Dice enough yellow onions, green bell peppers, and celery to equal 2 cups of each (300 g of onions, 350 g of green bell pepper, and 450 g of celery). Put the diced vegetables into the pot that the chicken browned in and turn the heat on to medium-high. Stir and cook the vegetables for about 5 minutes. The vegetables will soften and the onion should become clear. Mince 2 tablespoons of garlic and chop ½ cup (15 g) of flat-leaf parsley. Add these to the vegetables along with 2 cups (276 g) of chopped smoked andouille or pork sausage. Saute the mixture until the sausage is golden brown. Place the browned pieces of chicken back into the pot with the vegetable mixture. Pour in 1 cup (240 ml) of the chicken stock and stir it well. Scrape up the bottom so any browned bits are mixed in. Pour in the remaining 11 cups (2.6 liters) of chicken stock. The chicken pieces should be completely covered with the stock at this point. If you don't have enough stock, you could use some water. Stir 1 tablespoon of cayenne pepper and 1 1/2 cups (354 ml) of gumbo roux into the pot. Bring the gumbo to a boil. Turn the heat down to medium-low so the gumbo simmers. Put the lid on the pot and cook the gumbo for 1 hour. Carefully lift out the pieces of chicken and set them aside. Use a spoon to skim away any excess oil floating on top of the gumbo. Season the gumbo with salt and pepper and put the lid back on. Simmer the gumbo for 30 more minutes. If you want your gumbo thinner, you may need to stir in more stock or water. Take the lid off the pot and skim off any excess oil from the gumbo. Put the chicken pieces back in the pot and put the lid back on. Simmer the gumbo for 20 more minutes. If you prefer, you can remove the chicken meat from the bones and put the shredded chicken in the gumbo. Taste the gumbo and adjust the seasonings according to your taste. For example, you may want to add Cajun seasoning and hot sauce. Scoop some cooked, white rice into a serving bowl and spoon the gumbo over it. Garnish the gumbo with diced green onions and filé powder. You can store leftover gumbo in an airtight container in the refrigerator for several days. The flavor might actually improve over time as the flavors blend. Summary:","output":"The article provides a detailed recipe for preparing gumbo, starting with browning bone-in, skin-on chicken in oil, partially cooking it, and then setting it aside. It then details the process of sautéing a mix of diced onions, green bell peppers, and celery, garlic, parsley, and chopped smoked sausage in the same pot. The chicken is then returned to the pot along with chicken stock and seasonings including cayenne pepper and gumbo roux. It emphasizes the need to simmer the mixture, occasionally skimming off excess oil, adjusting the gumbo texture by adding more stock if needed, and re-adding the chicken. The final stage of the recipe includes adjusting the seasonings to taste, serving over rice, and garnishing with green onions and filé powder. The article ends by suggesting storing any leftover gumbo in an airtight container in the refrigerator, noting that the flavor may improve as the ingredients blend together over time."},{"instruction":"If \\"A man in a blue shirt and a woman in a dress having a conversation while drinking.\\" does that mean that \\"A man and a woman are walking down a city street.\\"?

Steam train 2. Pulling 3. Countryside Here's a detailed explanation for each word: 1. Steam train: This phrase refers to a specific type of train that is powered by steam, which is an important detail in understanding the essence of the sentence. Steam trains have historical significance as they were used extensively in the 19th and early 20th centuries before giving way to diesel and electric locomotives. They represent the progress and growth of rail transportation during that period, and by including this word, the sentence conveys an image of a classic, vintage form of transportation and possibly a nostalgic experience for some. 2. Pulling: The action word \\"pulling\\" refers to the motion of the train, indicating that it is actively moving forward and transporting something, either passengers or cargo. Pulling is an essential aspect of a train's core purpose – to transport people and goods from one location to another. It is also significant to note that trains can only move in a linear path along the tracks, which restricts their range of motion compared to other land vehicles. The word \\"pulling\\" imparts a sense of the train's power and determination to overcome any obstacles while navigating through various landscapes. 3. Countryside: The term \\"countryside\\" provides the setting for the train's journey and adds depth to the imagery portrayed in the sentence. By specifying that the steam train is moving through the countryside, the sentence paints a picture of a peaceful, picturesque environment, perhaps filled with rolling hills, green fields, and quaint villages. This sets a particular mood and atmosphere, contrasting to the bustle and noise of a city or the barrenness of a desert. The juxtaposition of a steam train traveling through the countryside might also suggest a connection between the industrial revolution and rural communities or a romantic sense of adventure and exploration in a bygone era."},{"instruction":"Criminal responsibility implies a fault which, in this case, has never been demonstrated.4.Taking a view as to his moral responsibility represents a dangerous departure, but if we are to consider it we must do so objectively.

Article: There is not enough oil in the world now. As time goes by, it becomes less and less, so what are we going to do when it runs out? Perhaps we will go back to using horses, carriages and bicycles. In the Second World War, some people didn't use gas made from petroleum in their cars. They made gas from wood and plants instead. The car didn't go fast, but they ran, so this was better than nothing. However, in the future, we can't cut down all our trees to make gas; we need our trees for other things, too. Besides different types of gas, we can also use electricity to run our cars, but first we must make the electricity! Some countries have coal and they make electricity with that, but we might not always have coal, either. Other countries have big, strong rivers, and they can use the power of water to turn turbines and make electricity more easily and cheaply. We are also able to get power from the ocean tides. We put turbines into the mouth of the river. Then the tide comes in, the water turns the turbines and then it goes out, it turns them again.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"Anxiety disorders affect around 10% of people at any one time.\\" - Sentence B: \\"10% of disordered people are anxious about anything all the time.\\" Let's solve this gradually.","output":"Let's analyze both sentences step by step: 1. Sentence A: \\"Anxiety disorders affect around 10% of people at any one time.\\" - This sentence states that about 10% of people experience anxiety disorders at any given moment. This seems logical as it is a general statement about the prevalence of anxiety disorders in the global population. It is a statistical statement, and such statistics are commonly found in research publications. 2. Sentence B: \\"10% of disordered people are anxious about anything all the time.\\" - This sentence states that 10% of the individuals with disorders are constantly anxious about everything. This seems less logical, as it implies that a fixed percentage of people with disorders have a specific type of anxiety and that this anxiety is pervasive and constant. This generalized statement may not apply to everyone with a disorder, as each individual's situation and mental health may vary greatly. Based on this analysis, Sentence B: \\"10% of disordered people are anxious about anything all the time\\" is the less logical sentence, as its statement is too generalized and may not accurately represent the experiences of individuals with various disorders."},{"instruction":"Sentence from a movie review: the film operates nicely off the element of surprise Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"Step 1: Identify key terms and phrases in the sentence In this case, the key terms and phrases are \\"the film operates nicely\\" and \\"off the element of surprise\\".

Additionally, \\"off the element of surprise\\" indicates that the unexpected events or twists in the film contribute positively to the overall experience. Step 3: Combine the meanings of the key terms and phrases Given that \\"operates nicely\\" implies a positive tone, and \\"off the element of surprise\\" suggests that the film's unpredictability adds to its appeal, we can conclude that the reviewer viewed the film positively.

Let your mop head dry completely before you store it so that your mop head will last longer. Dry mops, sponge mops, and other mops with flat heads should be stored with the head up. This keeps their heads off the floor and away from dust and debris while not in use. It also helps them better maintain their shape. Traditional wet mops should be stored in a way that allows their strings or strips to hang down naturally. If possible, the best way to do this is to hang the head off of a hook or rack on the wall, separate from the handle. If you cannot store your wet mop head separate from the handle, store the mop with the head up. This may cause some misshaping, but it is more sanitary and will help your mop last longer. To help avoid mold and mildew growing on your mop head, keep it in a dry place. A closet or another indoor space generally works just fine. Garages that aren’t temperature-controlled and laundry rooms aren’t always the best idea, though, as these can get humid. Exactly when you need to replace your mop will depend upon how often you use it and what you use it for. In general, though, a mop head will last about three months. If your mop smells even after disinfecting or if it has continued problems with mold growth, replace it immediately.

As an advocate of this sport, Beers not only promoted its growth but also wrote a comprehensive book that laid down the rules and regulations governing the gameplay. William George Beers (1843-1900) was not only a prominent dentist but also an ardent supporter of sports in Canada. Among the various sports, a particular field sport caught his interest, and he devoted his time and resources to ensure its widespread recognition and growth. The sport in question is lacrosse, a fast-paced field sport that has its origins in the Indigenous people of North America, particularly among the Native American plains tribes and the First Nations tribes of southeastern Canada who played multiple forms of the game. Lacrosse is played between two teams using a small rubber ball and long-handled sticks called crosses, with the objective being to score goals by sending the ball into the opposing team's net. Recognizing the importance of organizing and standardizing the rules of this dynamic game, William Beers decided to write a book that would detail all the rules and regulations that should be followed in lacrosse. The book, published in 1869, was titled \\"Lacrosse: The National Game of Canada.\\" The publication of this book played a major role in the sport's growth and popularity because it allowed people from different regions and backgrounds to play by unified rules and guidelines. Beers' efforts in promoting lacrosse led to its establishment as a popular sport in both Canada and the United States and beyond. In addition to writing the rule book, he also founded the Montreal Lacrosse Club in 1856 and served as the secretary of the National Lacrosse Association. In summary, the question is asking about the field sport – lacrosse – that Canadian dentist William Beers actively promoted and contributed to its development by writing a book containing standardized rules for the game. His involvement in the sport greatly influenced its progress and recognition, not only in Canada but also in various other regions of the world."},{"instruction":"with the genetic examinations the following questions are hoped to be answered: Make this proper case.","output":"With the genetic examinations, the following questions are hoped to be answered: Genetic examinations are scientific analyses that focus on the study of an organism's genetic material, understanding the relationships between genes, and identifying how they influence an individual's traits and characteristics. These investigations help answer several essential questions regarding human health, genetic disorders, and the biological world. Here are some critical questions that genetic examinations are expected to address: 1. Understanding the Genetic Basis of Diseases: One of the primary objectives of genetic examinations is to understand the genetic factors behind various diseases and health conditions. By knowing the specific genes involved, researchers can develop better diagnostic tools, risk assessment methods, and therapies to treat these diseases more effectively. 2. Tracing Ancestral Lineage: With genetic examinations, scientists can study an individual's ancestry, helping them trace their lineage back to their distant forebears. These examinations reveal migration patterns, population dynamics, and the relationships between different human populations, both geographically and temporally. 3. Personalized Medicine: Genetic examinations offer insights into an individual's unique genetic makeup, catering to the development of personalized medicine. This approach takes into account each person's genetic data to optimize medical treatments, allowing for more effective intervention and prevention strategies tailored to their specific genetic profiles. 4. Prenatal and Postnatal Testing: Genetic examinations extend to prenatal and postnatal testing, paving the way for early diagnosis and intervention in cases of various genetic disorders. These tests can help identify potential risks for specific conditions in fetuses, infants, and children. 5. Understanding the Genetic Basis of Inheritance: Genetic examinations aid in unraveling the complex patterns of inheritance by identifying the genes responsible for specific traits. They can help determine the likelihood of individuals passing on certain conditions to their offspring and provide essential information to prospective parents in cases of family planning. 6. Population Genetics and Biodiversity: Genetic examinations also play a significant role in studying population genetics, an essential foundation for understanding biodiversity. This field examines the distribution and frequency of genetic variations within populations, providing knowledge about genetic relationships, natural selection, and the adaptation of species. 7. Monitoring Genetic Variation: Genetic examinations allow scientists to monitor genetic variation in organisms and observe changes over time. By understanding the genome dynamics and evolutionary processes, researchers can develop strategies to protect endangered species and conserve genetic resources for future use. 8. Agricultural and Livestock Improvement: Genetic examinations have significant applications in agriculture and livestock industries. By understanding the genetic traits responsible for desirable characteristics in crops and animals, scientists can develop genetically improved varieties and breeds that require fewer resources, yield more, and exhibit better resistance to adverse environmental and biological challenges. In summary, genetic examinations play a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of the biological world and our place within it. By answering these questions and uncovering further insights into our genes' intricate workings, these examinations become a vital tool in addressing various challenges related to human health, genetic disorders, evolution, and biodiversity."},{"instruction":"Denny asked: Premise: \\"A skateboarder's hair flies through the air.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"The skateborder is falling.\\" is true?

Since single-digit integers have the same first and last digit, they should be returned too. If there are no integers matching the criteria, return an empty list. Here's the step-by-step approach I followed: 1. Create an empty list named 'result' to store the integers that meet the criteria. 2. Iterate through the input list of integers. 3. For each integer, convert it to a string to easily access its first and last digit. 4. If the integer has a single digit, append it directly to the 'result' list. 5. Else, compare the first and last digit of the string representation of the integer, if they are the same, append the integer to the 'result' list. 6. Once all integers are checked, return the 'result' list if not empty else return an empty list (\\"[]\\"). Following this approach, for the given input: [707, -387, 255, -217, 719, -324, -908, 935, -550, 680, 878, 981, 901, 492, -271, -982, -437, 17, -906, 276, -105, 664] The results are: [707, 255, -550, 878, 664] as these integers have the same first and last digit."},{"instruction":"Ah, I loved this movie.

Mental problems","output":"Title: Echoes of Tommy Genre: Drama/Mystery/Thriller Plot Summary: Tommy, a mentally unstable young man, is released from a psychiatric institution after spending most of his childhood there. As he begins to rebuild his life, he's plagued by fragmented memories from his troubled past. With the help of Sarah, his compassionate therapist, Tommy sets out on a journey to piece together the broken memories and uncover the truth behind his institutionalization. Act I: Tommy, now in his mid-twenties, is released from Green Meadows Psychiatric Institution, where he has spent most of his childhood. He struggles to adjust to the outside world and faces discrimination due to his mental problems. As he attends therapy sessions with Sarah, his therapist, Tommy begins to have flashbacks of traumatic events that occurred during his childhood. Act II: The flashbacks intensify, causing Tommy to fixate on discovering the truth behind his institutionalization. Sarah, moved by Tommy's determination, starts to help him investigate his family's history. Together, they find out that Tommy's mother was also institutionalized, causing Tommy to believe that mental illness runs in the family, and he questions whether he has inherited his mother's mental instability. As they delve deeper, they uncover that Tommy's father had been involved in illegal drug trafficking and was physically abusive toward Tommy's mother, which might have contributed to her mental breakdown. Sarah becomes increasingly invested in Tommy's case as she probes into the possibility of Tommy being institutionalized as a child to cover up his father's criminal activities. Act III: Tommy and Sarah's investigations lead them to a key witness, Tommy's childhood best friend, who reveals that he witnessed Tommy's father commit a murder when they were just kids. As Tommy grapples with this revelation, he starts to remember the moments leading up to his institutionalization: Tommy saw his father kill someone and confronted him, but his father managed to convince the authorities that Tommy was hallucinating due to his mental health issues. With Sarah's help, they gather sufficient evidence to expose Tommy's father. As the truth unravels, Tommy's father is arrested, and a court trial exposes his criminal activities. Finally, with the complete picture of his past, Tommy starts to heal and embrace a brighter future, but not before ensuring that his mother receives proper psychiatric care. In the end, Tommy becomes a mental health advocate and uses his story to raise awareness and help others who struggle with mental illness and stigma. He and Sarah maintain a close friendship, and Tommy makes peace with his tumultuous past. The film concludes with a hopeful note as Tommy stands at a mental health awareness event, sharing his journey, signifying that he has come a long way since his institutionalization."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Voici une phrase en français: \\"Le chat est mignon.\\" Now, let me explain it to you like you are a five-year-old!

(CNN) -- Over the past couple of days, I've listened with mounting frustration as people debate whether Penn State University should remove from its campus the 900-pound bronze statue of Joe Paterno, its once-legendary football coach. It's as if, to the folks who demand action, taking away a metal JoePa would serve as another blow to the real JoePa; one last spear in the heart of the fallen hero who apparently looked elsewhere as Jerry Sandusky, his longtime assistant coach and friend, molested one child after another. Sadly, it just doesn't work that way. As much as I have come to abhor Joe Paterno's indifference and arrogance and self-serving loyalty (to himself and his image and his stupid little football program), I fail to see how digging out a statue does anything but conflict with (what should be) one of the most important elements of higher education: Open and honest and intelligent dialogue. Were I in command of this decision, not only would I make certain the statue stays, I'd surround it with flood lights and fireworks and hire Flavor Flav to hype its very presence. \\"Come one, come all! Camp out! Bring classmates! Observe the bronze Joe Paterno! Debate away!\\" None of them have statues (rest assured, had any committed","output":"a heinous crime, there would be just as much debate), but history is peppered with individuals who have fallen in disgrace or participated in despicable acts. These individuals once inspired generations or led powerful movements until the truth surfaced, leaving them exposed for their actions or beliefs, tainted with the brush of controversy, and condemned by the masses. So, should we as a society hide these past figures from our collective consciousness, or should we use their transgressions as an opportunity for education and discussion, lest we forget and make the same mistakes again? Joe Paterno's case raises these essential questions - questions that should be a core aspect of higher education, a place where the free exchange of ideas is paramount and where reflecting on past actions can guide future generations. Instead, I would suggest that the statue remains, not as a symbol of Joe Paterno's achievements in the realm of college football, but rather as a constant reminder of the responsibilities that come with power and authority. This statue could provide a catalyst for open and honest and intelligent dialogue on the issues of ethics, accountability, and moral leadership. Additionally, the university could place a plaque alongside the statue that explains the context of Paterno's fall from grace and the impact his actions had on the lives of others. This information would provoke thought and reflection among those who view it, sparking conversations that extend beyond the boundaries of college football into the broader realm of society and culture. Will removing the statue make the problems disappear or undo the pain and suffering he caused? No, but confronting the ugly truth and promoting open discussion will push our society forward. By allowing the statue to stay, Penn State University will not only preserve valuable lessons that can be learned from Joe Paterno's mistakes but also create a unique venue for vital conversations - transforming a symbol of sorrow and regret into a call for better leaders and greater responsibility. Let the statue of Joe Paterno serve as a cautionary tale, a beacon for dialogue and introspection, and ultimately an instrument for positive change in the lives of students, faculty, and all those who take the time to reflect on the paths traveled by those who came before and the numerous lessons they left in their wake."},{"instruction":"Differences in air pressure over the surface of the Earth result in wind.

One lucky buyer wrote in an online comment: \\"Rushed to purchase, but to my shame, I have not read any of his novels.\\" Although Mo was entitled one of the top China's literature awards before the Nobel Prize, he is not the most popular novelist in China, in either the book market or in reputation.

Born in 1955 into a rural family, Mo dropped out of school and became a farmer when he was a teenager. He joined the army and devoted himself to writing. Mo's novels were translated into several languages. For more than a century, Nobel Prize has been regarded by the world as recognition to an individual or even a nation's cultural and scientific advances. \\"I think the reason why I could win the prize is that my works present lives with unique Chinese characteristics, and they also tell stones from a viewpoint of common human beings, which transcends differences of nations and races,\\" Mo said on Thursday evening to Chinese journalists.

Ashkenazi Jews are a Jewish ethnic group who historically resided in Central and Eastern Europe, and their traditional language is Yiddish. The Hasidic movement, which the Kotzker Rebbe was a part of, emerged in the 18th century among Ashkenazi Jews as a spiritual revival movement. Founded by Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov, Hasidism emphasized mystical spirituality, prayer, and communal life as a means to connect with God. Many Hasidic leaders, or rebbes, emerged within various dynasties and regions across Central and Eastern Europe, attracting followers and forming distinct communities within the larger Ashkenazi Jewish world. Menachem Mendel of Kotzk was one such Hasidic leader. As the Kotzker Rebbe, he was known for his unique and insightful teachings, as well as for his emphasis on truth and authenticity in one's spiritual journey. Under his leadership, the town of Kotzk (in present-day Poland) became a significant center of Hasidic learning, and hundreds of Ashkenazi Jews flocked to him as disciples.

Pete Maravich was born to Petar \\"Press\\" Maravich (1915-1987) and Helen Gravor Maravich (1925-1974) in Aliquippa, a steel town in Beaver County in western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. Maravich amazed his family and friends with his basketball abilities from an early age. He enjoyed a close but demanding father-son relationship that motivated him toward achievement and fame in the sport. Maravich's father was the son of Serbian immigrants and a former professional player-turned-coach. Maravich was survived by his wife Jackie and his two sons Jaeson, who was 8 years old, and Josh, aged 5. Only the previous year, Maravich had taken Jaeson to the 1987 NBA All-Star Game in Seattle, Washington, and introduced him to Michael Jordan. Since Maravich's children were very young when he died, Jackie Maravich initially shielded them from unwanted media attention, not even allowing Jaeson and Josh to attend their father's funeral. However, a proclivity to basketball seemed to be an inherited trait. During a 2003 interview, Jaeson told USA Today that, when he was still only a toddler, \\"My dad passed me a (Nerf) basketball, and I've been hooked ever since... . My dad said I shot and missed, and I got mad and I kept shooting. He said his dad told him he did the same thing.\\" Despite some setbacks coping with their father's death and without the benefit that his tutelage might have provided, both sons eventually were inspired to play high school and collegiate basketball--Josh at his father's alma mater, LSU. On June 27, 2014, Governor Bobby Jindal proposed that LSU erect a statue of Maravich outside the Assembly Center which already bears the basketball star's name. Former coach Dale Brown opposes such a monument, but Maravich's widow, Jackie McLachlan, said that she had been promised a statue after the passing of her husband. McLachlan said that she has noticed how fans struggle to get the Maravich name on the Assembly Center into a camera frame. In February 2016, the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame Committee unanimously approved a proposal that a statue honoring Maravich be installed on the campus.

Florida State University evolutionary anthropologist Dean Falk participated in the study led by Weiwei Men of East China Normal University. Falk said this study, more so than any other to date, \\"really gets 'inside' Einstein's brain.\\" After his death in 1955, Einstein's brain was preserved, although the fact remained hidden until 1986. The researchers used a new technique for measuring brain connectivity developed by Men. \\"Men's technique measures and color-codes the varying thicknesses of subdivisions of the corpus callosum along its length, where nerves cross from one side of the brain to the other,\\" said a Florida State University statement. \\"These thicknesses indicate the number of nerves that cross and therefore how 'connected' the two sides of the brain are in particular regions, which facilitate different functions depending on where the fibers cross along the length. For example, movement of the hands is represented toward the front and mental arithmetic along the back.\\" Men's research on Einstein's brain connectivity was done by photographs of Einstein's brain published by Falk and others in 2012. To make comparisons of Einstein's brain's connectivity versus that of others, the researchers used samples taken from a group of elderly men and a larger group of men who were 26 years old. In 1905, when Einstein was 26, he had his so-called \\"miracle year\\" where he published four papers that significantly contributed to the foundation of modern physics. Compared to both the younger and older control groups, Falk and Men found that Einstein's brain had more extensive connections between certain parts of the cerebral hemisphere. \\"This technique should be of interest to other researchers who study the brain's all-important internal connectivity,\\" Falk said. ||||| Einstein’s Genius Likely A Result Of His Well-Connected Brain by editor [ Watch the Video: Dissecting Einstein's Brain ] redOrbit Staff & Wire Reports - Your Universe Online Albert Einstein is generally recognized as one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century, but exactly what was it that made his brain so special? The authors of a recently published study believe that they have found the answer to that riddle. Writing in the journal Brain, Weiwei Men of East China Normal University's Department of Physics and his colleagues explained that the left and right hemispheres of the German-born theoretical physicist’s brain were exceptionally well connected to one another. That connection could have played a vital role in his intelligence. “This study, more than any other to date, really gets at the 'inside' of Einstein's brain. It provides new information that helps make sense of what is known about the surface of Einstein's brain,” Florida State University (FSU) evolutionary anthropologist Dr. Dean Falk explained in a statement. The study authors developed a new technique to conduct their research, which they claim is the first to analyze Einstein's corpus callosum (the largest bundle of fibers in the brain, and the part of the brain that that connects the two cerebral hemispheres and facilitates interhemispheric communication) in detail. Dr. Falk said that their method “should be of interest to other researchers who study the brain's all-important internal connectivity.” According to FSU, the technique developed by Men’s team “measures and color-codes the varying thicknesses of subdivisions of the corpus callosum along its length, where nerves cross from one side of the brain to the other. These thicknesses indicate the number of nerves that cross and therefore how ‘connected’ the two sides of the brain are in particular regions, which facilitate different functions depending on where the fibers cross along the length.” This technique allowed the study authors to register and compare the measurements of Einstein’s brain with those of two existing samples, one belonging to 15 elderly men and the other from 52 men who were Einstein’s age in 1905. During that year, the then-26-year-old physicist published four articles that would be essential to the foundations of modern physics, and helped alter the scientific community’s views of space, time, mass and energy. Men started work analyzing Einstein's corpus callosum by requesting high-resolution photographs of the two halves of the genius’s brain that had been published by Falk and other researchers in 2012. Their findings demonstrate that the man behind the general theory of relativity had more extensive connections between specific regions of his cerebral hemispheres than either the younger or older control groups. In addition to Men and Falk, who served as second author of the paper, Tao Sun of the Washington University School of Medicine and Weibo Chen, Jianqi Li, Dazhi Yin, Lili Zang and Mingxia Fan from the East China Normal University's Department of Physics were among the members of the research team. In March 2012, sections from Einstein’s brain were displayed alongside gray matter from other prominent historical figures at an exhibition in London. As the legendary thinker had requested, his brain was divided into several sections upon his death in 1955. The portions featured during the Wellcome Collection show “Brains: The Mind As Matter” had originally been put on display to the public in a Philadelphia museum back in 2011. ||||| Einstein was undoubtedly one of the most influential physicists of all time, advancing concepts in quantum physics and gaining enormous notoriety for his theory of relativity. Einstein was also a keen philosopher, proclaiming that “… independence by philosophical insight is… the mark of distinction between mere artisan or specialist and a real seeker of truth.“ It comes as no surprise that Einstein’s brain appears physiologically distinct from that of the average individual. A recent study has sought to explain the man’s genius-level intellect, in part, based a difference in a structure called the corpus callosum. Einstein’s Autopsied Brain Many have attempted to understand what inspired the German-born prodigy. A pathologist, named Dr. Thomas Stoltz Harvey, working at Princeton University, even attempted to establish whether there was a physiological trait that could explain the inner workings of Einstein’s extraordinary mind. Einstein died from internal bleeding, following a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. In 1955, Harvey, who was responsible for conducting Einstein’s autopsy, removed his subject’s brain, without requesting the permission of his family. Harvey then preserved Einstein’s brain in formalin, before snapping a vast number of photographs. After documenting the details of the specimen, he carved it up into approximately 240 individual sections, with the principal ambition of allowing the scientific community to research what made Einstein so truly remarkable. Harvey retained his photographs to write a book, which he was never able to finish. Following Harvey’s demise, his family decided to donate the images to the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington, during 2010. Decades after Einstein’s departure, it seems scientists are finally able to figure out the mysteries of the great man’s brain. The Corpus Callosum Study The latest research study, entitled The Corpus Callosum of Albert Einstein’s Brain: Another Clue to His High Intelligence, was published in the research journal Brain. The study demonstrated that the association between the left and right hemispheres of Einstein’s brain were atypical, with enhanced connection between these two parts. Evolutionary Anthropologist, Dean Falk, of Florida State University, collaborated on the project. Falk explains how the study offers greater insight into the illustrious physicist’s brain, improving upon prior research studies. The part of the brain that connects the two hemispheres of the brain is known as the corpus callosum (A.K.A. the colossal commissure), a bundle of neuronal fibers that sits beneath the cerebral cortex, uniting the two hemispheres in the brains of higher order mammals. The study, which was led by Weiwei Men of East China Normal University, managed to establish a novel technique to explore the “internal connectivity” of Einstein’s corpus callosum, for the very first time. Using their new method, the team were able to determine the relative thickness of various subdivisions throughout length of the corpus callosum. These differences in thickness were then color-coded to provide the research group with an approximation for the number of neurons stretching between the left and rights hemispheres; a thicker corpus callosum suggests there to be a greater number of neurons. In addition, different regions of the corpus callosum are implicated in specialist functions. For example, neurons situated at the front of this interlinking region of the brain are involved in movement of hands, whilst neurons running along its posterior are thought to be implicated in mental arithmetic. The researchers applied their technique to compare Einstein’s corpus callosum to two sample groups, including one group of over a dozen elderly men, and another group of 52 men that were Einstein’s age in 1905. 1905 was a pivotal year in Albert Einstein’s life, publishing seminal articles on Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, the photoelectric effect, as well as work that yielded the renowned E = mc2 formula. Following their study, the researchers concluded that Einstein’s brain demonstrated more extensive connections at particular points along the corpus callosum. The team suggest this could, at least partially, explain some of Einstein’s supreme intellectual abilities. Other Studies Falk and his colleagues had investigated Einstein’s brain on a previous occasion, in 2012. Simply through analysis of Harvey’s autopsy photographs, the team were able to visibly identify features of Einstein’s brain that could be fundamental to the man’s intellect. They found greater intricacy and convolution patterns across certain regions of his brain, particularly the prefrontal cortex, the visual cortex and the parietal lobes. The prefrontal cortex is critical to abstract thinking, decision-making and expression of personality traits, whilst the parietal lobe is involved in sense and motor function. Intriguingly, Falk’s group found that the somatosensory cortex, which receives sensory input information, was also increased in magnitude in an area that corresponded to his left hand. As Einstein was an avid violinist, after having been inspired by a number of Mozart’s pieces at age 13, the group drew a correlation between this enlarged cortical region and his musical aptitude. According to Live Science, Sandra Witelson, a scientist based at McMaster University, who has performed prior studies into Einstein’s brain, explained the physiological difference in the physicist’s neural tissue: “It’s not just that it’s bigger or smaller, it’s that the actual pattern is different… His anatomy is unique compared to every other photograph or drawing of a human brain that has ever been recorded.” Marion C. Diamond and colleagues, working at the University of California, published an article in 1985, called on the brain of a scientist: Albert Einstein. Fascinatingly, after performing microscopic cell counts, they found Einstein had an exceedingly high ratio of glial cells (a non-neuronal support cell) to regular neuronal cells, in two parts of his brain. It seems that Albert Einstein’s thicker corpus callosum may have been partly responsible for his genius-level intellect. However, it is likely that a combination of physiological factors played a part shaping the enigmatic theoretical physicist. The question is, will there ever be another extraordinary mind like Einstein’s?

His father is a Georgia State Trooper and serves as Athletic Director of Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, a private academy with one of the best high school basketball programs in the country, while his mother played on the inaugural women's basketball team at Morris Brown College. Howard's mother had seven miscarriages before he was born. A devout Christian since his youth, Howard became serious about basketball around the age of nine; when in the eighth grade, he resolved to be selected as the number one pick in the NBA Draft one day. Standing at 6 feet 11 inches tall (2.11 m) and weighing 265 pounds (120 kg), Howard plays the center position. Howard led the NBA in rebounding from 2007 to 2010, and again from 2012 to 2013. Howard's rebounding is in part facilitated by his extraordinary athleticism; his running vertical leap was tested at 39.5 inches in 2011, rare for a player of his size. He demonstrated this skill in the 2007 Slam Dunk Contest, where he completed an alley oop dunk from teammate Jameer Nelson while slapping a sticker onto the backboard at 12 ft 6 in (3.81 m) high. The sticker showed an image of his own smiling face with a handwritten \\"All things through Christ Phil: 4:13\\", a paraphrase of Philippians 4:13. Howard's leaping reach of 12 ft 6 in (3.81 m) is the highest documented in NBA history, 1 inch (2.5 cm) higher than Shaquille O'Neal's previous record of 12 ft 5 in (3.78 m). As of April 2013, Howard's career average of 12.9 rebounds per game (in the regular season) ranked 12th in NBA history. Howard's abilities and powerful physique have drawn attention from fellow NBA All-Stars. Tim Duncan once remarked in 2007: \\"[Howard] is so developed... He has so much promise and I am glad that I will be out of the league when he is peaking.\\" Kevin Garnett echoed those sentiments: \\"[Howard] is a freak of nature, man... I was nowhere near that physically talented. I wasn't that gifted, as far as body and physical presence.\\" Subsequent to a game in the 2009 NBA Playoffs, Philadelphia 76ers swingman Andre Iguodala said: \\"It's like he can guard two guys at once. He can guard his guy and the guy coming off the pick-and-roll, which is almost impossible to do... If he gets any more athletic or jumps any higher, they're going to have to change the rules.\\" As early as December 2007, ESPN writer David Thorpe declared Howard to be the most dominant center in the NBA. While many sports pundits have been rating Howard as one of the top young prospects in the NBA since 2006, Howard has some weaknesses in his game. Offensively, his shooting range remains limited; he is also mistake-prone, having led the NBA in total number of turnovers in the 2006-07 season. Like many centers, he has a low free throw conversion percentage. As a result, he is often a target of the Hack-a-Shaq defense and is annually among the league leaders in free throw attempts. During the 2007-08 regular season, Howard led the NBA with 897 free throw attempts while shooting only 59% from the free throw line. Also in that season, outside of layups and dunks, his shooting percentage was only 31.6%. In the 2008-09 season, he led the NBA again with 849 free throw attempts and in 2009-10, he was second in the NBA with 816. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What was his most unimpressive stat?","output":"Howard's most unimpressive stat can be considered his free throw conversion percentage.

It concentrates on the life of Argentine political leader Eva Peron, the second wife of Argentine president Juan Peron. The story follows Evita's early life, rise to power, charity work, and eventual death. The musical began as a rock opera concept album released in 1976. In Buenos Aires on July 26, 1952, an audience is watching a film (\\"A Cinema in Buenos Aires, July 26, 1952\\"). The film is interrupted when news breaks of the death of Eva Peron, Argentina's First Lady, at the age of 33. The nation goes into public mourning as they sing \\"Requiem for Evita\\" (in Latin, which is modelled on a Catholic requiem). Che, a member of the public, marvels at the spectacle and promises to show how Eva did \\"nothing, for years\\" (\\"Oh What a Circus\\"). In 1934, 15-year-old Eva Duarte (later Eva Duarte de Peron) lives in the provincial town of Junin, and longs to seek a better life in Buenos Aires. Eva falls in love with a tango singer, Agustin Magaldi, after she meets him at one of his shows (\\"On This Night of a Thousand Stars\\"). Eva persuades Magaldi into taking her with him to Buenos Aires and though he is initially resistant, he eventually accepts (\\"Eva, Beware of the City\\"). Upon her arrival at the city, Eva sings about her hopes and ambitions of glory as an actress (\\"Buenos Aires\\"). After Magaldi leaves her, and Che relates the story of how Eva goes through several relationships with increasingly influential men, becoming a model, actress and radio personality (\\"Goodnight and Thank You\\"). He then tells of both a right-wing coup in 1943 and Eva's success, implying that Argentine politics and Eva's career may soon coincide. Che also makes a point to introduce the figure of Colonel Juan Domingo Peron, an ambitious military colonel who was making his way up the Argentine political ladder (\\"The Lady's Got Potential\\"). In a game of musical chairs that represents the rise of political figures, Peron and other military figures compete for power and exhibit their political strategy (\\"The Art of the Possible\\"). After the 1944 San Juan earthquake, Peron organises a charity concert at Luna Park to provide aid to the victims. Eva attends and briefly reunites with Magaldi, who spurns her for her past actions. Peron addresses the crowd with words of encouragement and leaps off the stage, meeting Eva as soon as he exits (\\"Charity Concert\\"). Eva and Peron share a secret rendezvous following the charity concert, where Eva hints that she could help Peron rise to power (\\"I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You\\"). Eva dismisses Peron's Mistress (the character is known only by that title), who ponders the rejection (\\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\\"). After moving in with Peron, Eva is introduced to high society, but she is met with disdain from the upper classes and the Argentine Army (\\"Peron's Latest Flame\\"). In 1946, Peron launches his presidential bid after being promoted to general in the army, and while in bed with Eva, he discusses his chances of winning the election. Eva reassures him and soon they organise rallies where the people show their support and hope for a better future, while on the sidelines Peron and his allies plot to dispose of anyone who stands in their way (\\"A New Argentina\\").

As the two girls become romantically involved, their taboo friendship causes them to be marginalized by the other students. Unable to cope with the social pressures of having a lover of the same gender, Shi-Eun tries to distance herself from the increasingly dependent Hyo-shin. Hyo-shin reacts poorly to Shi-eun's changed attitude, viewing it as both a betrayal and rejection. Hyo-shin consequently commits suicide by jumping off of the school roof. It is also heavily implied that she was pregnant at the time of death, the father being literature teacher Mr. Goh. The plot unfurls in a nonlinear fashion, often from the perspective of fellow student Soh Min-ah (Kim Min-sun). Min-ah grows increasingly invested in Shi-eun and Hyo-shin when she finds a diary kept between the two alienated girls. This diary allows her disturbing insights to the nature of the relationship and pulls her deeper into a strange chain of events around the school. After Hyo-shin's death, supernatural occurrences start to terrorize all of the students that condemned the relationship. It is later revealed that Hyo-shin's spirit is malevolently haunting the school through the remnants she left behind in the diary.

The PM said his message was \\"London is not a place to stash your dodgy cash\\". Corruption, he added, was \\"a cancer which is at the heart of so many of the world's problems\\" and must be tackled. Mr Cameron is on a four-day tour of South East Asia. On Monday, he announced the UK and Indonesia had agreed measures to counter the \\"shared enemy\\" of Islamic State (IS) extremism. Later in the trip he will travel to Malaysia and Vietnam. He has been accompanied by 31 British business leaders in an attempt to drum up trade with the UK and has also discussed the fight against terrorism with his counterparts. Describing corruption as \\"the enemy of progress\\", he called for a \\"global effort\\" to tackle it, saying the world has \\"looked the other way for too long\\". Citing the steps taken by the UK and Singapore to tackle corruption as part of enforcing a rules-based financial and legal system, Mr Cameron said a zero tolerance approach boosted trust and could improve business profitability and economic growth. A 2014 report by anti-poverty organisation One said an estimated 1tn (Â£600bn) a year was being taken out of poor countries because of corruption, warning of the use of phantom firms and money laundering. And last week the National Crime Agency said foreign criminals were pushing up house prices in the UK by laundering billions of pounds through the purchase of expensive properties. In his speech, Mr Cameron said properties in the UK, particularly in London, \\"are being bought by people overseas through anonymous shell companies, some with plundered or laundered cash\\". Shell companies are non-trading companies that serve a particular purpose for their owners. More than 100,000 UK property titles are registered to overseas companies, with more than 36,000 properties in London owned by offshore firms. About Â£122bn of property in England and Wales is owned by offshore companies. The government is to publish Land Registry data later this year, setting out which foreign companies own land and property in England and Wales. It will also consider forcing a foreign company bidding for a government contract to \\"publicly state who really owns it\\". While the majority of foreign-owned business investing in Britain had \\"nothing to hide\\" and were welcome, the rules needed to be more transparent to counter those who were seeking to launder \\"their ill-gotten gains without being tracked down\\". \\"There is no place for dirty money in Britain,\\" he said. \\"Indeed, there should no place for dirty money anywhere. London is not a place to stash your dodgy cash.\\" Welcoming the pledge, Laura Taylor, head of advocacy at Christian Aid, said it was \\"another step forward in the battle for greater transparency worldwide\\". \\"Countering corruption is of fundamental importance in the fight against global poverty because of its impact on developing countries,\\" she added. Diane Sheard, UK director of One, said: \\"Lifting this veil of secrecy will help developing countries to identify and recover these funds, which should be spent on essentials like health and education. \\"We hope that making information public about foreign companies that own property in the UK will deter money-launderers from doing business here.\\" And Robert Palmer, head of the money-laundering campaign at the charity Global Witness, said: \\"London is a very attractive destination for very wealthy people, including corrupt officials who have looted their state coffers.\\" He added: \\"What the Prime Minister has announced today is a really good step forward.\\" In his speech, Mr Cameron also pledged to boost the UK's trade links with Asean nations, pointing out that Britain had larger two-way trade with Belgium than with Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia combined. The UK had become \\"too reliant\\" on its European market and must \\"not lose out\\" on the vast market that South East Asia represented - heralding a \\"partnership that can drive our shared prosperity for decades to come\\".

His 1937 paper was heavily cited . He completed his doctorate at the Universiteit Utrecht in 1934 . His dissertation was labelled : Reflectivity and Emissivity of Tungsten ; with a Description of a New Method to Determine the Total Reflectivity of Any Surface in a Simple and Accurate Way . His adviser was Leonard Ornstein . From 1934 to 1967 he was employed in the Physical Laboratory of Philips in Eindhoven , and from 1960 to 1972 he was Professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology . - After the explanation of van der Waals forces by Fritz London several scientists soon realised that his definition could be extended from the interaction of two molecules with induced dipoles to macro-scale objects by summing all of the forces between the molecules in each of the bodies involved. The theory is named after H. C. Hamaker who derived the interaction between two spheres, a sphere and a wall, and presented a general discussion in a heavily cited 1937 paper. - A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term \\"molecule\\" is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. - The Dommel is a stream in Belgium and the Netherlands, left tributary of the Dieze. It rises in north-eastern Belgium near Peer and flows into the southern part of the Netherlands. The Dommel takes in water from the Keersop, Tongelreep, Run, Gender and Kleine Dommel streams and merges at 's-Hertogenbosch with the Aa stream to form river Dieze, which subsequently flows towards the Meuse. The main cities and towns along the Dommel's course are Peer, Neerpelt, Valkenswaard, Dommelen, Eindhoven, Son en Breugel, Sint-Oedenrode, Boxtel, Sint-Michielsgestel and 's-Hertogenbosch. The most original part and natural state of the Dommel can be found between Eindhoven and Boxtel. Here the Dommel has still its original winds and meanders and forms a cultural-historical and valuable landscape area called the Dommelbeemden. - Fritz Wolfgang London (March 7, 1900 March 30, 1954) was a Jewish-German physicist and professor at Duke University. His fundamental contributions to the theories of chemical bonding and of intermolecular forces (London dispersion forces) are today considered classic and are discussed in standard textbooks of physical chemistry. With his brother Heinz London, he made a significant contribution to understanding electromagnetic properties of superconductors with the London equations and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on five separate occasions. - Friesland (official) or Frisia is a province in the northwest of the Netherlands.

As of 2015, it has a population of 2,762,163 and a total area of . - In physical chemistry, the van der Waals forces (or van der Waals interaction), named after Dutch scientist Johannes Diderik van der Waals, are the residual attractive or repulsive forces between molecules or atomic groups that do not arise from covalent bonds, nor ionic bonds. It can be shown that van der Waals forces are of the same origin as the Casimir effect, arising from quantum interactions with the zero-point field. The resulting van der Waals forces can be attractive or repulsive. - Eindhoven is a municipality and a city in the south of the Netherlands, originally at the confluence of the Dommel and Gender streams. The Gender was dammed short of the city centre in the 1950s and the Dommel still runs through the city. The city has a population of 223,220 in January 2015, making it the fifth-largest municipality of the Netherlands and the largest in the province of North Brabant. - Noord Brabant, also unofficially called Brabant, is a province in the south of the Netherlands. It borders the provinces of South Holland and Gelderland to the north, Limburg to the east, Zeeland to the west, and the Belgian provinces of Antwerp and Limburg to the south. The northern border follows the Meuse (Maas) river westward to its mouth in the Hollands Diep strait, part of the RhineMeuseScheldt delta. History. The Duchy of Brabant was a state of the Holy Roman Empire established in 1183 or 1190. It developed from the Landgraviate of Brabant and formed the heart of the historic Low Countries, part of the Burgundian Netherlands from 1430 and of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1482, until it was split up after the Dutch revolt. After the War of Independence, Catholics in the Southern Netherlands were systematically and officially discriminated against by the Northern Protestant government until the second half of the 20th century, which had a major influence on the economic and cultural development of the southern part of the Netherlands. Present-day North Brabant (Staats-Brabant) was adjudicated to the Generality Lands of the Dutch Republic according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, while the reduced duchy remained in existence with the Southern Netherlands until it was conquered by French Revolutionary forces in 1794. - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\".

Choose from: -Yes -No","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"water.\\" Reducing heat can change a gas into a liquid, but to state that it always turns into water is incorrect. Different gases will condense into different types of liquids when they lose heat. When heat is reduced, gases lose energy and their particles slow down, moving close to each other, which results in the formation of a liquid state. This process is called condensation. The type of liquid formed depends on the specific gas that is being cooled. For example, if you cool water vapor (gaseous state of water), it will condense into liquid water. But if you cool another gas, like nitrogen or carbon dioxide, they will condense into their respective liquid forms, which are not water. In summary, reducing heat in a gas does change it into a liquid, but it does not always change it into water. The specific liquid formed will depend on the original gas being cooled."},{"instruction":"I do n't know if Abby remembers Jessica or not . I know Kaitlyn does .

Many people find their dedication to securing the best deals amusing, while others question their priorities, wondering if the time spent waiting in line is worth the potential savings. Regardless, their story becomes well-known throughout the city and beyond. Meanwhile, Best Buy becomes increasingly crowded as the day of the sale approaches. During their time camping out, the two women become close friends and bond over their shared love of bargain hunting. They pass the time discussing their favorite stores, sales strategies, and previous Black Friday experiences. As they get to know each other better, they realize they have even more in common than just their enthusiasm for shopping. Vicky and Juanita start to share stories about their families, their favorite vacations, and their dreams for the future. As Thanksgiving Day finally arrives, a line has formed behind Vicky and Juanita, with hundreds of people seeking the same coveted deals. As the store doors open at 5 p.m., the two friends with newfound fame quickly make their way to the items they have been eyeing for weeks. They grab the latest gadgets, home appliances, and entertainment essentials at unbeatable prices. After a long day of shopping and excitement, Vicky and Juanita both return home to their families, who have been waiting patiently for them to finish their shopping odyssey. The women feel proud of their accomplishments and excited to share the great deals they scored with their loved ones. However, they also return feeling grateful for the unexpected friendship they developed along the way. Both women recognize that the time they spent waiting in line was an unforgettable experience, not just because of the bargains they managed to secure, but because of the bond they formed while camping outside the store. They eventually part ways, but remain in touch, even meeting up for future shopping trips and adventures. The story of Vicky and Juanita serves as a reminder that Black Friday is not just about store discounts, long lines, and crowds. In the end, it's about the connections made and the memories created throughout the waiting process. Though the women's extraordinary dedication to the art of bargain hunting may have initially intrigued the public, it is their friendship that truly brings the story to a heartwarming and meaningful conclusion."},{"instruction":"Q:Fact 1: Male dogs use pheromones in urine to mark their territory.

The most common metrics include the radius of maximum wind, the radius of 34-knot wind (i.e. gale force), the radius of outermost closed isobar (ROCI), and the radius of vanishing wind. An additional metric is the radius at which the cyclone's relative vorticity field decreases to 1×10−5 s−1.On Earth, tropical cyclones span a large range of sizes, from 100–2,000 kilometres (62–1,243 mi) as measured by the radius of vanishing wind. They are largest on average in the northwest Pacific Ocean basin and smallest in the northeastern Pacific Ocean basin. If the radius of outermost closed isobar is less than two degrees of latitude (222 km (138 mi)), then the cyclone is \\"very small\\" or a \\"midget\\". A radius of 3–6 latitude degrees (333–670 km (207–416 mi)) is considered \\"average sized\\". \\"Very large\\" tropical cyclones have a radius of greater than 8 degrees (888 km (552 mi)). Observations indicate that size is only weakly correlated to variables such as storm intensity (i.e. maximum wind speed), radius of maximum wind, latitude, and maximum potential intensity.Size plays an important role in modulating damage caused by a storm. All else equal, a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time. Additionally, a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher storm surge due to the combination of longer wind fetch, longer duration, and enhanced wave setup.The upper circulation of strong hurricanes extends into the tropopause of the atmosphere, which at low latitudes is 15,000–18,000 metres (50,000–60,000 ft). Paragraph: A storm is brewing in the northeastern Pacific basin. This storm has resulted in a cyclone. The radius of outermost closed isobar is measured to be 1.5 degrees of latitude. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Given the cyclone increases in size will the measurement of its outermost isobar have increased or decreased?","output":"If the cyclone increases in size, the measurement of its outermost isobar will have increased."},{"instruction":"Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it","output":"The sentiment of the sentence is not really positive or negative.

Do mail carriers need multiple uniforms?","output":"To answer the question of whether mail carriers need multiple uniforms, let's consider a few factors: 1. Work Schedule: Mail carriers typically work five or six days a week. Wearing the same uniform every day could be unhygienic and could also lead to faster wear and tear. 2. Weather: Mail carriers deliver mail in various weather conditions, including rain, snow, and heat. Having multiple uniforms allows them to have a clean, dry uniform regardless of the weather. 3. Hygiene: For maintaining good hygiene, it's recommended to wear clean clothes daily, especially when in close contact with other workers or the public. 4. Maintenance: Multiple uniforms allow for continuous usage while others are being washed and dried. This can help prevent a situation where a uniform becomes dirty or damaged, and the mail carrier has no backup. 5. Professionalism: Clean and presentable uniforms help mail carriers maintain a professional appearance while on duty. 6. Company Policies: Some postal services may have specific policies that require their employees to have multiple uniforms to ensure they are always clean and presentable. In conclusion, based on these factors, it is reasonable to suggest that mail carriers should have multiple uniforms to maintain hygiene, professionalism, and adapt to different weather conditions and work demands."},{"instruction":"Q:What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Great game good job but Please post patch notes in app description so we can decide if its worth it.

We need to find the value of 'j' in this problem. 1. We have the equation: 78*j + 5783 = -84*j - 2402 + 85 2. First, let's make the numbers simpler by adding 85 to -2402. We get -2402 + 85 = -2317. So now, our equation looks like this: 78*j + 5783 = -84*j - 2317 3. To find the value of 'j', we'll first move all the 'j' terms to one side of the equation. We'll add 84*j to both sides. So on the left side, we have 78*j + 84*j = 162*j and on the right side, we only have -2317. Our equation now looks like this: 162*j + 5783 = -2317 4. Next, we will move the number 5783 to the other side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 5783 from both sides. So now our equation is: 162*j = -2317 - 5783 5. Let's subtract the numbers on the right side. -2317 - 5783 = -8100 Our equation is now: 162*j = -8100 6. Finally, to find the value of 'j', we will divide both sides by 162. So we get: j = -8100 / 162 7. Now let's divide -8100 by 162. We get j = -50 So the value of 'j' in this equation is -50."},{"instruction":"Nana Kwame Abrokwa (born 5 October 1968) is a Ghanaian born German rapper and DJ, performing under the pseudonyms Nana or Darkman / Nana.

Here's an explanation for my choice: The two sentences have common elements in terms of the subject and the location. In both sentences, \\"Syrian forces\\" is the subject and the event is happening in or close to Syria. However, the context, scenario, and objects involved in each sentence are quite different, which makes these sentences not very similar overall. In the first sentence, \\"Syrian forces shoot civilians on bus,\\" the focus is on the Syrian forces and their violent action toward innocent civilians. It offers insight into a specific, tragic event, demonstrating the impact of the conflict on the Syrian population. This scenario is more specific and highlights a direct confrontation between a military force and unarmed civilians. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Syrian forces, rebels clash near Turkey,\\" implies a broader context of the ongoing armed conflict between two organized groups, or various factions. In this scenario, the Syrian forces and rebels are engaged in a clash, and the geographical proximity to Turkey suggests implications for the international community, particularly Turkey. Overall, while these two sentences share some common ground in regard to the subject and location, the provided options do not include a higher similarity score that accurately reflects this. I believe option c). 2 is the best choice to represent the level of similarity between these two sentences, because the differences in context and the nature of involved parties are significant."},{"instruction":"Read this and answer the question In China, urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex. Large urban centers, such as Nanjing and Beijing, also contributed to the growth of private industry. In particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however, relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil. Despite the xenophobia and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of neo-Confucianism, China under the early Ming dynasty was not isolated. Foreign trade and other contacts with the outside world, particularly Japan, increased considerably. Chinese merchants explored all of the Indian Ocean, reaching East Africa with the treasure voyages of Zheng He. What caused urbanization to increase in China?","output":"Urbanization increased in China due to several interrelated factors. These factors include population growth, the development of a more complex division of labor, growth of private industries in large urban centers, and increased foreign trade and contacts with the outside world. 1. Population Growth: As China's population grew, there was a need for more housing, infrastructure, and services. This growth in population led to the expansion of existing urban areas and the creation of new ones. More people living in urban areas meant a greater need for resources, jobs, and amenities that cities could provide. 2. Complex Division of Labor: As the Chinese society developed, so did the division of labor. Jobs became more specialized, creating opportunities for people with specific skills and expertise to find work in urban areas. This complexity in the division of labor attracted more people to seek out jobs that matched their skillset, contributing to the growth of cities. 3. Growth of Private Industries in Large Urban Centers: Large urban centers, such as Nanjing and Beijing, saw the growth of private industries, particularly in the sectors of paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. These small-scale industries provided jobs and stimulated the local economy, attracting more people to urban areas and fueling urbanization. 4. Proliferation of Small Urban Centers with Markets: Smaller urban centers throughout China began to grow as they developed markets for trading goods, primarily food but also necessary manufactures such as pins or oil. As these markets provided a hub for economic activity, they fostered the growth of surrounding urban areas. 5. Increase in Foreign Trade and Contact: During the early Ming dynasty, China's foreign trade and contacts with the outside world, particularly Japan, increased significantly. Chinese merchants explored the entirety of the Indian Ocean, even reaching East Africa through the voyages of Zheng He. This expanding trade brought new opportunities and wealth, spurring the growth of coastal cities and further promoting urbanization in China. In conclusion, urbanization increased in China due to a combination of factors such as population growth, complex division of labor, growth of private industries in large urban centers, the development of small urban centers with markets, and increased foreign trade and contact with the outside world. These factors worked in tandem to create a more economically and socially dynamic environment, driving the growth of cities and urban populations."},{"instruction":"Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Do not be mistaken, this is neither a horror, nor really a film.

During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as \\"The ruling monarch of the mind.\\" Harry Emerson Fosdick, pastor at New York's Riverside Church, gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance. Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration. Einstein next traveled to California where he met Caltech president and Nobel laureate, Robert A. Millikan. His friendship with Millikan was \\"awkward\\", as Millikan \\"had a penchant for patriotic militarism,\\" where Einstein was a pronounced pacifist. During an address to Caltech's students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good. This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted for their pacifism. Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios, gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner. Chaplin said Einstein's outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a \\"highly emotional temperament,\\" from which came his \\"extraordinary intellectual energy.\\" Chaplin also remembers Elsa telling him about the time Einstein conceived his theory of relativity. During breakfast one morning, he seemed lost in thought and ignored his food. She asked him if something was bothering him. He sat down at his piano and started playing. He continued playing and writing notes for half an hour, then went upstairs to his study, where he remained for two weeks, with Elsa bringing up his food. At the end of the two weeks he came downstairs with two sheets of paper bearing his theory. Chaplin's film, City Lights, was to premier a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests.

However, today Pope Francis took significant steps to balance his involvement in the longstanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In a first for the papal office, he placed a wreath on the grave of Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, as reported by the New York Times. This gesture lends symbolic support to the Zionist movement and acknowledges the historical significance of its founder. Pope Francis continued his efforts to promote peace and reconciliation by visiting the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial. During his visit, he showed deep respect and compassion for Holocaust survivors by kissing their hands and uttering the Jewish phrase, \\"Never again, Lord, never again.\\" This act demonstrates the Pope's commitment to honoring the memory of the Holocaust victims and expresses his desire to foster unity between Catholics and Jews. The Pope also took time to pray and leave a note at the Western Wall, one of the holiest sites in Judaism located in the Old City of Jerusalem. His visit is a symbolic gesture, emphasizing the importance of mutual respect between religious groups and acknowledging the deep significance of this site for Jews worldwide. Israeli President Shimon Peres praised Pope Francis for his actions, saying, \\"I believe that your visit and call for peace will echo through the region\\" and contribute to revitalizing the peace process, according to the Jerusalem Post. By extending gestures of goodwill to both Palestinians and Israelis, Pope Francis is making it clear that the Catholic Church stands on the side of peace and dialogue in the ongoing regional conflict.

These traumas include being coerced to take part in child pornography by Kayleigh and Tommy's father, George Miller (Eric Stoltz), being nearly strangled to death by his institutionalized father, Jason Treborn (Callum Keith Rennie), who is then killed in front of him by guards; accidentally killing a mother and her infant daughter while playing with dynamite with his friends; and seeing his dog being burned alive by Tommy. Seven years later, while entertaining a girl in his dorm room, Evan discovers that when he reads from his adolescent journals, he can travel back in time and redo parts of his past. His time traveling episodes account for the frequent blackouts he experienced as a child, since those are the moments that his adult self occupied his conscious, such as the moment his father strangled him when he realizes that Evan shares his time-traveling affliction. However, there are consequences to his revised choices that dramatically alter his present life. For example, his personal time-line leads to alternative futures in which he finds himself, variously, as a college student in a fraternity, an inmate imprisoned for murdering Tommy, and a double amputee. Eventually, he realizes that, even though his intentions to fix the past are good, his actions have unforeseen consequences, in which either he or at least one of his friends does not benefit. Moreover, the assimilation of dozens of years' worth of new memories from the alternative timelines causes him brain damage and severe nosebleeds. He ultimately reaches the conclusion that he and his friends will never have good futures as long as he keeps trying to fix the past, and he realizes that the only thing keeping his friends from having good lives is himself. Evan travels back one final time to the day he first met Kayleigh as a child. He intentionally upsets her so that she and...

Mei: OK, So, let's think first... Me:","output":"Yes, it is true that \\"A boy wearing a green shirt is jumping in front of a lane at a bowling alley.\\" Here is the justification for the answer: 1. Both sentences mention a boy: \\"A boy in a green shirt\\" and \\"A boy wearing a green shirt\\" - so the subject remains the same. 2. In both sentences, the boy is wearing a green shirt: \\"in a green shirt\\" and \\"wearing a green shirt\\" - so the description of the boy is consistent. 3. In both sentences, the action is that the boy is jumping: \\"is jumping\\" and \\"is jumping\\" - so the activity being described is the same. 4. Both sentences mention that the location of the activity is at a bowling alley: \\"at the end of a bowling alley\\" and \\"in front of a lane at a bowling alley.\\" While the first sentence specifies \\"the end of a bowling alley\\" and the second sentence specifies \\"in front of a lane,\\" both can be true as lanes typically run the entire length of a bowling alley. 5. The additional detail about the boy's arms being \\"in the air\\" in the first sentence does not contradict the information provided in the second sentence.

In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound. Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \\"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\\" he told supporters. Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s. Moore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \\"We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.' That is what we have got to do.\\" Moore had the full backing of the president in the final days of the campaign after Trump initially held back his endorsement in the wake of the allegations against Moore. The president responded Wednesday to questions at the White House about the Alabama race and said that he had hoped for a different result. \\"I wish we would have gotten the seat. A lot of Republicans feel differently. They are very happy with the way it turned out,\\" he said. \\"But as the leader of the party, I would have liked to have the seat. I want to endorse the people who are running.\\" Jones won in large part because of a strong Democratic turnout, especially by African-Americans. Moore was hurt by a depressed Republican turnout and a write-in campaign that drained away votes. Question: Why did Moore quote the bible? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"Moore quoted the Bible in his speech as a way to express his disappointment and to encourage his supporters to remain patient and hopeful despite the unfavorable outcome of the election. Drawing from Psalms 40, he implied that they should wait for God's guidance and plan in this situation. Moore's use of a biblical passage also reflects his strong religious beliefs and conservative values, which were a significant part of his campaign and appeal to certain voters."},{"instruction":"Question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Chemical compounds rise into the air - Chemical compounds mix with elements in clouds - The affected rain falls to the earth - The affected rain can harm natural and man-made objects because of its acidic content.

Additionally, registry offices usually manage and process civil marriages and partnerships. Based on the options provided, the most likely place where you might need to visit a registry office before entering is a \\"court house.\\" Here's a breakdown of each option: 1. City: A city itself doesn't require you to visit a registry office before entering. A registry office may be located within a city, but it is not a prerequisite for entry. 2. Court house: In some cases, you may need to visit a registry office before entering a court house if your visit is related to legal matters such as marriage, civil partnership, or obtaining vital record copies. In these situations, the registry office can provide you with the necessary documentation required for court proceedings. 3. Chapel: Chapels are primarily used for religious services and events. While marriages may take place in a chapel, you generally do not need to visit a registry office specifically before entering a chapel. However, before a religious marriage ceremony, a couple would likely need to visit a registry office to obtain a marriage license. 4.

Article: In a world today of immense technology, population growth and economic flourish, planning for future residential and commercial developments needs careful analysis with well thought through assumptions about effects on the environment and the people of the community. One example of a growing city is Wooster, Ohio, my place of residency, Wooster in the last five years has grown considerably in population, leading to a growth in commercial business. Surrounded by farmland, Wooster's planning commission chose to extend the community into these farm areas in the form of residential and commercial areas. Picture this--corn fields, old trees, clean air, country roads, and wildlife are all part of the area. Within four years, the people living on this farm step outside on their front porch to view an extensive shopping center containing Wal-Mart, McDonald's, Wendy's, TCBY, and a Cinemark movie theatre. The once quiet road is now a city street with traffic lights, busy with automobiles day and night. The air smells of car exhaust and fast food. Some destruction of farmland is unavoidable when a city expands. Instead of expanding outward, planning commissions should consider interior _ of a city. Tearing down unusable buildings could remodel many areas inside the city. In addition, commercialized buildings could extend upwards to avoid unnecessary use of land. Environmentally, commercial expansion is harmful to the land. Besides forms of pollution, wildlife, including both plants and animals, is put at risk. A planning commission could have realized the benefits of environmental protection. Why not preserve the beauty and naturalness of the land while at the same time allowing for growth? With a steady growth of population and the need for more homes and more workplaces, many problems arise when planning for the future. The hillsides, fields and animal habitats need to be preserved while expanding cities. In the future, a world covered with concrete and asphalt could become reality. Serious research and analysis...

The consequences of the increased water and rock activity can be assessed through the possible answers provided: A: More B: Less C: No effect To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the direct and indirect effects of more ocean water breaking rocks off of cliffs. Direct Effects: 1. Increased rate of erosion: More ocean water breaking rocks off of cliffs results in an augmented rate of erosion. This means there will be a greater amount of rock and sediment particles being carried away by the water, which can eventually be deposited elsewhere. 2. Increased sediment supply: This process of increased cliff erosion results in a higher supply of sediment available in the ocean. With more sediment available, the chances of sediment being deposited on the remains of animals and plants would increase. Indirect Effects: 1. Dynamics of sediment transport: The increased amount of sediment in the ocean can lead to a change in the dynamic equilibrium of sediment transportation. Sediment particles may be redistributed and deposited in new areas, possibly leading to an altered pattern of sediment cover on the remains of animals and plants. 2. Change in depositional environment: As more sediment is introduced into the ocean, the depositional environment of the remains of animals and plants might change. This could lead to either a less conducive environment for fossil preservation or favor the burial of remains under newly deposited sediment. Based on these observations, since more ocean water breaking rocks off of cliffs leads to an increase in available sediment and the possibility of a change in depositional environment, the most accurate answer would be: A: More The increased sediment supply resulting from more ocean water breaking rocks off of cliffs can lead to a greater likelihood that sediments will build on top of the animals and plants, potentially progressing the formation of fossils. However, it is crucial to note that many factors influence the deposition of sediments and the preservation of fossils, and these processes might vary considerably depending on the specific environmental conditions of the area in question."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: Uruguay, leader, Tabaré Vázquez.

If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. and the situation: After working out in the yard for the day doing various chores, Karen comes back inside to prepare for a shower. While waiting for the shower to heat up, she notices she got one cut on each of her arms. The cut on her left arm is hardly even noticeable, but the one on her right arm is red and easy to see. Karen gets some cream from her cabinet to use on her cuts after she gets done showering. Answer the following question: Which arm's blood vessels are more dilated? Answer:","output":"Karen's right arm's blood vessels are more dilated. Step 1: Identify the signs of inflammation From the given background information, we know that the signs of inflammation include redness, warmth, and pain. Karen notices that the cut on her right arm is red and easy to see, indicating a possible inflammation, while the cut on her left arm is hardly noticeable. Step 2: Relate inflammation to blood vessel dilation The background information tells us that when the body reacts to infections or injuries, it causes inflammation. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released in response to damaged skin or tissues. These chemicals cause the blood vessels in the affected area to dilate, or expand, increasing blood flow to the damaged area. Step 3: Compare the cuts on Karen's arms Since the cut on Karen's right arm is showing signs of inflammation (redness), it can be inferred that the blood vessels in her right arm are more dilated as a part of the body's inflammatory response to that injury. The cut on her left arm is not showing any visible signs of inflammation, and so we can assume that the blood vessels in her left arm are less dilated. In conclusion, Karen's right arm's blood vessels are more dilated due to the visible signs of inflammation."},{"instruction":"If Health-food promoters often cite traditional use by Native Americans or Chinese herbalists as evidence., can we conclude that \\"Chinese and Native American herbalist practices are sometimes co-opted by health-food promoters to sell product.\\"?","output":"Yes, we can say that sometimes health-food promoters use Chinese and Native American herbalist practices to sell their products.

As the steam is funneled to the piston, it expands and causes the piston to move in a linear motion. This linear motion, created by the force of the steam, drives a connecting rod which in turn rotates a crankshaft. The crankshaft's rotational motion is then used to power a generator or an alternator, which are designed to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. The generator or alternator functions by utilizing the principle of electromagnetic induction. As the crankshaft rotates, the generator converts this motion into electrical energy by rotating a magnet (rotor) within a coil of wire (stator). The changing magnetic field induces an electric current within the stator windings, which is then collected and distributed as electrical energy through transformers and power lines to be used by various devices and appliances. The steam that has transferred its energy to the piston now loses its temperature and pressure, and turns back into water. This condensed water is returned to the water tank above the boiler, where it is heated again, and the cycle repeats. This process is known as the Rankine cycle which is widely used in power plants for the generation of electricity. In summary, the final step of the process of coal being heated in a boiler to generate steam and power a piston is the conversion of mechanical energy produced by the piston into electrical energy through a generator or alternator, ultimately providing electricity for various uses."},{"instruction":"You are given a sentence in Polish.

The industry has filed a federal lawsuit demanding that the US Fish and Wildlife Service reinstate a no-otter zone off part of the coast, reports Courthouse News Service. It seems the sea otters love to hoover up shellfish, and the fishermen are afraid their livelihoods will be wiped out. \\"We're not attacking sea otters,\\" one of their attorneys tells the Los Angeles Times. \\"It's just that without a sea otter management zone, the fisheries our clients rely on will be decimated in 10 to 20 years.\\" Some background on the zone he's talking about, from a blog at Earthjustice: Congress authorized it in the 1980s. The idea was to relocate the otters from those fishing grounds to the more isolated San Nicolas Island, a move that was supposed to help both the otters and the fishermen. The problem is that the otters never took to the island and kept trying to return to their original waters. They would often get injured while being trapped and relocated. The Fish and Wildlife Service finally scrapped the no-otter zone in January, and the fishermen say the agency had no authority to do so. Environmental groups worried about the otters' stagnant population (about 2,800 for several years now) are stepping up to defend them in court. \\"If the fishermen's lawsuit were to prevail, our concern is that harm, injury and even death to sea otters would follow,\\" says a rep from the nonprofit Friends of the Sea Otter.

He visits Choule in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Choule's bedside, Trelkovsky meets Simone's friend, Stella (Isabelle Adjani), who has also come to visit. Stella begins talking to Simone, who becomes aware of her visitors. Initially showing some signs of agitation upon seeing them, Choule soon lets out a disturbing cry, then dies. It isn't clear which of the two has caused this reaction. Apparently unaware that Choule is now dead, Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone, instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie (1973's Enter The Dragon), where they fondle each other. Outside the theatre they part ways. As Trelkovsky occupies the apartment he is chastised unreasonably by his neighbors and landlord, Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas), for hosting a party with his friends, apparently having a woman over, making too much noise in general, and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor.

She never attempted to entrap her man or set him up in a tawdry kiss-and-tell. Yet it was her steamy text messages to Tiger Woods that set in train the public disgrace of a man who had been promoted as the most squeaky-clean, family-friendly sportsman of his generation. It was almost a year ago that the previously discreet Tiger fled his Florida home in the middle of the night after his furious wife Elin discovered Rachel’s texts. He crashed his car into a fire hydrant and a neighbour’s tree and was transported, dazed and bloody, to hospital. The superstar golfer’s highly paid image-makers went into overdrive to try to contain the PR fallout amid swirling rumours of an extramarital affair. New life: Rachel Uchitel, relaxing on a beach at Malibu, has now applied for a licence to work as a private detective But the scandal ballooned out of all control as a colourful procession of 15 women, including porn stars, strippers, waitresses and prostitutes, came forward to say that they had slept with Tiger. The sordid revelations led to the implosion of the sports star’s marriage, destroyed his career and forever wrecked his image as a calm, caring family man. The global icon at the centre of a multi-billion-dollar commercial empire was exposed as a deeply flawed man with feet of clay. But for the past 12 months, as Tiger has tried to piece together the wreckage of his life, Rachel, too, has had to face her demons. Thanks to her career as a nightclub hostess – essentially a highly-paid female nightclub maitre d’, looking after VIP clients such as Sir Philip Green and Premier League footballers, among many others – she has been reviled as little better than a prostitute, or at best a gold-digging marriage-wrecker. Yet Rachel’s friends insist that she is an intelligent, middle-class girl who sincerely believed her eight-month affair with Woods was a serious relationship with a ‘soul mate’, and who has never breathed a word in public about him. And tragically, they add, her previously respectable life was derailed on the darkest day in modern American history. On September 9, 2001, privately-educated Rachel was working as a television producer for the Bloomberg News channel and engaged to be married to 32-year-old investment banker Andrew O’Grady. He was killed in the Twin Towers atrocity. She briefly became the face of America’s grief after a picture of her holding a photo of her fiance was printed on the front page of the New York Post. Ever since, she has been trying to fill the void left in her life with a series of affairs with unsuitable men – of which her doomed love affair with Tiger Woods is just one. But last night Rachel, 35, finally broke her silence. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday from the ocean-front balcony of her rented home in Malibu, she said: ‘People have called me all sorts of names, but they don’t know me. I am not the same as the other girls and I never ever imagined in my wildest dreams that I would be caught up in a scandal like this. ‘If things had been different and 9/11 had never happened, my life would have taken a different course. I’d be fat and happy, living in a big house in Long Island with a load of kids. ‘I’m only telling my story now so that people can discover what sort of girl I am and learn the truth about me. If they still choose to hate me, then so be it. But I never set out to hurt anyone.’ In person, Rachel is tiny. Like so many women in Los Angeles, she has generously proportioned artificial breasts, plumped-up lips and a body kept whippet-thin with daily two-hour sessions in the gym (she’s clearly obsessed by her weight and constantly asks me if she looks fat). She has bought a pretty floral dress especially for our photoshoot but admits: ‘It is not something I would normally be caught dead in. But I want to show a different side of me. I’ve been branded as a scarlet woman but I am much, much more than that.’ Broken marriage: Elin and Tiger divorced in August following the scandal sparked by Rachel's texts to the golfer Rachel chain-smokes nervously as she recounts her life story for the first time. She has recently filmed a show in the new season of the series Celebrity Rehab (due to be shown in Britain early next year) in which she deals with her addiction to prescription pills – and love. ‘People don’t really understand love addiction, but I think a lot of women will relate to it,’ she explains. ‘Instead of filling themselves with booze or drugs, love addicts become emotionally invested in a series of bad relationships. Since I lost Andy, I have always been looking for the perfect man. I wanted a man who would marry me, give me the house and children I long for. I plunged headfirst into relationships which I should never have been in.’ I ask her if she regrets sleeping with a married man: ‘Yes, of course,’ she snaps. ‘I will never, ever do that again.’ Yet it’s clear the tragedy that befell her on 9/11 is only part of Rachel’s story. In fact her family history mirrors the good and the dark side of the great American dream. Her grandparents were penniless Ukrainian Jews who arrived in America with just the clothes on their backs. Since then, the Uchitels have made millions and mingled with Presidents and film stars. But Rachel’s father, Bob Uchitel, died of cocaine addiction at the early age of 44. She says proudly: ‘My Grandpa Maurice came to this country with nothing and built a fortune. He was in the rag trade and manufactured shoulder pads and linings for uniforms. He landed the contract for the US Army and made a fortune.’ Maurice married a Broadway singer called Patricia Pollack and the couple rubbed shoulders with President Kennedy, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. In 1966, he bought El Morocco, a legendary Manhattan nightclub, and the Eden Roc Hotel in Miami. ‘He was cool before it was cool to be cool,’ his granddaughter says proudly. ‘He was a big personality.’ Rachel’s father Bob was an entrepreneur who moved to Alaska because ‘he wanted to prove himself in the last frontier’. Together with wife Susan Bishop, Bob launched Alaska’s first cable television station: ‘My dad was ahead of his time. He went to Alaska with a thousand dollars in his pocket and earned his own millions. My mother was an on-air producer and host.’ When she was five, the couple split up and Susan returned to her native New York with Rachel: ‘It was hard. I didn’t see as much of my dad as I wanted. And then his addictions began.’ Bob Uchitel was found dead at his sprawling country estate in September 1990, with blood pouring from his nose. Grief-stricken: Rachel hunting for news of her fiance Andy O'Grady after the 9/11 attack The Anchorage Daily News reported: ‘The police found only one body, but ask Bob Uchitel’s friends, they’ll tell you two Bobs died that day. The old Bob was a strong man, a man of vision and intellect, a self-made Alaskan millionaire. The new Bob died alone, his body bruised and bloody, his brain cooked on cocaine.’ Rachel’s eyes cloud over: ‘The loss of my father was devastating to me. I was 15 when he died. It left a gaping hole in my life.’ Nevertheless, she followed a conventional path – private progressive boarding school in California, psychology degree from the University of New Hampshire, tele¬vision career with Bloomberg News. Ten years ago, she met handsome New York investment banker Andy O’Grady on a blind date. He proposed a few months later, in the summer of 2001. ‘We were madly in love and I was the happiest girl in the world,’ she says. ‘I was working as an assignment editor for Bloomberg News, Andy and I were talking about our future and kids. In Andy I had found my rock, a stable male figure that I’d never had . . . then 9/11 happened.’ Rachel’s face crumples. ‘Andy and I had just come back from a holiday in Greece. I left for work early that morning. I didn’t kiss him goodbye because I didn’t want to mess my lipstick. It’s something that haunts me.’ Rachel was at Bloomberg News as the first plane slammed into the World Trade Center: ‘Andy called and said, “Rachel, this is serious, I’ve just seen someone jump from the window of the other building.” He was working for Sandler O’Neill on the 104th floor of the South Tower. He hung up and I watched the second plane hit his building, 30 floors below where I knew he was. I tried calling him back but there was silence. Nothing.’ Grief-stricken, Rachel joined hundreds of other family members outside Bellevue Hospital: ‘I’d heard his name was on a list of survivors so I raced down there. They told me he wasn’t there and the news cameras got me as I left.’ She says the next year was a blur: ‘I sat in the closet in his clothes just to smell him. The doctors gave me pills to sleep. That’s when my addiction to Ambien started (Rachel allegedly introduced Tiger to the sleeping drug he took before he crashed his car). Andy’s credit cards were returned, burned, in the mail. Every day they would find bits of his life, a burned driver’s licence or whatever, and I would have to open the envelope. ‘I went through hell. I fell to pieces. When the one-year anniversary of 9/11 happened, most of his friends had moved on. People we knew had married and were starting families. I felt robbed.’ Given the sudden, premature losses of her father and fiance, it is little wonder Rachel began to career out of control, and that finding a replacement man became her leitmotif. She embarked on a brief, disastrous marriage to one of Andy’s best friends, Wall Street trader Steven Ehrenkranz: ‘We were both grieving. It was a mistake.’ After that, Rachel says: ‘I had to leave New York and move on with my life for my own sanity. I had to reinvent myself.’ She loaded her belongings into her car and headed west to Las Vegas, where her grandfather had a house. Within months she had landed a job as head of VIP operations at Tao Nightclub in The Venetian casino. She later acted in a similar role at other clubs in Vegas, including The Bank at Bellagio. ‘I am not a whore, nor am I a girl impressed by money or fame,’ she says. ‘I have a brain and I came from money. I never needed any man’s money.’ It was a job that would bring her into contact with the world’s richest men: ‘I still have my little black book and it has 5,000 men in there who are pretty much the men who run the world,’ she says grandly. ‘My life became one of private jets. My job was to get the high-rollers, or whales – as we called them – into the club and give them anything and everything they wanted to have the best night of their lives – guys who would order 100 bottles of Cristal champagne in a night or even blow 500,000 [£300,000] on one night of partying. ‘If they wanted steak, they got steak. If they wanted a certain song, I’d get it played on a loop all night. A Saudi prince loved Uptown Girl so I sent someone out to get it and that prince had Uptown Girl all night. ‘And if they wanted girls, I’d get them girls, though you have to understand I never got involved in that side of things. Of course, some of the girls were hookers. And others would sleep with men for gifts. But I didn’t force anyone to do anything. These were consenting adults. I was there to work and make money. It was strictly business.’ She claims she earned £300,000 a year: ‘I was paid well and got huge tips. I deserved it. I was good at my job.’ She also insists she ‘mostly’ went home alone, but it was as nightclub hostess that she met Tiger Woods and embarked on their affair. According to friends, the golfer bombarded her with texts and emails promising to leave his wife and calling her his ‘soul mate’. One source told me: ‘They were both emotionally immature. Tiger was trapped in an unhappy marriage and Rachel worshipped him. They both thought they had found the love of their lives and got caught up in the drama.’ Rachel refuses point blank to discuss her affair with Tiger. It is widely rumoured that a £6 million commercial settlement was reached a year ago. When I ask Rachel directly about the pay-off, she smiles sweetly and says: ‘Naughty you. You know I can’t say anything.’ Yet the signs all point to the fact that Tiger ‘invested’ in her silence. She recently bought an apartment on Park Avenue in New York for more than £2 million. She owns an apartment in Las Vegas and splits her time in LA between Beverly Hills and Malibu, where a £10,000 tan Hermes bag sits casually on a side table. The last year has seen her embark on rehab, study for a masters degree in psychology and, bizarrely, apply for a professional private eye’s licence. ‘I should get it next month ,’ she says with a wry smile. ‘And, yes, that means I will be hunting down cheating husbands. It is all part of me moving on with my life and I figured I may as well do something career-wise that I have a flair for.’ She reveals she has gained a sense of humour about Tiger – when I tell her she is much prettier than most of Wood’s other women, she giggles: ‘It’s hard not to be,’ before calling Tiger’s lover Mindy Lawton ‘poor Mindy’ (referring to her looks) and adding about cocktail waitress Jaimee Grubbs: ‘The poor girl had a tooth missing. Honestly! She was toothless!’ ||||| This might be the most fitting couple in the world.Sources close to Jason Wahler tell us that he's falling for Rachel Uchitel, most infamously known for being the rumored head notch on Tiger Woods' naughty belt (can you believe it's almost been a year since that crap came out?).The two Read More |||||Summary:","output":"Rachel Uchitel, the woman whose affair with Tiger Woods led to the downfall of the golfing superstar's career and marriage, has broken her silence on the scandal. Uchitel, a former nightclub hostess who had an eight-month affair with Woods, never intended to be the catalyst for a scandal.

Uchitel's friends insist that she is an intelligent and sincere person who believed she had a real relationship with Woods and has never spoken publicly about him. After the 9/11 attacks, in which her fiancé was killed, Uchitel sought solace in a series of affairs with unsuitable men. Reflecting on her relationship with Woods, Uchitel admits she regrets sleeping with a married man and vows never to do it again. Since the scandal, Uchitel has focused on rehabilitating her life, starting with addressing her addiction to prescription pills and love on the television show \\"Celebrity Rehab\\".

He is considered one of the most ruthless drug lords around, operating an invisible drug empire that stretches all the way from Alaska to Chile, and he's proven impossible to catch, having managed to kill, intimidate or bribe every major politician in the Western Hemisphere who could give him up.As Bond, Leiter, and Leiter's fishing buddy Sharkey (Frank McRae) drive to the wedding, Leiter's boss, Hawkins (Grand L.

No, the sentence provided does not directly answer the question \\"Which author did Lee aspire to be like?\\". However, it offers some indirect information that can help deduce some conclusions regarding Harper Lee's inspiration. The sentence states that \\"One writer notes that Scout, 'in Austenian fashion', satirizes women with whom she does not wish to identify.\\" This implies a similarity in the literary technique used by Scout, a character in Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", with those employed by Jane Austen, a famous English novelist. The term \\"Austenian fashion\\" specifically evokes the style of Austen's works, characterized by social commentary, wit, satire, and keen observation of human nature. Although the sentence indicates that Lee's writing style is reminiscent of Jane Austen's style, it does not directly confirm that Lee aspired to be like Austen. The comparison drawn is solely based on the similarity of their techniques. Aspiring to be like an author would suggest a more profound admiration, influence, or emulation that goes beyond just using similar writing techniques. To decisively answer the question \\"Which author did Lee aspire to be like?\\", one would need more context or direct evidence from Lee's life, interviews, or other writings where she might have expressed her admiration or aspirations towards a particular author. In conclusion, while the sentence provided highlights a similarity between Lee's and Austen's writing styles, it does not explicitly answer whether Harper Lee aspired to be like Jane Austen or another author among the available options.

One morning, Ann asks David if he had to do it over again, would he marry her? To her disappointment, although he is very happy with her now and wouldn't marry someone else, he answers that he would not. Later that day, Harry Deever (Charles Halton), an Idaho county official, informs David that due to a jurisdictional mishap, their three-year-old marriage license from Idaho is not valid.

Last Saturday evening, I had the pleasure of dining at The Garden Greenhouse restaurant with my spouse, and I cannot express just how exquisite the experience was! The moment we stepped into this charming establishment, we were greeted with a warm and inviting ambiance that was delicately infused with sheer elegance. From the twinkling fairy lights draped gracefully over the verdant plants, to the rustic wooden tables adorned with crisp, white tablecloths, and the gentle, live piano music floating through the air – the atmosphere was sheer perfection. We were promptly seated near the soothing, indoor waterfall feature by the courteous host, providing us with a magical backdrop for the night. Our server, Sarah, arrived at our table, her friendly smile radiating warmth and professionalism that instantly won us over. She took the time to elaborately describe the chef's specials and offered recommendations based on our dietary preferences, making us feel genuinely cared for and attended to. Now, onto the culinary masterpieces! For our appetizers, we chose the delectable truffle mushroom bruschetta, and I must say, it was a symphony of flavors in each bite! The mushrooms were cooked to perfection, and the truffle oil infused just the right amount of earthiness to enhance the overall taste. Our other starter, the goat cheese and walnut-stuffed figs wrapped in prosciutto, were a delightful medley of sweet, salty, and savory – a true work of art! For our main courses, I opted for the pan-seared Chilean sea bass served atop a bed of sautéed spinach and drizzled with a delicate lemon-butter sauce. The fish was cooked to utter perfection – moist, flaky and bursting with flavor. My spouse went for the braised short rib cooked in a rich wine reduction, accompanied by a velvety, garlic mashed potatoes. The short rib was so tender it practically melted in our mouths, and the depth of flavor in the wine-infused sauce was simply divine. As for dessert, our server, Sarah, recommended their signature vanilla bean crème brûlée, and she didn't steer us wrong. The dessert was an indulgent treat, with a flawlessly crisp caramelized sugar crust that broke away delicately to reveal the silkiest, rich, and creamy custard within. We couldn't have asked for a better way to end our feast! Besides the phenomenal food, the service was equally impressive throughout the evening. Sarah checked on us at just the right intervals and made sure our water glasses were always full. She displayed an extensive knowledge of the menu, was attentive without being intrusive, and her suggestions added to our unforgettable dining experience. In conclusion, The Garden Greenhouse is not just a restaurant, but a true culinary haven filled with as much love and passion for food as for providing memorable experiences.

Possible A: fast food restaurant, plate, bowl, freezer, oven Why is \\"fast food restaurant\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"\\"Fast food restaurant\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly relates to the context and nature of KFC as an establishment. KFC, which stands for Kentucky Fried Chicken, is a well-known international fast food chain that primarily serves chicken dishes. By understanding this background information about KFC, it becomes clear why \\"fast food restaurant\\" is the most appropriate and common-sense answer among the given options. Let's analyze the other possible answers to further understand why \\"fast food restaurant\\" prevails as an answer that aligns with human common sense: 1. Plate: While a plate is indeed a dish or surface used for serving and eating food, this answer is too narrow and specific to provide a comprehensive understanding of KFC's overall purpose. It does not convey the concept that KFC is an establishment where chicken dishes are prepared and served. 2. Bowl: Similar to the \\"plate\\" answer, the term \\"bowl\\" refers to a container in which one can serve or eat food. However, it does not encompass the broad nature of KFC as a fast-food chain that serves a variety of chicken-based meals, not just those served in a bowl. 3. Freezer: A freezer is an appliance used to store food at low temperatures to preserve its freshness. Although KFC may use freezers to store ingredients and pre-prepared meals, the term does not convey KFC's overall function as a restaurant. Therefore, it is not an answer aligned with human common sense in this context. 4. Oven: An oven is a crucial appliance for cooking various types of food, and it is most likely used in KFC's cooking process, especially when it comes to preparing their signature fried chicken. Nevertheless, the term \\"oven\\" does not fully capture the essence of KFC as a fast-food restaurant, making this option less aligned with human common sense in comparison to \\"fast food restaurant.\\" In conclusion, \\"fast food restaurant\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it accurately depicts the primary function and nature of KFC. Other options, such as plate, bowl, freezer, and oven, may be related to the food industry but do not appropriately represent KFC's role as a fast-food chain serving chicken dishes."},{"instruction":"Write the answer: Temple Meads Railway Station is in which English city?","output":"Step 1: Identify the question The question asks for the English city where Temple Meads Railway Station is located.

Question: Which intricate emotions did Turner come up with? Context: A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant. Answer:","output":"In Turner's theory, the intricate emotions, also known as first-order elaborations, that he came up with include pride, triumph, and awe. These emotions are derived from the combination of primary emotions such as assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness."},{"instruction":"Q:Build a movie plot around this: Who does Tina have sex with?

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Who was released before a second search Movie title: The Lives of Others Movie plot: The Lives of Others is at once a political thriller and a human drama. The film opens in East Berlin in 1984 with a sequence that alternates scenes from an interrogation with scenes from a training class for aspiring officers of the Stasi, or secret police. Stasi Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), code name HGW XX/7, is demonstrating his interrogation technique using audio of his own interrogation of a suspect. Wiesler instructs the students on how to tell whether a subject is lying. A student asks a question that Wiesler judges to be a bit too compassionate (read \\"bourgeois\\"), and the professor marks the student's name on the attendance record: surely this student has just flunked the course, or worse. During the feature's first thirty minutes, writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck draws a portrait of Wiesler that borders on caricature: Wiesler is a highly skilled officer of the Stasi, a proud, zealous, disciplined and entirely cold-blooded professional. He is one of the many cogs in the wheel of \\"the System,\\" working anonymously and tirelessly, convinced that his efforts are building a better Socialist society.At the end of the class, Lieutenant-Colonel Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), Wiesler's old school friend (and probably his only friend), who has risen to the position of head of the Culture Department at Stasi, comes to invite Wiesler to a theatrical premiere. The play is by the celebrated East German playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), and its leading character is played by Dreyman's lover, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), an actress of great reputation. Dreyman, who writes plays about the heroic proletariat, lives a rather comfortable life in a plush East Berlin apartment, enjoying a certain notoriety among DDR officials who value him because he's one of the few East German writers whose work is read in the west. He preserves the respect of the artistic community by using his (relatively) secure position for occasional interventions in favor of dissident fellow artists.... Answer:","output":"In order to decide whether investing in the film proposal for \\"The Lives of Others\\" is a good decision, it is essential to address a few critical questions regarding its potential success. These questions will help offer insight into the film's marketability, the strengths of its plot, the talent involved, and its appeal to target audiences. 1. Marketability: Considering the movie's plot and themes, does it have the potential for a broad appeal or attract a niche audience? \\"The Lives of Others\\" deals with political intrigue, human drama, and a powerful historical context. This could attract both audiences interested in the history of East Germany and those who enjoy character-driven dramas. Apart from its themes, the critical acclaim and recognition the original film received can also generate interest amongst potential viewers. 2. Cast and Director: Are there well-known or talented actors and a reputable director attached to the project? The quality of a film often relies on the talent of its cast and crew. It is essential to investigate the knowledge and experience of the filmmakers, as well as the attached actors. Engaging with the right talent can help elevate the film's artistic value and appeal to a broader audience base. 3. Awards and critical recognition potential: Does the film have the potential to gain critical acclaim, receive awards, or be recognized internationally? As a remake of Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's Oscar-winning film, investing in it could lead to prestigious recognition and awards. These accolades may potentially elevate the film's visibility and boost its financial success. 4. Target audience: What is the target demographic for the film, and how does its intended audience align with current market trends? \\"The Lives of Others\\" may especially appeal to adult viewers who appreciate historical and political dramas. However, given the film's plot and subject matter, it may not cater to younger audiences or those seeking light entertainment. Understanding the film's appeal and target demographic is an essential factor in gauging its potential success in the market. 5.

To provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer to the question, we can explore the different types of decorative items, their purposes, and how traditional Tuvalu designs are incorporated in them. Traditional Tuvalu designs are not limited to the functional items like canoes and fish hooks mentioned in the statement. The Tuvaluan arts and crafts also include a wide range of decorative items that showcase their rich cultural heritage. Let's discuss some examples. 1. Tapa cloth: Tapa (called \\"fatele\\" in Tuvaluan) is a traditional cloth made from the bark of the paper mulberry tree. After being soaked, pounded, and processed, fatele is often decorated with intricate geometric patterns, floral motifs, and other symbolic designs to create wall hangings, ceremonial garments, and gifts. This form of textile art plays a significant role in the culture and ceremonies of Tuvalu. 2. Handicrafts: Tuvaluan handicrafts make use of natural materials, such as coconut shells, pandanus leaves, and fronds, to create baskets, mats, fans, and hats. These items often incorporate traditional Tuvalu designs and motifs either by weaving different colored leaves together or by dyeing and printing on the materials. 3. Carvings and sculptures: Tuvalu has a long tradition of wood carving, with skilled craftsmen creating decorative carvings and sculptures inspired by island motifs, such as turtles, fish, birds, and other elements of nature. These carvings can range from small personal items, such as combs and jewelry, to larger pieces of art displayed in homes and public places. 4. Tattoos: Tattooing is another form of artistic expression that features traditional Tuvalu designs. These tattoos often incorporate symbols that represent family lineage, social status, or spiritual connections and are applied using traditional methods and tools. 5. Dance costumes: Dance is a significant aspect of Tuvaluan culture, and traditional costumes feature the use of bright colors, feathers, shells, and other natural materials. The costumes themselves can be embellished with symbols and patterns associated with Tuvaluan heritage. In conclusion, various decorative items use traditional Tuvalu designs, including tapa cloth, handicrafts, carvings and sculptures, tattoos, and dance costumes. These items serve not only as expressions of artistry but also as a means to preserve and promote the unique heritage of the Tuvalu people."},{"instruction":"FINAL EXAM Question 1. Dpo the genuses Anthemis and Veronica belong to the same family? A:","output":"No, the genuses Anthemis and Veronica do not belong to the same family. They belong to two different families within the plant kingdom. Anthemis, commonly known as chamomile, is a genus that belongs to the family Asteraceae, also known as the sunflower family or the daisy family. The Asteraceae is one of the largest and most diverse families of flowering plants, with over 23,000 species distributed across about 1,620 genera. This family is characterized by its unique inflorescence, called a capitulum, which gives the appearance of a single flower but is actually composed of numerous smaller flowers called florets. Family members often have alternate, simple, and arranged leaves, and they can be found in a variety of habitats worldwide, including grasslands, forests, and wetlands. Anthemis itself comprises around 200 species of herbaceous perennials and annuals, mainly distributed in the Mediterranean region and Southwest Asia. These plants have finely divided leaves and capitulum inflorescence with white or yellow ray florets surrounding disk florets. Some species within this genus are used for their medicinal properties, such as Anthemis nobilis (Roman chamomile) and Anthemis tinctoria (golden marguerite). These species are known for their calming effects and are used to treat minor ailments like stomachaches, skin irritations, and insomnia. Veronica, on the other hand, is a genus that belongs to the family Plantaginaceae, which is commonly known as the plantain family. This family includes around 1,900 species of flowering plants spread across about 90 genera. The Plantaginaceae family is characterized by its bilaterally symmetrical flowers with usually five petals that are fused at the base, opposite leaves, and capsules or utricles as fruit types. The family members are distributed worldwide in a variety of habitats, from mountains to coastal regions and from wetlands to arid deserts. The genus Veronica itself consists of approximately 500 species of annuals, perennials, and subshrubs, widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, Australia, and New Zealand. These plants are known for their brightly colored, usually blue, flowers and their various medicinal uses. Some commonly known species within the Veronica genus are Veronica officinalis (heath speedwell), Veronica chamaedrys (germander speedwell), and Veronica beccabunga (brooklime). These plants have been used for their astringent, diuretic, and expectorant properties, and in the treatment of coughs, respiratory infections, and skin conditions, among other ailments. In conclusion, while both Anthemis and Veronica are genera of flowering plants, they differ significantly in their taxonomy, morphological characteristics, and distribution. Anthemis belongs to the Asteraceae family and is primarily associated with the Mediterranean region and Southwest Asia, whereas Veronica is a part of the Plantaginaceae family and has a more widespread distribution across the Northern Hemisphere, Australia, and New Zealand. Their flowers, leaves, and fruit structures are different, and they are adapted to distinct habitats and environmental conditions."},{"instruction":"Write an article using the following points: Jacky Goodfellow, 40, gave the 23-year-old Eritrean snacks as they chatted.

She gave him Hula Hoops and Penguin bar - but he couldn't open the crisps. Mrs Goodfellow said: 'He was a very pleasant young man... we are all human'","output":"Title: Humanity Beyond Borders: The Compassionate Encounter Between Jacky Goodfellow and an Eritrean Asylum Seeker In this world divided by geographical boundaries, cultural differences, and political affiliations, it is heartwarming to find instances where human connections trump artificial barriers. Such was the case when a 40-year-old British woman, Jacky Goodfellow, displayed a moment of empathy and kindness towards a young Eritrean asylum seeker who knocked on her door in Elvington, near Dover. This story is one that goes beyond nationality and speaks to the very core of what it means to be human. The refugee, a 23-year-old Eritrean man, had been through unimaginable hardships as he fled his home country in search of a better life. Eritrea, a small nation in East Africa, has been plagued by war, political repression, and human rights abuses. Many of its citizens embark on a perilously long journey to seek asylum in safer nations where they can build a new future. Jacky Goodfellow was home with her daughter when the asylum seeker knocked on their door. Despite the language barriers, the two engaged in a conversation fueled by curiosity and goodwill. The young man, a science graduate, voiced his dreams of becoming a teacher and making a difference in the world around him. The ambition and resilience of the Eritrean youth moved Goodfellow, while her daughter quickly called the police to ensure he received the help he needed. As they continued chatting, Goodfellow took it upon herself to extend some gestures of kindness to the young man. She offered him popular British snacks, including Hula Hoops and a Penguin bar. The refugee, unfamiliar with the packaging of these treats, found himself unable to open the crisps. It was this small, shared experience of laughter amid adversity that humanized their exchange. Reflecting on the encounter, Mrs. Goodfellow expressed her admiration for the asylum seeker, stating, \\"He was a very pleasant young man... we are all human.\\" Her ability to see past the external circumstances of his life and her willingness to empathize with his predicament is a testament to the power of human connection. This story resonates on multiple levels. Not only does it highlight the unwavering aspirations of a young man who has braved unfathomable challenges, but it also serves as an example of how even fleeting connections can bridge seemingly insurmountable cultural divides. Jacky Goodfellow's kindness exemplifies that humanity can be found in even the smallest of gestures. It is essential for society to recognize that individuals seeking refuge are more than just their harrowing stories; they are people with aspirations, passions, and courage. Similarly, the citizens of host countries can act with compassion, reminding us all that humanity knows no borders. In conclusion, the story of Jacky Goodfellow and the Eritrean asylum seeker is one that should inspire others to cultivate understanding and empathy in their daily lives, challenging the presumption that cultural differences preclude meaningful connections. It reminds us that what unites us is far greater than what divides us, and that we all have it within us to extend a helping hand to someone in need. It's stories like these that give us faith in the power of human interaction and inspire us to work together, regardless of our backgrounds and situations, to create a more inclusive world for all."},{"instruction":"Bu arada, Arnavut ordusunun barış operasyonlarıyla ilgili eğitim almasını destekleme amaçlı 2 milyon dolarlık bir bağış da, Amerikan müttefiklerinin koalisyon ortaklarıyla sağlam bir barışı koruma kapasitesi geliştirmesine yardım etme amaçlı bir program olan GPOI yoluyla yapıldı.

(Associated Press) A woman who said she was Maria Do Rosario Valente, the wife of fugitive George Wright is seen outside the house where neighbors said Wright lived in Almocagema, near Lisbon Wednesday, Sept. 28, 2011.... (Associated Press) He married a local woman, raised two children and grew old in a pretty house on a cobbled street near a stunning beach. Locals knew him as Jorge Santos, a friendly man from Africa who did odd jobs and spoke fluent Portuguese. He kept his true identity secret: convicted murderer, prison escapee and accused hijacker. Wright's decades-long flight from justice ended when the 68-year-old American was taken into custody by local police Monday at the request of the U.S. government. On Tuesday, he appeared before a judge in Lisbon, the capital, for an initial extradition hearing. Residents of this charming coastal town were coming to terms Wednesday with the fact that a man they knew and liked had been living a lie. \\"I never imagined George was in trouble,\\" gas station attendant Ricardo Salvador said. Most assumed Wright was African, not American. His Portuguese identity card said he was born in Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony in West Africa. A photocopy, shown to The Associated Press, bore the name Jose Luis Jorge dos Santos, an alias U.S. officials said Wright used. It was issued in 1993 and expired in 2004. Salvador and other residents said Wright had business cards that gave his first name as Jorge or George, and many called him by the latter. \\"He was a very nice guy,\\" Salvador said as he took a break from pumping gas on a sunny autumn day in Almocageme, 28 miles (45 kilometers) west of Lisbon. \\"He used to wave as he drove past and I'd shout out, 'Hey, George!'\\" In his younger years, Wright was a darker character. He was convicted of the 1962 murder of gas station owner Walter Patterson, a decorated World War II veteran shot during a robbery at his business in Wall, New Jersey. Eight years into his 15- to 30-year prison term, Wright and three other men escaped from the Bayside State Prison in Leesburg, New Jersey, on Aug. 19, 1970. While on the run, the FBI said Wright joined an underground militant group, the Black Liberation Army, and lived in a communal family with several of its members in Detroit. In 1972, Wright _ dressed as a priest and using an alias _ is accused of hijacking a Delta flight from Detroit to Miami along with four other Black Liberation Army members and three children, including Wright's companion and their 2-year-old daughter. His capture drew reactions on both sides of the Atlantic. Ann Patterson, daughter of the murdered New Jersey gas station owner, told the AP she wants Wright sent back quickly. \\"I'm so thankful that now there's justice for Daddy,\\" she said. \\"He never got any kind of justice.\\" Rui Santos, who works at the Almocageme village council, said he was \\"stunned\\" by the news. \\"I'd never have thought it possible,\\" he said outside a newsstand. He said Wright approached him in the mid-1990s and offered to coach local kids at basketball, though the project never got off the ground. Until his arrest, life was quiet for Wright in this hamlet of a few hundred residents, where neighbors said he lived for at least 20 years. Speaking Portuguese with a slight foreign accent, he worked at a series of odd jobs, most recently as a nightclub bouncer, said two neighbors who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared being stigmatized for speaking out. Wright also once had a stall at the beach and ran a barbecue chicken restaurant. He married a Portuguese woman, identified by neighbors as 55-year-old Maria do Rosario Valente, the daughter of a retired Portuguese army officer. They had two children _ Marco and Sara, now in their early 20s _ who used their mother's last name when they registered for swim classes at the local pool. The family lived in a neat whitewashed house with terra cotta roof tiles, a yellow door and a small front garden. At the front gate, a black mailbox in the shape of a barn carried the words \\"U.S. Mail.\\" A gray VW Passat station wagon that neighbors said Wright drove was parked on the narrow dead-end street. A woman who answered the door confirmed she was Maria do Rosario Valente and said she had no comment about the arrest. About a mile (1.6 kilometers) away was the breathtaking Praia da Adraga beach, a sandy cove surrounded by steep rocky hillsides that has a natural rock tunnel where ocean waves blast through. A fingerprint contained on Wright's Portuguese ID card as required by law was the break that led a U.S. fugitive task force to him, according to U.S. authorities. Wright's capture was among the top priorities when the New York-New Jersey Fugitive Task Force was formed in 2002, according to Michael Schroeder, a spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service, who worked with New Jersey's FBI and other agencies on the case. \\"They have a national ID registry,\\" Schroeder said of Portugal. \\"They pulled that. That confirmed his print matched the prints with the (Department of Corrections in New Jersey). The sketch matched the picture on his ID card.\\" Schroeder said the task force had been aware for at least several months of the possibility that Wright could be in Portugal. \\"Once the investigative group had a strong belief that George Wright might be in Portugal, we proceeded to take the next steps immediately. But those steps take time,\\" Ward said. Wright was being detained in Lisbon while the extradition process continued, but Portuguese police refused to release any details about the case. U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Laura Sweeney said she couldn't speculate on how long extradition might take. Back in 1972, Wright and his alleged accomplices released the hijacked plane's 86 passengers in exchange for a 1 million (euro730,000 million) ransom _ delivered by an FBI agent wearing only swim trunks as ordered by the hijackers. They then forced the plane to fly to Boston, where an international navigator was taken aboard, and the plane was flown to Algeria. The group was taken in by American activist and writer Eldridge Cleaver, who had been permitted by Algeria's socialist government to open a Black Panther Movement office in 1970. The Algerian president then professed sympathy for what he saw as worldwide liberation struggles. At the request of the U.S. government, Algerian authorities returned the plane and the ransom to the United States. They briefly detained the hijackers before allowing them to stay. But their movements were restricted and the Algerian president ignored their requests for asylum. Wright and the others left Algeria in late 1972 or early 1973 and settled in France, said Mikhael Ganouna, producer of a 2010 documentary about the hijacking, \\"Nobody Knows my Name.\\" Wright left the group after breaking up with a girlfriend, and no one knew where he went, Ganouna said. Wright's associates were all eventually tracked down, arrested and tried. They were convicted in Paris in 1976, but the French government refused to extradite them to the U.S., where they would have faced longer sentences. One of them, George Brown, lives in Paris but isn't worried about being extradited because he has already served his sentence, Ganouna said. Over the years, the New Jersey Department of Corrections task force on fugitives reviewed reports from the 1970s, interviewed Wright's victims and the pilots of the hijacked plane, had age-enhanced sketches made of the fugitive and tracked any possible links to his family in the U.S. An address in Portugal was one of several leads they wanted to check, but Schroeder said there was nothing special about it. \\"It was another box to get checked, so to speak,\\" he said. That changed last week when details started falling into place with the help of Portuguese authorities. By the weekend, U.S. authorities were on a plane to Portugal. On Monday, Portuguese police took Wright into custody. William May, the pilot of the Detroit-Miami flight hijacked in 1972, said Wright was the group's leader. \\"It's been 40 years,\\" May said. \\"I'm surprised there was even any interest in finding him still.\\" ___ Alan Clendenning in Madrid, Jamey Keaton in Paris, Wayne Parry in Howell, New Jersey; Samantha Henry in Newark, New Jersey; Geoff Mulvihill in Trenton, New Jersey; Tom Breen in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Karen Zraick, Rhonda Shafner, Barbara Sambriski and Judith Ausuebel in New York contributed to this report. ||||| Mr. Wright had been convicted of shooting a gas station owner, Walter Patterson, a decorated World War II veteran. Mr. Wright, who got away with 70, was eventually sentenced to 15 to 30 years. In August 1970, he and three other men escaped from what is now Bayside State Prison in Leesburg, N.J. Mr. Wright ended up in Detroit in a commune-like house on Manistique Street where it appeared the residents had practiced their own brand of religion. There was a mound of dirt in the living room, and in the center, a doll that had been stabbed with a knife. There were also a Bible and what the police said were astrological signs. The house is gone and it is now an empty, overgrown lot. In 1972, Mr. Wright, dressed as a priest, was at the center of the group that hijacked Captain May’s plane, Delta Flight 841, and demanded 1 million, according to the F.B.I. The hijackers also demanded that the plane be flown to Algeria, where they were counting on asylum. “He said, ‘You tell ’em this’ and ‘You tell ’em that,’ ” Captain May recalled on Wednesday. “I said, ‘You tell ’em,’ and I handed him the mike. He said, ‘If that money is not here by 2 o’clock, I’m going to start throwing a dead body out the door every minute after 2 o’clock.’ I really thought that was an empty threat, but you can’t be sure, and I didn’t know two of them were escaped cons in for murder. I’d have been a lot nicer if I’d known that. We had some pretty tough conversations going on. Then the F.B.I. guy said the money’s on the way.” The plan was to send out a trucklike vehicle with steps that could reach the cabin door, and two people — one to drive the truck, the other to carry the suitcase with the money. “They said, ‘I want these guys to come out here nude’ ” so it would be clear they were not carrying guns, Captain May recalled. “I said, ‘Wait a second.’ I said, ‘These guys can’t come out here nude. Be reasonable.’ ” He said the co-pilot suggested bathing suits. They released the passengers, and the plane left for Boston and then Algiers. Four years after the hijacking, the others were arrested in Paris. But Mr. Wright remained on the loose. Ann Patterson, the daughter of the man Mr. Wright had shot in 1962, said she “felt like a burden had been lifted.” She said her father had been a driver in the Army and had been awarded the Bronze Star after getting his troops out when they came under heavy fire in woods in Italy. Once, Ms. Patterson said, she asked, “Daddy, why did you do that?” “He said, ‘Because they were my men and I had to get them out,’ ” she recalled. |||||","output":"After escaping from a New Jersey prison 41 years ago, George Wright lived a quiet life in Almocageme, Portugal where he married a local woman, raised two children and maintained a series of odd jobs. This all came to a sudden end in 2011 when his true identity -- a convicted murderer, prison escapee, and accused hijacker -- was revealed. Wright was convicted for the 1962 murder of a gas station owner in Wall, New Jersey. Serving his 15- to 30-year prison term, Wright escaped eight years later, joining the underground militant group, the Black Liberation Army. While at large, Wright is accused of hijacking a Delta flight from Detroit to Miami in 1972, alongside four other Black Liberation Army members. After his arrest in Portugal, Wright appeared before a judge in Lisbon for an initial extradition hearing. U.S. authorities had been aware of the possibility that Wright was in Portugal for several months. A fingerprint contained on Wright's Portuguese ID card, which was required by law, provided the break that led the U.S. fugitive task force to him.

Tragic: Liam Hardy, 14, had been hospitalised after a suicide attempt less than a week before he died, an inquest heard. A 14-year-old schoolboy who was about to become a father was found hanged days after being discharged from hospital following a suicide attempt. Liam Hardy was allowed to leave St Helier Hospital in Carshalton, Surrey, after his first suicide bid - despite pleas from his mother for him to be sectioned, an inquest heard. Days later, he was readmitted when he tried to hang himself at home. Again, the teenager was released within hours. But that same week, Liam was found dead in his bedroom as his grandfather took him a cup of hot chocolate. He had just texted his girlfriend to say: 'It's no use, I'm giving up'. Despite. desperate attempts by Terry Hardy and paramedics to resuscitate the teenager, Liam never regained consciousness and died at St Georges’ Hospital, South London, nine days later. Giving evidence at an inquest into her son’s death, Janine Hardy wept as she claimed pleas to have her son taken into care as a precaution were ignored. She had caught Liam during his first attempt after school on November 15, 2012. Despite trying to calm him down, he persisted until police and ambulance crews arrived, treated him for a superficial injury and took him to St Helier. Even though he was seen by a doctor, a specialist nurse from the district Children and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMHS) and his therapist, Liam was allowed to leave and go back to his pregnant girlfriend’s house, against his mother’s wishes. He was readmitted and discharged once more, before his grandfather found him on November 19, 2012. He died on November 27. Accompanied by her partner, Ms Hardy said: 'I gave her all Liam’s history about his self-harming, what was going on in the present situation, how he didn’t get on with [his therapist] Catelin, that he wasn’t taking help seriously, about the pregnancy. 'She said she would go and speak to Liam, she would go and speak to him alone. She was in there for about 10 minutes. We went back in to the room. There was the C.A.M.S nurse, myself and Dean. Devastated: Liam's mother, Janine Hardy, (pictured, left, outside Croydon Coroner's Court and, right, with her son) said she asked for him to be sectioned but her calls went ignored. 'She said that Liam was fine now, he didn’t intend to die, no he doesn’t want to die. I told her he intended to do this. 'She said that in her opinion it was fine for him to go back to his girlfriend’s house. 'I wasn’t happy with it, I asked why she was discharging him back to his girlfriend’s, why she isn’t keeping him in or sectioning him.' Liam, a pupil at Carshalton Boys Sports College who suffered from epilepsy, was expecting a child when he died. Liam, a pupil at Carshalton Boys. Sports College, had a history of psychological health issues including. epilepsy and had been assigned a therapist in May 2012. At. an earlier meeting with CAMHS in March, Ms Hardy had told how her son. was self-harming, had been found with red marks around his neck and that. 'he didn’t want to live'. She said she did not want her son to go into care at the time and was told 'there wasn’t any mental health issue there', although he was referred to Multi Systemic Therapy and eventually assigned to a therapist. However, Croydon Coroner’s Court heard how he struggled to interact with the therapist, who he was supposed to meet 'a couple of times a week'. Ms Hardy claimed her son felt he was not being taken seriously. After another altercation at their home in Worcester Park, Surrey, Liam was taken into custody after the police were called. Again, his mother asked for social services to section him after he self-harmed. However, he was allowed to leave the station before they had the chance to see him after being collected by his girlfriend’s father. Liam had been expecting a baby daughter with his girlfriend, who can not be named for legal reasons, who was seven months pregnant at the time of his death. In the stand today, his girlfriend told how she caught him choking himself in the weeks before he died, but he had promised her he wouldn’t do it again.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, comprising three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number-one album. The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the bandmembers' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996. During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album titled Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were \\"polished and reworked\\" until judged releasable. To promote Reload, Metallica performed \\"Fuel\\" and \\"The Memory Remains\\" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs, Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy,... Answer:","output":"Andres Serrano, an American artist known for his provocative artwork, used three distinct bodily fluids in the creation of the album cover art for Metallica's Load and Reload albums. For the Load album, released in 1996, Serrano created a visually striking piece of art titled \\"Blood and Semen III.\\" As the name suggests, the artwork was created using a mixture of Serrano's own semen and blood. The artist pressed this mixture between sheets of plexiglass to create an abstract pattern that was visually captivating and served as the album's cover art. This piece marked a change in Metallica's musical direction and image, corresponding to the band's experimentation with alternative rock elements in their music. When Metallica released the follow-up album, Reload, in 1997, they once again collaborated with Andres Serrano for the cover art. This time, the artwork utilized a mixture of blood and another bodily fluid: urine. Serrano combined blood and urine, creating a similarly abstract piece that complemented the visual of the Load album cover. The choice of these controversial materials aligned with the band's daring approach to their music and the themes explored in the albums. In summary, Andres Serrano used three different bodily fluids in the creation of the cover art for Metallica's Load and Reload albums. For Load, the artist used a mixture of his own blood and semen, while the Reload cover art consisted of a combination of blood and urine. These provocative choices in artistic materials contributed to the overall impression of the band's evolution in musical direction and image during this time in their career."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Who is Sonny's father?

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less adult birds around happens, how will it affect MORE sugar and oxygen being produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you have proposed is that there would be fewer adult birds around, and we want to understand if this perturbation has any effect (either direct or indirect) on photosynthesis, which leads to more sugar and oxygen being produced. To analyze the potential effects, let's consider each aspect involved in the photosynthesis process: 1. Carbon dioxide from the air: The presence or absence of adult birds would not directly affect the amount of carbon dioxide in the air, as carbon dioxide is primarily produced through natural processes and human activities. However, indirectly, birds can play a part in dispersing seeds and pollinating plants, which can lead to more plants growing and thus increase the overall consumption of carbon dioxide. 2. Stomata in leaves and water absorption by roots: The presence of fewer adult birds would not have a direct impact on the stomata or the water absorption by the root systems of plants. The stomata's opening and closing are generally regulated by various environmental factors like light, temperature, and internal signals from the plant itself. 3. Chlorophyll and sunlight absorption: Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight, and the sun's energy is necessary for the process of photosynthesis. The presence or absence of adult birds would not directly affect the sunlight absorption by chlorophyll in plants. However, if we consider the indirect interactions between birds and plants, we can find some potential effects. Many bird species help maintain a balance in ecosystems by controlling the population of insects that could damage plants. With fewer adult birds around, there might be a higher number of insects harming vegetation, which could damage the leaves where photosynthesis occurs. This could lead to reduced sugar and oxygen production. 4. Formation of glucose and release of oxygen: The formation of glucose and the release of oxygen by plants are a direct result of the photosynthesis process. The presence or absence of adult birds would not have a direct impact on these processes. In summary, the presence of fewer adult birds would not directly impact the process of photosynthesis and the production of sugar and oxygen by plants. However, you can observe indirect effects, such as changes in seed dispersal, pollination, and controlling the population of insects that could potentially harm plants. While these factors can influence plant growth and health, they do not necessarily lead to more sugar and oxygen being produced, rather they affect the overall health and distribution of the plant population."},{"instruction":"Premise: either course the service i'm at i don't think gives a education uh after service Hypothesis: It doesn't educate after service.

Our vocabulary becomes richer and our writing style becomes more fluent when we type using just one hand, scientists have found. \\"Typing can be too fluent or too fast, and _ can actually weaken the writing process,\\" said Srdan Medimorec, the lead author of the study conducted at the department of psychology at the University of Waterloo, Canada. \\"It seems that what we write is a product of the interaction between our thoughts and the tools we use to express them.\\" Using text-analysis software, researchers asked 103 university students to write essays under different conditions, using one hand to type and using both hands to type. The software was used to analyze elements of the essays, such as range of vocabulary, sentence complexity and the cohesion of the writing. Researchers found that participants' vocabulary became more advanced when they typed with one hand rather than two. The research team said that by slowing our writing down, typing one-handed allows more time for an internal word search, resulting in a larger variety of words. In contrast, fast typists might just write the first word that comes to mind. However, it is important not to slow typing down too much. Those who typed essays one-handed in the current study slowed down to about the speed of handwriting. This is the first study to show that changing people's typing can make their writing get better. The researchers suggested that the speed of writing could affect writing quality regardless of the tools used, whether they are computers, or pen and paper, although further research would be required to prove that idea.

In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084–1105) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century.

One day the cat got sick and finally dies. As there was no back yard to their home in which to bury the cat. Father was forced to wrap the cat up in a newspaper and take it with him, being carefully reminded by Mother to throw the package from the train window when on the way to his work. Father placed his bag upon the package shelf over his seat, but started to have a conversation with a traveler and forgot to throw the bag out of the window. He took the package on to his office, thinking that he would deal with it on his way home that evening. But again he got to talking to someone on the train, forgot about the cat, and still had the package under his arm when he arrived home. His wife scolded him about it and Father promised to take care of the matter the next day. But once more his memory failed him. When for the third time he arrived home still carrying the package, the poor Mother became quite angry. \\"You've got to deal with that cat right now,\\" she said. \\"Put it in the stove right now as the fireman is seldom there at this hour.\\" Well, Father decided perhaps he'd better take it to the room and put it in the stove, but as he lifted the bag from a table, it fell open, and to their surprise there was a boiled ham!

The fact that the package contained a boiled ham indicates that at some point during Father's trips between home and work, the package with the cat might have gotten switched or replaced with another package, which contained the ham. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that Father had unintentionally put another package on the table, the one containing the boiled ham, instead of the original package with the cat.

It has not had any major work done since 1900 and as a result the slate roof is leaking, parts of the plaster ceiling have collapsed into the upstairs gallery and internal walls are suffering from damp. The HLF grant will also provide money to develop a programme of education and activities to increase visitor numbers to the church.

Situated on the site of a former brewery, the building was constructed in the period 1840-41 and hasn't seen any major restoration work since 1900. This has resulted in a plethora of problems, for instance, a leaking slate roof, collapsing portions of the plaster ceiling into the upstairs gallery and damp internal walls. However, relief has arrived in the form of a lottery grant which is intended to fund a £225,000 restoration project. This fund is issued by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF), whose contribution has been appreciated and labelled as an \\"answer to our prayers\\" by David Brill, the chairman of the church's friends group. In addition to helping repair the deteriorating parts of the church, the grant will also be utilized to foster a programme of education and activities in a bid to attract more visitors to the church. These funds have brought about great joy and relief for the members of the High Street Church, as without it, they would have been forced to buy bowls, buckets, and tarpaulins to catch the rain leaking from the roof, and buckets and spades for children from the Sunday school and kids club to dig out built-up areas around the church.

George Frideric Handel was born on 23 February 1685 in the German city of Halle. It is unclear what initial musical education he received; his father, Georg Händel, was not a music lover, and did not at first appreciate or encourage his son's precocious talents. Nevertheless, by the age of ten Handel had become an accomplished organist; his playing in the royal chapel at Weissenfels, where his half-brother Karl was in the service of the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, impressed the duke, who persuaded Händel senior that the boy should have a proper musical education. As a result, Handel began formal study under Friedrich Zachow, the organist of the Lutheran church at Halle.Handel's biographer Jonathan Keates writes that: \\"From [Zachow] Handel learned not only a great deal about the line and shape of an aria, about strong, adventurous bass lines and solid choral writing, but also about those delicacies of instrumental colouring which he later perfected in his own style\\". Handel's musical development also benefited from an early and lasting friendship with Georg Philipp Telemann, whom he met in 1700. In February 1702 Handel enrolled at the University of Halle, perhaps intending to study law. In March he took up the post of organist at Halle's Calvinist cathedral (Domkirche), a prestigious appointment for one so young and indicative of his burgeoning musical reputation in the city.At some time, possibly in late 1702 or early 1703, Handel visited Berlin, where his father had held an honorary post as physician to the elector who, in 1701, had become the Prussian king Frederick I. In Berlin Handel first experienced Italian opera, and may have met the Italian composers Giovanni Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti, who were writing operas for Frederick's court. The king heard of Handel's abilities, and wanted him to train as a future court composer, but Handel's horizons had been broadened by his sojourn in Berlin and he was developing his own ideas for his future.

Some have argued that this arrangement was \\"fully compatible with Jefferson's views on the separation of church and state;\\" however, others point to Jefferson's support for a scheme in which students at the University would attend religious worship each morning as evidence that his views were not consistent with strict separation. Still other scholars, such as Mark David Hall, attempt to sidestep the whole issue by arguing that American jurisprudence focuses too narrowly on this one Jeffersonian letter while failing to account for other relevant history\\"?","output":"Based on the passage provided, one potential question could be: To what extent do you agree with the different perspectives on Thomas Jefferson's views regarding the separation of church and state in relation to the establishment of the University of Virginia? Support your argument with evidence from the passage. This question prompts students to critically analyze the passage and form an argument based on the different perspectives presented. They would need to discuss the accusations made by Jefferson's opponents, the role of the constitutional ban on State-funded Professorship of Divinity, and the differing interpretations of Jefferson's intentions by various scholars."},{"instruction":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Beach volleyball is one of those sports that can be an exciting game to play and watch. It's really easy, and all you need is sand, a net and a group of people, of any age or fitness level, who want to have fun. Beach volleyball can be played with as few as two people in each team, making a total of four people. However, if you are less skilled and experienced in the game, it will be easier to play with a larger team. The more players you have, the less ground each person will be responsible for covering and the more time they will have to recover between shots. If you only have a few players, each of you will get a lot of running for the ball after each volley . If you are looking for a relaxing, fun, low-key experience, choose larger teams. Beach volleyball is similar to regular volleyball in its rules. However, even experienced volleyball players do not realize how much more difficult it is to run and jump on sand. Since it is harder to move quickly on sand than a hard surface, play will be much slower than regular volleyball on a court. When an athlete trains for beach volleyball, he will focus on building lower body strength as well as upper body strength. Strengthening his legs is extremely important. This improves the player's ability to move quickly and accurately on sand despite the resistance. The ability to jump high and land without injury is necessary for beach volleyball players. Whether you are in it for the competition, or just to have a great time with your friends, beach volleyball can be extremely exciting and fun. You may start out with friends and may soon fall in love with the sport. Answer:","output":"What is a key difference between beach volleyball and regular volleyball? A. The rules of the game B. The number of players needed C. The difficulty of movement on the playing surface D. The importance of jumping high Explanation: According to the article, beach volleyball differs from regular volleyball due to the difficulty of movement on sand, making it harder to run and jump compared to a hard surface. This is the key difference between the two, so the correct answer is C. The difficulty of movement on the playing surface."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"The boy in the swimming trunks is playing in the yard.\\" can we conclude that \\"The boy is jumping through the sprinkler.\\"?

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the perturbation will have an effect on the process. Let's break it down step by step to understand the effects: 1. When water freezes, it becomes 10% bigger or takes up 10% more space. This means that as water pools in smaller cracks and freezes more readily, the volume of ice formed in those cracks increases, leading to the expansion of ice in the cracks. 2. As water expands in the form of ice, it puts great pressure on the walls of anything containing it, including any rocks surrounding it. When this process occurs more often due to water freezing more readily in smaller cracks, the force exerted on the surrounding rocks increases, which can cause more significant damage to the rocks over time. 3. The force of the pressure exerted on the rock surrounding it is enough to wedge the walls of the crack farther apart, thus expanding and deepening the crack. In this perturbation scenario, the force is applied more often, making it more likely for the cracks to widen and deepen, leading to further division and fragmentation of the rocks. 4. This causes the rock to break apart. As the cracks widen and deepen more frequently due to the perturbation, the overall rate of rock breakdown increases. This could lead to the formation of more significant gaps and divisions in the rock structure, possibly even creating new spaces for water to gather, freeze and further expand. 5. Some plants, like mosses and lichens, can grow without soil on bare rock. These organisms can take advantage of the widened and deepened cracks caused by the perturbation, allowing them to grow more easily and in greater numbers. 6. When these plants grow, their roots penetrate pores and crevices, causing rocks to split apart as the roots force their way down through the rocks. The increased amount of cracks in the rock due to the perturbation provides more opportunities for plant roots to penetrate and grow, further contributing to the breakdown of rock structures. In conclusion, the perturbation of water pooling in smaller cracks and freezing more readily can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of rock breakdown. The increased frequency of ice formation and the expansion of ice in cracks can lead to greater pressure and damage to the surrounding rocks, allowing plant roots to better penetrate and break apart the rock structures."},{"instruction":"Teacher: In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a \\"time slice\\" until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss.\\" Answer: A:","output":"The programs work together through a process known as multitasking, which allows multiple programs to share a computer's resources and run simultaneously without causing significant speed loss. This is achieved by the operating system managing the allocation of time slices and prioritizing tasks based on their current state and requirements. Step 1: Identify the programs running on the system The operating system keeps track of all the active programs and their current states in order to manage their execution efficiently. Step 2: Assign priorities to the programs Each program is assigned a priority level based on its current state (e.g., whether it is waiting for user input or actively executing tasks). Programs that require more immediate attention, such as those waiting for input/output devices, are given higher priority. Step 3: Allocate time slices to the programs The operating system divides the available processor time into small units called time slices. Each program is allocated a certain number of time slices based on its priority. Step 4: Switch between programs based on their priorities and states The operating system continuously loops through the active programs, allocating time slices to each program in accordance with its priority. If a program is waiting for an input/output event, it will not receive a time slice until that event occurs. This allows other programs to use the available resources in the meantime, ensuring smooth multitasking. Step 5: Update program states and priorities as needed As programs complete tasks, wait for user input, or execute background processes, their states and priorities will change. The operating system continuously monitors these changes and adjusts the allocation of time slices accordingly to ensure efficient multitasking. In conclusion, programs work together in a multitasking environment through a combination of priority assignment, time slice allocation, and continuous monitoring by the operating system. This process minimizes potential speed loss and allows multiple programs to run simultaneously without negatively impacting the system's overall performance."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you are given an article.

Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer. Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream... I am facing a new situation today: Ben visited two states. Washington state, which had many wildfires year-round, and Oregon, state which had almost no wildfires.

From the moment my partner and I stepped through the beautifully adorned doors, we were transported into a world of tantalizing aromas, mesmerizing decor, and unparalleled hospitality. As soon as we entered the establishment, we were greeted with warm smiles from the hostess, Alyssa, who guided us to our perfectly situated table by the cozy fireplace. The low lighting and flickering candlelight created an intimate and romantic atmosphere that only enhanced our enchanting evening further. Now, let me dive into the pièce de résistance - the food. Oh, the extraordinary dishes that The Enchanted Bistro had in store for us! The menu was diverse and exciting, featuring a delightful fusion of traditional and modern cuisine. We were spoilt for choice, but our knowledgeable and friendly server, Michael, was more than happy to offer suggestions that catered to our taste buds and dietary preferences. For starters, we had the savory mushroom cappuccino soup and the zesty citrus-marinated salmon ceviche. Both dishes were visually stunning and teased our taste buds with their symphony of flavors. The soup had a velvety, creamy texture, which was beautifully contrasted by the earthy and aromatic wild mushrooms, while the ceviche was bursting with vibrant, fresh, and zesty flavors that danced on our palates. Following the appetizers, we enjoyed the most flavorful main courses. I opted for the succulent seared Atlantic scallops with truffle risotto and a micro-greens salad, and my partner chose the tender rosemary-infused rack of lamb with a delightful medley of roasted vegetables. Both dishes were cooked to perfection, with the scallops being buttery soft and the lamb tender and juicy. The attention to detail and artistry in presentation was evident in each dish, and the taste left us speechless. Finally, the dessert was an absolute masterpiece. We shared a scrumptious dark chocolate soufflé topped with a salted caramel drizzle, and a velvety raspberry coulis. This heavenly creation melted in our mouths, enveloping them in sweet notes of pure dark chocolate, which was perfectly balanced by the tangy, fruity flavors of the raspberry coulis. The service throughout the evening was impeccable, with attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely friendly staff who ensured that our dining experience was nothing short of perfect. Michael, our server, checked in on us frequently, making sure our water glasses were always full, advising us on excellent wine pairings, and attending to any questions or dietary concerns we had. The Enchanted Bistro truly lives up to its name, as it provided a magical, unforgettable experience that left us raving about it to our friends and family. If you are in search of exquisite cuisine, an exceptional dining experience, and an enchanting ambiance, look no further! I wholeheartedly recommend The Enchanted Bistro and cannot wait to return for another dazzling culinary adventure."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer: If \\"Two people are hiking on a trail next to a large wall.\\", does it logically follow that \\"Two people hike on a nature trail next to a large wall during a sunny day.\\"?

The answer is:","output":"To answer this question, I will first need to identify the British patriotic hymn in question that was created in 1921 and had a unison song with an orchestra. I will do so by: 1. Identifying the specific time period given (1921). 2. Researching British patriotic hymns created during that time period. 3. Filtering through the hymns to find one that was a collaboration between unison singing and orchestra. Step 1: The time period given is 1921, which narrows down the search considerably. Step 2: In my research, I've discovered that a relevant hymn created in this time period is \\"Jerusalem\\" by Sir Hubert Parry, which was orchestrated in 1921 based on the poem 'And did those feet in ancient time' by William Blake. This hymn is closely associated with British patriotism. Step 3: Further research suggests that \\"Jerusalem\\" was indeed written as a unison song with orchestral accompaniment. The piece starts with a unison vocal line and is supported by an orchestra throughout the hymn. Considering the steps taken and the information gathered, the answer to the question is: The British patriotic hymn created in 1921 as a unison song with an orchestra is \\"Jerusalem\\" by Sir Hubert Parry."},{"instruction":"next question: When remembering you referencing things that you have what?

Turkey's Ahmet Davutoglu said the pair discussed \\"concrete steps\\" for Damascus to halt the killing of civilians. Mr Assad said he would not relent in pursuing \\"terrorist groups\\". As they met, rights activists said at least 28 more people had been killed, including nine in and around Hama. More than 1,700 civilians are believed to have been killed and tens of thousands arrested since the uprising began in mid-March. 'Open and clear' Mr Davutoglu, who has helped improve ties between Ankara and Damascus, had been told by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to pass on a \\"tough\\" message, demanding an end to the military operations against civilian demonstrators. Analysis This visit was probably Turkey's last chance to revive a relationship, which has been the foundation of its ambitious new foreign policy. Mr Davutoglu clearly had a lot to say. The talks lasted for three-and-a-half hours and the exchanges were probably pretty blunt. Mr Davutoglu described the methods used by the Syrian security forces as unacceptable, and said he outlined actions Syria must take to stop the bloodshed - the developments of the coming days will be critical, he said. But there is no indication that Mr Assad will act on Turkey's pleas. The warm, personal ties between him and the Turkish PM are now in the past. Other aspects of the relationship, like trade and tourism, which have flourished in recent years, are at risk. Tellingly, Turkey has co-ordinated closely with the US over its response to Syria; it may now be willing to back tougher action at the UN Security Council. Iran, another neighbour wooed by Turkey in recent years, is still backing President Assad. Mr Davutoglu used to describe his new foreign policy as one based on zero problems with Turkey's neighbours. He does not use that term any more. Over the weekend, Mr Erdogan said not only that he had \\"run out of patience\\", but also that from Turkey's point of view the Syrian crisis was almost an internal problem - their shared border is more than 800km (500 miles) long, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Istanbul. Many Turks sympathise with anti-government protesters in Syria and there is burning anger at what is happening, our correspondent says. Speaking to reporters on his return to Ankara, Mr Davutoglu described the methods used by the Syrian security forces as \\"unacceptable\\" and outlined actions that Syria had to take to stop the bloodshed. \\"We discussed ways to prevent confrontation between the army and the people, and tensions like those in Hama, in the most open and clear way,\\" he said. \\"The coming days will be important to see if the expectations are being met. We hope that internal peace and calm is achieved and steps for reform are taken.\\" The Turkish government would be monitoring events in Syria, and maintaining contacts with all parts of society, he added. Mr Davutoglu stressed that he hoped for a peaceful transition in Syria that would result in its people determining their own future. The official Syrian account of their talks quoted Mr Assad as saying security forces would \\"not relent in pursuing terrorist groups\\" to ensure the stability of the nation and the safety of its citizens. The president also insisted he was serious about a proposed reform programme. The Syrians quoted Mr Davutoglu as saying he was not carrying a message from anyone, and that Syria would be an example to the whole region once Mr Assad's reforms were enacted. Image caption The army has been deployed to crush dissent in the restive cities of Hama, Homs and Deir al-Zour Since Saturday, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Kuwait have recalled their ambassadors and demanded an immediate end to the use of military force against civilians. The Arab League and Gulf Co-operation Council have also issued statements condemning the crackdown and calling for serious dialogue. Egypt's Foreign Minister Mohammed Amr on Tuesday expressed concern that the situation in Syria was \\"heading to the point of no return\\". \\"Reforms that are soaked in the blood of the martyrs who are dying daily are of no use,\\" state media quoted him as saying. Envoys from India, Brazil and South Africa are also due in Damascus this week to appeal for an end to the killing of protesters. Ramadan protests Efforts to persuade Syria's government to halt the crackdown have had little effect in the past week, during which more than 300 civilians are believed to have been killed, including at least 14 on Monday. Despite concerted and ruthless efforts, the regime has not been able to stamp out the flames of defiance Deadlock in Syria as pressure builds On Tuesday, at least seven people were killed when troops backed by tanks and armoured vehicles overran towns and villages outside the restive central city of Hama, including Soran, Halfaya and Taybat al-Imam, where snipers have been deployed on roofs. Two sisters aged six and 11 were reportedly among the five dead brought to a hospital in Taybat al-Imam, while the Syrian National Organisation for Human Rights told Reuters news agency that at least 26 people had died. Two people were also killed in the centre of Hama, activists said. At least three others were killed in the town of Binnish, in Idlib governorate, about 30km (19 miles) from the border with Turkey, in a similar attack. Asked why Binnish was stormed, a resident who had fled told Reuters: \\"The whole town has been joining in night rallies after Ramadan prayers.\\" The army also continued its operation to crush dissent in the eastern city of Deir al-Zour, where more than 60 civilians are said to have been killed since Sunday. The Local Co-ordination Committees, an activist group that organises and documents the protests, said that more than 200 tanks had been deployed in the centre, and that security forces were carrying out raids and detaining residents. Deaths were also reported in Homs and the Damascus suburb of Irbin. Access to Syria has been severely restricted for international journalists, and it is rarely possible to verify accounts by witnesses and activists. Also on Tuesday, former Syrian Defence Minister Gen Ali Habib, who was removed from his post on Monday, denied reports that he was sacked because he was unhappy with the crackdown. \\"I affirm that they are fabricated stories that run counter to reality and aim at harming Syria and its national army,\\" he said on state TV. ||||| Reports of seven deaths in Hama and Idlib province as the Turkish foreign minister meets President Assad in Damascus. Syria's army is continuing operations in several locations, as the country's leadership is facing increasing pressure to end its bloody crackdown on anti-government protesters. At least five civilians were killed during raids on villages around the besieged city of Hama on Tuesday, local activists said. The Syrian Revolution Co-ordinating Union said five bodies had been taken to the Jwash hospital in the town of Tibet al-Imam north of Hama, including two girls from the same family, six-year old Afra Mahmoud al-Kannas and 11-year old Sana Ahmad al-Kannas. Earlier, a a rights group said two civilians were killed and several more wounded in the northwestern Idlib province bordering Turkey. \\"Operations this morning in Idlib resulted in two deaths and several wounded by security forces' gunfire,\\" the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in a statement. \\"Around a dozen tanks and other armoured vehicles attacked the Binnish and Sirmeen areas\\" of Idlib. Asked why Binnish was stormed, a resident who had fled the town told Reuters: \\"The whole town has been joining in night rallies after Ramadan prayers.\\" The Local Co-ordination Committees said the town of Sirmeen was attacked from three sides, with troops carrying out house raids and arbitrary arrests. Tanks were also deployed in and around the city of Idlib, following big demonstrations there, the activists said. Turkey envoy On the diplomatic front, Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, arrived in Damascus to press the Syrian leadership into ending the violent crackdown on demonstrations. He met President Bashar al-Assad and Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem, days after Turkey, a former close ally and business partner, condemned the violence. Meanwhile, footage was posted online, purportedly showing troops assaulting the town of Albu Kamal, near the Iraqi border, on Monday. The video showed soldiers firing tanks, using rocket launchers and Kalashnikovs against an unseen enemy. Opposition sources said up to seven people had been shot dead by security forces on Monday at a funeral in the southern city of Deraa, the cradle of the five-month uprising against Assad's rule. The funeral was for a youth who had been arrested earlier this week when he took part in a protest. His body was handed to relatives on Monday with visible signs of torture, according to relatives. Abdul Rahman said one of the dead was Maen Yousef Awadat, a leading political campaigner, who had recently been released from prison. In the east of the country, the army maintained its siege of the city of Deir ez-Zor, reportedly shelling at least one neighbourhood. \\"Armoured vehicles are shelling the al-Hawiqa district heavily with their guns. Private hospitals are closed and people are afraid to send the wounded to state facilities because they are infested with secret police,\\" Mohammad, a resident who did not want to give his full name, told Reuters news agency. He said at least 65 people had been killed since tanks and armoured vehicles entered the provincial capital on Sunday. Al Jazeera could not independently verify the reports since most foreign journalists have been barred from entering Syria. The Syrian Observatory says more than 2,050 people, including almost 400 members of the security forces, have been killed since the uprising began. Diplomatic action Assad's government disputes the toll and blames a foreign conspiracy for the unrest. But those claims have been dismissed by most of the international community, with world leaders ramping up its condemnation of the security forces' actions in recent days. India's UN ambassador Hardeep Singh Puri told reporters the three countries would be \\"calling for restraint, abjuring violence, [and] promoting reform, taking into account the democratic aspirations of the people.'' ? Lebanese and Syrians living in Beirut rallied in solidarity with the Syrian people on Monday Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain on Monday recalled their ambassadors from Damascus amid mounting pressure from the Arab world. Qatar withdrew its ambassador from Damascus and closed its embassy in July after Assad loyalists attacked the embassy compound amid protests against Doha-based Al Jazeera's coverage of the uprising. Besides Turkey, India, Brazil and South Africa were also sending envoys to Syria to appeal for an end to the violent crackdown. Officials said country's representatives were to meet \\"high-level'' Syrians on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Assad replaced his defence minister, Ali Habib, on Monday with illness cited as the official reason. State television reported that the Christian chief of staff, General Daoud Rajha, was to take up the post. The position of defence minister is a mostly ceremonial post in Syria. The professional core of the military consists of officers from the minority Alawite sect, the Shia offshoot which Assad belongs to, while most of the conscripts are Sunni. The military is effectively under the command of Assad's feared brother Maher. Assad's brother-in-law, Assef Shawkat, is deputy chief or staff and diplomats say he plays a key role in the control over the army. The European Union imposed sanctions on Habib earlier this month as part of measures against Syria's ruling hierarchy for their bloody crackdown on demonstrations. ||||| Syria defied Arab isolation and mounting international anger on Monday as President Bashar al-Assad's security forces continued attacks on pro-democracy protesters across the country. The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, urged al-Assad to return his troops to barracks and release all prisoners, one of the bluntest demands yet made of the Syrian leader, after regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia led a rare chorus of Arab states in condemning the repression. Reports from Deir al-Zor described artillery and heavy machinegun fire and snipers on roofs as troops and intelligence agents carried out mass arrests in the north-eastern city. On Sunday, 42 people were killed there, nudging the death total during five months of the uprising to more than 2,000. In Hama, security forces were reported to have deployed an anti-aircraft gun to fire on civilians, diplomats said. Videos from around the country purported to show gunfire, shelling and corpses from violence over the weekend. Three people were reported to have been shot during a funeral in Deraa. In a political development, al-Assad announced the replacement of his defence minister, Ali Habib, a member of the minority Alawite community, by the army chief of staff, Daoud Rajha, who is a Christian. Analysts said the move seemed intended to emphasise the regime's claim to be defending all Syrian citizens against a sectarian conflict it says is being fomented by Islamic extremists. State TV described Habib as being in poor health and said the decision to replace him had been taken after consultations by the president. Syrian media scorned moves by Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies to protest against the violence by withdrawing their ambassadors from Damascus. The Sana news agency quoted an unnamed official as expressing \\"regret\\" that Arab states had \\"completely ignored facts on the killing and sabotage committed by armed terrorist groups\\". Kuwait and Bahrain followed the Saudis in recalling their envoys for consultations. On Sunday, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia condemned the crackdown in a speech that was billed as historic but was largely prompted, western diplomats said, by US pressure. Britain has also been lobbying the Saudis and other Arab states, which rarely criticise each other in public, to get tough with Syria. Qatar, which pursues more independent policies, recalled its ambassdor from Damsacus last month. On Sunday the Arab League, which represents all Arab states, had spoken out for the first time and called on the Syrian authorities to stop acts of violence against civilians. Speaking on state TV, commentator Samir Shehadi warned that Syria would in future support Shia protestors in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in retaliation for their stand. Neighbouring Jordan also expressed concern for the first time. British diplomats said they were alarmed by the arrest of a leading dissident, Walid al-Bunni, and his sons, who had been due to take part in an opposition conference. A leading human rights lawyer was also reportedly detained. Communications were patchy and details incomplete, but the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights quoted residents in Deir al-Zor as saying that security forces had shot dead a mother and her two children who were fleeing the assault. \\"The army opened up with heavy machine guns on al-Joura district. Security forces then launched a search sweep, terrorising residents,\\" an activist in the city told AFP. People were said to be too terrified to take the wounded to government hospitals, instead treating them at home or in makeshift hospitals. Troops also entered Maarat an-Numan in the northern province of Idlib at dawn on Monday, opposition activists said. Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, is due to meet Assad in Damascus on Tuesday and will be carrying Clinton's message to Assad to release all detained protesters, establish a new government and send his army back to barracks, Turkish media reported. Bouthaina Shaaban, Assad's media adviser, said Davutoglu would hear a protest that his country had failed to \\"condemn the brutal killing and crimes committed by the armed terrorist groups\\". William Hague, the foreign secretary, condemned the latest violence against Syrians. \\"This brutality exposes the regime's claims to be committed to a reform process as an utter sham,\\" he said in a statement. On Sunday night reporters were taken on a tour of the government-run hospital in Hama, where more than 150 fatalities have been reported in recent days, and shown the remains of 16 people, some decomposing. Dr Mohammed al-Omar said most of the bodies were members of the security forces who were killed by armed groups. Condemnation of the Syrian government spread to the internet, where the hacking group known as Anonymous claimed credit for vandalising the Syrian military's website. The site quickly became unavailable, but screenshots circulated online showed the group's trademark headless suit and a message addressed to the Syrian people saying that \\"the world stands with you against the brutal regime.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"There have been problems happening in Syria. People are not happy with their leader, President Bashar al-Assad, so they are protesting. But the government is using force to stop them, which has led to many people getting hurt or dying.

Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, talked to Assad about stopping the violence on people in Syria.

The king of Shilla, Kim Choon-Chu established diplomatic and military ties with the super-power Tang, or as we know it today, China. He ordered his general Kim Yu-Sin to meet with the general of Tang. Tang, the superpower, had the upper hand in the meetings and ordered Kim Yu-Sin to tell his king that the Kingdom of Shilla would have to pay a tribute to Tang no later than July 10th in order to shore up their newfound diplomatic relations. But geographically, in order to bring the tribute to Tang, Shilla had to cross the firmly defended kingdoms of Baekche and Koguryo. Fearing a new alliance between Tang and Shilla, Baekche and Koguryo disallowed Shilla to cross through their kingdoms. This act of defiance was a self-fulfilling prophecy as it angered Tang who sided with Shilla in a war. They decided to attack the weaker, more corrupt of the two other kingdoms, Baekche.As Tang's ships began arriving at the western coast of the Baekche kingdom, Baekche's king and his cabinet grew anxious, worrying that Tang's marines would stage a joint attack on their kingdom with Shilla. The king sent word to his lords to prepare their troops, but the call to arms was blocked by powerful lords who were hostile toward the king. As it turns out their deepest concerns were confirmed; they were being boxed in by Tang and Shilla and had little military support with which to defend the kingdom. The only person who remained loyal to the king of Baekche was Kye-Baek. He was summoned to the palace, where the king served him three glasses of wine, a symbolic gesture asking him to defend the kingdom. Kye-Baek agrees.

He had two older brothers, William and Isidor. He spent part of his youth in Mount Vernon, New York. Context: Returning to the United States, Chayefsky worked in his uncle's print shop, Regal Press, an experience which provided a background for his later teleplay, Printer's Measure (1953), as well as his story for the movie As Young as You Feel (1951). Kanin enabled Chayefsky to spend time working on his second play, Put Them All Together (later known as M is for Mother), but it was never produced. Producers Mike Gordon and Jerry Bressler gave him a junior writer's contract. He wrote a story, The Great American Hoax, which sold to Good Housekeeping but was never published. He relocated to Hollywood, where he met his future wife Susan Sackler, and the couple married in February 1949. Failing to find work on the West Coast, Chayefsky returned to New York. During the late 1940s, he began working full-time on short stories and radio scripts, and during that period, he was a gagwriter for radio host Robert Q. Lewis. Chayefsky later recalled, \\"I sold some plays to men who had an uncanny ability not to raise money.\\" During 1951-52, Chayefsky wrote adaptations for radio's Theater Guild on the Air: The Meanest Man in the World (with James Stewart), Cavalcade of America, Tommy (with Van Heflin and Ruth Gordon) and Over 21 (with Wally Cox). His play The Man Who Made the Mountain Shake was noticed by Elia Kazan, and his wife, Molly Kazan, helped Chayefsky with revisions. It was retitled Fifth From Garibaldi but was never produced. In 1951, the movie As Young as You Feel was adapted from a Chayefsky story. Question: What did eh do here?.

In 1970, Lennon and Ono went through primal therapy with Arthur Janov in Los Angeles, California. Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for four months; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer, but they felt no need to continue and returned to London. Lennon's debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), was received with praise by many music critics, but its highly personal lyrics and stark sound limited its commercial performance. Critic Greil Marcus remarked, \\"John's singing in the last verse of 'God' may be the finest in all of rock.\\" The album featured the song \\"Mother\\", in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque \\"Working Class Hero\\", a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric \\"you're still fucking peasants\\", fell foul of broadcasters. In January 1971, Tariq Ali expressed his revolutionary political views when he interviewed Lennon, who immediately responded by writing \\"Power to the People\\". In his lyrics to the song, Lennon reversed the non-confrontational approach he had espoused in \\"Revolution\\", although he later disowned the message, saying that it was borne out of guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Ali. Lennon became involved with Ali in a protest against the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity. Lennon denounced the proceedings as \\"disgusting fascism\\", and he and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single \\"God Save Us/Do the Oz\\" and joined marches in support of the magazine. Eager for a major commercial success, Lennon adopted a more accessible sound for his next album, Imagine (1971). Rolling Stone reported that \\"it contains a substantial portion of good music\\" but warned of the possibility that \\"his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant\\". The album's title track later became an anthem for anti-war movements, while the song \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" was a musical attack on McCartney in response... Answer:","output":"The full name of the person that John Lennon became involved with in a protest against the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity was Tariq Ali. Ali was a political figure who expressed revolutionary political views, which aroused Lennon's interest. They both took part in a protest against what Lennon called the \\"disgusting fascism\\" of the prosecution of Oz magazine. Their involvement went as far as promoting their shared viewpoint through music, where Lennon and his partner, Yoko Ono, released a single under the band name Elastic Oz Band with the songs \\"God Save Us/Do the Oz.\\" Additionally, they participated in marches to support the magazine. It's worth noting that Ali's political stance deeply influenced Lennon, prompting him to write the song \\"Power to the People\\". The song marked a shift in Lennon's political approach; he transited from non- confrontational, as seen in \\"Revolution\\" to radical, an influence that seemingly came from Ali. However, Lennon later disowned the radical message in \\"Power to the People,\\" attributing it to guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Ali."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task you will be given a list of integers.

Which person observed autumn cooling? Two climate experts studied different continent to observe climate changes. Jordan studied Australia, while Jeb studied Antarctica. Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

(September 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) One evening, whilst Mortimer \\"Mo\\" Folchart (Brendan Fraser) and his wife Teresa \\"Resa\\" Folchart (Sienna Guillory) are reading the fairy tale \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" to their baby daughter Meggie, a red velvet hood appears out of nowhere. Several years later, a much older Meggie (Eliza Bennett) travels with her father Mo to visit an old book shop in Italy, unaware that he is secretly looking for a copy of the book, Inkheart. Shortly after finding one, Meggie comes across a marten with horns outside the shop, who tries to bite her fingers. Suddenly, a man (Paul Bettany) appears from the shadows, claiming to be an old friend while revealing the marten's name as Gwin. When Mo comes out of the book shop, he quickly recognizes the man as a person called Dustfinger, whom quickly asks to be read back into the book, only for Mo to flee with Meggie from him. Travelling across Italy, Mo takes Meggie on a visit to Meggie's great aunt Elinor (Helen Mirren), whereupon he reveals to Meggie why he fled from Dustfinger. While she was young, Mo read to her from Inkheart, inadvertently freeing Dustfinger as a result, due to a gift he possessed from birth, that marks him as a \\"Silver Tongue\\". Unfortunately, his gift also freed the book's villain Capricorn (Andy Serkis) and several of his henchman, but at the same time, losing Resa after being forced to flee with his infant daughter. Soon, Dustfinger reappears seeking Mo, accompanied by Capricorn's minion, Basta (Jamie Foreman), who quickly captures Mo and his family and takes back Inkheart, destroying Elinor's valuable library in the process.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process for a muscle to contract or relax occurs when a signal, or action potential, is sent from the nervous system to the muscle fibers. This signal is generated by the brain or spinal cord and travels through neurons, which make up the nerves. Once the signal reaches the neuromuscular junction—the connection point between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber—it stimulates the release of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. Acetylcholine binds to receptors on the muscle fiber membrane (known as the sarcolemma), triggering a change in the membrane's electrical charges. This process initiates an action potential on the sarcolemma, which then travels along the muscle fiber and reaches the sarcoplasmic reticulum, where calcium ions are stored. The release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum initiates the interaction between actin and myosin protein filaments necessary for muscle contraction or relaxation. In summary, the crucial first step in the process of muscle contraction or relaxation is the generation and transmission of a signal, or action potential, from the nervous system to the muscle fibers."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer.

I look in the magazines and all I see are girls with fair hair, blue eyes, and, of course, a pretty little nose. They're on the outside of the buses that I take home, the television programs I watch, and the billboards I walk under. Almost every advertisement I see shows this human physical \\"perfection\\". These billboards not only tell me what to drink, but also how to look. Our society place more importance on a person's physical beauty, rather than their ability, honesty and character. We have influenced women to go through painful surgeries and starve themselves to become this society built physical model. To be a beautiful woman in the 21st century doesn't mean that you are a brilliant doctor or caring mother. It means you have the perfect jaw, eyes and lips. It means that you can be six feet tall and weigh one hundred and ten pounds. But what about the women who are starting to leave their youth? Instead of looking at aging as a sign of wisdom, we try to prevent the aging process . It's a kind of funny thing to want to look eighteen when fifty. Fifty is a relaxed age, when you can step back and look at all you've achieved (successfully complete something). It is when your hard work pays off. Unfortunately, our society just sees you as \\"old\\". To stop the aging process, women buy wrinkle creams, do eye lifts and face lifts. They spend thousands of dollars to win the hopeless battle against age. I remember when I was about thirteen years old and going through teens, I had oily hair, and a half developed body. I hated the way I looked. I used to cry to my mother all the time, but she would just laugh and tell me that \\"you don't want anyone to like your appearance. It's your heart that is important, because beauty fades. \\" I knew that she was right.

How to display succulents Construct a succulent wall planter. Creating a wall planter can spruce up any room without taking up much space. It can also provide an interesting conversation piece when you have guests.","output":"Step 1: Gather materials To create a succulent wall planter, you first need to gather the necessary materials. These may include: - A wooden frame or shadow box (preferably with a back panel) - Succulent potting mix - Sphagnum moss - Succulent plants (select a variety of shapes and sizes) - Hardware cloth or wire mesh - Staple gun and staples - Wood screws and screwdriver - Work gloves - Hanging hardware Step 2: Prepare the frame Clean and sand the wooden frame or shadow box, if necessary. Make sure it is free of any debris or rough edges. Consider painting or staining the frame to match the aesthetic of your room. Step 3: Attach the wire mesh Cut a piece of hardware cloth or wire mesh that is slightly larger than the opening of your frame or shadow box. Staple the mesh securely to the inside edges of the frame using a staple gun. Be sure to wear work gloves to protect your hands from any sharp edges. Step 4: Fill the frame with succulent potting mix Place the frame on a flat surface with the mesh facing upwards. Fill the frame with succulent potting mix, making sure to press the mix firmly into place. The potting mix should be level with the top edge of the frame. Step 5: Plant the succulents Choose your succulent plants and arrange them on top of the potting mix. Carefully poke holes in the mesh using a pencil or similar tool. Insert the succulent roots through the holes and into the potting mix, making sure the plants are secure. Step 6: Add sphagnum moss Gently poke pieces of sphagnum moss between the succulents and into any gaps in the potting mix. This will help to hold the potting mix in place and provide extra moisture for your succulent plants. Step 7: Attach the back panel If your frame or shadow box has a back panel, attach it using wood screws. This will help to hold everything in place and make it easier to hang your succulent wall planter. Step 8: Install hanging hardware Install the appropriate hanging hardware on the back of your succulent wall planter. This may vary depending on the size and weight of your planter, as well as the wall surface you plan to hang it on. Step 9: Hang the planter Hang your succulent wall planter in a location that receives plenty of bright, indirect sunlight. Be sure to periodically check your planter to ensure it stays moist enough to support the succulent plants. Step 10: Maintenance Take care of your succulent wall planter by watering your plants as needed, allowing for proper drainage, and pruning any dead leaves or overgrowth.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated / Source: NBC News By Alexandra Jaffe Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said Sunday that there is a “very severe problem” with some Muslims, and declined to say whether he’d support a Muslim president of the United States. In an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Trump said that he feels “strongly that Muslims are excellent. I know so many Muslims that are such fabulous people. But he continued,“We can be politically correct and say there is no problem whatsoever, but the fact is, there is a problem with some and it’s a very severe problem and it’s a problem that’s taking place all over the world.” Asked by host Chuck Todd whether he’d support a Muslim president, Trump dodged. “Would I be comfortable? I don’t know if we have to address it right now. Some people have said it already happened,” he said. The comments are sure to further inflame controversy sparked by Trump last week when he declined to correct a questioner at a New Hampshire town hall who denounced Muslims as a \\"problem\\" in the U.S. and asserted both the President follows the religion and wasn't born in the U.S. The questioner asked, \\"When can we get rid of [Muslims]?\\" and Trump replied, \\"We are going to be looking at that and plenty of other things.\\" After the event his staff issued three different statements clarifying his response. On Sunday, Trump acknowledged that President Obama has said he’s a Christian, and added “I’m willing to take him at his word on that. I have no problem with that.”But Trump was less willing to budge on his skepticism of President Obama’s citizenship. Trump has questioned whether the president was born in the U.S. for years, holding an infamous 2011 press conference calling for the president to release his long-form birth certificate to prove his citizenship. The real-estate mogul has repeatedly declined to disavow the “birtherism” conspiracy, and again refused to do so on Sunday. “I just don’t want to discuss it,” he said, rattling a list of other issues he’d rather talk about: Jobs, the military, veterans. “The other’s a long, complex subject and I just don’t like talking about it,” Trump added, referring to President Obama’s citizenship. ||||| AP Photo Ben Carson: America's president can't be Muslim \\"I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation,\\" he says. The president of the United States should not be a Muslim, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson declared during an interview airing Sunday morning. And Islam, a faith professed by some 3 million Americans, is not constitutional, the retired neurosurgeon said. At the end of his \\"Meet the Press\\" segment with NBC News' Chuck Todd, Carson responded to a series of questions related to Donald Trump's failure to correct an audience member at a New Hampshire town hall last Thursday who suggested in his question that President Barack Obama is a Muslim and not an American. Story Continued Below Asked whether his faith or the faith of a president should matter, Carson said, \\"It depends on what that faith is.\\" \\"If it's inconsistent with the values and principles of America, then of course it should matter. But if it fits within the realm of America and consistent with the constitution, no problem,\\" he explained, according to a transcript. Todd then asked Carson, whose rise in the polls has been powered in large part by Christian conservatives, if he believed that \\"Islam is consistent with the Constitution.\\" \\"No, I don't, I do not,\\" he responded, adding, \\"I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation. I absolutely would not agree with that.\\" But for Carson, the matter of voting for a Muslim for Congress \\"is a different story, but it depends on who that Muslim is and what their policies are, just as it depends on what anybody else says, you know.\\" \\"And, you know, if there's somebody who's of any faith, but they say things, and their life has been consistent with things that will elevate this nation and make it possible for everybody to succeed, and bring peace and harmony, then I'm with them,\\" he went on to say. Obama is both a Christian and born in the United States, Carson said, adding that he had \\"no reason to doubt\\" the president. Todd's question referred to long-running \\"birther\\" conspiracy theories in which some claim the president was born in Kenya and is thus not a natural-born citizen. Other versions claim that Obama lost his U.S. citizenship when he lived in Indonesia as a child and may be an Indonesian citizen instead. At Thursday's town hall in New Hampshire, an audience member stood up and asked Trump: \\"We have a problem in this country, it’s called Muslims. Our current president is one. We know he’s not even an American. We have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That’s my question, when can we get rid of them?” “A lot of people are saying that and a lot of people are saying that bad things are happening out there. We’re going to be looking at that and a lot of different things,” Trump responded. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton quickly condemned Trump's actions, while most other 2016 contenders remained silent. On Saturday morning, in a series of tweets, Trump defended himself, writing: “Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? I don't think so!” He added, \\"If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president, do you really think he would come to my rescue? No chance!\\" But it was Trump himself who, in in 2011, led a push for Obama to release his long-form birth certificate. \\"People have birth certificates. He doesn't have a birth certificate. He may have one but there's something on that, maybe religion, maybe it says he is a Muslim. Maybe he doesn't want that. Or he may not have one. But I will tell you this. If he wasn't born in this country it's one of the great scams of all time,\\" Trump told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly in March 2011. At the time, Trump told NBC that he had sent investigators in Hawaii, where Obama was born, and that they \\"cannot believe what they're finding.\\" Weeks later, Obama released his long-form birth certificate, showing that he was born Aug. 4, 1961, at Kapiolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu. More recently, 29 percent of Americans described Obama's religion as Muslim, Islam or Islamist in a CNN/ORC poll conducted in early September. Among Republicans, that share rises to 43 percent, and among self-identified conservatives, it rises to 45 percent. Among those identifying as tea party supporters, 47 percent said they thought Obama is a Muslim. The same poll also asked respondents to identify Obama's birthplace, with 59 percent overall saying that he was born in Honolulu or Hawaii, and an additional 16 percent who said that the president was born in the U.S., but not in Hawaii. Thirteen percent said that as far as they knew, Obama was born somewhere other than the U.S., whether somewhere in Africa or in Asia. Majorities of all subgroups surveyed said that Obama was born in Hawaii. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said on NBC's \\"Meet the Press\\" that there is a \\"very severe problem\\" with some Muslims and declined to say whether he would support a Muslim president of the United States.

The line from a drama of Terence, Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto (or with nil for nihil), meaning \\"I am a human being, I think nothing human alien to me\\", known since antiquity through the endorsement of Saint Augustine, gained renewed currency as epitomising the humanist attitude. The statement, in a play modeled or borrowed from a (now lost) Greek comedy by Menander, may have originated in a lighthearted vein – as a comic rationale for an old man's meddling – but it quickly became a proverb and throughout the ages was quoted with a deeper meaning, by Cicero and Saint Augustine, to name a few, and most notably by Seneca.

The humanists and Church fathers viewed these ancient pagan philosophies with an understanding that they could have derived from divine revelation and hence could be adapted to a life of Christian virtue. A significant line from Terence's drama, Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto (or with nil for nihil), meaning \\"I am a human being, I think nothing human alien to me\\" became popular and epitomized the humanist attitude. Although it may have originally appeared in a lighthearted context, the quote was later used to convey a deeper meaning. Throughout the ages, this line has been cited by influential figures like Cicero, Saint Augustine, and Seneca. Richard Bauman's statement, \\"Who couldn't quote a line of Terence?\\" serves as a rhetorical question, emphasizing the lasting influence and widespread recognition of Terence's work. It is important to note that the passage does not pose a specific inquiry that requires a single direct answer.

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. Question: What field does the author most probably work in? === The answer to the above question is a). sales b). medicine c). Health and nutrition d). not enough information","output":"Step 1: Identify the main topic discussed in the text. The main topic is clean eating on a budget. Step 2: Identify the elements of clean eating mentioned in the text. The text mentions fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and good foods close to nature. Step 3: Identify any job fields or industries mentioned in the text. The author does not directly mention their job, but it is implied that they are knowledgeable about clean eating, budgeting, and sourcing food. Step 4: Evaluate the possible answer choices. a) Sales: The author does not talk about selling products or services related to clean eating, so this choice is unlikely. b) Medicine: The author talks about clean eating and its benefits, but they do not mention any medical aspects or procedures, so this choice is unlikely. c) Health and nutrition: The author's focus on clean eating, fresh ingredients, and staying within a budget is consistent with someone who works in health and nutrition. This choice is likely. d) Not enough information: While it's possible that the author's field is not explicitly mentioned, their knowledge and focus on clean eating and budgeting suggest that they work in health and nutrition. This choice is less likely.

First, we need to establish the context of Bill Clinton's presidency. Bill Clinton served as the 42nd president of the United States from January 20, 1993, to January 20, 2001. 2. Next, we need to determine if Bill Clinton has played the saxophone. It is well-known that Bill Clinton is an avid saxophone player and has played the instrument since his youth. 3. Now we need to find out if Bill Clinton has performed on live TV playing a saxophone during his presidency. One of the most famous instances of this happened during his 1992 presidential campaign when he appeared on \\"The Arsenio Hall Show,\\" where he played the saxophone live on television. Although the performance on \\"The Arsenio Hall Show\\" occurred before his presidency, it demonstrates that he was known for playing the saxophone, and there are other instances during his presidency where he played the saxophone at various events. For example, an article published in Deseret News on December 15, 1996, reported that Clinton played \\"Jingle Bells\\" on his saxophone for about 600 guests during a White House dinner. While there aren't many widely known examples of him playing on live television during his presidency, it's likely that some instances occurred during live telecasts of events.

For his work as an actor, Phoenix has received a Grammy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and has three Academy Award and British Academy Film Award nominations. Phoenix started acting in television shows with his brother River Phoenix and sister Summer Phoenix. In 2006, Phoenix was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 2007, Phoenix reunited with director James Gray for the film We Own the Night, which he also produced. In the film, Phoenix played a New York nightclub manager who tries to save his brother and father from Russian mafia hit men. The film premiered at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, receiving mixed reviews from critics and grossed a total of 54.5 million worldwide. Critic Peter Travers described Phoenix as \\"electrifying and then some\\", and he was awarded the People's Choice Award for Favorite Leading Man for the performance. For his second film of 2007, Phoenix also reunited with director Terry George for the film Reservation Road. In it, Phoenix played a father obsessed with finding out who killed his son in a hit-and-run accident. The film failed at the box office and received negative reviews from critics, with film critic Peter Travers writing \\"Even the best actors -- and I'd rank Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo among their generation's finest -- can't save a movie that aims for tragedy but stalls at soap opera.\\" Phoenix made his third collaboration with director James Gray in the film Two Lovers (2008), where he played a bachelor torn between the family friend his parents wish he would marry and his beautiful but volatile new neighbor. Two Lovers premiered in competition at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival in May, receiving largely positive reviews, especially Phoenix who was praised by film critics David Edelstein who wrote \\"He [Phoenix] is, once again, stupendous, and stupendous in a way he has never been before\\" and Roger Ebert describing his performance as \\"perfect pitch\\". Two Lovers grossed 16 million worldwide. Phoenix's mockumentary film I'm Still Here (2010) premiered at the 67th Venice International Film Festival on September 6, 2010. The film was directed by Phoenix's then brother-in-law Casey Affleck and was also written by Affleck and Phoenix himself. The film purports to follow the life of Phoenix, from the announcement of his retirement from acting, through his transition into a career as a hip hop artist. Filming officially began on January 16, 2009 at a Las Vegas nightclub. Throughout the filming period, Phoenix remained in character for public appearances, giving many the impression that he was genuinely pursuing a new career. Although widely suspected to be a \\"mockumentary,\\" the fact that the events of the film had been deliberately staged was not disclosed until after the film had been released. The film received mixed reviews and failed at the box office.

Did Supernatural break 2001 CW debuting shows seasons record?","output":"The rationale for determining if the TV show \\"Supernatural\\" broke the 2001 CW debuting shows seasons record is to research the number of seasons the 2001 debuting shows on CW aired and then compare it with the number of seasons \\"Supernatural\\" aired. To do this, let's first look at the list of shows that premiered on The CW (formerly known as The WB and UPN) in 2001: 1. Smallville 2. Reba 3. Maybe It's Me 4. Off Centre 5. Nikki 6. Men, Women & Dogs 7. Elimidate Deluxe (reality show) 8. Ripley's Believe It or Not! (reality show) Now, let's check the number of seasons for each of these shows: 1. Smallville: 10 seasons (2001-2011) 2. Reba: 6 seasons (2001-2007) 3. Maybe It's Me: 1 season (2001-2002) 4. Off Centre: 2 seasons (2001-2002) 5. Nikki: 2 seasons (2000-2002) (Technically not a CW debut in 2001, but we'll include it for completeness) 6. Men, Women & Dogs: 1 season (2001) 7. Elimidate Deluxe: 1 season (2001) 8. Ripley's Believe It or Not!: 4 seasons (2000-2003) (Not a CW debut in 2001, but included for completeness) The show with the highest number of seasons in the 2001 CW debuting shows is \\"Smallville\\" with 10 seasons. Now let's look at the number of seasons \\"Supernatural\\" aired. The series debuted on September 13, 2005, and lasted for 15 seasons, concluding on November 19, 2020. Now, comparing the number of seasons of Supernatural (15 seasons) with that of the highest record for the 2001 debuting CW shows (10 seasons for Smallville), Supernatural has indeed broken the record for the number of seasons. Therefore, yes, Supernatural did break the 2001 CW debuting shows' seasons record."},{"instruction":"Question: what is the mortality rate for lightning strikes? Would \\"This current, caused during each stroke, takes the path of least resistance, which may be ion rich human or animal legs, over poorly conducting earth.\\" be a reasonable answer? Select from: [i] No. [ii] Yes.","output":"[i] No. The mortality rate for lightning strikes and the statement provided as an answer address two distinct yet related aspects of lightning strike incidents. To provide a comprehensive response, it is necessary to first address the mortality rate, followed by an analysis of the provided statement. The mortality rate for lightning strikes refers to the ratio of lightning strike fatalities to total cases of lightning strike incidents. According to the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the average global mortality rate for lightning strikes is between 10% and 20%. These rates slightly vary across different regions and are influenced by factors such as access to medical care and the degree of vulnerability associated with the affected population's activities. Now, let's analyze the statement: \\"This current, caused during each stroke, takes the path of least resistance, which may be ion-rich human or animal legs, over poorly conducting earth.\\" This statement focuses on the nature of the current caused by a lightning strike and does not address the mortality rate directly. However, it offers some insight into one of the mechanisms that could contribute to the injuries and fatalities resulting from lightning strikes. Lightning strikes occur when the electrical discharge of a thunderstorm seeks a way to connect the electrical charge between the ground and the clouds. This discharge tends to follow the path of least resistance, which is generally the shortest and most conductive route to the ground available. In the presence of humans or animals, this path may sometimes involve passing through their body, particularly if they provide better electrical conductivity than the ground around them (such as ion-rich legs). When an individual is struck by lightning, the electrical current can cause severe injuries and damage to internal organs, which can lead to fatalities. The specific path of the current through the body, the type and intensity of the lightning strike, and the individual's physical condition are factors that determine the degree of harm caused and the likelihood of survival. In conclusion, while the provided statement does not directly answer the question of lightning strike mortality rates, it does offer insight into the mechanism of lightning strikes and how humans and animals can become part of the current's path. The mortality rate for lightning strikes is estimated to be between 10% and 20% globally, with variations across regions influenced by factors such as access to medical care and the affected population's vulnerability."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Un impulso exaltado de un Bhakti rezaga al Jnani más lento.\\" from Spanish to English.","output":"\\"An excited push from a Bhakti leaves behind the slower Jnani.\\" Now, let me explain it like I am talking to a five-year-old.

A Florida teacher who had a four month affair with an underage student and aborted his child left her previous job after being investigated for another inappropriate relationship with a teen boy. Jennifer Fichter was said to have been infatuated with the eighth grade student and was suspended from her job while an investigation was launched in 2008. A 40 page report on the English teacher revealed that she told another teacher she had feelings for the boy, and hinted to another student that she wanted to have sex with him. She reportedly said ‘he makes me melt into a puddle with those eyes.’ Her co-worker told investigators that she told her she even dreamed about the boy one night. When asked what it was about, she said, ‘Oh my goodness, it was a goooood dream!’ The report said Fichte and her colleague joked that the remark could get her jailed if ever revealed.

Fichter had reportedly told another teacher that a 14-year-old student 'makes me melt into a puddle with those eyes' An investigation was launched into her feelings for the 14 year old boy. No charges were ever filed against the 29 year old in the 2008 case. But she is now in jail after being accused of having sex with a minor as many as 30 times in the backseat of her truck. Police said she confessed to a love affair with a 17-year-old student and even claimed she got pregnant with his child but had an abortion. Ficher, who worked at the Central Florida Aerospace Academy was charged with six counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor. The teen has not been identified. Scene: Jennifer Christine Fichter, 29, was an English teacher at Central Florida Aerospace Academy in Lakeland, Florida (pictured) and the teen was her student.

The. teen told detectives he and Fichter met for sex three times in the. parking lot of a Lakeland apartment complex and three times near New. Tampa Highway. He also said they had sex four times outside the city in Polk and Hillsborough. Lakeland police said those counties are investigating those incidents. The illegal meetings were discovered by the teen's suspicious mother on January 27. When she noticed her son was not home at 5am and lied about his whereabouts, she looked through his cell phone and found texts from two names. One discussed an 'age difference'. Police said the mum confronted her son, who admitted both names were used by Fichter. The mother reported Fichter to police, however it is not clear why she waited so long. Fichter is now in jail after being accused of having sex with a minor as many as 30 times in the backseat of her truck. The mother also agreed to speak to Fichter and record the conversation for investigators. During the call, Fichter allegedly admitted she became pregnant with the teen's child and had an abortion.

Interestingly, this was not Fichter's first brush with inappropriate relations with students. She had previously been invested in 2008 over a relationship with an eighth-grade student, during which she had allegedly expressed infatuation for the boy both verbally and through her behaviour. This previous event took place while she was working at Robinswood Middle School in Orange County, and led to her suspension and eventual resignation. However, despite an extensive 40-page report detailing her inappropriate behaviour and feelings towards the minor, no charges were filed against Fichter in the 2008 case. In the latest incident, Fichter, who was employed at the Central Florida Aerospace Academy at the time, was reported to have had sexual encounters with the minor as many as 30 times, often in the backseat of her truck. These illegal meetings were discovered when the student's mother found suspicious text messages on her son's phone. Upon confrontation, the teenager admitted to the relationship, and Fichter was reported to the police. Further investigations by the police unveiled that Fichter confessed to falling pregnant with the student's child and subsequently having an abortion. She also professed her love for the student and expressed her intention to continue the relationship. Following these revelations, Fichter was arrested at her home and is currently in jail, facing six counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor. The revelations also prompted new investigations into the previous encounters Fichter had with students. The narrative does not simply cast Fichter as a criminal but paints a complex and disturbing portrait of a woman who, despite professional expectations and legal boundaries, continually developed inappropriate feelings and relationships with her underage students."},{"instruction":"Process: - Humans are born as babies - Babies become infants - Infants become children - Children learn skills - Children become teenagers - Teenagers undergo puberty - Teenagers become adults - Adults have children - Adults become elderly - Elderly humans die. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more light to travel happens, how will it affect MORE babies. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned involves an increase in light travel, which presumably means an increase in the exposure to light or the length of daylight hours. To evaluate whether this perturbation affects the process of human growth and development, we will examine each stage of the process in the context of this perturbation and discuss any potential direct or indirect impacts on the overall outcome of more babies being born. 1. Humans are born as babies: Generally, the exposure to daylight or an increase in light travel should not directly affect the conception and birth of babies. However, there may be indirect effects such as seasonal changes in the birth rate. Some studies have linked changes in the length of daylight with fertility, suggesting that an increase in daylight may lead to an increase in births, perhaps due to higher levels of Vitamin D or increased melatonin production. 2. Babies become infants: An increase in light exposure may indirectly influence infants' development and well-being. Higher natural light levels could positively impact mood and create a healthier environment for infants, which could potentially lead to better growth and development during this phase of life. 3. Infants become children: As infants grow into children, more light exposure could again indirectly impact their development. Longer periods of daylight may lead to more opportunities for outdoor play, socialization, and physical activity, which could contribute to healthier and more well-rounded children. 4. Children learn skills: With increased light exposure, children are likely to have more opportunities for learning as a result of increased waking hours and potentially better mood and mental well-being. Additionally, natural light has been shown to improve cognitive function and memory, which would support the learning of new skills for children. 5. Children become teenagers: An increase in light travel may indirectly impact the transition into adolescence. Longer daylight hours may contribute to more opportunities for physical activity, social interactions, and personal growth, which can help shape teenagers into well-rounded individuals. 6. Teenagers undergo puberty: Research indicates that melatonin, a hormone influenced by light levels, plays a role in the timing of puberty. An increase in light travel may cause changes in melatonin production, potentially leading to earlier or later onset of puberty depending on the specific circumstances. However, this indirect effect would depend on the individual and their unique physiology and environment. 7. Teenagers become adults: As teenagers mature into adulthood, the indirect impact of increased light exposure may continue to influence their lives through various physical and mental health benefits. 8. Adults have children: As previously mentioned, the increased light exposure may indirectly influence fertility rates through a variety of related factors like Vitamin D or increased melatonin production, resulting in more babies born. 9. Adults become elderly: With more light exposure, elderly adults may experience some indirect benefits, such as improved mood, better sleep patterns, and more opportunities for socialization and physical activity, which in turn may contribute to a better quality of life. 10. Elderly humans die: While increased light travel doesn't have a direct impact on mortality, it may indirectly influence the quality of life for elderly humans during their final years. Better mental and physical well-being may lead to a more fulfilling life, even as they approach the end. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis concerning an increase in light travel does not seem to have any direct impact on the process of human growth and development. However, if we consider the indirect effects, such as fertility rates, mental and physical well-being, and the opportunities for social interaction and skill learning, it is possible that an increase in light exposure could contribute to an increase in the birth of babies and influence the overall quality of life."},{"instruction":"Question: Article: For as long as they can remember Jynne Martin and April Surgent had both dreamed of going to Antarctica.This winter,they each made it to the icy continent as guests of the National Science Foundation(NSF).Bm they didn't go as scientists.Martin is a poet and Surgent is an artist.They went to Antarctica as participants.in the NSF's Artists and Writers program.The NSF is thegovernment agency that funds scientific research in Antarctica.But it also makes it possible for artists,including filmmakers and musicians,to experience Antarctica and contribute their own points of view to our understanding of the continent. The mixing of science and art in Antarctica isn't new.Some of the earliest explorersbrought along painters and photographers.Edward Wilson was a British painter,doctor,and bird expert who journeyed with RobertFalcon Soott on two separate Antamtic expeditionsmore than 100 years ago.Herbert Ponting was a photographer who also accompanied Scott on one of those expeditions.In hundreds of photos,Pontingcaptured the beauty of the continentand recorded the daily lives and heroic struggles of the explorers. Today's scientists write articles forscientificjournals.Unlike theearly explorers'journals,scientific papers can now be very difficult for non-scientists to understand.Writers in Antarctica workto explain the research to the public.Peter Rejcek is editor,writer,and photographer for the Antarctic Sun,an onlinemagazine devoted to news about the U.S.Antarctic Program.Rejeck began his career in the Antarctic in 2003 by spending a year at the South Pole.He has returned everyyear since,interviewing,scientists about research at Palmer,McMurdo,and South Pole stations. There are also scientists in Antarctica who work hardto explain their research to the public.Scientist Diane McKnight wrote The Lost Seal,a children's book that explains the research she and others are doing in an unusual ice-free area in Antarctica called the Dry Valleys. Antarctica is full of stories and wonders that are scientific,historic.and... Question: What do we know about the NSF? Yes or no, is the answer \\"It is a government agency.\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the National Science Foundation (NSF) is a government agency in the United States. However, simply stating it as a government agency does not do justice to the scope of its work and contributions. The NSF is responsible for funding scientific research in various fields, including Antarctic research. The agency plays a crucial role in supporting and enabling significant scientific discoveries, technological advancements, and subsequent applications. Furthermore, the NSF also runs special programs such as the Artists and Writers program. This program allows artists, writers, filmmakers, and musicians to visit and experience Antarctica and contribute their perspectives and interpretations to enhance our understanding of the continent. By facilitating the collaboration and interaction of science, art, and culture, the NSF helps generate a more comprehensive and accessible view of the scientific research conducted in Antarctica and its implications. Through this program, artists such as Jynne Martin, a poet, and April Surgent, an artist, had the opportunity to visit the continent to gain firsthand experience, which subsequently influenced their artistic work. In addition to its funding and support initiatives, the NSF plays an essential role in communicating scientific findings and promoting public understanding by encouraging scientists and non-scientists to make research accessible and engaging. This is exemplified in projects like the Antarctic Sun, an online magazine covering news about the U.S. Antarctic Program, and efforts by scientists like Diane McKnight, who authored a children's book explaining her research in Antarctica's Dry Valleys. In conclusion, while the NSF is indeed a government agency, it has a multifaceted role in funding research, supporting artistic and cultural exchanges, and promoting public understanding and engagement with scientific knowledge, particularly in the context of Antarctic research."},{"instruction":"Give me the correct facts to answer this: what was vasco nunez de balboa original purpose of his journey?","output":"Vasco Núñez de Balboa's original purpose for his journey was to explore and establish trade routes and settlements in the newly discovered lands of the Americas.

Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. - Evangelica was a magazine started in 1980 following the controversial dismissal of Seventh-day Adventist theologian Desmond Ford. It was published until 1987, and had an \\"Evangelical Adventist\\" perspective. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - The Evangelical and Reformed Church (E&R) was a Protestant Christian denomination in the United States. It was formed in 1934 by the merger of the Reformed Church in the United States (RCUS) with the Evangelical Synod of North America (ESNA).

A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field. Research projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school research project, they can be used to further a student's research prowess to prepare them for future jobs or reports. To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole. The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, or the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological,etc. - The headquarters of the United Nations is a complex in New York City designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer.

The United Church of Christ is in historical continuation of the General Council of Congregational Christian churches founded under the influence of New England Puritanism. The Evangelical and Reformed Church and the General Council of the Congregational Christian Churches united in 1957 to form the UCC. These two denominations, which were themselves the result of earlier unions, had their roots in Congregational, Christian, Evangelical, and Reformed denominations. At the end of 2014, the UCC's 5,116 congregations claimed 979,239 members, primarily in the United States. In 2015, Pew Research estimated that 0.4 percent, or 1 million adult adherents, of the U.S population self-identify with the United Church of Christ. - Manhattan is the most densely populated borough of New York City, its economic and administrative center, and the city's historical birthplace.

The conservatives argued that elected politicians should instead be trusted . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"Step 1: Read both sentences and analyze the meaning. Sentence 1: \\"Conservatives argued that instead, trusted politicians should be elected.\\" Sentence 2: \\"The conservatives argued that elected politicians should instead be trusted.\\" Step 2: Break down the basic components of both sentences. Sentence 1: Subject: Conservatives Verb: argued Object: trusted politicians should be elected Sentence 2: Subject: The conservatives Verb: argued Object: elected politicians should be trusted Step 3: Compare the components for similarities and differences. Both sentences share the same subject (conservatives) and verb (argued). The difference lies in the object of the sentence. Sentence 1 tells us that conservatives argued that trusted politicians should be elected (meaning the politicians should first be trustworthy, and then elected). Sentence 2, however, tells us that the conservatives argued that politicians elected first should then be trusted (meaning politicians should be trusted after they have been elected). Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the comparison. Although the two sentences might seem similar at a first glance, their meanings are different. The first sentence emphasizes the importance of trustworthiness in politicians before they are elected, while the second sentence emphasizes trusting politicians after they have been elected. Conclusion: These two sentences are not paraphrases of each other."},{"instruction":"Can you tell me the answer to what is the maximum amount of time that tcs foods can be in the temperature danger zone??","output":"To answer the question, I will do the following steps: 1. Define TCS foods and the temperature danger zone. 2. Research and gather information about the maximum amount of time TCS foods can be in the temperature danger zone. 3. Summarize my findings and provide an answer. Step 1: Define TCS foods and the temperature danger zone. TCS (Time/Temperature Control for Safety) foods are foods that require temperature control because they are more likely to harbor harmful pathogens that can cause foodborne illnesses. The temperature danger zone is the range of temperatures in which such harmful pathogens can grow rapidly, which is generally between 41°F (5°C) and 135°F (57°C). Step 2: Research and gather information about the maximum amount of time TCS foods can be in the temperature danger zone. I am an AI language model, and I possess a large database of knowledge from various credible sources. According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service guidelines, the maximum amount of time TCS foods can be in the temperature danger zone is generally mentioned as 4 hours. However, it's important to always follow local food safety regulations and consider specific guidelines for particular kinds of TCS foods. Step 3: Summarize my findings and provide an answer. The maximum amount of time that TCS foods can be in the temperature danger zone is generally 4 hours.

Translate to Finnish Finnish:","output":"Aloittaisin sanomalla, etten aio puhua omasta raportistani. Tässä yhteydessä haluaisin kuitenkin tarjota kattavamman ja yksityiskohtaisemman vastauksen asiaan kuin alkuperäinen lausunto antoi ymmärtää. Siksi keskityn tässä vastauksessa antamaan tietoa ja neuvoja liittyen kuinka toimia tilanteessa, jossa et haluaisi keskustella omasta raportistasi. Ymmärrän, että on useita syitä, joiden vuoksi et haluaisi puhua omasta raportistasi tai työstäsi. Se saattaa johtua haluttomuudesta avata keskustelua, joka voisi aiheuttaa ristiriitoja tai erimielisyyksiä, tai se saattaa olla strateginen päätös olla jakamatta tietoja kollegojen, kilpailijoiden tai muiden sidosryhmien kanssa. Seuraavassa on joitain vinkkejä siitä, kuinka voit ilmaista haluttomuutesi puhua omasta raportistasi ja käsitellä tilannetta mahdollisimman rakentavasti. 1. Ole diplomaattinen: Muotoile vastauksesi kohteliaasti ja diplomaattisesti, ja muista, että kunnioitus ja myötätunto ovat avaimia yhteistyöhön ja konfliktien ratkaisemiseen. 2. Tarjoa alternatiivisia resursseja: Jos olet tottunut puhumaan raporteista julkisesti tai saat paljon kyselyitä aiheeseen liittyen, harkitse viitata kollegoihin tai muihin lähteisiin, jotka voivat tarjota tietoja tai oivalluksia raportin tai aiheen suhteen. 3. Keskitä keskustelu muihin kysymyksiin: Voit ohjata keskustelua muiden asioiden puoleen ja näin välttää raportistasi puhumista. Tämä voi olla erityisen hyödyllistä, jos raportti ei ole suoraan relevantti keskustelun aiheeseen tai on parempi keskittyä laajempiin kysymyksiin. 4. Aseta omat rajat: On tärkeää asettaa henkilökohtaiset rajat ja ilmaista selkeästi niiden ylläpitäminen. Esimerkiksi, voit ilmaista, että et halua tehdä työstäsi julkista, etkä ole valmis keskustelemaan siitä. 5. Ole avoin ja rehellinen: Jos sinulla on todellinen syy siihen, että et halua puhua raportistasi, kerro siitä avoimesti ja rehellisesti. Toiset saattavat arvostaa avoimuuttasi ja rehellisyyttäsi paljon enemmän kuin yrityksen vältellä aihetta. Lopuksi on tärkeää muistaa, että jokaisella on oikeus valita, mistä aiheista he haluavat keskustella työympäristössä, ja jokaisen tulee kunnioittaa toisten valintoja. Se, että et halua puhua raportistasi, ei tarkoita, että olet epäammattimainen tai et halua olla osa tiimiä. Päinvastoin, suhtautumalla tilanteeseen rakentavasti, diplomaattisesti ja rehellisesti, voit itse asiassa osoittaa ammattitaitoa ja johtajuutta."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage.

Passage:The main feud heading into Cyber Sunday was between WWE Champion John Cena, World Heavyweight Champion King Booker, and ECW World Champion The Big Show, the top champion of each of the three brands. This feud began on the October 9 edition of Raw, where they came face to face, arguing about who was the most dominant champion in WWE. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon interrupted, and booked a triple threat \\"Champion of Champions\\" match at Cyber Sunday between the three of them. This also gave each show's General Manager an opportunity to choose opponents for each other's champion that night. This resulted in Big Show defeating Jeff Hardy and Booker defeating Rob Van Dam; however, the match between Cena and The Undertaker was interrupted by Booker, Big Show, and The Undertaker's storyline rival, Mr. Kennedy. At the same time, Cena began a minor feud with Kevin Federline. Federline, as the on-screen close friend of Johnny Nitro and Melina's, appeared on Raw to promote his album, \\"Playing With Fire\\". Cena rapped about Federline, but Nitro came out to Federline's defense and was thrown out of the ring by Cena. Cena was then interrupted by his two Cyber Sunday opponents, and McMahon who announced that a championship would be on the line at Cyber Sunday. Cena performed the FU on Federline, after being insulted. The feud between the champions continued on the October 20 edition of SmackDown!, when Big Show and Cena were at ringside during Booker's title defense against Batista. Batista speared Booker onto Big Show, who, in response, assaulted Batista, ending the match via disqualification. Cena then joined the brawl, and SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long announced a tag team match for the next week. On the next Raw, Cena defeated Nitro after an FU, but was assaulted afterwards by his Cyber Sunday opponents, who turned on each other shortly after to start a brawl between the four to end the show. Batista and Cena were successful in the tag team match, after Big Show abandoned Booker. The next week, on Raw, a preview of Cyber Sunday's interactivity was displayed when fans voted for Cena's opponent for the night, between Big Show, Booker, and Jonathan Coachman. Coachman won in the voting, but was easily defeated by Cena. Solution:","output":"b"},{"instruction":"Q: Glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids are the two main types of what in humans?

Your thoughts:","output":"To calculate the total number of wins the basketball team had in the three competitions, we first need to determine how many games they won in each competition. First Competition: The team won 40 games in their first competition. Second Competition: They won 5/8 times as many games as they won in their first competition. To calculate this, we'll multiply the number of games they won in the first competition (40) by 5/8: 40 * (5/8) = (40 * 5) / 8 = 200 / 8 = 25 games So the team won 25 games in the second competition. Third Competition: In this competition, the basketball team won the same number of games as the sum of their winnings from the first and second competitions. Total winnings from the first and second competitions = 40 games (first) + 25 games (second) = 65 games Therefore, the team won 65 games in the third competition. Total Number of Wins in the Three Competitions: Now that we have the number of games won in each competition, we can calculate the total number of wins: 40 games (first) + 25 games (second) + 65 games (third) = 130 games So the basketball team won a total of 130 games in the three competitions."},{"instruction":"Q:Question: Many random citizens would use an entrance hall to enter this sort of building.

What are some tips for making my AP art studio final portfolio? Do those questions have the same meaning? Select from: [1]. no [2]. yes","output":"[1]. No The two questions do not have the same meaning. They refer to two different subjects. Now, let me address each question individually: 1. Side effects of using skin whitening tablets Skin whitening tablets, like any other supplement or medication, may have potential side effects. These tablets generally contain active ingredients such as glutathione, vitamin C, and other antioxidants. Although these ingredients are generally safe, potential side effects may occur, particularly if taken in excessive amounts or if one is not compatible with an individual's body. Some of the possible side effects of using skin whitening tablets include: a. Allergic reactions: Some individuals may have an allergic reaction to one or more ingredients in skin whitening tablets. Symptoms of allergic reactions may include skin rashes, itchiness, swelling, and difficulty breathing. b. Nutrient overload: Consuming excessive amounts of any supplement can lead to nutrient overload, which may cause health problems. For example, excessive vitamin C intake can lead to diarrhea, nausea, and stomach cramps. c. Hormone imbalances: Some skin whitening tablets may interact with hormones in the body, potentially causing side effects such as mood swings, weight gain, or acne. d. Drug interactions: Skin whitening tablets may interact with other medications, reducing their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects. e. Liver and kidney problems: Excessive use of skin whitening tablets, particularly those containing high amounts of glutathione, could lead to stress on liver and kidney function, potentially causing damage over time. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any supplementation regimen, particularly if you have pre-existing medical conditions or are taking other medications. 2.

You've probably seen mom or dad stop at the gas station to fill up the car, right? It's just like getting a big glass of milk for your car, but instead of milk, cars drink oil to keep going. That oil has a special price that changes from time to time. Sometimes, it's more expensive, and sometimes it's cheaper. Now, imagine if you saw your favorite candy at the store for a very high price one day, and a very low price the next day. That would be pretty strange, wouldn't it? That's what's happening with oil prices. But here’s the funny part - for most people, especially in the U.S, these changes aren’t surprising anymore, just like how you wouldn’t be surprised if you have to go to bed at bedtime! Even if the price goes up a lot, people just say, \\"Oh well, that's how it is.\\" This is what we mean when we say that oil prices have lost their 'shock value'. Shock value is when something surprises or shocks you. The 'Chart of the Day' part in the title talks about a special picture that shows info about these changing oil prices. It's like a storybook, but instead of words, it tells the story using lines, colors and numbers. Sometimes, grown-ups like to look at these charts to understand how prices have changed over time. It's like if we drew a picture everyday of how much ice cream we ate. Over time, we can look back and see some days we had lots of ice cream and some days we had a little. That’s how these charts work! In simple terms, the oil price dance doesn’t wow people anymore. They have gotten used to it, just like how you get used to your big brother's silly faces! It's just part of everyday life now. And the chart of the day is like showing today's chapter in that big, oil price storybook!"},{"instruction":"Creatively image a question and justification for this answer: no","output":"Question: Is it possible to stop the rotation of the Earth instantaneously without causing any catastrophic consequences?

He plans to steal 2 million from the money-counting room of a racetrack during a featured race. He assembles a team consisting of a corrupt cop (Ted de Corsia), a betting window teller (Elisha Cook Jr.) to gain access to the backroom, a sharpshooter (Timothy Carey) to shoot the favorite horse during the race to distract the crowd, a wrestler (Kola Kwariani) to provide another distraction by provoking a fight at the track bar, and a track bartender (Joe Sawyer). George Peatty, the teller, tells his wife Sherry (Marie Windsor) about the impending robbery. Sherry is bitter at George for not delivering on the promises of wealth he once made her, so George hopes telling her about the robbery will placate and impress her. Sherry does not believe him at first but, after learning that the robbery is real, enlists her lover Val Cannon (Vince Edwards) to steal the money from George and his associates. The heist is successful, although the sharpshooter is shot and killed by the police. The conspirators gather at the apartment where they are to meet Johnny and divide the money.

The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Amaranthus, collectively known as amaranth, is a cosmopolitan genus of annual or short-lived perennial plants. Some amaranth species are cultivated as leaf vegetables, pseudocereals, and ornamental plants.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"After Alexander the Great's ventures in the Persian Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west Asia (Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamon), north-east Africa (Ptolemaic Kingdom) and South Asia (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom). This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum. This mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca through the Hellenistic world.\\"? The answer is:","output":"One potential question to test the students' understanding of the passage could be: \\"How did the establishment of Hellenistic kingdoms and colonization across different regions influence the cultural and linguistic dynamics of the Hellenistic world?

We have a train with 24 carriages and an engine, each 60 meters long, and it's going at 60 kmph. We need to find how long it takes to cross a 1.4 km bridge. We can start by finding the total length of the train. With the 24 carriages and the engine, we have 25 units, each 60 meters long: 25 * 60 meters = 1500 meters. We need to convert the train's speed from kmph to meters per second to make the units compatible with the bridge length. We know there are 1000 meters in a kilometer and 3600 seconds in an hour, so: 60 kmph * (1000 meters / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) = 60 * (1000/3600) m/s = 60 * (5/18) m/s = 50/3 m/s. Now let's find the total distance the train has to travel to completely cross the bridge. We need to add the length of the train to the length of the bridge: 1500 meters (train) + 1400 meters (bridge) = 2900 meters. Next, we need to find the time it takes to travel this distance, with the formula time = distance / speed: time = 2900 meters / (50/3 m/s) = (2900 * 3) / 50 = 174 seconds.

Solve 14*o = 6*o - 8 for o.","output":"To solve the given equation: 14 * o = 6 * o - 8, we will have to isolate 'o'. Let's start breaking this down step by step. First, since there are 'o' terms on both sides, you'll need to get all terms involving 'o' on one side of the equation. You can do this by subtracting '6o' from both sides of the equation. The choice to subtract '6o' is made in order to keep a positive coefficient of 'o', but you can also opt to subtract '14o', which would give you a negative coefficient. So, it becomes: 14o - 6o = 6o - 6o - 8, which simplifies to: 8o = -8. Next, to solve for 'o', we need to get 'o' on its own on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing every term in the equation by the coefficient of 'o' which in this case is '8'. This gives us: 8o / 8 = -8 / 8, which simplifies to : o = -1. So the solution to the equation 14 * o = 6 * o - 8 is o = -1."},{"instruction":"Q:Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".

Morgan Geyser was ordered to undergo mental health treatment in August after a psychologist testified that she was not fit to stand trial, claiming she saw and heard unicorns, Slender Man and Harry Potter's Voldemort. The girl, who had previously appeared disheveled and often rocked back and forth in court, looked more alert and had her hair back from her face during Wednesday's brief hearing. She is accused of stabbing a 12-year-old classmate 19 times with another friend, Anissa Weier, after they lured her into the woods in Waukesha following a sleepover on May 30. Scroll down for video. Fit to stand: Morgan Geyser, pictured in court in June, has been deemed fit to stand trial by a doctor. She is accused of stabbing a 12-year-old friend 19 times in May and leaving her for dead. On Wednesday, Judge Michael Bohren summarized the doctor's report, but he didn't act on it after defense attorney Anthony Cotton said he hadn't had a chance to discuss it with his client. Bohren told Cotton to talk to the girl and come back to court next Tuesday. Cotton, who declined comment after the hearing, had previously expressed concern about the girl's mental health and advocated for treatment. Court documents allege that the two girls had plotted to kill their classmate in an effort to curry favor with the fictional character Slender Man. Accused: Geyser, left, and her friend Anissa Weier, right, allegedly planned the stabbing for five months. Co-defendent: Weier, also pictured in court over the summer, has a competency hearing next month. The victim, Payton Leutner, who identified herself to ABC's 20/20 in September, was lured into the woods and stabbed in the chest, abdomen, legs and arms, allegedly by her two friends. Police revealed the girls had been plotting the attack for five months and initially intended to murder Payton in her sleep at Morgan's house but backed out at the last minute. They changed their plans and decided to kill her in a bathroom at a nearby park the next morning. Weier told police she knew there was a drain in the floor for the blood to go down. When they left for the park the next morning, Geyser hid the knife tucked away in her waistband. They planned to play hide and seek with the victim and then kill her when they were out of sight, in the trees. Victim: Payton Leutner, pictured on ABC in September, had stayed at a sleepover with her two friends the night before and was lured to a wooded area the next morning. She managed to crawl for help after the attack. The Slender Man is a fictional character prevalent on the internet after originating as a meme in 2009. The mythical creature is often depicted as an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a blank, featureless face, wearing a black suit. The character is said to have long, tentacle-like arms, which can be extended to capture prey. It is said to stalk, abduct and traumatize children and, depending on interpretations of the myth, can cause memory loss, insomnia and paranoia. It is also said to be able to create distortions in photographs and teleport. It is understood to have originated in a photoshop contest on the Something Awful Forums in 2009. It then went viral with numerous works of fan art and short scary stories published online known as 'creepypasta'. It was in the seclusion of the woods that one of the girls held down the victim while the other frantically stabbed their friend 19 times. Geyser told investigators she stabbed the victim multiple times, according to a criminal complaint. Weier said that the victim was so badly injured she couldn't breathe, see or walk and that they left her lying on the ground in a pool of blood. Despite her numerous wounds, she was able to crawl out of the woods and to safety where a bicyclist found her and called 911. The victim spent six days in the hospital. Doctors later told police the knife missed a major artery near her heart by a millimeter. The two young suspects were arrested several hours later at a furniture store where police found Weier had a five-inch blade in her backpack.

Here's a step-by-step process and justification for each step: 1. Clean the tie (if necessary): Ensure the tie is clean before attempting to flatten it. If it's dirty or stained, consider hand-washing it gently with cool water and a mild detergent, then rinse thoroughly. This will prevent any dirt or stains from being embedded into the fabric during the flattening process. 2. Air dry the tie: After cleaning the tie, let it air dry by hanging it from the narrow end or laying it flat on a clean, dry towel. Avoid wringing or twisting it, as this can cause damage to the fabric and result in wrinkles that are hard to remove. Air drying ensures that the tie retains its shape and prevents any damage caused by the use of harsh heat. 3. Prepare the ironing board and iron: Set up your ironing board in a well-lit area and plug in your iron. Adjust the temperature setting on the iron according to the fabric composition of the tie (check the care label for recommendations). The main goal is to have a smooth surface to iron on, and a well-suited heat level for the tie's material. 4. Use a pressing cloth: To protect the tie's fabric from direct heat, place a thin, clean, dry, white (color-free) cloth between the tie and the iron. This will diffuse the heat and protect the tie's delicate fibers from being scorched or damaged. 5. Start ironing the tie's backside: Begin by carefully ironing the backside (the side that doesn't show when worn) of the tie, starting at the narrow end and working your way towards the wider end. Use gentle, sweeping motions, and avoid pressing down too hard as that can damage the fabric and its structure. 6. Iron the front side: After ironing the backside, gently flip the tie over and iron the front side using the same gentle, sweeping motions. Pay particular attention to the edges, ensuring you iron out every crease or wrinkle. 7. Store the tie correctly: Proper storage is crucial to maintain the flattened and wrinkle-free appearance of your tie. Roll the tie up by starting from the narrow end and working your way towards the wider end, making sure the front side remains outwards. Alternatively, you can hang the tie on a tie rack or place it carefully in a drawer, away from humidity and direct sunlight. By following these steps, your tie will be flattened, wrinkle-free, and easier to work with."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Dear Mr. Wolfson, The purpose of this letter is to inform you of one of our citizens who I believe should receive some special recognition for dedicated community service. The person I recommend is Elizabeth Samuelson. I believe you know her in your position as volunteer coordinator . I have known Elizabeth for more than 20 years as both a friend and a neighbor. During that time I have seen her work tirelessly on scores of community projects and committees. As far as I know, she has never received any kind of recognition from the community for her work. I believe she should be given some sort of special recognition. Just last year alone, she worked on at least six different community projects including the Park Renewal Project and the Heritage Homes FundRaising Banquet. In addition, she is a weekly driver for the MealsonWheels program and she visits patients in the care unit on a regular basis. Whenever a project or committee needs her, she will put herself into the work wholeheartedly. I'm sure that if you check with a few of your staff members who have been there over the years, they will confirm Elizabeth's community service record and probably be able to add many examples to the few I have given here. By the way, Elizabeth has no idea that I am writing this. She is a humble person, and if she were aware of it, she would not allow me to send it. I thought about writing such a letter about her a number of times in the past but just never took action. Then last week, I noticed in the paper that you sponsor an annual dinner at which dozens of awards are given out to people with much less community service than Elizabeth. In fact, I checked with her and she has never even been invited to that annual event! I urge you to correct that omission now and take action to see that Elizabeth is properly recognized for her many years of silent but outstanding service to this community.

They start showing physical signs of aging, such as wrinkles and gray hair. Typically, vision, strength and reaction time start declining.

Following the termination of their contract with RCA, the Kinks signed with Arista Records in 1976. With the encouragement of Arista's management they stripped back down to a five-man core group and were reborn as an arena rock band. John Dalton left the band before finishing the sessions for the debut Arista album. Andy Pyle was brought in to complete the sessions and to play on the subsequent tour. Sleepwalker, released in 1977, marked a return to success for the group as it peaked at number 21 on the Billboard chart. After its release and the recording of the follow-up, Misfits, Andy Pyle and keyboardist John Gosling left the group to work together on a separate project. Dalton returned to complete the tour and ex–Pretty Things keyboardist Gordon John Edwards joined the band. In May 1978, Misfits, the Kinks' second Arista album, was released. It included the US Top 40 hit \\"A Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy\\", which helped make the record another success for the band. The non-album single \\"Father Christmas\\" has remained a popular track. Driven by session drummer Henry Spinetti's drumming and Dave Davies' heavy guitar the song \\"Father Christmas\\" has become a classic seasonal favorite on mainstream radio. Dalton left the band permanently at the end of their UK tour, and Gordon John Edwards followed. Ex-Argent bassist Jim Rodford joined the band before the recording of Low Budget, on which Ray Davies played the keyboard sections. Keyboardist Ian Gibbons was recruited for the subsequent tour, and became a permanent member of the group. Despite the personnel changes, the popularity of the band's records and live shows continued to grow. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands such as the Jam (\\"David Watts\\"), the Pretenders (\\"Stop Your Sobbing\\", \\"I Go to Sleep\\") and the Knack (\\"The Hard Way\\") recorded covers of Kinks songs, which helped bring attention to the group's new releases.

We have five beautiful children together and they remain our top priority. We ask for your privacy during this time.” The president’s daughter-in-law filed for an uncontested proceeding, meaning she’s not likely to fight her ex for custody of the couple’s five children or over their assets. Legal experts say the former couple likely has a prenuptial agreement. “Prenuptial agreements and confidentiality agreements are in the Trump dynasty DNA so I would be surprised if Donald Jr. went into the marriage completely naked,” said divorce lawyer Michael Stutman, of the firm Stutman Stutman & Lichtenstein LLP. He is not involved in the case. Vanessa and Don Jr., ​both ​40, were married in 2005. Page Six first reported that they were struggling with marital problems related to Don Jr.’s travels and controversial tweets. The filing comes the same day as special counsel Robert Mueller subpoenaed President Trump’s family business, demanding that the Trump Organization release information related to Russia. Don Jr. and his younger brother Eric Trump have been running their father’s company while he’s in office. Nancy Chemtob, another family law expert who is not representing either party, said Vanessa could invoke spousal immunity to avoid testifying against her husband while their divorce is still pending. Chemtob speculated that Vanessa may be filing for the split now to secure a financial settlement before the Mueller probe potentially puts her husband’s assets at risk. ||||| \\"After 12 years of marriage, we have decided to go our separate ways.

Both the monument and the reflecting pool hold historical significance and are visited by millions of tourists from around the world every year. The following is a detailed account of these landmarks, including a variety of facts and information. The Washington Monument is an impressive, 555-foot tall, marble obelisk dedicated to the nation's first president, George Washington. Completed in 1884, the monument was constructed to commemorate Washington's pivotal role in United States history and symbolizes the hopes and aspirations of the country. The design of the monument was inspired by ancient Egyptian obelisks and follows a neoclassical architectural style. Several facts about the Washington Monument stand out: 1. The construction of the monument began in 1848, but it was halted in 1854 due to lack of funds, and then recommenced in 1879 before its eventual completion in 1884. 2. The two-toned shades of the monument are due to a change of marble supply during the construction hiatus. 3. The monument is made of marble, granite, and bluestone gneiss, with the interior containing almost 20,000 stones in the form of commemorative blocks. 4. There is an elevator inside the monument that takes visitors to the observation deck, which offers a 360-degree panoramic view of Washington D.C. 5. The monument is thought to be the tallest freestanding masonry structure in the world, and it was once the tallest building before the construction of the Eiffel Tower in 1889. The Reflecting Pool, located within the National Mall, stretches eastwards from the Lincoln Memorial all the way back to the Washington Monument. The pool is approximately 2,029 feet long, 162 feet wide, and its depth ranges from 18 inches at the edges to 30 inches near the center. It was constructed in 1923 and was designed by architect Henry Bacon, who also designed the Lincoln Memorial. The Reflecting Pool provides beautiful photographic opportunities, offering pristine reflections of both the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument. It has also been the backdrop for some of the most significant moments in American history, such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech during the civil rights movement in 1963. Here are some key facts about the Reflecting Pool: 1. The Reflecting Pool is around four feet deep and holds about 6.75 million gallons of water. 2. The pool was renovated in 2012 to improve its water quality and circulation system, as well as to make it more sustainable by using filtered water from the nearby Tidal Basin. 3. The water is now treated with ultraviolet light to avoid the use of excessive chemicals, ensuring the pool remains safe for both humans and local wildlife. 4. The surrounding sidewalks and landscaping were also restored, allowing better accessibility and enjoyment for visitors. In conclusion, the Washington Monument and the Reflecting Pool are integral components of the National Mall in Washington D.C., and serve as the nation's symbols of history, democracy, and freedom. These landmarks attract millions of visitors each year who appreciate their architectural beauty, historical significance, and the unique experience of marveling at these American treasures."},{"instruction":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: bake, bread, loaf","output":"We can bake a yummy loaf of bread in the oven!"},{"instruction":"Q: You are given a conversation between two people.

Air travel has high speeds, but incurs large waiting times prior to and after travel, and is therefore often only feasible over longer distances or in areas where a lack of ground infrastructure makes other modes of transport impossible. Bush airlines work more similarly to bus stops; an aircraft waits for passengers and takes off when the aircraft is full. Multi-choice problem: Is it true that is a plane a form of public transport? pick from the following. -- no. -- yes. The answer is:","output":"Yes. The plane is indeed a form of public transport. The definition of public transport is a system of transport, in contrast to private transport, that is available for use by the general public, typically managed on a schedule, operated on established routes, and that charge a posted fee for each trip. Airplanes exemplify these characteristics. Firstly, airlines have a regular schedule, with specific times for departure and arrival, similar to how a bus or train service runs on a determined schedule. This timetable allows passengers to plan their journeys and select flights that align with their schedules. Passengers can check these schedules online or at the airports to determine the most suitable flights. Secondly, airlines operate on established air routes, flying from one airport to another, similar to buses operating along specific routes or trains running on specific rail lines. These air routes are fixed, connecting various destinations across the globe. Passengers can choose the route that will take them to their desired destination. Thirdly, airlines charge a fee for each trip. The airfares are usually posted online or are available at the airline's ticketing office or at travel agencies. The fares may vary based on factors such as the distance to be travelled, the type of class (economy, business, first class), and the time of booking. However, irrespective of these variations, there is always a posted standard fee that passengers are required to pay to use the service. In addition, airplanes, like buses or trains, have the capacity to carry a large number of passengers at a time. This ability to accommodate many people simultaneously contributes to the categorization of airplanes as public transport. Furthermore, accessibility is a key characteristic of public transport, and airplanes embody this characteristic. Air travel is widely accessible to the public, irrespective of the passengers' destination. Bush airlines can also be viewed as a form of public transport, with operations similar to bus stations, where the aircraft waits for passengers and takes off when the aircraft is full. This system allows local residents in remote areas with limited ground infrastructure to travel to and from different locations. In conclusion, an airplane is a form of public transport as it ticks all the boxes: it runs on a schedule, operates via established routes, charges a standard fee for each trip, has the capacity to carry many passengers at a time, and is widely accessible to the general public."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and answer the question. Context: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature... Question: When did President Trump announce his plans to suspend military exercises?

Article: Against the supposition that forest fires in Alaska, Canada and Siberia warm the climate, scientists have discovered that cooling may occur in areas where burnt trees allow more snow to mirror more sunlight into space. This finding suggests that taking steps to prevent northern forest fires to limit the release of greenhouse gases may warm the climate in northern regions. Usually large fires destroyed forests in these areas over the past decade. Scientists predict that with climate warming, fires may occur more frequently over the next several centuries as a result of a longer fire season. Sunlight taken in by the earth tends to cause warming, while heat mirrored back into space tends to cause cooling. This is the first study to analyze all aspects of how northern fires influence climate. Earlier studies by other scientists have suggested that fire in northern regions speed up climate warming because greenhouse gases from burning trees and plants are released into the atmosphere and thus trap heat. Scientists found that right after the fire, large amounts of greenhouse gases entered the atmosphere and caused warming. Ozone levels increased, and ash from the fire fell on far-off sea ice, darkening the surface and causing more radiation from the sun to be taken in. The following spring, however, the land within the area of the fire was brighter than before the fire, because fewer trees covered the ground. Snow on the ground mirrored more sunlight back into space, leading to cooling. \\"We need to find out all possible ways to reduce the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\\" Scientists tracked the change in the amount of radiation entering and leaving the climate system as a result of the fire, and found a measurement closely related to the global air temperature. Typically, fire in northern regions occurs in the same area every 80 to 150 years. Scientists, however, found that when fire occurs more frequently, more radiation is lost from the earth and cooling results. Specifically, they determined when...

By Anbarasan EthirajanBBC News Sundar Maurya, a farmer from the south-western town of Narainapur, complained of breathing difficulties and tested positive on 3 May. Within days, his condition worsened. Mr Maurya took his father, who is in his mid-50s, to three medical facilities in the Banke district but all refused him admission due to a shortage of beds and oxygen. By the time he managed to find a bed, it was too late. \\"We are devastated, he was the main breadwinner of the family,\\" Mr Maurya told the BBC. \\"Now I have to take care of my own family and three younger brothers. My mother has been crying inconsolably.\\" Thousands of people like Mr Maurya have lost their loved ones in Nepal, a nation now reeling from a second wave of the virus. \\"If we don't manage this right now, the situation will become catastrophic,\\" said Dr Samir Kumar Adhikari, the chief of the government's Health Emergency Operation Centre. \\"In Kathmandu valley, almost all of the intensive care beds and ventilators are full,\\" he said. \\"Even in hospitals where beds are available, they cannot admit patients due to a lack of oxygen. We have also run out of vaccines.\\" Nepal, a Himalayan nation of about 30 million people, is one of the least developed countries in the world. Landlocked and sandwiched between China in the north and India in the south, it depends on India for most of its supplies, especially medical equipment and liquid oxygen. With India stopping exports of oxygen due to the worsening situation there, Kathmandu is now struggling to find alternative supplies. Like many other Asian nations, Nepal somehow managed to escape the first wave without any serious damage. But the second wave has been devastating. Daily infections hovered at around 150 at the beginning of April but in a month the figure has passed 9,000. More than 4,000 people have died. Nepali health officials say the current daily positivity rate is nearly 50%, meaning that one in two people are testing positive for Covid. An estimated 80,000 people are in home isolation, and officials are warning of many more deaths in the coming weeks. \\"We rank Nepal 9th among the 10 top countries in terms of daily increase in Covid-19 cases. Of all those countries, Nepal has the smallest population but it has the highest case positivity rate,\\" Sara Beysolow Nyanti, the UN resident co-ordinator in Nepal told the BBC. As in neighbouring India, normal life had begun to resume a few months ago when daily cases fell below 100. The country was in a hurry to get back to normality in order to recover from the economic impact of the lockdowns. Masks, sanitation and social distancing were ignored. At the same time, Nepal was hit by a political crisis. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, facing rebellion in his own party, dissolved parliament last December and called for a snap election. But the Supreme Court reinstated parliament in February this year. Mr Oli was also facing criticism from the opposition and civil society over the government's handling of the coronavirus. There have been pro- and anti-Oli protests in Kathmandu and other parts of the country. On Monday, Mr Oli lost the vote of confidence in parliament. It's not clear who will form the next government, with no party having a clear majority. Experts blame the political wrangling and infighting for the sharp turn for the worse in the pandemic. \\"The politicians were busy trying to hold on to power, their attention was not on the health of the people but on retaining power,\\" said Dr Rajan Pandey, chief consultant physician at Bheri hospital, in Nepalgunj city. Nepalgunj, near the border with India, is one of the worst affected regions in Nepal. Every day, hundreds of migrant workers from India are returning through the land border amid fears that some of them may be carrying the virus. Fearing quarantine, many enter the country illegally and go to their villages. There are reports of some of the returnees falling sick. But migrant labourers alone should not be blamed for the second wave, said Dr Pandey. \\"Two months ago, the government and the opposition held huge rallies all over the country. People celebrated religious festivals and organised marriage ceremonies - all contributing to this second wave,\\" he said. The situation has been exacerbated by the fact that Nepal has now suspended its vaccination programme after it ran out of doses. Initially, India donated about a million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, and Nepal secured doses from the global vaccine sharing programme Covax and from China. Officials in Nepal say altogether 2.1 million people have had the vaccine and out of that number 400,000 have received both doses. But with Delhi abruptly suspending the export of vaccines, Nepal is in limbo, alongside Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, increasingly looking to China and Russia to meet their demands. \\"Nepal has not been able to secure vaccines for even 20% of those who need to be vaccinated. So, Nepal should be prioritised at the top,\\" the UN official Ms Nyanti said. \\"I appeal to the countries which can spare vaccine to send them to Nepal immediately.\\" You may also be interested in A:","output":"Nepal faces a devastating second wave of COVID-19, with a daily positivity rate of nearly 50%, medical resources running low, and political instability hindering crisis management."},{"instruction":"Denny asked: If \\"A group of artists smoke cigarettes and sketch chalk drawings on the streets.\\" does that mean that \\"Artists smoke cigarettes and draw with chalk on the sidewalk.\\"?

Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

Which language is this?","output":"The given text, \\"Dies waren wahrscheinlich Fakten,\\" is written in German. German is a West Germanic language predominantly spoken in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and some regions of Luxembourg, Belgium, and Italy. As a major world language, German has a large number of speakers, estimated to be more than 132 million people worldwide. The German language shares common roots with English and Dutch as they all belong to the West Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. It has gone through several periods of evolution, such as Old High German (750–1050 AD), Middle High German (1050–1350 AD), and Early New High German (1350–1650 AD), before reaching its modern form, known as New High German. German is characterized by complex grammatical rules, such as inflection, which includes a rich system of noun, pronoun, and verb declensions. It also has four cases (nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive), three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), and plural forms. Moreover, German is known for its compound words, which can be created by joining multiple words together. This results in some of the longest and precise words found in any language. The influence of the German language can be felt in various fields, such as literature, science, music, and philosophy. It has produced numerous famous works and scholars, including but not limited to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Immanuel Kant, and Albert Einstein.

CLOSE Elon Musk and singer Grimes make their red carpet debut at the Met Gala. USA TODAY It's now red-carpet official: entrepreneur Elon Musk, 45, and musician Grimes, 30, are an item. The South Africa-born billionaire (who moved to Canada when he was 17) and Canadian artist arrived at the Met Gala together on Monday, confirming reports that two have been quietly seeing each other. Elon Musk and Grimes arrive at the Met Gala together, making their relationship red-carpet official. (Photo: Neilson Barnard, Getty Images) Did they dress for the carpet theme, \\"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\\"? Yes, if you consider Musk's electric cars heavenly bodies: He appeared to wear a Tesla pin and she a Tesla choker as part of their coordinated ensembles. The unlikely couple got connected after they made the same artificial intelligence joke, reports Page Six. As the story goes, Musk, a longtime A.I. warner, thought of a pun that's way over our heads and combines A.I. thought experiment Roko's Basilisk with baroque European style Rococo, to make \\"Rococo basilisk.\\" But Musk realized Grimes had made the same highbrow A.I. joke, years before he thought of it. So, according to the report, he reached out to her (before finally tweeting out his pun today) and they got together. USA TODAY has reached out for confirmation on this story. Rococo basilisk — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 7, 2018 Musk and Grimes are a new couple on the carpet this year. Last year, Musk dated another lady who's at this Met Gala, Amber Heard. Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2HVfG6l ||||| New relationship alert! Elon Musk stepped out with his new girlfriend, Grimes, at the 2018 Met Gala in New York City on Monday, May 7. The duo also attended Rihanna’s Met Gala afterparty on Monday. An eyewitness told Us Weekly that Musk and Grimes “made out the whole night” at the event, which was sponsored by Beats by Dre. “They have been dating for about a month,” another source tells Us of the new couple. The source added that pair designed the musician’s dress together over dinner and commissioned a team to make it. Musk, 46, tweeted about Grimes’ music in April. “Likewise …was just listening to Go Flex & Psycho on @Grimezsz playlist,” he wrote on April 25. “glad ur finally listening to cyberpunk speedwae hahaha,” the 30-year-old replied. After the duo exchanged tweets, a fan tweeted at Musk on April 27 to “just ask her out already.” He responded with a wink face. Us Weekly confirmed on February 1 that Musk had called it quits with on-again, off-again girlfriend Amber Heard. “Amber wants her independence and prefers being friends rather than romantically linked,” one source told Us at time. Another source aded that “Elon decided it was time to end things, and Amber agreed … They both care for one another, but the timing just isn’t right.” The Tesla CEO and the Justice League actress, 31, split for the firs time in August 2017 after dating for a year. Five months later, they were spotted kissing in Los Angeles and spent New Year’s Eve together in Chile. Heard also attended the 2018 Met Gala.

Perhaps the most unexpected couple made their debut at the 2018 Met Gala when Elon Musk and Grimes appeared together on the red carpet. The Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) CEO/Tesla co-founder and the musician (real name Claire Elise Boucher) have been flirt-tweeting back and forth for a while, and reportedly met when Musk discovered Grimes beat him to a “Rococo Basilisk” joke on Twitter. The two were dressed in black and white for the “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion & the Catholic Imagination” theme, a topic that heavily contrasts with their interest in artificial intelligence and technology. A version of this story originally appeared on Billboard.com. ||||| Elon Musk has been keeping everyone guessing about his love life, but sources exclusively revealed to Page Six that he has been quietly dating hip musician Grimes — who will walk the red carpet with him at Monday’s Met Gala. A source tells us the pair met around a month ago online, of course, through a joke Musk had planned to tweet but discovered Grimes had already made, dealing with the complications of artificial intelligence. Thought experiment Roko’s Basilisk considers the hypothesis of a future where AI lords over the world and could punish those who did not help it into existence. His joke was to merge this thought experiment with a pun using “Rococo,” referring to the ornate French 18th century baroque style, perhaps pointing out that both concepts are complex, too extreme and ridiculous. And while this takes some explaining, arty performer Grimes was already in on the same joke — three years ahead of Musk. In 2015, she created a character named “Rococo Basilisk” for a video of her song “Flesh Without Blood.” “I don’t know if you’ve heard of Roko’s Basilisk,” she told Fuse. “[This character] is doomed to be eternally tortured by an artificial intelligence, but she’s also kind of like Marie Antoinette.” “Elon was researching the idea of joking about Rococo Basilisk, and when he saw Grimes had already joked about it, he reached out to her,” says the insider. “Grimes said this was the first time in three years that anyone understood the joke. They were both poking fun at AI.” Musk is well known for warning of an AI apocalypse, calling it “more dangerous than nukes.” SpaceX and Tesla founder Musk has been very public in his past fandom for Grimes, whose real name is Claire Boucher. He tweeted out her artsy video with Janelle Monae for the song “Venus Fly” this past March, adding “Best music video art I’ve seen in a while.” Grimes shot to fame in 2012 with her third studio album, “Visions,” and also put out the critically acclaimed “Art Angels” in 2015. She recently revealed she has clashed with her label 4AD, saying “There’s some srsly f–ked up and crazy s–t going behind the scenes in my career,” but that she will be releasing another album with 4AD, followed by independent music. “I just took a month off, a lot of insane s–t went down and I’m reorienting my life,” she wrote on Instagram. “I have a deep well of s–t this time, like sooo many songs so after my album I’ll be able to consistently release new music.” She was a double major in psychology and philosophy, with minors in Russian and electro-acoustics before she dropped out of school to follow her music career. The tech billionaire also tweeted his approval of her Spotify playlist “Go Flex & Psycho.” “Glad ur finally listening to cyberpunk speedwae hahaha,” she responded. “Sounds great riding my cyborg,” he hit back. Just last week they had another online in-joke. After Musk tweeted a video created from long-exposure photos of a comet, Grimes said “that’s a lot of cocaine,” to which he responded, “Yeah, most people don’t know this, but comets [are] mostly made of cocaine.” Aside from flaunting their banter online, Musk hinted at his talented Met Gala date on Monday, tweeting “Rococo basilisk,” and a link to the Rococo Wikipedia page. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a short, simple explanation of a longer piece of information.

Lay out the pattern: Now we put the pattern on top of the fabric, making sure everything is in the right place and fits well. We can use weights or pins to keep the pattern in place. 6. Cut the fabric: Following the pattern, we carefully cut the fabric using special scissors. It's like cutting paper, but we have to be extra careful not to make mistakes. 7.

In 1978, 50% of 16-year-olds had got their first driving licence. In 2008, according to the US Transportation Department, it was just 30%. The number of those aged 19 and under with driving licences has also been _ since 1978, when 11, 989, 000 had licence. In 2010, it was 9, 932, 441, or 4.1% of American drivers. In the UK, 683, 273 teenagers have driving licences- just 1.85% of total licence holders, according to Department of Transport figures from September 2010. But the decline in the US may have more to do with tougher tests and the introduction of the new rule in many states, which force drivers aged under 16 to be with licensed drivers of 21 years and older when driving. In recent years, the annual number of journeys being made by American drivers of all ages has declined clearly for the first time ever. Car use began falling in 2007, when average petrol prices almost doubled to 4.12 a gallon, and the economy became worse.

Charles \\"Chuck\\" Prescott (Thompson) is not sure if his brother, Lt. Dan Prescott (Edwards), is the right choice for piloting the rocket powered Y-13 to very high altitude. Capt. Ben Richards (Ayres) of the Air Force Space Command insists that Dan is their best pilot, even though when piloting the Y-12 into the ionosphere, he began experiencing flight difficulties. Upon landing, Dan broke flight regulations by going to see his girlfriend (Landi), rather than immediately filing his flight report. Despite these concerns, Capt. Richards insists that Dan pilot the Y-13 after a thorough check-out and briefing by Dr. Paul von Essen ([Jaffe). The Y-13 takes off, and at 600,000 feet, Dan is supposed to level off and begin his descent. But he continues to climb, firing his rocket emergency boost for more speed. He climbs to 1,320,000 feet (250 miles) and suddenly loses control of the Y-13 while passing through a dense cloud of unknown material, which forces him to eject. The New Mexico State Police later send a report that a Mexican farmer spotted a parachute, attached to some sort of aircraft, land near his farm, 10 miles south of Alvarado, New Mexico. Chief Wilson (Bill Nagy) meets with Cmdr. Prescott, showing him the wreckage. Tests later show that the automatic escape mechanism and braking chute operated perfectly.

Minority Democrats were enraged after Gannon made the obscene gesture toward Senate Minority Leader Peter Barca (D-Kenosha). Barca rose on Tuesday to argue with Gannon over a news release Gannon issued last week complaining about Milwaukee's homicide rate and how more homicides occur in black neighborhoods with high unemployment rates. The exchange went as follows: Gannon: \\"If Milwaukee wants to export something, how about you export safety and jobs? Thank you Mr. Speaker.\\" Barca: \\"It's bad enough, Mr. Speaker, that this release comes out.

Here is a step-by-step guide on the best way to do it: 1. Gather materials: To begin, you'll need the following items: - A stick (preferably straight and lightweight) - Feathers (3-4 per arrow, typically all from the same wing of a bird) - Fletching jig (optional, but highly recommended) - Glue (fletching glue or super glue) - Nocking points (for consistent placement on the bowstring) - Knife or scissors (for cutting and trimming feathers) 2. Prepare the feathers: Start by cutting the feathers to the desired length and shape. The most common shapes are shield and parabolic. You should also strip the base of the quill to expose the spine, as this will make it easier to attach the feathers to the stick. 3. Prepare the stick: First, ensure the stick is clean and free of debris. Next, mark the location where you want to place the feathers on the stick. Typically, this should be about an inch or two from the end where the nock will be. 4. Set up the fletching jig (optional): If you have a fletching jig, follow the manufacturer's instructions to set it up for your desired feather orientation. A jig helps maintain consistent placement and angle of the feathers. 5. Apply glue: Apply a thin layer of glue to the base of the feather quill. Be careful not to use too much, as excess glue can cause a mess and result in an uneven bond. 6. Attach the feather: Press the feather onto the stick at the marked location, leaving about 1/16 of an inch gap between the end of the quill and the edge of the stick. Hold the feather firmly in place for a few seconds to allow the glue to bond. If using a fletching jig, follow its instructions to attach the feathers. 7. Repeat for remaining feathers: Attach the remaining feathers with equal spacing around the stick (usually, 3-4 feathers are used per arrow). Make sure the feathers are aligned and evenly spaced. 8. Allow the glue to dry: Wait for the glue to fully dry and set before testing the arrow. This may take several hours, depending on the glue used. 9. Install nocking points: Attach the nocking points to the end of the stick opposite the feathers. This will ensure consistent placement on the bowstring and improve the arrow's flight. 10. Test the arrow: After allowing the glue to dry completely, test the arrow by shooting it from your bow. Make any necessary adjustments to the fletching or nocking points as needed. By following these steps, you will successfully attach feathers to the end of a stick to create a functional feathered arrow."},{"instruction":"How does the sentence end?

The sentence conveys that since Emma's mother passed away, another woman had taken over her role or responsibilities, in this case, as a governess. To understand this better, let's break down the sentence: 1. \\"Emma's mother had died long ago\\" - This part of the sentence is talking about the fact that Emma's mother is no longer alive, and this event happened a long time ago. 2. \\"her place had been taken by an excellent woman as governess\\" - This part of the sentence is explaining what happened after Emma's mother died. It states that a woman, described as excellent, took over the role or position that Emma's mother once held, which is implied to be the role of a caretaker or influence in Emma's life. The term \\"governess\\" tells us that this woman was not just a replacement mother figure but also someone responsible for Emma's education and upbringing. By breaking down the sentence in this manner, we can conclude that \\"her\\" refers to Emma's mother because it is explicitly detailing what happened after the mother's death––the introduction of a governess who filled the void left in Emma's life."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you are given a dialogue between a user and an assistant, where users and assistants converse about geographic topics like geopolitical entities and locations.

The letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon from North Korea's U.N. Ambassador Ja Song Nam, dated June 27 but made public this week, does not mention the name of the movie but talks about a plot that \\"involves insulting and assassinating the supreme leadership.\\" \\"To allow the production and distribution of such a film on the assassination of an incumbent head of a sovereign state should be regarded as the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as an act of war,\\" Ja said. \\"The United States authorities should take immediate and appropriate actions to ban the production and distribution of the aforementioned film; otherwise, it will be fully responsible for encouraging and sponsoring terrorism,\\" he wrote. Ja attached a June 25 story by the official KCNA news agency slamming the film with similar rhetoric. Actor Rogen said on Twitter the same day: \\"People don't usually wanna kill me for one of my movies until after they've paid 12 bucks for it.\\" (Reporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Bernadette Baum) ||||| North Korea has lodged a formal protest at the United Nations against a Hollywood comedy about an assassination bid on leader Kim Jong-Un and asked Washington to block the film's release. \\"The Interview\\" stars Seth Rogen and James Franco as two tabloid television journalists who land an interview with Kim in Pyongyang and are then tasked by the CIA with killing him. The film is due to be released in the United States on October 14. In a letter addressed to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, and seen on Wednesday, North Korea's UN envoy Ja Song-Nam says allowing the film to be made and seen constitutes \\"the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as a war action.\\" \\"The US authorities should take immediate and appropriate action to ban the production and distribution of the film, otherwise it will be fully responsible for encouraging and sponsoring terrorism,\\" the letter says. North Korea asked that the letter be circulated as an official document to members of the UN General Assembly and Security Council for their consideration. Last month, North Korea denounced the film as a \\"wanton act of terror\\" and warned of a \\"merciless response\\" unless it were pulled from distribution. In a statement carried by North Korea's official KCNA news agency, a foreign ministry spokesman said the film was the work of \\"gangster moviemakers\\" and should never be shown. Rogen poked fun at the threat on Twitter, writing: \\"People don't usually wanna kill me for one of my movies until after they've paid 12 bucks for it.\\" \\"The Interview\\" is not the first Hollywood film to mock a North Korean leader.

I think that this is important because the treatment of acne is such a personalised journey that it is good to hear about the results of the skincare from a variety of people. In the third review of this series, Nalini from The Made Up Maiden has reviewed this acne set for me. Nalini is 30 and has troublesome skin. She has tried many products to fix it without a lot of luck. Here is Nalini's review: I've always thought the journey to clear skin can be quite a complicated one. There are just so many things that affect the condition of your skin; genetics, skincare, diet, hormones, weather, stress...the list is endless. In my case, both parents had acne when they were younger, and I had hopes that my acne would fade once I left my teens. My skin isn't completely horrendous, but I do have some minimal scarring on my cheeks (which goes away after a little while), and the odd large pimple on my chin during those hormonal times, which goes away after a while but is still really frustrating when it happens! I'm 30 years old, so it looks like these problems are here to stay. I have contemplated taking hormonal pills or medication aimed at reducing acne, but decided that the possible side effects haven't really been worth the benefit. As a result, I was really keen to explore the Aphelia Cosmetology range and see if it lives up to the promise of helping with acne troubled skin. I would classify my skin as combination, the t-zone gets a little oily towards midday, while the rest of my skin is pretty much classified as 'normal'. I received the following items.

Input: CONTEXT: 10 de marzo de 2006 10 de marzo de 2006Bogotá, Colombia — Óscar Leonardo Salas Angel, quien según varios testigos no participaba activamente en las protestas de este miércoles (8) en la Universidad Nacional de Colombia, falleció la madrugada del viernes (10) al ser desconectado de los aparatos que lo mantenían con vida. Horas antes, Salas había sido declarado muerto cerebral por los médicos de la clínica Los Fundadores, sitio donde fue ingresado al mediodía del miércoles (8) tras recibir el impacto de un elemento contundente que se alojó en su cerebro y que falta por determinar. Los médicos, que nunca se nunca se atrevieron a hacer pronósticos alentadores, declararon la mañana del jueves (9) que el joven había sufrido grave deterioro neurológico e inestabilidad hemodinámica, condiciones que aumentaban el temor de que Óscar Leonardo presentara daño cerebral severo e irreversible. El hecho, que se presentó durante una protesta estudiantil en rechazo del recién firmado Tratado de Libre Comercio y con ocasión de la celebración del Día Internacional de la Mujer, ocurrió alrededor de las 11.00 (16.00 UTC) en la Carrera 30 con Calle 45, cuando el joven de 20 años, estudiante de 4o. semestre de lingüística de la Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas, otra universidad pública, acompañaba a su hermano a observar las protestas en la Universidad Nacional. El general Luis Alberto Gómez Heredia, en declaraciones sobre lo sucedido a Caracol Radio el jueves, señaló que la solicitud de presencia de los antimotines fue realizada a las 10:30 (15:30 UTC) del miércoles por las directivas de la Universidad Nacional y agregó que pedirá una investigación ante la Procuraduría y la Justicia Penal Militar para determinar la responsabilidad de la fuerza pública ante las graves denuncias que la acusan como responsable del hecho. Salas formaba parte del Polo Joven, organización adscrita al partido izquierdista Polo Democrático Alternativo (PDA). Samuel Moreno Rojas, presidente del PDA, dijo en un comunicado: \\"esperamos que la situación se aclare a la mayor brevedad posible y que los responsables paguen por la muerte de un muchacho de 20 años que apenas estaba empezando a vivir y quien era una promesa para el futuro de nuestro país\\". Protestas mucho más pacíficas, ocurridas en noviembre pasado debido a la aprobación de una reforma interna, desencadenaron en bloqueos y en el cierre temporal de la sede Bogotá de la Universidad, que debió ponerse al día entre enero y febrero, cuando finalizó el segundo semestre de 2005 -que debía acabar en diciembre-. Este lunes (6), la Universidad inició las actividades del primer semestre de 2006. Como consecuencia de lo sucedido y por las elecciones legislativas de este domingo, las directivas decidieron no realizar actividades académicas el viernes y el sábado (11).

Thus, the answer should clarify the steps or processes that Tracy should take or activities that she should participate in to successfully find the item at the store before receiving help. Appropriate responses may include the following steps: 1. Conduct a thorough search of the store on her own: Tracy can start by systematically checking each aisle or section of the store to locate the item. This step would help her familiarize herself with the store layout and potentially find other items of interest. 2. Check store directory or signs: If Tracy is unsure about the specific location of the item, she can use the store directory or informational signs typically placed around the store to guide her to the appropriate section. These resources help customers navigate the store quickly and efficiently. 3. Utilize available technology: Some stores offer mobile apps or in-store tablets that can help customers locate items through a search function. Tracy could download and use the store app or access the in-store device to find the item within the store. 4. Ask another customer: Prior to asking help from store personnel, Tracy may consider approaching a fellow shopper who might have experience with the item she is looking for or who appears to be knowledgeable about the store layout. If, after taking these steps, Tracy is still unable to find the item, asking for help from store personnel would be necessary and appropriate.

San Francisco – December 11, 2017 – Breakthrough Listen, the global astronomical program searching for evidence of civilizations beyond Earth, announced that it is currently focusing its observational efforts on ‘Oumuamua, the mysterious interloper recently spotted moving rapidly through the solar system. ‘Oumuamua was discovered by the Pan-STARRS project at the University of Hawaii in October 2017, passing Earth at about 85 times the distance to the Moon – a stone’s throw, in astronomical terms. It is the first object discovered in the solar system that appears to originate from another star system. Its high speed – 196,000 mph at its peak – suggests it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun, but will continue its voyage back into interstellar space. It has a highly unusual structure for an asteroid – an elongated cigar shape, hundreds of meters in length but with width and height perhaps only one tenth as long. Researchers working on long-distance space transportation have previously suggested that a cigar or needle shape is the most likely architecture for an interstellar spacecraft, since this would minimize friction and damage from interstellar gas and dust. While a natural origin is more likely, there is currently no consensus on what that origin might have been, and Breakthrough Listen is well positioned to explore the possibility that ‘Oumuamua could be an artifact. Listen’s observation campaign will begin on Wednesday, December 13 at 3:00 pm ET. Using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, it will continue to observe ‘Oumuamua across four radio bands, from 1 to 12 GHz. Its first phase of observations will last a total of 10 hours, divided into four “epochs” based on the object’s period of rotation. ‘Oumuamua is now about 2 astronomical units (AU) away, or twice the distance between Earth and the Sun. This is closer by a factor of 50-70 than the most distant human artifact, the Voyager I spacecraft. At this distance, it would take under a minute for the Green Bank instrument to detect an omnidirectional transmitter with the power of a cellphone. “‘Oumuamua’s presence within our solar system affords Breakthrough Listen an opportunity to reach unprecedented sensitivities to possible artificial transmitters and demonstrate our ability to track nearby, fast-moving objects,” said Listen’s Andrew Siemion, Director of Berkeley SETI Research Center. “Whether this object turns out to be artificial or natural, it’s a great target for Listen.” Even if no signal or other evidence of extraterrestrial technology is heard, Listen observations will cover portions of the radio spectrum in which the object has not yet been observed, and could provide important information about the possibility of water/ice, or the chemistry of a coma (gaseous envelope), neither of which have yet been identified. Listen has already proved its value for traditional, non-SETI astronomy: in August 2017 it detected several dozen repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) from a distant dwarf galaxy – for details see www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=10675. Breakthrough Listen is a scientific program in search for evidence of technological life in the Universe. It aims to survey one million nearby stars, the entire galactic plane and 100 nearby galaxies at a wide range of radio and optical bands. The Breakthrough Initiatives are a suite of scientific and technological programs exploring the Universe, seeking scientific evidence of life beyond Earth, and encouraging public debate from a planetary perspective.

The Green Bank telescope in West Virginia will listen for radio signals being broadcast from a cigar-shaped body which was first spotted in the solar system in October. The body arrived from interstellar space and reached a peak speed of 196,000 mph as it swept past the sun. Scientists on the Breakthrough Listen project, which searches for evidence of alien civilisations, said the Green Bank telescope would monitor the object, named ‘Oumuamua, from Wednesday. The first phase of observations is expected to last 10 hours and will tune in to four different radio transmission bands. “Most likely it is of natural origin, but because it is so peculiar, we would like to check if it has any sign of artificial origin, such as radio emissions,�? said Avi Loeb, professor of astronomy at Harvard University and an adviser to the Breakthrough Listen project. “If we do detect a signal that appears artificial in origin, we’ll know immediately.�? Mysterious object confirmed to be from another solar system Read more The interstellar body, the first to be seen in the solar system, was initially spotted by researchers on the Pan-Starrs telescope, which the University of Hawaii uses to scan the heavens for killer asteroids. Named after the Hawaiian word for “messenger�?, the body was picked up as it swept past Earth at 85 times the distance to the moon. While many astronomers believe the object is an interstellar asteroid, its elongated shape is unlike anything seen in the asteroid belt in our own solar system. Early observations of ‘Oumuamua show that it is about 400m long but only one tenth as wide. “It’s curious that the first object we see from outside the solar system looks like that,�? said Loeb. The object’s orbit The body is now about twice as far from Earth as the sun, but from that distance the Green Bank telescope can still detect transmissions as weak as those produced by a mobile phone. Loeb said that while he did not expect Green Bank to detect an alien transmission, it was worth checking. “The chances that we’ll hear something are very small, but if we do, we will report it immediately and then try to interpret it,�? Loeb said. “It would be prudent just to check and look for signals. Even if we find an artefact that was left over and there are no signs of life on it, that would be the greatest thrill I can imagine having in my lifetime. It’s really one of the fundamental questions in science, perhaps the most fundamental: are we alone?�? The Breakthrough Listen project was launched at the Royal Society in London in 2015, when the Cambridge cosmologist Stephen Hawking announced the effort to listen for signs of life on planets that orbit the million stars closest to Earth. The 100m project is funded by the internet billionaire Yuri Milner, and has secured time on telescopes in the US and Australia to search for alien civilisations. Astronomers do not have good ideas about how such elongated objects could be created in asteroid belts. By studying ‘Oumuamua more closely, they hope to learn how they might form and whether there are others in the solar system that have so far gone unnoticed. “If it’s of natural origin, there should be many more of them,�? Loeb said. Previous work on the body found it to be extremely dark red, absorbing about 96% of light that falls on it. The colour is associated with carbon-based molecules on comets and asteroids. If, as expected, the telescope fails to pick up any intelligent broadcasts from ‘Oumuamua, the observations are still expected to aid scientists in understanding the body. Other signals detected by the Green Bank telescope could shed light on whether the object is shrouded in a comet-like cloud of gas, and reveal whether it is carrying water and ice through the solar system. • This article was amended on 12 December 2017.

Beyoncé, born as Beyoncé Giselle Knowles on September 4, 1981, has established herself as one of the most influential and successful artists of the 21st century. Throughout her career, she has transcended the barriers of music and broken several records, while setting new ones. A multi-Grammy Award winner, she gained popularity as the lead singer of Destiny's Child before venturing into a remarkable solo career. Beyoncé's impact can be studied from the perspectives of her contributions to the music industry, feminism, and the representation of women and people of color in the entertainment world. 1. Impact on the Music Industry: Beyoncé's distinct voice, strong work ethic, and exceptional performances make her an icon in the music industry. She fuses various musical styles such as pop, R&B, hip-hop, soul, and more, demonstrating a diverse and flexible sound. Her albums, such as \\"Dangerously in Love\\" (2003), \\"B'Day\\" (2006), and \\"Lemonade\\" (2016), have critical acclaim, massive sales, and countless accolades. She is also known for her headline-making live performances, such as her Super Bowl halftime shows (2013 and 2016) and her 2018 Coachella set. By challenging the way music is released and consumed, she has forced the industry to adapt to new methods. Her surprise album releases, such as 2013's eponymous \\"Beyoncé\\" and 2016's \\"Lemonade,\\" set trends and increased fan engagement. 2. Influence on Feminism: Beyoncé is an ardent advocate of gender equality and women's empowerment. She brazenly labeled herself a feminist in her 2013 self-titled visual album, which included a clip of Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's TEDx talk \\"We Should All Be Feminists.\\" By doing this, she created a buzz and initiated conversations about feminism amongst her fans and the general public. Her music often features themes of self-confidence, independence, and addressing societal expectations for women. Examples include her songs \\"Independent Women,\\" \\"Run the World (Girls),\\" \\"Flawless,\\" and \\"Formation.\\" Additionally, her clothing line, Ivy Park, aims to empower women and promote body positivity. 3. Representation of Women and People of Color: Beyonce is an influential voice in the fight against racial inequality and the promotion of Black culture. Her music, visuals, and performances are rich with symbolism and references to the African diaspora. She uses her platform to raise awareness about issues like police brutality, racial bias, and other forms of systematic racism. The 2016 Super Bowl halftime performance, in which she paid homage to the Black Panthers, and her 2018 Coachella set, celebrating historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), are prime examples. Moreover, Beyoncé continuously defies societal expectations of beauty by embracing her natural hair, curves, and heritage. Through her career, she has created space for greater diversity and representation of Black women in the entertainment industry. In conclusion, Beyoncé's impact extends beyond the music industry, as she has emerged as a prominent figure in feminism and representation. By using her art to challenge conventions, empower women, and advocate for the Black community, she has cemented herself as a cultural icon, heralding a new era of artistic activism."},{"instruction":"Q:WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton called Republican rival Donald Trump dangerous and unqualified for the presidency in a blistering foreign policy speech Thursday in San Diego, California. \\"He is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility,\\" Clinton said. \\"This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes.\\" Trump “doesn’t understand America, or the world,” she said. \\"It’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.\\" In anticipation of the address, Trump attacked his Democratic opponent on Twitter. “Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin’ Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions,” he tweeted. Clinton emphasized her own experience as first lady, senator and secretary of state, saying she would provide the steady diplomacy the country needs. “National security is the foundation of how we make sure our interests are pursued in the world,” said Louis Goodman, Emeritus Dean of International Relations at American University in an interview with VOA. With polls show terrorism is a major concern among Americans, Clinton targeted Trump's positions on the issue. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has promised to temporarily block Muslims from crossing U.S. borders. \\"The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens more.

Sentence 2: While disputed, some feel that the Soviets were only there to take Egypt for themselves. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"The second sentence can be true but is not necessarily true if the first sentence is true. Let's break down both sentences to have a deeper understanding of this: In the first sentence, we learn that Nasser ruled Egypt for 17 years, during which he embarked on a significant modernization program with the help of the Soviet Union. This sentence highlights the cooperation between Egypt and the Soviet Union during Nasser's rule, which led to the development and progress of the country. The second sentence, however, states that some people believe that the Soviet Union may have had ulterior motives for providing help to Egypt. These people argue that the Soviet Union intended to take control of Egypt, essentially using their assistance as a strategic move to expand their influence and sphere of control. Considering the historical context, both sentences can be true simultaneously without being mutually exclusive. During the Cold War era, the Soviet Union sought to expand its influence worldwide. Therefore, it is possible that, while Soviet aid to Egypt contributed to the country's modernization program, as stated in the first sentence, the Soviet Union might have had additional, more secretive intentions, as many people suspect, which is expressed in the second sentence. However, it is also essential to bear in mind that the second sentence is not presented as an established fact but rather as the opinion of some individuals who feel that Soviet involvement in Egypt might have had ulterior motives. In conclusion, although the modernization program under Nasser's rule with Soviet assistance is a fact, the notion that the Soviet Union intended to take control of Egypt remains a matter of dispute and opinion. Therefore, the truth of the second sentence does not necessarily hinge on the truth of the first sentence. Both sentences can independently be true without one directly impacting the validity of the other."},{"instruction":"Definition: You are given a sentence in Arabic.

Question: suppose the person has sugar insulin problems happens, how will it affect sugar is not in the body. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"When a person has issues with sugar and insulin regulation within their body, it can lead to several complications and affect the overall glucose management system. In order to provide a comprehensive answer, let's first break down the normal process of sugar entering the body and its subsequent management: 1. Sugar enters the body through the consumption of carbohydrate-rich foods. 2. In the digestive system, carbohydrates are broken down into glucose (a type of sugar), which then enters the bloodstream. 3. The elevated glucose level in the bloodstream signals the pancreas to produce insulin, a hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar levels. 4. Insulin allows glucose to enter the cells, where it is used for energy or stored for later use. This process effectively lowers blood sugar levels. 5. Once blood sugar levels return to normal, insulin production slows down, and the system maintains a state of equilibrium. Now, considering a scenario where someone has problems with sugar and insulin regulation, there are primarily two types of issues that can be present, either separately or together. A. Insulin Resistance - In this condition, the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin, making it more difficult for glucose to enter the cells. As a result, blood sugar levels remain consistently high, and the pancreas must produce more insulin to try to overcome this resistance. This may eventually lead to type 2 diabetes, where the pancreas can no longer produce enough insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels. In this case, the perturbation leads to MORE difficulties in glucose management. B. Insulin Deficiency - This occurs when the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels correctly. This can cause high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia), leading to type 1 diabetes. Insulin deficiency can be due to the destruction of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas or genetic factors that affect insulin production. In this case, the perturbation leads to LESS effective glucose management. Suppose a person has both insulin resistance and insulin deficiency simultaneously. In that case, their ability to regulate blood sugar levels becomes significantly hampered, leading to severe and dangerous variations in blood sugar, higher chances of developing diabetes, and other health complications due to poor glucose management. Taking into account the specific phrase \\"sugar is not in the body,\\" this scenario would likely represent a case of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels), which can be equally dangerous when dealing with sugar and insulin management problems. In this case, the perturbation may lead to a greater propensity for hypoglycemic episodes. To summarize, the perturbation of sugar and insulin regulation problems in a person's body can lead to MORE difficulties in maintaining normal blood sugar levels, whether through insulin resistance, insulin deficiency, or a combination of both. This results in a more challenging glucose management process and puts the person at higher risk for developing health complications, such as diabetes."},{"instruction":"Question: Who does Sarah leave for dead?

Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics for her acting prowess, she has established herself in Bollywood, and is considered among the country's most attractive and highest-paid actresses. Born in Hong Kong, Kaif and her family lived in several countries before she moved to London. She received her first modelling assignment as a teenager and later pursued a career as a fashion model. In 2012, Kaif appeared in \\"Chikni Chameli\\", an item number in Agneepath that incorporated dance steps from the Lavani genre (a Maharashtrian folk dance). The song was filmed over a ten-day period and, according to the actress, \\"It was hard work. It was very fast and it was not a style I was used to, but I took it as a challenge\\". Kaif appeared next in Kabir Khan's espionage thriller Ek Tha Tiger as a Pakistani ISI agent who falls in love with an Indian RAW agent. Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express wrote about her performance: \\"Katrina is an able, animated foil to Salman, her long legs making her leaps and kicks credible\\". The film received predominantly positive reviews, with Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis calling it \\"smart and stylish\\". With worldwide earnings of Rs3.1 billion (US47 million), Ek Tha Tiger was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year. That year Kaif also appeared with Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma in Yash Chopra's swan song, the romance Jab Tak Hai Jaan. About working with Chopra, she remarked that he \\"undoubtedly is the king of romance and I have always admired the way he presents his heroines. It was always a dream to work with him and the reality is even better\\". She played Meera, a woman who promises God to end her affair with her comatose lover if he survives. Although the film received mostly positive reviews, Kaif's performance had a mixed reception. CNN-IBN wrote: \\"Meera's role was a difficult one and Katrina falls short in emotional scenes. It seems Katrina still doesn't feel very easy in front of the camera and has difficulty with complex expressions\\". Commercially, the film proved a box-office hit with revenues of Rs2.11 billion (US32 million) worldwide. In 2013, she appeared briefly with Aamir Khan in Vijay Krishna Acharya's action thriller Dhoom 3. To prepare for her role as a circus performer, she undertook a year-long regimen of Pilates, functional training and aerial straps. The film received ambivalent reviews and Kaif was criticised for taking on an insubstantial part.

The Hollywood star, 47, and her 51-year-old husband François-Henri Pinault, owner of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, are said to be scouring Belgravia, Kensington and Notting Hill for a family home. Their search comes as a number of French tycoons have indicated they are preparing to leave their home country following a crackdown on high earners by Socialist president François Hollande. The company insisted","output":"that their decision to move to London has nothing to do with tax reasons, but rather personal reasons, as Hayek has been working in the city more frequently and they want to be closer to Pinault's work and have easier access to the international business hub. Moreover, their search for a new home in London could also indicate a desire to provide a more international and diverse upbringing for their daughter, Valentina. London is known for being a melting pot of cultures, providing an enriching environment for children to grow up in. The areas they are targeting, such as Belgravia, Kensington, and Notting Hill, are known for their affluent neighborhoods and proximity to some of the best schools in the city. These areas also have a large population of French expatriates, which could be another motivating factor for the couple. The so-called \\"l'exodus\\" of wealthy French citizens is primarily driven by concerns about France's high taxes on high earners, which have been introduced by President François Hollande's socialist government. Some wealthy French individuals and business owners believe that the tax burden is pushing them to seek out opportunities in countries with more favorable tax policies. France has implemented a number of taxation changes, including a 75% tax on incomes over €1 million, which have been met with mixed reactions. Some argue that these taxes help reduce economic inequality and provide much-needed funding for public services, while others claim that they stifle job creation and investment. London, on the other hand, has become an attractive destination for wealthy individuals due to its comparatively lower tax rates and its cosmopolitan nature. In addition to the advantages offered by the city in terms of lifestyle and education, London is also a global financial center, making it a prime location for business people like Pinault. The fact that Salma Hayek and her husband are considering a move to London has only fueled the debate about the policies in France that are driving some of its most affluent citizens to move to other countries. Though the couple maintains that their reason for moving is personal rather than financial, their decision to relocate is seen by many as an example of how excessive taxation can push people to seek out better options elsewhere. Furthermore, France's brain drain has sparked concern about the impact on its economy and reputation, with critics arguing that the departure of wealthy individuals and entrepreneurs could lead to a decrease in investments and job opportunities. Therefore, it is vital for France to review its tax policies and strike a balance between ensuring fiscal fairness and providing an environment that fosters growth, innovation, and prosperity. In conclusion, the decision of Salma Hayek and her billionaire husband, François-Henri Pinault, to search for a new home in London is reflective of a larger trend among wealthy French citizens seeking better opportunities and less aggressive tax policies. While the couple cites personal reasons for their potential move, their decision has ignited a debate on the need for France to review its taxation policies in order to remain attractive to high earners and to foster economic growth."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Paul: You ok to give me a lift to work tomorrow?

He pulled a gun from his backpack after being asked to show his identity papers and was killed in the ensuing shootout, ANSA reported. A police officer was injured. ANSA said various sources in Milan and Rome confirmed that the dead man was Amri, who German authorities believe drove the truck that plowed into the Christmas market Monday. Citing Milan anti-terrorism police, ANSA said authorities positively identified Amri from his physical appearance and fingerprints. ||||| MILAN (Reuters) - Italian police shot dead the man believed responsible for this week’s Berlin Christmas market truck attack, killing him after he pulled a gun on them during a routine check in the early hours of Friday. The suspect - 24-year-old Tunisian Anis Amri - traveled to Italy from Germany via France, taking advantage of Europe’s open-border Schengen pact to cross the continent undetected. As anger grew over the fact that Amri had escaped expulsion twice in 18 months thanks to bureaucratic loopholes, euroskeptic parties called for the reintroduction of border controls, while Germany said deportations had to be made easier. Amri is suspected of ploughing a truck through a festive Berlin market on Monday, killing 12 people. In a video released on Friday after his death, he is seen pledging his allegiance to militant group Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. “I call on my Muslim brothers everywhere... Those in Europe, kill the crusader pigs, each person to their own ability,” he says in the video posted on Islamic State’s Amaq news agency. Amri had arrived in Milan’s main railway station from France at 1.00 a.m. (2000 EDT) and then traveled to the working class suburb of Sesto San Giovanni, where two young policemen approached him because he looked suspicious idling on a street. Milan police chief Antonio De Iesu told a news conference his men had no idea that they might be dealing with Amri. “They had no perception that it could be him, otherwise they would have been much more cautious,” De Iesu said. “We had no intelligence that he could be in Milan.” He failed to produce any identification so the police requested he empty his pockets and his small backpack. He pulled a loaded gun from his bag and shot at one of the men, lightly wounding him in the shoulder. Amri then hid behind a nearby car but the other police officer managed to shoot him once or twice, killing him on the spot, De Iesu said. Amri was identified by his fingerprints. ITALIAN JAIL De Iesu said that besides the gun, the suspect had been carrying a small pocket knife. He also had a few hundred euros on him but no cell phone and very few other belongings. Amri once spent four years in jail in Italy and police were trying to work out if he knew someone in Sesto, which is home to a sizeable Muslim community. “He could have carried out other attacks. He was a loose cannon,” De Iesu said. Islamic State had previously claimed responsibility for the Berlin killings and on Friday it acknowledged the death of the man it referred to as “the executor of the Berlin attacks.” Leading euroskeptics were quick to blame the Schengen open borders pact for allowing the suspect to travel so easily. “This escapade in at least two or three countries is symptomatic of the total security catastrophe that is the Schengen agreement,” said Marine Le Pen, who leads France’s far-right National Front party and is running for president. Beppe Grillo, the founder of the 5-Star Movement, Italy’s main opposition party, said Schengen was allowing militants to cross Europe with impunity and had to be re-thought. He also said all illegal migrants had to be expelled from the country. The body of Anis Amri, the suspect in the Berlin Christmas market truck attack, is seen covered with a thermal blanket next to Italian officers in a suburb of the northern Italian city of Milan, Italy December 23, 2016. REUTERS/Stringer Chancellor Angela Merkel, under increasing pressure inside Germany to take a much tougher line on immigration after opening the country’s borders to waves of refugees in 2015, said the Berlin attack raised many questions and promised measures would be taken to improve security. Amri originally come to Europe in 2011, reaching the Italian island of Lampedusa by boat. He told authorities he was a minor, though documents now indicate he was not, and he was transferred to Catania, Sicily, where he was enrolled in school. Just months later he was arrested by police after he attempted to set fire to the school, a senior police source said. He was later convicted of vandalism, threats, and theft. He spent almost four years in Italian prisons before being ordered out of the country after Tunisia refused to accept him back in 2015 because he had no identification papers linking him to the north African country. He moved to Germany and applied for asylum there, but this was rejected after he was identified by security agencies as a potential threat. Once again he could not be deported because of a lack of I.D. Merkel said on Friday she had told Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi during a phone conversation that her government wanted to speed up deportation of failed asylum seekers. The attack, which echoed one in Nice in July that killed more than 80 people, has put Europe on high alert over the Christmas period. Early on Friday, German special forces arrested two men suspected of planning an attack on a shopping mall in the western city of Oberhausen. The men - two brothers from Kosovo, aged 28 and 31 - were arrested in the city of Duisburg on information from security sources, police said. A police spokesman said there was no link with the Amri case.

Italy's interior minister, Marco Minniti, assured that after all necessary checks were conducted, it is beyond doubt that the dead man is Amri, who German authorities believe drove the truck into the market, resulting in the death of 12 people. The incident took place during a routine police check in Milan's Sesto San Giovanni neighborhood when Amri pulled a gun from his backpack after being asked to show his identity papers. This led to a shootout wherein a police officer was injured and Amri was killed. The officer's condition is not life-threatening. Amri, a 24-year-old Tunisian, allegedly took advantage of Europe’s open-border Schengen pact to travel from Germany via France to Italy.

Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said detectives did not have the tape before, and would be acquiring it this week. In the recording, released Monday by RadarOnline, Gibson's former girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva recounts an incident in which she says Gibson hit her as she held their baby daughter, a blow that broke the model's teeth. A voice believed to be Gibson's is heard telling the woman she \\"deserved\\" it. An investigation into Gibson began last week, after Grigorieva, a Russian model and the mother of one of Gibson's children, made formal allegations against the actor. Sheriff's officials are not releasing details into the investigation, but say it's expected to be wrapped up by the middle of next month. Their findings will be turned over to the Los Angeles County district attorney's Office, which would then determine if charges will be filed against Gibson. The tape released Monday is being reviewed along with interviews, and other evidence, authorities said. \\"What kind of a man is that? Hitting a woman when she's holding a child in her hands?\\" Grigorieva is heard saying. \\"Breaking her teeth twice in the face! What kind of man is that?\\" \\"Oh, you're all angry now! You know what, you … deserved it!\\" a man believed to be Gibson is heard responding. A spokesman for Gibson declined to comment Monday afternoon. Controversy revisited the troubled actor recently with reports that he was recorded using a derogatory term for African Americans. In 2006, the \\"Lethal Weapon\\" star unleashed a profanity-laden anti-Semitic tirade, after being stopped on suspicion of drunk driving.

However, after a period of rapid temperature increases during the 1980s and 1990s there has been a significant slow-down since the turn of the century, leading some sceptics to claim that global warming has stopped. A scientific assessment of the planet’s heat balance has found that the most likely explanation for the recent hiatus in global warming is the continual absorption of thermal energy by the huge “heat sink” of the deep ocean many hundreds of metres below the sea surface, according to scientists from the Met Office. Senior climate scientists said that they had always expected periods when the rate of increase in temperatures would level off for a few years and emphasised that the last decade was still warmer than any previous decade, with 12 of the 14 hottest years on record occurring since 2000. Professor Rowan Sutton, a climate scientist at Reading University, said the temperatures have levelled off in the past, the latest example being in the 1940s and 1950s when sulphate pollutants from the post-war boom in industrial production may have acted as a shield against incoming solar radiation. “Some people call it a slow-down, some call it a hiatus, some people call it a pause. The global average surface temperature has not increased substantially over the last 10 to 15 years,” Professor Sutton said. “Climate scientists absolutely expect variations in the rate at which surface temperature will rise….but that is not to say we understand all the details of the last 10 to 15 years,” Professor Sutton said. The problem for the Met Office is to explain why the rate of increase in global temperatures has declined in recent years while concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have continued to accelerate. Sceptics claim that this shows there is not a strong link between the two, whereas climate scientists insist that rising carbon dioxide concentrations are largely responsible for the rise in global temperatures. Professor Stephen Belcher, head of the Met Office Hadley Centre, said that a pause in the rate of increase in global temperatures lasting this long is unusual but not exceptional, with similar pauses of about 10 years expected on average twice every century. The most likely explanation for the current pause is that excess heat trapped by carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is being transferred from the atmosphere to the oceans where it is being transported down to deeper layers that cannot be monitored by satellites, Professor Belcher said. “It looks like the Earth is continuing to accumulate energy but it looks like it is being re-arranged and hidden from view,” he said. However, measurements from hundreds of ocean floats released over the last decade, which descend and drift to depths of up to 2,000 metres, show that huge amounts of heat from the sea surface is now being transferred to the deep ocean, with unknown consequences for the environment, the scientists said. “In summary, observations of ocean heat content and of sea-level rise suggest that the Earth system has continued to absorb heat energy over the past 15 years, and that this additional heat has been absorbed in the ocean,” says the Met Office report. The pause, however, is unlikely to change the predictions over the future course of global warming. Temperature increases expected by 2015 will only be delayed by a further five or ten years, the scientists said. Average surface temperatures are still on course to increase by 2C this century, with further rises expected by the end of the century if nothing is done to curb carbon dioxide emissions, they said. It is not possible to account for the recent lack of surface warming solely by looking at the difference between amount of heat being received from the Sun and the amount of thermal energy being lost from the planet – calculations show that extra heat continues to be absorbed by the Earth at a rate of 0.6 Watts per square metre, equivalent to about 300bn 1KW electric heaters or 150bn 2KW kettles distributed across the planet. “Observations of ocean heat content and of sea-level rise suggest that the additional heat from the continued rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations has been absorbed in the ocean and has not been manifest as a rise in surface temperature,” the Met Office says in one of its three reports into the global warming pause. “Radiated forcing by greenhouse gases has continued unabated; that heat is being held in the system but is not manifest as a rise in global mean surface temperature. Observations of ocean heat content and of sea-level rise suggest that this additional heat has been absorbed by the ocean,” it says. ||||| The high-pressure dome causing the East Coast heat wave can be seen from space. The heat wave gripping much of the East Coast and Midwest has people wondering: Could this scorching weather have any link to global warming? Experts say it's hard to connect any single event with long-term trends. Still, heat waves \\"are expected to happen more often in the future,\\" said Jake Crouch, a scientist at the National Climatic Data Center. \\"As the average temperature increases, these types of events become more frequent.\\" The current heat wave is somewhat unusual in that it is driven by a high-pressure system, also known as a Bermuda high, that has drifted farther west than usual, Crouch said. This mass of hot air is parked over the Great Lakes and eastern United States, rather than staying in its typical spot over the Southeast and Atlantic Ocean, he said. But it's too early to say if this location change is related to a warmer climate, he added. This week's East Coast heat wave differs from those of last summer, which were driven by a persistent mass of hot air called a heat dome that stayed in place for weeks over much of the central United States, Crouch said. Last year's heat waves were also worsened by drought. Soil moisture can dissipate some heat as it takes up energy and evaporates; without water, it's easier for temperatures to climb, he added. However, a combination of rain and heat leads to high humidity, which is being seen in many places currently. And humidity can lead to higher nighttime temperatures, which are a major factor in deaths from heat, said Jeff Weber, a scientist with the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. Hot nights don't allow people to cool down and get some relief, Weber said. As the Earth continues to warm, heat waves are tending to last longer, Weber told LiveScience. The jet stream, which generally ferries weather patterns from west to east across North America, is driven by a difference in temperature between the cold Arctic and warm equator. Polar regions are heating faster than the equator is, which is leading to a weaker jet stream, Weber said. That means weather systems, like high-pressure systems with high temperatures, tend to stay in place longer, he added. Email Douglas Main or follow him on Twitter or Google+.

Here are the step-by-step reasons: Step 1: Understand the concepts - An image in a mirror is formed by reflecting light, which means that light bounces off the mirror and reaches our eyes. - Light is made of photons, which are elementary particles that carry electromagnetic energy. Step 2: Reflecting photons off the mirror - When photons hit the surface of a mirror, their energy and direction are altered due to the mirror's reflective properties. Step 3: Reflected photons reaching the observer - The photons that have been reflected off the mirror will travel to the observer's eyes, carrying the information about the image's color and intensity. Step 4: Image formation in the observer's brain - The observer interprets the reflected photons entering the eye, and the brain processes this information to recreate the image. Step 5: Conclusion - Therefore, when a mirror reflects photons, it creates a reflected image that the observer perceives, based on the information carried by the reflected photons."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this \\"Place the pork tenderloin onto a cutting board.

One of the most delicious ways to enjoy this delightful cut of meat is by butterflying it, filling it with your favorite stuffing, and rolling it back up for a mouthwatering, impressively presented meal. In this article, we will take you through a step-by-step guide on how to prepare a sumptuous stuffed pork tenderloin, including tips for cutting, pounding, and cooking to perfection. Step 1: Preparing The Pork Tenderloin To begin, place your pork tenderloin onto a clean, dry cutting board. Ensure that the cutting board is sturdy and won't slide around while you are working on it. Next, you'll want to butterfly the tenderloin. Using a sharp knife, carefully make a vertical cut down the length of the tenderloin. Stop the cut about 1-inch from the end of the pork loin to avoid completely slicing it in half. Step 2: Butterflying The Pork Tenderloin Once you've made your vertical cut, open up the cut meat and lay it flat on the cutting board. This technique, often referred to as \\"butterflying,\\" allows for a larger surface area for the stuffing and creates a visually appealing presentation. Step 3: Pounding The Meat To ensure that the pork tenderloin not only cooks evenly but also has an appealing texture, it is essential to pound the meat. With your meat laid flat on the cutting board, cover it with a layer of plastic wrap or parchment paper. Use a meat mallet to gently pound the meat, paying close attention to maintaining an even thickness throughout the tenderloin. This will also make it more receptive to absorbing flavors from the stuffing. Step 4: Chilling The Meat To maintain the freshness and quality of your pork tenderloin while you prepare the stuffing, chill the meat in the refrigerator while working on the next steps. This keeps the pork tenderloin safe and prevents the growth of bacteria. Step 5: Preparing The Stuffing Now it's time to let your creativity shine! Choose your favorite stuffing recipe to prepare while the meat is chilling. Some popular options include apple and sage, mushroom and spinach, or cranberry and walnut fillings. Whatever you choose, make sure to finely chop or grate the ingredients for a better distribution of flavors in the final dish. Step 6: Stuffing The Tenderloin Remove your pork tenderloin from the refrigerator and lay it flat on the cutting board. Evenly distribute the stuffing mixture in an even layer across the surface of the butterflied pork loin. Be mindful not to overstuff the tenderloin as this will make it difficult to roll and tie later. Step 7: Rolling And Tying The Tenderloin Once you've added the stuffing, carefully roll the pork tenderloin back up with the stuffing safely contained and seal off the cut. Using butcher's twine, tie the loin securely so the stuffing is held in place and the tenderloin retains its shape during cooking. Step 8: Cooking The Pork Tenderloin Follow the instructions in your recipe for properly cooking the stuffed pork tenderloin. Typically, this involves searing the tenderloin in a hot, oven-safe skillet on all sides till golden brown, then transferring it to a preheated oven to finish cooking until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 145°F for medium doneness. Conclusion With a little patience and preparation, you can create a mouthwateringly delicious and visually appealing stuffed pork tenderloin that will surely impress your family and friends. Don't hesitate to put your personal touch on this dish by playing around with the choice of stuffing and experimenting with flavors that specifically cater to your taste buds."},{"instruction":"Write an article with the title: \\"Learning Gardens Sprouting Up Across America\\" Article:","output":"Title: Learning Gardens Sprouting Up Across America Hi kids!

Paul Getty never saw the Getty Villa. He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty’s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his “ranch” on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms—Galleries 105 to 108—share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty’s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place. From a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa Getty bought the 64-acre ranch—once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant—just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (“Teddy”) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection. He knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies. (The Davies estate is now the Annenberg Community Beach House, while Getty’s beach house has been replaced by a large modern condo complex, 270 Palisades Beach Road.)

In this context, the aspects being questioned pertain to the measures that have been established to help families balance their work and personal lives, especially when it involves raising children. There are various provisions within government policies, legislation, and organizational support structures that work to facilitate this balance, particularly for working parents with young children. Support services for children, which include childcare services such as preschools, nurseries, and after-school programs, play a crucial role in enabling families to manage both their professional and family responsibilities. These services not only provide a safe and stimulating environment for children but also allow parents the flexibility and peace of mind needed to focus on their careers and workplace demands. Reconciling professional and family life requires a comprehensive approach that addresses various dimensions. These include flexible working hours, parental leave policies, affordable and accessible childcare, and the promotion of gender equality in the distribution of childcare and household responsibilities. Furthermore, companies and organizations can provide additional support through work-from-home options, childcare benefits, and the implementation of family-friendly corporate policies. However, there are concerns about how effectively these provisions are addressing the real needs of families, and whether they promote fairness and equity among different segments of society. Some of the key issues that may need further attention include: 1. Availability and accessibility of support services: Even with existing provisions in place, the demand for affordable, quality childcare may still exceed supply, leaving many families struggling to find suitable solutions. 2. Financial challenges: High costs of childcare can put a strain on family budgets, potentially making it difficult for some parents to pursue work opportunities, or even forcing them to rely on informal or substandard childcare arrangements. 3. Work-life balance: Policies promoting work-life balance may not always be enough to counteract the pressures faced by parents when trying to meet both professional and family obligations. 4. Gender inequalities: Traditional gender roles can continue to influence expectations around childcare and household responsibilities, despite provisions aimed at promoting gender equality. 5. Quality of services: Ensuring that support services meet high standards and cater to the needs of individual children plays a significant role in promoting their well-being and development. In light of these concerns, it is essential to continually examine and evaluate these provisions and policies to ensure that they effectively support families in reconciling their professional and family lives. This may involve conducting research, gathering feedback from families, and adjusting policies based on the data and best practices. By doing so, both governments and organizations can create environments that empower and support parents and children, ultimately leading to a more balanced and fulfilling life for all."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer from options.

It often serves to entertain, amuse, or enlighten someone who may not have known the fact before. Random facts can be found in various fields, such as history, nature, science, and pop culture. Here's a detailed random fact for you: The Mantis Shrimp, an extraordinary marine crustacean, has incredibly unique vision and striking capabilities. Native to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, it's not just the vibrant colors of their exoskeleton that make them stand out in the underwater world. What truly makes the Mantis Shrimp distinctive are its sophisticated eyes and powerful punch. In terms of vision, the Mantis Shrimp has one of the most advanced optical systems in the animal kingdom. Humans have three types of color-receptive cones in their eyes that allow them to perceive a wide range of colors. In contrast, the Mantis Shrimp possesses 16 different types of photoreceptor cells, 12 of which are dedicated to color vision. This means they can detect colors beyond the spectrum visible to humans, including ultraviolet and polarized light. Moreover, each of their eyes is divided into three sections, enabling them to perceive depth and distance without moving their eyes. They can also move each eye independently, allowing them to focus on multiple directions simultaneously. This extraordinary visual acuity plays a significant role in hunting prey and detecting predators. When it comes to striking capabilities, the Mantis Shrimp is no less impressive. They are classified into two categories: \\"Spearers,\\" which have spiny appendages to snatch up soft-bodied prey, and \\"Smashers,\\" which have club-like appendages to break open hard-shelled prey. The \\"Smasher\\" Mantis Shrimp, in particular, can deliver a punch with a force that's over 1,000 times its own body weight, moving at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) underwater. This swift strike can generate temperatures close to those on the sun's surface and produces cavitation bubbles that cause a shockwave, which is often enough to stun or kill their prey. In conclusion, the Mantis Shrimp's exceptional vision and striking abilities make it one of nature's most remarkable creatures. Its unique characteristics have been a source of inspiration for scientists, leading to research and innovation in various fields such as optics, materials science, and robotics. This random fact highlights the wonders of the natural world and the depth of diversity in the animal kingdom."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"There is no sense in it!\\" to Romanian?","output":"Sigur, micuțule!

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth.

Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedonia, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms.

When Infamous' driver fakes an ankle injury, Natasha becomes Infamous' driver in exchange for 300,000 and a recording contract. However, she is unaware that Infamous has to place her on his wager, as Michael - who has been obsessed with her since watching her band perform on stage earlier - has placed four platinum bars at stake. At the same time, Brecken wagers his brand-new Enzo Ferrari on Natasha. Natasha (driving a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren) takes on Jason (driving a Lamborghini Diablo). As they approach the finish line, Natasha is several car lengths ahead of Jason, but he quickly zips past her by engaging the onboard nitrous system. Unfortunately, because of the excessive speed, the Diablo loses downforce, flies off the ground and flips in mid-air before crashing upside down at the finish line. Attempting to avoid the falling Diablo, Natasha crashes on a barrier...

The Manchester City man scored the only goal in Sunday’s derby win against rivals United – meaning he now notches once every 109 minutes. It was Aguero’s 62nd in the league for City – and 10th this season – and puts him ahead of Henry, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Alan Shearer. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero has netted 62 Premier League goals in 6783 minutes in England. Sergio Aguero converts Gael Clichy's low cross from the left to put Manchester City 1-0 ahead in the derby. Aguero (second from left) is mobbed by his team-mates after giving the hosts the lead against Man United. Thierry Henry is widely-regarded as one of the best strikers to have ever graced the Premier League. Not only that, the 26-year-old is comfortably in front of every other frontman to have lit up the top flight since 1992. Henry – Arsenal’s main man for eight years – netted 175 times in 237 Premier League games. Widely-regarded as a revolutionary in the modern era, Henry’s capability of scoring 20-a-season in double-quick time put him on a pedestal as the best there had been. Even superior to Shearer, who ended his career with more, 260, but took longer in between strikes to find the net. Van Nistelrooy’s trailblazing four campaigns at Manchester United – ignoring the injury-ravaged first – garnered 95 goals at a rate of one every 128 minutes. Robin van Persie’s strike rate is healthy at 137 minutes per goal, while the year spent in England by Samuel Eto’o had proved profitable – his 12 goals coming in 1609 minutes. Manchester United skipper Wayne Rooney, on the other hand, has taken 168 minutes for each of his 176 in the Premier League. That isn’t a record to be sniffed at. It comes in at better than a goal every other game if purely using minutes. Aguero’s 109 minutes for every strike – which is half-an-hour more impressive than Luis Suarez and Edin Dzeko – makes him the most lethal marksman to have graced English football. Henry comfortably finishes past Bolton Wanderers goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen in an FA Cup tie. Aguero has a better minutes-per-goal ratio than ex-Liverpool talisman Luis Suarez (celebrating at Norwich) Alan Shearer's goals were crucial in Blackburn winning the 1995 Premier League title (Chris Sutton right) Detractors may point to the City striker’s injury record – he always struggles to get through a full campaign without tweaking something – as reason enough to suggest he can never be named No 1. But even last year, when Aguero spent two months on the sidelines, he was up there with Suarez and Daniel Sturridge. His manager Manuel Pellegrini said last December that this season’s top scorer was a better player than the Uruguayan. ‘Suarez is a very important striker, but I think Sergio participates more in the game,’ Pellegrini claimed. ‘He has always been a top player and he has always scored goals, but I think at this moment, he has added working for the team without the ball, which is also important for him.’ Shearer scored 260 Premier League goals, most marked with his trademark celebration. The bustling centre forward often notched from the penalty spot but got plenty from open play. Wayne Rooney is in the top 25 but his record is worse than the likes of Robin van Persie and Javier Hernandez. The Chilean certainly isn’t wrong – Aguero contributes so much more – but it is for his goalscoring that he will be remembered most fondly for. There was never any danger of Gael Clichy’s centre not ending up nestled beyond David de Gea at the Etihad Stadium this weekend. It is that sort of clinical finishing that sets him apart. He rarely needs more than one chance. While Aguero offers much more across the width of a pitch and in behind defenders, there are a number of players who have merely relied on their prowess in front of goal to retain a spot in the upper echelons of this all-time Premier League list. Javier Hernandez, now at Real Madrid, was renowned for doing very little in United games before a ball broke inside the opposition penalty area, while Adam Le Fondre – whose record is only topped by Henry and Aguero – has forever been an impact substitute. Ivan Klasnic's goalscoring record while at Bolton puts him among the Premier League's elite. Tony Yeboah (pictured scoring for Leeds against Liverpool in 1995) scored picture-book goals. Reading used Adam Le Fondre as a super sub - but his minutes-per-goal ratio was exemplary. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer often saved Manchester United late on in games after being called from the bench. Shearer was chief penalty taker wherever he played, while Ivan Klasnic’s 20 Bolton goals tended to come in gluts (and often from the bench) before Owen Coyle sent him packing. Unsurprisingly, both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Owen feature, although their records of a goal every 150 minutes might have been better if the pair didn’t spend so much time coming back from injuries. Derby’s Branko Strupar makes the list, but his four years at Pride Park from 1999 actually only brought about 15 goals, with Tony Yeboah’s record slightly more impressive. Of the current crop to surprise, Andre Schurrle and Wilfried Bony both make the top 25. Whether Aguero’s record can be beaten remains to be seen, but it looks doubtful. Highlights:","output":"Sergio Aguero, a Manchester City soccer player, might become the best striker in the Premier League because he scores goals very quickly! He scores a goal every 109 minutes, which is faster than some other famous players like Thierry Henry and Alan Shearer. People remember Aguero for being really good at scoring goals and helping his team win games. Some people think he might not be the best, because he sometimes gets hurt and can't play the whole season, but he always comes back and keeps scoring goals quickly."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"A child having an imaginary friend in itself isn't cause for worry.\\" to Spanish.","output":"Un niño que tenga un amigo imaginario no es motivo de preocupación.

The sentence mentions \\"two young men\\" - this informs us that there are two individuals involved, and they are both male. This statement does not specifically mention anything about their intentions or goals. 2. The sentence states that they are distributing \\"Obama condoms\\" - this implies that they are giving out condoms with some association to Obama, likely the former US President Barack Obama. However, it doesn't establish a clear connection between this act and attempting to get votes. Based on the information given, we cannot definitively conclude that \\"Men are trying to get votes\\" from this sentence. While it might imply some political association because of the mention of \\"Obama\\", there is not enough information to directly link their actions to an intent to get votes.

The cake was more or less dense? The answer to this question is:","output":"The answer to this question is that the cake was less dense. To better understand why the cake was less dense, let's first analyze the information provided in the question and explore the concepts of density and heaviness (mass) of substances. Density is defined as the mass per unit volume of a substance. The formula for density is: Density = Mass / Volume When comparing two substances of the same volume, the one with a higher mass (the heavier substance) will have a greater density. The passage states, \\"A given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume of a less dense substance.\\" Now, let's examine the scenario involving Henry's pieces of cake and butter. Both items have the same volume, but the piece of cake is lighter (has a lower mass) than the piece of butter. Using the concept of density, we can deduce that since the mass of the cake is lower than the mass of the butter for the same volume, the density of the cake must also be lower compared to butter's density. Therefore, the cake is less dense than the butter."},{"instruction":"Premise: In 1996, the last year for which country statistics are available, 10,353 H-2A workers came from Mexico while only 4,231 came from the second leading country, Jamaica.

When used without qualification it refers to the best-selling or most frequently broadcast popular music. The term is derived from record music charts, a few of which traditionally consist of a total of 40 songs. Top 40 is also an alternative term for the radio format of such music, also known as Contemporary hit radio. - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. - David Louis \\"Dave\\" Bartholomew (born December 24, 1918) is an American musician, bandleader, composer, arranger and record producer, prominent in the music of New Orleans throughout the second half of the 20th century. Originally a trumpeter, he has been active in many musical genres, including rhythm and blues, big band, swing music, rock and roll, New Orleans jazz and Dixieland. He has been cited by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a key figure in the transition from jump blues and swing to R&B and as \\"one of the Crescent Citys greatest musicians and a true pioneer in the rock and roll revolution.\\" - Swing music, or simply swing, is a form of American music that dominated in the 1930s and 1940s. Swing uses a strong rhythm section of double bass and drums as the anchor for a lead section of brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones, woodwinds including saxophone and clarinets, and sometimes stringed instruments such as violin and guitar, medium to fast tempos, and a \\"lilting\\" swing time rhythm. The name swing came from the 'swing feel' where the emphasis is on the offbeat or weaker pulse in the music. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement. The danceable swing style of big bands and bandleaders such as Benny Goodman was the dominant form of American popular music from 1935 to 1946, a period known as the swing era. The verb \\"to swing\\" is also used as a term of praise for playing that has a strong groove or drive. Notable musicians of the swing era include Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Count Basie, Woody Herman, and Artie Shaw. - A big band is a type of musical ensemble associated with playing jazz music and which became popular during the Swing Era from the early 1930s until the late 1940s.

The terms jazz band, jazz ensemble, stage band, jazz orchestra, and dance band are also used to refer to this type of ensemble. This does not, however, mean that each one of these names is technically correct for naming a \\"big band\\" specifically. - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary.

The song was featured in The Blues Brothers movie , during the scene in which the orphanage kids help spread the word of the band 's revival concert . - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Jump blues is an up-tempo style of blues, usually played by small groups and featuring saxophone or brass instruments. It was popular in the 1940s and was a precursor of rhythm and blues and rock and roll. Appreciation of jump blues was renewed in the 1990s as part of the swing revival. - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States.

Possible answers: * no. * yes.","output":"No, these two statements do not mean the same thing, and they indicate different origins and influences on dumplings within these two different cultures. The first sentence, \\"Indonesian dumplings were influenced and brought to Indonesia by Chinese immigrants,\\" implies that dumplings originally existed in China. Chinese immigrants then brought this dumpling concept to Indonesia, which suggests that the Indonesian dumplings have Chinese roots. The dumplings' characteristics in Indonesia might have been adapted and changed based on the local cuisine and preferences, but their essential idea, that is, stuffing wrapped in dough, came from China. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Chinese dumplings were influenced and brought by Indonesian immigrants to Indonesia,\\" indicates a completely different scenario. This sentence suggests that dumplings originally came from Indonesia and were brought to China by Indonesian immigrants. This implies that the Chinese dumplings were influenced or evolved from these original Indonesian dumplings, not the other way around. Therefore, while both sentences talk about the influence and transference of dumpling culture, they attribute the origin of this cuisine to different countries. This influences the nature of the dumplings in each country, including their shape, fillings, cooking methods, and serving methods, all of which reflect different historical and cultural ties. This makes the respective dumplings in each country unique and inherent to their own culinary tradition, despite having ties to each other due to migration and cultural exchange."},{"instruction":"Q:What was the last name of Emilius Bangert teacher? Answer the above question based on the context below: From 1916, Nielsen taught at the Royal Academy where he became director in 1931, shortly before his death. He also had private students in his earlier days in order to supplement his income. As a result of his teaching, Nielsen has exerted considerable influence on classical music in Denmark. Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, Harald Agersnap, both a conductor and orchestral composer, and Jørgen Bentzon who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (Københavns Folkemusikskole). Among his other students were the musicologist Knud Jeppesen, the pianist Herman Koppel, the academy professor and symphony composer Poul Schierbeck, the organist Emilius Bangert who played at Roskilde Cathedral, and Nancy Dalberg, one of Nielsen's private students who helped with the orchestration of Aladdin. Nielsen also instructed the conductor and choirmaster Mogens Wöldike, remembered for his interpretations of Baroque music, and Rudolph Simonsen, the pianist and composer who became director of the Academy after Nielsen's death.The Carl Nielsen Society maintains a listing of performances of Nielsen's works, classified by region (Denmark, Scandinavia, Europe apart from Scandinavia and outside Europe) which demonstrates that his music is regularly performed throughout the world. The concerti and symphonies feature frequently in these listings. The Carl Nielsen International Competition commenced in the 1970s under the auspices of the Odense Symphony Orchestra. A four-yearly violin competition has been held there since 1980. Flute and clarinet competitions were later added, but these have now been discontinued. An international Organ Competition, founded by the city of Odense, became associated with the Nielsen competition in 2009, but from 2015 will be organized separately, based in Odense Cathedral. A:","output":"The last name of Emilius Bangert's teacher was Nielsen. In the context provided, it is mentioned that Emilius Bangert was a student of composer Carl Nielsen, who taught at the Royal Academy and had private students as well.

Born in Cherryvale, Kansas, Louise Brooks was the daughter of Leonard Porter Brooks, a lawyer, who was usually too busy with his practice to discipline his children, and Myra Rude, an artistic mother who determined that any \\"squalling brats she produced could take care of themselves\\". Rude was a talented pianist who played the latest Debussy and Ravel for her children, inspiring them with a love of books and music. When she was nine years old, a neighborhood predator sexually abused Louise. This event had a major influence on Brooks' life and career, causing her to say in later years that she was incapable of real love, and that this man \\"must have had a great deal to do with forming my attitude toward sexual pleasure.... Brooks made her screen debut in the silent The Street of Forgotten Men, in an uncredited role in 1925. Soon, however, she was playing the female lead in a number of silent light comedies and flapper films over the next few years, starring with Adolphe Menjou and W. C. Fields, among others. She was noticed in Europe for her pivotal vamp role in the Howard Hawks directed silent \\"buddy film\\", A Girl in Every Port in 1928. In an early sound film drama, Beggars of Life (1928), Brooks played an abused country girl who kills her foster father in a moment of desperation. A hobo, Richard Arlen, happens on the murder scene and convinces Brooks to disguise herself as a young boy and escape the law by \\"riding the rails\\" with him. In a hobo encampment, or \\"jungle,\\" they meet another hobo, Wallace Beery. Brooks's disguise is soon uncovered and she finds herself the only female in a world of brutal, sex-hungry men. Much of this film was shot on location, and the boom microphone was invented for this film by the director William Wellman, who needed it for one of the first experimental talking scenes in the movies. By this time in her life, she was mixing with the rich and famous, and was a regular guest of William Randolph Hearst and his mistress, Marion Davies, at San Simeon, being close friends with Davies' niece, Pepi Lederer. Her distinctive bob haircut helped start a trend; many women styled their hair in imitation of her and fellow film star Colleen Moore. Soon after the film Beggars Of Life was made, Brooks, who loathed the Hollywood \\"scene\\", refused to stay on at Paramount after being denied a promised raise, and left for Europe to make films for G. W. Pabst, the prominent Austrian Expressionist director. Paramount attempted to use the coming of sound films to pressure the actress, but she called the studio's bluff. It was not until 30 years later that this rebellious move would come to be seen as arguably the most savvy of her career, securing her immortality as a silent film legend and independent spirit. Unfortunately, while her initial snubbing of Paramount alone would not have finished her in Hollywood altogether, her refusal after returning from Germany to come back to Paramount for sound retakes of The Canary Murder Case (1929) irrevocably placed her on an unofficial blacklist. Actress Margaret Livingston was hired to dub Brooks's voice for the film, as the studio claimed that Brooks' voice was unsuitable for sound pictures.

Among the factors that we need to consider is the ratio between renter-occupied units and owner-occupied units. An examination of these numbers provides insights into various aspects of the housing market, such as affordability, mobility, and lifestyle preferences. This article will provide a detailed analysis of the number of units occupied by renters compared to those occupied by owners. Step 1: Gather Data from Reliable Sources To ascertain the number of units occupied by renters and homeowners, it's crucial to gather data from credible sources. One such reliable source is the U.S. Census Bureau, which provides housing data through the American Community Survey (ACS). By using their most recent numbers, we can ensure that our analysis is as accurate and up-to-date as possible. Step 2: Identify the Data on Renter-Occupied and Owner-Occupied Units The ACS provides data on housing units in the United States, including the numbers for renter-occupied and owner-occupied units. By searching through the data tables, we can locate the relevant statistics and extract them for our analysis. Step 3: Calculate the Difference between Renter-Occupied and Owner-Occupied Units Once we have the data on both renter-occupied and owner-occupied units, we can calculate the difference in the number of units occupied by renters compared to owners. To do this, we simply subtract the total number of owner-occupied units from the total number of renter-occupied units. Step 4: Evaluate the Differences and Its Implications After obtaining the difference in the number of renter-occupied and owner-occupied units, it's important to consider what this information signifies in terms of current housing trends. For example, a higher number of renter-occupied units may indicate a less affordable housing market or a preference for the flexibility of renting. Results Based on the latest available data from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey, there were approximately 43,848,000 renter-occupied housing units and 77,647,000 owner-occupied housing units. To determine the difference between the two, we subtract the number of owner-occupied units from the number of renter-occupied units: 43,848,000 (renter-occupied) - 77,647,000 (owner-occupied) = -33,799,000 Conclusion From our analysis of the data, we can conclude that there were approximately 33,799,000 more units occupied by owners than by renters. This difference highlights the continuing importance of homeownership in the United States. However, it's essential to monitor these trends over time, as shifts in the housing market can occur rapidly, impacting renter and owner-occupied unit ratios. In the broader context of current housing trends, it's crucial for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and individuals to examine the factors contributing to the differences between renter-occupied and owner-occupied units. By understanding the complex factors at play, we can provide better solutions to the ever-changing landscape of the housing market."},{"instruction":"If \\"Women selling grains at a market.\\" does that mean that \\"Women are at the market.\\"?

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - use of water - drowning - rash - wet skin - dry skin A:","output":"The most common but not long-lasting side effect of having a bath is wet skin. When taking a bath, a person submerges themselves in water, typically in a bathtub, to clean their body and relax. As a result of this submersion, their skin becomes wet. Wet skin is a natural and expected outcome of taking a bath, as the water comes into contact with the surface of the skin. The other options have different implications: - Use of water: While this is a fundamental aspect of taking a bath, it is not a side effect. Using water, often combined with soap or other bathing products, is the primary means of cleaning oneself during a bath. - Drowning: This is a rare and dangerous risk associated with bathing, especially for children and vulnerable individuals, but it is not a common side effect. Proper supervision, safety precautions, and common sense should always be employed when bathing to avoid such risks. - Rash: While skin rashes or irritation can occur during or after a bath, this is not the most common side effect. Rashes may develop due to an allergic reaction to a particular bath product or soap, sensitivity to hot water, or as a result of other underlying skin conditions that may be aggravated by bathing. - Dry skin: After a bath, the skin may feel dry due to the removal of natural oils produced by the body. Continued submersion in water, especially hot water, can strip away these oils, leading to dryness and tightness. However, this side effect is not as common and can be mitigated by moisturizing the skin after a bath. Therefore, wet skin remains the most common and expected but not long-lasting side effect of having a bath, as the skin will naturally dry off as the excess water evaporates or is removed by patting dry with a towel."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

However, let's analyze each of the options you provided: 1. Shopping Bag: This is not a suitable place for long-term storage, as shopping bags can easily be discarded or damaged over time. 2. Hardware Store: This is a place where tin may be temporarily stored and sold. However, items in a hardware store will eventually be sold or removed if they remain unsold for an extended period. 3. Landfill: Landfills are places where waste items are disposed of, and tin might end up there if it's discarded. However, tin is a valuable and recyclable material, so it's in our best interest to recycle and repurpose it whenever possible. While tin could remain in a landfill for a long time, it's not an ideal solution for its storage. 4. Junk Yard: Similar to landfills, junk yards are places where discarded items are collected. While tin could remain in a junkyard for a long period, it may eventually be removed and recycled, given its value. 5. Antique Store: An antique store could be a place where tin items are stored for an extended time, especially if the items are valuable or of historical significance. It's important to note that items in antique stores are intended for sale, so they may not remain in the store forever. In general, it's important to keep in mind that nothing is truly permanent.

Among these, the emergence of online pharmacies has brought with it the promise of easier access to affordable medications. However, it has also opened the door to numerous unscrupulous web-based pharmacies that threaten the well-being of consumers. In response, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has intensified its efforts to crack down on these rogue online pharmacies. The Rise of Robust Regulatory Measures The FTC has been taking robust regulatory measures to safeguard the interest of consumers and ensure they are not deceived by these fraudulent online pharmacies. These include the deployment of advanced technologies to monitor and identify illegitimate websites, cross-border collaborations to combat illegal online drug sales, and regular liaison with other government agencies to make sure the enforcement of laws is carried out smoothly. Operation Pangea, an international effort spearheaded by the FTC, exemplifies a concerted effort to crack down on rogue internet pharmacies. In collaboration with other national and international partners, the FTC has successfully taken down hundreds of websites involved in the illicit sale of counterfeit medications. Identifying the Telltale Signs of Web Pharmacy Fraud Rogue web pharmacies employ various tactics to deceive consumers, including offering prescription drugs at prices well below the market rate, dispensing medications without a prescription, and selling counterfeit or substandard medications. These fraudulent practices pose a significant threat to public health and well-being, as they may lead to misdiagnosis, mistreatment, drug resistance, and even life-threatening conditions for unsuspecting patients. To ensure the safety of consumers, the FTC has published guidelines that help in identifying the telltale signs of web pharmacy fraud. These include: 1. Lack of License: Reputable pharmacies must hold a valid license from the appropriate state board of pharmacy. Many rogue pharmacies operate without this credential, failing to adhere to the required standards of quality and care. 2. No Physical Address: Genuine pharmacies usually provide their physical address on their website. Illegitimate web pharmacies frequently omit this detail or use a fake address to avoid detection. 3. Absence of Pharmacists: Trustworthy pharmacies employ registered pharmacists to answer queries and ensure the safe delivery of medications. Rogue pharmacies typically lack such professional oversight. 4. Insecure Transactions: Legitimate pharmacies use secure websites and encrypted transactions to protect consumers' personal and financial information. Fraudulent pharmacies may fail to offer these safeguards, putting customers at risk of identity theft and financial fraud. 5. Unverified Medications: Reputable pharmacies source their medications from established suppliers and verify them through the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy's (NABP) Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites program. Rogue pharmacies often bypass these safety measures, risking patient health and allowing the circulation of counterfeit drugs. Protecting Yourself and Your Loved Ones In light of this ongoing battle against illegitimate online pharmacies, it is critical for consumers to take precautions when purchasing medications on the internet. The following steps can help ensure a safe experience: 1. Verify the Pharmacy: Check whether the online pharmacy is licensed with your state board of pharmacy or the NABP's Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites program. 2. Consult a Doctor: Never purchase prescription medications without first speaking to a healthcare professional, as self-diagnosing can lead to mistreatment and exacerbate underlying health issues. 3. Avoid \\"Too Good to Be True\\" Offers: Steer clear of pharmacies offering extremely low prices or drugs without a prescription. If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Conclusion The FTC's ongoing efforts to crack down on rogue web pharmacies seek to increase consumer awareness and safety. By educating the public and working in collaboration with national and international partners, the FTC aims to eliminate the nefarious practices of these unscrupulous online businesses, ultimately protecting the health and well-being of internet users worldwide. As consumers, it is essential to remain vigilant and take personal responsibility for safeguarding our health by adhering to the guidelines provided and staying informed about the risks associated with online pharmacies."},{"instruction":"Comment dès lors expliquer que l'on continue de voir certains de ces projets de résolution être mis aux voix? Could you please translate this to English?","output":"How can we then explain that we continue to see some of these resolution projects being put to vote? The question, translated from French to English, raises the concern regarding the continuous presence of certain resolution projects being put to a vote. The reasons behind this might vary depending on the context, but some possible explanations are as follows: 1. Shift in priorities or perspectives: As time passes, various political, economic, or social changes may lead to a shift in priorities or perspectives among decision-makers. Consequently, previously rejected or stalled resolution projects might gain prominence once again, leading to them being put forward for a vote. 2. Lobbying and interest groups: Different interest groups, industries, or other entities may lobby to have their preferred resolution projects put to a vote. Vested interests could play a significant role in pushing certain proposals to the forefront, despite possible opposition or controversies associated with them. 3. Persistence of an issue or problem: Certain issues or problems may persist over time, necessitating the reconsideration of resolution projects previously discussed or voted upon. As long as an issue remains relevant or unresolved, the corresponding resolution projects may continue to circulate and be put up for a vote. 4. Changes in leadership or government: With the election of new representatives or changes in government leadership, there might be varying perspectives on previously considered resolution projects. These changes may lead to a renewed push for certain resolutions, ultimately resulting in them being reconsidered and subjected to a vote. 5. Revisions or amendments: Resolution projects may undergo revisions or amendments based on feedback, debates, or new information. These changes could make a previously rejected or controversial proposal more appealing to decision-makers, thereby leading to the project being put to a vote again. 6. Negotiations and compromises: In order to reach a consensus or appease different stakeholders, some resolution projects may be put to a vote as part of negotiations or compromises. While a specific proposal may not have gained widespread support initially, the voting process could present an opportunity for various parties to discuss and agree upon a mutually beneficial solution. In conclusion, although certain resolution projects continue to be put to a vote, the reasons behind this phenomenon may vary significantly depending on the specific circumstances and context. Factors such as shifts in priorities, lobbying efforts, persistence of issues, changes in leadership, revisions, and negotiations are all potential explanations for why some resolution projects remain in contention and are subjected to voting."},{"instruction":"Here is a premise: Do you want to lie on beaches or hike in mountains? Here is a hypothesis: It's impossible to actually lie on the beaches. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To answer this question, let's break down the given premise and hypothesis step-by-step: Step 1: Understanding the premise Premise: Do you want to lie on beaches or hike in mountains? This premise presents two alternative choices, one is lying on beaches, and the other is hiking in mountains. Step 2: Understanding the hypothesis Hypothesis: It's impossible to actually lie on the beaches. The hypothesis suggests that it is not possible to lie on the beaches. Step 3: Analyzing the relationship between the premise and hypothesis Now we should determine if there's a relationship between the premise and hypothesis that allows us to infer a conclusion. The premise provides two possible choices, while the hypothesis claims that one of those choices (lying on beaches) is impossible. Step 4: Making a conclusion Based on the premise, which provides two alternative choices, it is not possible to conclude that the hypothesis is true. The premise does not provide any evidence that lying on beaches is impossible; it simply offers it as one of two choices.

Context: A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. However, there are an estimated 59.5 million forcibly displaced persons around the world, according to United Nation's Global Trends report.

'' \`\` i would not say that i am","output":"rattled, but it is true that I have a personal connection to the school in question. My eldest child, Sophie, attends Durand. As a parent, I understand the concern and apprehension you might feel in this situation. But let's get to the heart of your initial question: \\"Will he listen to someone at my level? Will he understand what I am saying?\\" I believe these concerns stem from a fear of not being heard or understood by someone in a position of authority or influence. This is a common experience, and it's essential to acknowledge and address these feelings. To determine if someone will listen to you and understand your perspective, there are a few factors to consider: 1. Communication style: This plays a critical role in ensuring that your message is heard and understood. Make an effort to present your viewpoint clearly, concisely, and confidently. When emotions are high, it's easy to lose sight of this important aspect. Keep in mind that the person you are addressing might have a different communication style, so be patient and adaptable. It is essential to tailor your message to their understanding, without losing the essence of what you are saying. 2. Past experiences: Reflect on your prior interactions with this individual. Do they generally listen to others? Are they receptive to new ideas and perspectives, even if they don't agree with them? Past behavior can serve as a useful indicator of future behavior, so keep this in mind when preparing your conversation. 3. Mutual respect: Mutual respect is a crucial element in any communication. If the person you're addressing respects you and your perspective, they are more likely to listen attentively and make a genuine effort to understand your viewpoint. Show respect by being attentive, making eye contact, and validating their feelings and opinions, even if you don't agree with them. 4. Emotional intelligence: Emotionally intelligent people are more capable of understanding and empathizing with others' feelings and viewpoints. If the person you're addressing has a strong sense of emotional intelligence, they will likely listen and understand you, even if they may not agree with your perspective. 5. Different backgrounds: Recognize that people come from various backgrounds that can shape their worldviews and perspectives. This diversity can sometimes create communication barriers. However, stressing the importance of open-mindedness and a willingness to learn from each other can help cultivate a more inclusive environment in which everyone can be heard. In conclusion, while it is not guaranteed that the individual in question will listen to you or understand your perspective, keeping these factors in mind can help you foster more effective communication. Present your thoughts clearly and confidently, pay attention to past experiences, ensure mutual respect, focus on emotional intelligence, and acknowledge the influence of diverse backgrounds. Remember that every conversation is an opportunity for growth, and sometimes, even if we feel unheard, our message may still have an impact."},{"instruction":"Question: Question: Doctors gave sedative to the patient complaining of pain, what did he say afterwards?

He was born in Tibet, a beautiful place with tall mountains and kind people. Lobsang was a monk, which means he spent his life praying, meditating, and helping people be good and kind. Monks shave their heads, wear simple clothes, and live a simple life. His full name was the 5th Dalai Lama Lobsang Gyatso because he was the fifth person to hold the title \\"Dalai Lama.\\" People thought of him as both a wonderful teacher and a leader. Sadly, Lobsang Gyatso passed away in 1682. Just like everyone, he got old, and his body got tired. But there is something interesting about when people found out about his passing. The leaders in Tibet kept his passing a secret for a long time because they wanted to make sure everything was ready for the next leader. They were afraid if people knew about Lobsang Gyatso's passing, there might be trouble or confusion. So for 15 whole years, the leaders of Tibet kept this secret. Fifteen years is a very long time - it's like celebrating your birthday 15 times! Finally, in the year 1697, everyone learned that Lobsang Gyatso had passed away and that the leaders of Tibet had kept it a secret. The people were sad and surprised, but they understood that their leaders had good reasons for keeping the secret. That was the story of Lobsang Gyatso and the year people found out that he had passed away.

My question: The most notorious hired killer?","output":"The movie plot you've shared follows the story of a fictional character, Leon Maria Lozano, who becomes a notorious hired killer within the context of the movie. However, the plot is inspired by real-life events during a period known as \\"El Bogotazo\\" (April, 1948), where Colombian Liberal leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán was assassinated. This event marked the beginning of \\"La Violencia,\\" a period of political violence and unrest in Colombia from 1948 to 1958. Although Leon Maria Lozano is a fictional character and not a real person, it is important to note that he represents the type of hired killers and the violence that was prevalent during this period. In reality, numerous vicious killers operated during \\"La Violencia,\\" and their crimes escalated the conflict between the Colombian Conservative and Liberal parties. In summary, Leon Maria Lozano is a fictional notorious hired killer in the plot of \\"A Man of Principle.\\" He is not an actual person but represents the extreme violence that occurred during \\"La Violencia\\" in Colombia."},{"instruction":"Article: Half of the world's population is affected by Asian monsoons , but monsoons are difficult to predict. American researchers have put together a 700-year record of the rainy seasons, which is expected to provide guidance for experts making weather predictions. Every year, damp air masses,known as monsoon,produce large amounts of rainfall in India, East Asia, Northern Australia and East Africa. All this wet air is pulled in by a high pressure area over the Indian Ocean and a low pressure area to the south. According to Edward Cook , a weather expert at Columbia University in New York., the complex nature of the climate systems across Asia makes monsoons hard to predict. In addition, climate records for the area are too recent and not detailed enough to be of much use. Therefore, he and a team of researchers spent more than fifteen years traveling across Asia, looking for trees old enough to provide long-term records. They measured the rings, or circles, inside thousands of ancient trees in more than 300 places. Rainfall has a direct link to the growth and width of rings on some kinds of trees. The researchers developed a document they are calling a Monsoon Asia Drought Atlas. It shows the effect of monsoons over seven centuries, beginning in the 1300s. Professor Cook says the tree-ring records show periods of wet and dry weather. \\"If the monsoon basically fails or is a very weak one, the trees affected by monsoons at that location might put on a very narrow ring. But if the monsoon is very strong, the trees affected by that monsoon might put on a wide ring for that year. So, the wide and narrow ring widths of the chronology that we developed in Asia provide us with a measure of monsoon variability.\\" With all this information, researchers say they can begin to improve computer climate models for predicting the behavior of monsoons. \\"There has been widespread famine and starvation and human dying in the past in large droughts. And on the other hand, if the monsoon is particularly heavy, it can cause extensive... Question: It is difficult for experts to predict Asian monsoons because _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"they are formed under complex climate systems.\\"? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, \\"they are formed under complex climate systems.\\""},{"instruction":"What is a shorter version of this: mike huckabee bowed to reality and out of the republican presidential race . Summary:","output":"Mike Huckabee has acknowledged the reality of the political landscape and decided to withdraw from the Republican presidential race. This decision comes after assessing the odds of success and determining that continuing in the race may not be in his or the party's best interest. Huckabee's withdrawal reflects his evaluation of factors such as the strength of opponent candidates, received endorsements, and his performance in polls and primaries. It also signals the importance of focusing on a united front within the Republican Party, aiming to secure a candidate who can compete effectively in the general election. Throughout his campaign, Huckabee has contributed to the political discourse by addressing key issues such as economic, social, and foreign policies. Although he is no longer an active candidate, his ideas and perspectives will continue to shape the debate moving forward. Undoubtedly, Huckabee's supporters will be watching closely to see which candidate he endorses, as his opinion and influence within the party remain significant. As the campaign continues to evolve, the remaining Republican candidates must now incorporate the political reality of Huckabee's exit into their strategies. This could lead to shifts in campaign messaging, debate tactics, and outreach efforts, as candidates vie to capture his supporters and demonstrate that they are the best choice for the Republican nomination."},{"instruction":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

Although the Silk Road from China to Europe and the Western World was initially formulated during the reign of Emperor Wu (141–87 BC) during the Han, it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when Hou Junji (d. 643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade. The Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over its western lands, as the Tibetan Empire largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.Despite the many expatriate European travelers coming into China to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks and missionaries, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions. The Silk Road also affected Tang dynasty art. Horses became a significant symbol of prosperity and power as well as an instrument of military and diplomatic policy. Horses were also revered as a relative of the dragon. Answer:","output":"The person that recorded travelers being assaulted by bandits on the road is Xuanzang."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: This article: The MAUD Committee reports urged the co-operation with the United States should be continued in the research of nuclear fission. Charles C. Lauritsen, a Caltech physicist working at the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), was in London during this time and was invited to sit in on a MAUD meeting. The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once he returned to the United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.In August 1941, Mark Oliphant, the director of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and an original member of the MAUD Committee, was sent to the US to assist the NDRC on radar. During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.Oliphant took the initiative himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent ground breaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed. Oliphant also travelled to Berkley to meet with Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron. After Oliphant informed Lawrence of his report on uranium, Lawrence met with NDRC chairman James Bryant Conant, George B. Pegram, and Arthur Compton to relay the details which Oliphant had directed to Lawrence. Oliphant was not only able to get in touch with Lawrence, but he met with Conant and Bush to inform them of the significant data the MAUD had discovered.

Some organizations and political parties find this practice controversial but mainstream Swiss opinion is in favour of the system. Compulsory military service concerns all male Swiss citizens; women can serve voluntarily. Men usually receive military conscription orders for training at the age of 18. About two thirds of the young Swiss are found suited for service; for those found unsuited, various forms of alternative service exist. Annually, approximately 20,000 persons are trained in recruit centres for a duration from 18 to 21 weeks. The reform \\"Army XXI\\" was adopted by popular vote in 2003, it replaced the previous model \\"Army 95\\", reducing the effectives from 400,000 to about 200,000.

To use a money clip, follow these simple steps: 1. Gather all your money (bills) and any cards, like your ID or credit cards, that you want to carry with you. 2. Put the money together by arranging the bills from largest (like a 20 bill) on the bottom to the smallest (like a 1 bill) on the top. This will make it easier to see and find the right money when you need it. 3. Fold your money in half, so it becomes smaller and easier to fit in the money clip. 4. Place any cards you want to carry on top of the folded money. You can keep them together or organize them in a way that works best for you, like putting the most used card on top. 5. Open the money clip by gently pulling the two sides apart and then slide your money and cards between the sides, making sure they are snug and secure.

Washington (CNN) -- When President Obama threw out the first pitch at the Washington Nationals' season opener on Monday, he kicked off not only a new baseball season but also a new round of fundraisers at Nationals Park. Though Obama wasn't raising any cash himself on game day, his appearance was the backdrop for at least one ballpark fundraiser Monday, the first of what Nationals President Stan Kasten hopes will be many political events held at the stadium this season. Since Nationals Park first opened in March 2008, Kasten has actively encouraged political operatives of all ideological stripes to hold their fundraisers and receptions at the ballpark, as opposed to more conventional venues such as restaurants or hotel ballrooms. Although holding fundraisers at baseball games is not new, the","output":"reemergence of it has sparked some controversy. Critics argue that the blending of sports and politics might potentially taint the perceived neutrality of the game. But supporters counterargue that these events systematize opportunities for bipartisan conversations to occur at a local societal level, thus promoting a more engaged democracy. Furthermore, they provide an alternative casual and relaxed environment that could foster more candid and productive discussions compared to traditional venues. The future of political fundraisers at baseball festivals, therefore, remains uncertain as these debates continue. Here, I'm giving a logical continuation to the passage. I introduced two perspectives, one considering the blending of sports and politics as problematic and the other viewing it as an alternative method to stimulate constructive political conversations. The last sentence indicates that this issue is ongoing and the outcome is uncertain, completing the passage in a way that leaves room for future discussions and developments."},{"instruction":"Question: Information: - Jarnac is a commune in the Charente department in southwestern France. - Rugby union, or simply rugby, is a contact team sport which originated in England in the first half of the 19th century.

Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party.

The MT Aris 13 was travelling from Djibouti to Mogadishu on 13 March when, instead of giving the Somali coast a wide berth as advised, it took a short cut between the tip of the Horn of Africa and the Yemeni island of Socotra. Somali pirates then ambushed the vessel just 11 miles (17km) from shore with two fast speedboats, known as skiffs, while aiming their weapons at the crew. The vessel and its crew of eight Sri Lankan seafarers have now been seized by the pirates and are being held pending either ransom negotiations or a rescue attempt by the regional Puntland authorities. This brings to 16 the number of seafarers currently being held by Somalia-based pirates, the remaining eight being Iranians. \\"For a vessel passing that close to the coast of Somalia without armed guards shows a level of complacency,\\" said a spokesman for Neptune Maritime Security, which is currently running armed protection teams on around 70 vessels this month as they pass through the area of the western Indian Ocean known as the High Risk Area (HRA). Employing armed teams, usually former servicemen, is seen by many shipping companies as prohibitively expensive. Shipping industry analysts say many vessels, especially those with a high freeboard (the vertical distance between the surface of the sea and the deck) have simply been speeding up to avoid capture. This is part of what is known as Best Management Practice, or BMP4. Although pirates have, in the past, been incredibly adept at scaling the sides of big ocean-going vessels while in motion, this becomes very hard to do at speeds of 15 knots or more, especially if the captain takes evasive action, creating an unpredictable bow wave that can sink the pirates' skiffs. In recent years the European Union and other nations, including China, have mounted naval patrols to deter Somali piracy and escort convoys along the coast of Yemen. But the area is so vast that their ships were rarely able to reach a vessel in distress in time. Once pirates were onboard it became a hostage situation which most naval vessels' rules of engagement prevented them from getting involved in. \\"The navies' presence is good,\\" says John Steed from the seafarers' welfare group Oceans Beyond Piracy, \\"but the primary factor in deterring Somali piracy has been the presence of armed guards onboard, along with best practice like speeding up,\\" he added. The ship that was captured on Monday had a low freeboard and was travelling so slowly that it was, he says \\"almost a sitting duck\\". So will this latest hijacking be a wake-up call that prompts more precautions being taken at sea or will it signal the start of a new wave of piracy? Worryingly, the factors that drove many Somali coastal fishermen to become pirates nearly a decade ago are still there. Somalia is currently in the grip of a famine and poverty is widespread; there are few employment options for young people. There is massive and growing local resentment at the poaching of fish stocks off the coast by Asian trawlers. According to Oceans Beyond Piracy, some foreign vessels have \\"dubious\\" licences issued by officials in Puntland, but the local people never get to see any benefit from them. The high point in Somali piracy came in 2010, both in terms of vessels hijacked and the number of seafarers taken prisoner for ransom. Soon after that, shipping companies began placing armed guards onboard who would \\"show weapons\\" to circling pirates and if necessary fire warning shots to ward them off. This effectively broke the pirates' business model as, until then, they had been able to approach a ship, often at dawn after a night of chewing the narcotic qat leaf, open fire on the bridge to scare the captain into slowing down and stopping, and then they would board it using ladders. They would then hold the vessel, its crew and its cargo for ransoms of millions of dollars. After 2010 they were no longer able to do this with impunity. But now that news will have spread that many vessels are not carrying that armed protection there are concerns that the lucrative business of Somali maritime piracy may be set to return. What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses the hijacking of the MT Aris 13, a commercial vessel, by Somali pirates in 2017, which marked the first successful hijacking in the region since 2012.

The article examines the reasons behind the hijacking, including the vessel's decision to take a shortcut and the lack of armed guards on board. It also explores the factors that have driven piracy in the region, such as widespread poverty, unemployment, and local resentment over the poaching of fish stocks by foreign trawlers. The article questions whether the incident will serve as a wake-up call for shipping companies to be more cautious or if it will signal the start of a new wave of piracy in the region."},{"instruction":"Sentence: The tomato belongs to the genus Solanum and the Solanaceae plant family.

Rachmaninoff's choral symphony The Bells reflected the four-part progression from youth to marriage, maturity, and death in Poe's poem. Britten reversed the pattern for his Spring Symphony—the four sections of the symphony represent, in its composer's words, \\"the progress of Winter to Spring and the reawakening of the earth and life which that means.... It is in the traditional four movement shape of a symphony, but with the movements divided into shorter sections bound together by a similar mood or point of view.\\"The gestation of Shostakovich's Thirteenth Symphony, Babi Yar, was only slightly less straightforward. He set the poem Babi Yar by Yevgeny Yevtushenko almost immediately upon reading it, initially considering it a single-movement composition. Discovering three other Yevtushenko poems in the poet's collection Vzmakh ruki (A Wave of the Hand) prompted him to proceed to a full-length choral symphony, with \\"A Career\\" as the closing movement. Musicologist Francis Maes comments that Shostakovich did so by complementing Babi Yar's theme of Jewish suffering with Yevtushenko's verses about other Soviet abuses: \\"'At the Store' is a tribute to the women who have to stand in line for hours to buy the most basic foods,... 'Fears' evokes the terror under Stalin. 'A Career' is an attack on bureaucrats and a tribute to genuine creativity\\". Music historian Boris Schwarz adds that the poems, in the order Shostakovich places them, form a strongly dramatic opening movement, a scherzo, two slow movements and a finale.In other cases, the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures. Havergal Brian allowed the form of his Fourth Symphony, subtitled \\"Das Siegeslied\\" (Psalm of Victory), to be dictated by the three-part structure of his text, Psalm 68; the setting of Verses 13–18 for soprano solo and orchestra forms a quiet interlude between two wilder, highly chromatic martial ones set for massive choral and orchestral forces. Likewise, Szymanowski allowed the text by 13th-century Persian poet Rumi...

No, the statement \\"A cowboy is riding a horse whilst spinning a lasso around\\" does not mean the cowboy is playing tennis. The situation described in the statement portrays a traditional scene of a cowboy on horseback while using a lasso, which is a rope with a loop used in various activities such as capturing animals, ranching, and rodeo events. The cowboy's action of spinning the lasso has no direct connection to the game of tennis. Tennis is a sport played with rackets and a small, hollow, rubber ball called a tennis ball. Players, either individually or in teams of two, strike the ball back and forth over a net. The objective of the game is to hit the ball in such a way that the opponent cannot return it within the bounds of the court. This sport is typically played indoors or outdoors on a variety of court surfaces such as grass, clay, or hardcourt. The game has specific rules and well-delineated boundaries and is different from a cowboy spinning a lasso on horseback. In conclusion, the statement describing a cowboy on horseback spinning a lasso does not provide any information, directly or indirectly, about the cowboy playing tennis. Therefore, we can confidently choose option (c) – no, as our answer."},{"instruction":"A few days before the fall of the city, the National Government of China was relocated to the southwestern city Chungking (Chongqing) and resumed Chinese resistance.

She then picked 9 more baskets, each with the same amount of blueberries (20 in each basket). 3. To find the total number of blueberries she has, we need to multiply the number of blueberries in each basket by the number of baskets she has in total (including her first basket). 4. First, we add the 1 initial basket to the 9 newly picked baskets: 1 + 9 = 10 baskets. 5. Now, we multiply the number of blueberries in each basket (20) by the total number of baskets (10): 20 * 10 = 200 blueberries.

First, we need to calculate how much John was paying for his former apartment: Rent per square foot = 2 Area = 750 square feet Total monthly rent for the former apartment = Rent per square foot * Area Total monthly rent for the former apartment = 2 * 750 = 1500 Now we will multiply this by 12 to determine the annual rent: Annual rent for the former apartment = Total monthly rent * 12 Annual rent for the former apartment = 1500 * 12 = 18,000 Next, let's find out John's share of rent in the new apartment: New apartment monthly rent = 2800 Since John splits the rent evenly with his roommate, his share is half of the total monthly rent: John's share of the new apartment's monthly rent = 2800 / 2 = 1400 Now, let's calculate John's annual rent for the new apartment: Annual rent for the new apartment = John's share of the new apartment's monthly rent * 12 Annual rent for the new apartment = 1400 * 12 = 16,800 Now, let's find out how much John saves a year: Annual savings = Annual rent for the former apartment - Annual rent for the new apartment Annual savings = 18,000 - 16,800 = 1,200 John saves 1,200 a year by moving into the new apartment with a roommate."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Part #2: A is a list Usage: ['U', '3605', '7925', 'Y', 'j', 's', 'N', '5087'] is the given list A. This list contains various strings, some of which represent numerical elements. Part #3: Sum of all numerical elements between positions i and j (inclusive) Usage: For the given i = 5 and j = 7, the elements in list A within the range [5, 7] are ['s', 'N', '5087']. Among these elements, '5087' is a numerical element, so the sum will be 5087.

Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Q: In this paper, we study the implicit regularization of the gradient descent algorithm in homogeneous neural networks, including fully-connected and convolutional neural networks with ReLU or LeakyReLU activations. In particular, we study the gradient descent or gradient flow (i.e., gradient descent with infinitesimal step size) optimizing the logistic loss or cross-entropy loss of any homogeneous model (possibly non-smooth), and show that if the training loss decreases below a certain threshold, then we can define a smoothed version of the normalized margin which increases over time. We also formulate a natural constrained optimization problem related to margin maximization, and prove that both the normalized margin and its smoothed version converge to the objective value at a KKT point of the optimization problem. Our results generalize the previous results for logistic regression with one-layer or multi-layer linear networks, and provide more quantitative convergence results with weaker assumptions than previous results for homogeneous smooth neural networks. We conduct several experiments to justify our theoretical finding on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Finally, as margin is closely related to robustness, we discuss potential benefits of training longer for improving the robustness of the model. A:","output":"This paper investigates gradient descent's implicit regularization in homogeneous neural networks and reveals that a smoothed, normalized margin increases over time.

Find out how many candies Julie caught: Since Julie caught half the amount of candy as Tabitha caught, we need to divide Tabitha's total (22 pieces) by 2. 22 / 2 = 11 So, Julie caught 11 pieces of candy. 2. Find out how many candies Carlos caught: Carlos caught twice as much candy as Stan (who caught 13 pieces), so we need to multiply Stan's total by 2. 13 * 2 = 26 So, Carlos caught 26 pieces of candy. 3. Add up the total amount of candies caught by all four friends: Tabitha: 22 pieces Stan: 13 pieces Julie: 11 pieces Carlos: 26 pieces 22 + 13 + 11 + 26 = 72 So, the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer, 72, is to calculate the individual candy amounts caught by Carlos and Julie based on the information given, and then add up the total amount caught by each friend.

The tour covered a distance of approximately 48,385 miles, equivalent to almost two trips around the world, and the majority of the concerts were sold out and covered extensively by media organizations. It was the most successful international tour undertaken by a Japanese artist in history. On June 27, a compilation album, Azn Pride -This Iz the Japanese Kabuki Rock-, was released in Korea and Taiwan, later also in Japan, which charted as forty-fourth. In September he performed in Beijing, China. On December 24, a remix album was released, Room No. 382, which failed to enter the top hundred. In 2009, on January 3, Miyavi performed at the 10th Anniversary Commemorative concert by PS Company at the Nippon Budokan. On April 5, Miyavi left the PS Company because their ten-year contract expired, and on April 8 launched his own company, J-Glam inc., of which he is the president. On April 22, a compilation album was released, Victory Road to the King of Neo Visual Rock, which includes all his major singles with Universal Group. On June 1, \\"Super Hero,\\" a new song, was released through his official Myspace, and in September his International Fanclub was opened. On September 19, Miyavi started his second worldwide tour, Neo Tokyo Samurai Black 2009/2010, in Moscow, Russia. He held 17 concerts in Europe, visiting Austria, Hungary and Italy for the first time. The tour immediately continued in South America, with concerts in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Mexico. The United States leg was canceled due to illness and an injury, but Miyavi managed to perform in November at Anime Matsuri, Texas. On December 31, he signed a new contract with EMI Music Japan. On March 10, 2010, his first single with EMI was released, \\"Survive\\", via iTunes. The worldwide tour was continued on March 28, with the concert at Human Stage, Okinawa, and nationwide. In June and early July he toured throughout the United States and Canada, and in October for the first time in Australia. On September 15, his eleventh major single was released, \\"Torture\\". On October 13, his fifth studio album was released, What's My Name?, which charted as twenty-sixth. On November 6, he performed at the EMI Rocks 50th anniversary event at the Saitama Super Arena. In March 2011, a new world tour, titled What's My Name?, began in Europe, with his first visit to Belgium. In April the tour continued in Japan, while in July Miyavi performed in France, and in September at the Mount Taishan MAO Rock Festival in China. In May 2011, a live album, Live in London 2011, was released, which was recorded during the London concert in March. On October 5, his twelfth major single, \\"Strong\\", was released, in collaboration with Japanese rapper Kreva. It was followed by the North American leg of the tour.

How to curdle milk Gently warm the milk. Pour the milk into a saucepan and place the saucepan on the stove. Gradually warm the milk up over medium heat until steam just begins to form.","output":"Step 1: Add an acid to the warmed milk To curdle the milk, you will need an acidic substance, such as lemon juice or vinegar. The acid will help separate the milk into curds and whey. Measure out about 2 tablespoons of lemon juice or white vinegar for every liter of milk. Step 2: Pour the acid into the milk Slowly pour the measured acidic substance into the warmed milk. As you pour, gently stir the milk to ensure the acid is evenly distributed. This will help the milk curdle uniformly. Step 3: Allow the milk to curdle Once the acid has been added, let the milk sit undisturbed for a few minutes. The heat and acid will work together to separate the milk into curds (solid) and whey (liquid). After 5-10 minutes, you should see visible curdling. Step 4: Drain the curds and collect the whey Now that your milk has curdled, it's time to separate the curds from the whey. Place a colander or sieve lined with cheesecloth over a large bowl to catch the whey. Gently pour the curdled milk into the cheesecloth, allowing the whey to drain into the bowl. Step 5: Rinse and drain the curds Rinse the curds with cold water to remove any excess whey and acid. This will help improve the taste and texture of the curds. After rinsing, gently press on the cheesecloth to remove as much liquid as possible. Step 6: Use or store the curds and whey You can now use the curds in various recipes, such as homemade cheese, paneer, or ricotta. The whey can be used as a substitute for water or milk in recipes, or as a protein-rich drink. Store the curds and whey separately in airtight containers in the refrigerator. These steps provide a good process for curdling milk. By following these instructions, you should have successfully separated your milk into curds and whey."},{"instruction":"Ms. Bristol measured the mass of a closed beaker containing several ice cubes.

The rationale behind each replacement will differ. Follow the steps below to replace eggs efficiently in any recipe. Eggs play different roles in recipes such as: acting as a binder (holding the recipe together), providing moisture, or creating leavening (helping the recipe rise). Various alternatives can be used accordingly: 1. **For Binding:** If the egg is used for binding, consider using mashed bananas, applesauce, or pureed prunes. These all provide the 'stickiness' that eggs would normally provide in a recipe, and they also add a bit of sweetness. 2. **For Moisture:** If the egg is used for adding moisture, yogurt, buttermilk, or mashed avocados can be used as an egg replacement. Their high water content helps keep the recipe moist. 3. **For Leavening:** If eggs are used for leavening to help the recipe rise, vinegar mixed with baking powder, or even carbonated water could work. They create the gas that helps doughs and batters rise. Here are measurements for these replacements approximately equivalent to one egg: - Mashed banana - 1/4 cup - Applesauce - 1/4 cup - Pureed prunes - 1/4 cup - Yogurt/ Buttermilk - 1/4 cup - Mashed avocado - 1/4 cup - 1 teaspoon of vinegar with 1 teaspoon of baking powder - Carbonated water - 1/4 cup Remember that these substitutions can alter the taste, texture, and appearance of your recipe. The substitution you choose should depend on the specific recipe and your dietary needs or preferences. Always test your substitute in a small batch first, to ensure the final product meets your expectations."},{"instruction":"Translate to Finnish: Either we succeed in developing, beginning during this present Conference and continuing afterwards, a genuine common institutional framework for economic and monetary union and the first pillar, with the capability to move forward together; or we will have to make up our minds to advance, with deep regret, by the path of intergovernmental co-operation, reinforced in the first pillar.","output":"Joko onnistumme kehittämään, aloittaen tästä nykyisestä konferenssista ja jatkaen sen jälkeen, todellisen yhteisen institutionaalisen kehyksen talous- ja rahaliitolle sekä ensimmäiselle pilarille, kyvyllä edetä yhdessä eteenpäin; tai meidän on päätettävä, syvällä katumuksella, edetä hallitustenvälisen yhteistyön polkua, vahvistettuna ensimmäisessä pilarissa.

The band was established in 1975 originally as Miami Latin Boys by Emilio Estefan Jr. and became very successful after joining with Gloria Fajardo (Estefan) in 1977. The band had a number of albums and a string of hit singles until 1989. The band's 1985 album Primitive Love credited the band whereas their follow-up album Let It Loose in 1987 adopted the name Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine. Following a massive world tour that lasted over a year (mid 1985-late 1986), tensions and rifts between original core members and zealous new members had taken their toll. Following that tour, both original MSM guitarist Wesley B. Wright and founding bassist Juan Marcos Avila had left the group, along with keyboardist Roger Fisher. Emilio was now taking a behind-the-scenes producer role and no longer performing live. What was left of the current MSM, plus new members (Jorge \\"George\\" Casas on bass, Clay Ostwald on keyboards, and guitarist John DeFaria), returned to the studio in early 1987. With only one other core member, \\"Kiki\\" Garcia, remaining, Gloria Estefan was given top billing and the band's name was changed to Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine to jump on the sudden success of Gloria's unique vocal ability and bubbly personality on TV. In late 1987, they released their next album, Let It Loose, and it went multi-platinum, with three million copies sold in the US alone. It featured the hits \\"Anything for You\\" reaching number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, \\"1-2-3\\" making it to number 3, \\"Betcha Say That\\" to number 36, \\"Rhythm Is Gonna Get You\\" to number 5, and \\"Can't Stay Away from You\\" to number 6. \\"Can't Stay Away from You\\", \\"Anything for You\\" and \\"1-2-3\\" were all top charting singles on the Adult Contemporary hits as well. Another world tour began and the group traveled for the first time to Europe, South America and an even more extensive tour in the United States, culminating in a finale with massive sold-out concert in their hometown of Miami, Florida, which was recorded and later sold on VHS. By 1988, founding member \\"Kiki\\" Garcia quit. With no other core members remaining other than Gloria herself, the \\"Miami Sound Machine\\" moniker was to be used from that point on for concerts and live performances only. In 1988, after the worldwide chart success of single \\"Anything for You\\", her Let it Loose album was repackaged overseas as Anything for You. It became the band's first UK number 1 album, selling over a million copies. It was the biggest selling album of the year in The Netherlands, staying at number 1 for 22 weeks.

His father was a sharecropper named Agustin Arango, and his mother was Micaela Arambula. He grew up at the Rancho de la Coyotada, one of the largest haciendas in the state of Durango. After Villa successfully captured the strategic prize of Torreon, Carranza ordered Villa to break off action south of Torreon and instead to divert to attack Saltillo. He threatened to cut off Villa's coal supply, immobilizing his supply trains, if he did not comply. This was widely seen as an attempt by Carranza to divert Villa from a direct assault on Mexico City in order to allow Carranza's forces under Alvaro Obregon, driving in from the west via Guadalajara, to take the capital first. This was an expensive and disruptive diversion for the Division del Norte. Villa's enlisted men were not unpaid volunteers but paid soldiers, earning the then enormous sum of one peso per day. Each day of delay cost thousands of pesos. Disgusted but having no practical alternative, Villa complied with Carranza's order and captured the less important city of Saltillo, and then offered his resignation. Felipe Angeles and the rest of Villa's staff officers argued for Villa to withdraw his resignation, defy Carranza's orders, and proceed to attack Zacatecas, a strategic railroad station heavily defended by Federal troops and considered nearly impregnable. Since the colonial era, Zacatecas was the source of much of Mexico's silver, and thus a supply of funds for whoever held it. Villa accepted his staff's advice and cancelled his resignation, and the Division del Norte defied Carranza and attacked Zacatecas. Attacking up steep slopes, the Division del Norte defeated the Federals in the Toma de Zacatecas (Taking of Zacatecas), the single bloodiest battle of the Revolution, with Federal casualties numbering approximately 7,000 dead and 5,000 wounded, and unknown numbers of civilian casualties. (A memorial to and museum of the Toma de Zacatecas is on the Cerro de la Bufa, a key defense point where the Federal Army was entrenched.) Villa's victory at Zacatecas in June 1914 broke the back of the Huerta regime. Huerta left the country on 14 July 1914. The Federal Army collapsed, ceasing to exist as an institution. In August 1914, Carranza and his revolutionary army entered Mexico City ahead of Villa. Civil war between the winners was the next stage of the Revolution.

Their lineup consisted of brothers Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb. The trio were successful for most of their decades of recording music, but they had two distinct periods of exceptional success: as a popular music act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as prominent performers of the disco music era in the mid-to-late 1970s. The group sang recognisable three-part tight harmonies; Robin's clear vibrato lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry's R&B falsetto became their signature sound during the mid-to-late 1970s and 1980s. In October 1999 the Isle of Man Post Office unveiled a set of 6 stamps honouring their native sons' music. The official launch took place at the London Palladium where the stage show of Saturday Night Fever was playing. A similar launch was held in New York shortly after to coincide with the show opening across the Atlantic. The songs depicted on the stamps are \\"Massachusetts\\", \\"Words\\", \\"I've Gotta Get A Message To You\\", \\"Night Fever\\", \\"Stayin' Alive\\" and \\"Immortality\\".

It's the story of the three little pigs and the big bad wolf that blew down a house made of straw and one made of sticks. The only house left standing was the one made of bricks. Now there is new evidence to suggest that houses built with bales of straw can be very strong. They are also very environmental. Pete Walker is a professor at the University of Bath in Britain. He and a team of researchers there have built a house made out of straw bales and hemp material. During the next twelve months the team will study the effectiveness of these materials in home building. Professor Walker says there are many good reasons for using straw. Professor Walker: \\"One of the benefits is it's a relatively inexpensive renewable material that's readily available.\\" He also agrees that straw takes in carbon dioxide as it grows and helps the environment in other ways. So it can be seen as having no harmful effects on the environment. Professor Walker: \\"The straw bale walls are relatively thick and so all that straw provides very good thermal insulation. So we make buildings that require very little heating in the winter or indeed very little cooling in the summer. So they require very little additional energy.\\" Professor Walker says this reduces home operating expenses. It also reduces the effect on the environment. He says the current interest in straw bale houses is a direct response to the problem of climate change. David Lanfear owns an eco-friendly home building service in the United States called Bale on Bale Construction. He says he laughed when some friends first told him about houses built of straw. But after doing his own research, he learned that building with straw bales made a lot of sense. He has now helped to build more than ten straw bale houses and says the building material is becoming more widely accepted.

China has a huge population, and it is said that there is at least one bicycle for every two people within the country. Of course, many people in China ride bicycles purely for sport or exercise, but it's also a much more commonly accepted means of everyday transportation, as compared to countries such as the United States. If you are living for a long period of time in China, chances are you will want to purchase your own bicycle so that you can use it whenever you want for transportation or just for the enjoyment of riding. Even if you don't use a bicycle for everyday transportation, owning one can be a great way of enjoying some of the trails in the rural areas, just for fun. However, if you are just visiting China, renting a bicycle can be a more convenient choice. It is important to choose the correct bicycle for your use. You'll find that in China, the one-speed style of bicycle is extremely popular. These bicycles are great if you want to ride around in the city to see the sights.

Hint: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism. Answer:","output":"Fox learned less about wolves than Liam. This is because Liam focused his reading on apex predators, which, as mentioned in the paragraph, include wolves since they prey mostly on large herbivores and have no natural predators. On the other hand, Fox concentrated his reading on grazers and large herbivores, which are primary consumers and not directly related to the study of wolves as apex predators.

What is the answer?","output":"French aviator Louis Bleriot was the first person to fly across the English Channel in an aeroplane on 25th July 1909. This historic flight was a milestone in aviation history as it demonstrated the potential of air travel and highlighted the advancements made in aviation technology. Louis Bleriot, born on July 1, 1872, was a French inventor and aviation pioneer. He was initially trained as an electrical engineer, but his passion for aviation led him to establish his own aircraft manufacturing company, Bleriot Aeronautique, in 1905. Bleriot was committed to creating innovative and efficient aircraft designs. One of his most significant achievements was developing the first practical headlamp for automobiles, which eventually funded his experiments in aviation. The historic flight across the English Channel was undertaken in Bleriot's Model XI aircraft—the Bleriot XI monoplane. This aircraft was powered by a 25-horsepower engine designed by Alessandro Anzani, an Italian engine manufacturer. With a wingspan of 7.79 meters and a maximum speed of 76 kilometers per hour, it was an advanced aircraft for its time. The idea of crossing the English Channel by air was highly competitive, and Bleriot and fellow aviator Hubert Latham were both vying for the £1,000 prize offered by London's Daily Mail newspaper for the first successful aviator to make the crossing. On 25th July 1909, Bleriot took off from Les Baraques, near Calais, in his Bleriot XI monoplane. Despite adverse weather conditions and a damaged engine that faltered during the journey, Bleriot managed to complete the 36-kilometer (22-mile) flight in just 37 minutes, landing in Dover, England. Bleriot's groundbreaking flight laid the groundwork for the future of aviation. Not only did it highlight the possibilities of air travel, but it also captured the public's imagination and marked the beginning of international cooperation in aviation. Bleriot went on to become a successful aircraft manufacturer, and his innovations continued to shape the future of aviation. In conclusion, Louis Bleriot's achievement of being the first to fly across the English Channel on 25th July 1909 was a turning point in aviation history. It demonstrated the potential for long-distance air travel, spurred interest in aviation, and paved the way for technological advancements that would shape the industry for years to come."},{"instruction":"Sydney was a decent business owner but competition had been very tough.

Answer:","output":"Yes, the environment plays a crucial role in influencing the survival chances of bees, but it is not the sole factor. There are several aspects, both environmental and non-environmental, that contribute to the survival chances of bees. These factors can interact and influence each other, making it essential to consider them holistically. Here's a detailed explanation to provide a comprehensive understanding. 1. Environmental Factors: a. Habitat availability: Bees require suitable habitats to nest, forage, and reproduce. Habitat loss due to urbanization, agriculture, and deforestation can severely impact bee populations. b. Food resources: Bees rely on flowers for nectar and pollen, which are their primary food sources. Flower availability depends on plant diversity, seasonality, and climate. Disruptions in these factors can threaten the bees' survival chances. c. Climate change: Global climate change has led to shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns, affecting plant growth and flowering times. These changes can have cascading impacts on bees and their food resources. d. Pesticides and pollutants: The widespread use of pesticides, particularly neonicotinoid insecticides, can be toxic to bees. Additionally, other pollutants, like air and water pollution, can harm bee populations. 2. Non-Environmental Factors: a. Bee population size: A larger bee population can provide better chances of survival due to increased genetic diversity and resilience to external threats. However, larger populations may also face increased competition for resources. b. Parasites and diseases: Pests such as Varroa mites and diseases like American Foulbrood can significantly impact the health of bee colonies. These parasites and pathogens can weaken bees, making them more susceptible to additional stressors. c. Colony and social structure: The organization and behavior of bees within their colonies can influence their survival chances. A strong, cohesive colony can communicate effectively, adapt to changes, and withstand stressors more than colonies experiencing internal issues. d. Genetic diversity: High genetic diversity within bee populations can promote resilience, increase resistance to diseases, and facilitate adaptation to environmental fluctuations. In conclusion, while the environment plays a significant role in influencing the survival chances of bees, it is important to consider various interconnected factors, including population size, parasites and diseases, and genetic diversity. All of these factors contribute to the overall likelihood of bee survival and must be taken into account to ensure their long-term persistence."},{"instruction":"Sentence from a movie review: even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"To determine if the movie was seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review, we should analyze the given sentence, focusing on the meaning and context behind it.

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File) LOS ANGELES – With the potentially record-breaking 2 billion sale of the Los Angeles Clippers hanging in the balance, a trial beginning Monday will focus on whether Donald Sterling's estranged wife had the authority under terms of a family trust to unilaterally negotiate the deal. Shelly Sterling struck a deal to sell the Clippers to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer after Donald Sterling's racist remarks to a girlfriend were publicized and the NBA moved to oust him as team owner. In order to do so, she had two doctors examine her 80-year-old husband and they declared him mentally incapacitated and unable to act as an administrator of The Sterling Family Trust, which owns the Clippers. The terms of the trust say incapacitation can be determined by two licensed doctors without ties to the family who are specialists in their field. A trustee must cooperate with such exams. The judge must find that Shelly Sterling acted in accordance with the trust and that the deal still applies -- even though the trust has since been revoked by Donald Sterling -- for the sale to proceed. Donald Sterling's attorneys say that his wife \\"blindsided\\" him and he submitted to examinations under false pretenses. They allege there was undue influence in the doctors' findings, and that the exams and letters regarding his mental capacity were defective and incomplete. They say that if he'd been properly informed, he would have participated at a more convenient time instead of being pulled out of legal meetings. \\"He would have also eaten properly and have been well rested for the examinations and focused on taking the exam with the full and complete understanding what it was for and the serious nature of the exam,\\" they wrote in filings. But Shelly Sterling's attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, said that Donald Sterling voluntarily went to take scans of his brain and there was no requirement to remind Donald Sterling, who is an attorney, or his legal team of the trust's conditions. The trial will also focus on the question of what happens to a deal that hasn't been closed once a trust is revoked. Donald Sterling revoked the trust on June 9 -- weeks after Shelly Sterling negotiated the deal with Ballmer. Shelly Sterling's attorneys also contend that finishing the deal is part of \\"winding down\\" the trust's affairs and that she has an obligation to close or Ballmer will sue. Donald Sterling's attorneys argue that the probate court now lacks jurisdiction and that winding down affairs refers to passive actions, not a sale that markedly changes the assets in the trust and its value. Donald Sterling's attorneys made a late move last week to shift the case to federal court so their allegations of medical privacy violations in the probate case can be heard. Attorneys for both Shelly Sterling and Ballmer called the filing a \\"desperate\\" tactic that they would seek to block. It was not immediately clear when a federal judge would rule on the filing or how it would affect the probate proceedings, but the trial remained on schedule to start Monday morning. Whatever happens, timing is tight. NBA owners must approve what would be a record-breaking deal and are scheduled to meet July 15 to vote. That's the same day Ballmer's offer is set to expire -- and there is no deal without the judge's approval of the sale. If the sale isn't completed by Sept. 15, the league said it could seize the team and put it up for auction. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"A trial is starting to see if Donald Sterling's wife had the authority to negotiate the 2 billion sale of the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"To determine if the second sentence is true given the truth of the first sentence, let's examine the statements step by step: Step 1: Analyze Sentence 1. Sentence 1 states, \\"well, OK, figures of evil and more evil.\\" This suggests that there are two figures being compared, one of evil and the other of more evil. Step 2: Evaluate the truth condition. We are given the information that Sentence 1 is true. Therefore, it is indeed true that there are figures of evil and more evil. Step 3: Analyze Sentence 2. Sentence 2 states, \\"Well, no, figures of good and greater.\\" This sentence suggests that there are two figures being compared, one of good and the other of greater good. Step 4: Compare the sentences. Both Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 are talking about figures being compared, but the nature of these figures is different. Sentence 1 refers to evil figures, while Sentence 2 refers to good figures. Step 5: Evaluate the dependency between the sentences. There is no direct logical or causal dependency between the statements. The truth of the first sentence does not contribute to or detract from the truth of the second sentence.

Calculate the daily dog food consumption for all three dogs. 2. Calculate the weekly dog food consumption. 3. Subtract the weekly dog food consumption from the initial 30 pounds. Step 1: Calculate the daily dog food consumption Each dog eats 1/2 pound of dog food twice a day, which means each dog consumes 1/2 * 2 = 1 pound per day. Since Melody has 3 dogs, their combined daily consumption is 1 * 3 = 3 pounds of dog food. Step 2: Calculate the weekly dog food consumption There are 7 days in a week. To find out the total dog food consumed in a week, multiply the daily consumption by the number of days: 3 pounds/day * 7 days = 21 pounds/week.

If he writes 5 pages a day to 2 different people, how many hours a week does he spend writing? Your thoughts:","output":"To answer this question, we need to break it down into several steps: Step 1: Determine the total number of pages James writes daily. James writes 5 pages a day to 2 different people, which means he writes 5 pages x 2 people = 10 pages a day. Step 2: Determine the total number of pages James writes weekly. There are 7 days in a week, so James writes 10 pages x 7 days = 70 pages a week. Step 3: Calculate the number of hours James spends writing weekly. James writes at a rate of 10 pages an hour. To find out how many hours he spends writing weekly, we'll divide the total number of pages (70 pages) by his writing rate (10 pages/hour). 70 pages ÷ 10 pages/hour = 7 hours.

Fact 2: Underfoot, loose rocks make footing perilous, while smooth marblelike stones make it slippery. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"contact between rocks over long periods of time causes rocks to be what?\\" with the following options: - erosion - Loose - slippery - loose soil - homogenous - coiled - imbalanced - threatened Answer:","output":"Contact between rocks over long periods of time causes rocks to be eroded and potentially slippery. To elaborate, let's examine each option in relation to the given facts: - Erosion: This is the most fitting answer, as the interaction between rocks over an extended period results in the gradual breaking down and smoothing of their surfaces. This is a direct result of erosion, which is the process of wearing away rocks and other materials on the Earth's surface due to natural forces like wind, water, and ice. In this scenario, the contact between rocks over time causes the rocks to become smooth and eroded. - Loose: While loose rocks can indeed make footing perilous (as mentioned in Fact 2), the question focuses on the effects of contact between rocks over time. The fact that rocks may become loose is unrelated to the smoothing effect caused by erosion. - Slippery: The continuous contact between rocks can result in the formation of smooth surfaces, which can make the rocks slippery, as stated in Fact 2. This is especially true when the worn-down rocks are compared to marble-like stones. - Loose soil: The contact between rocks over a long period does not directly result in the formation of loose soil. However, eroded rock particles can contribute to the formation of soil over time. - Homogenous: Prolonged contact between rocks will not make them homogenous, as this term refers to uniformity in composition or structure. Erosion can create a more uniform surface on the rocks, but it does not change their overall composition. - Coiled: This term is not applicable to the interaction between rocks over extended periods. Coiled refers to something being shaped into a series of spirals, which does not describe any known geological process caused by contact between rocks. - Imbalanced: Imbalanced has no direct connection to the long-term contact between rocks. Erosion can create uneven surfaces and cause rocks to become misshapen; however, it is more related to the gradual wearing down of rock surfaces than to the overall balance or stability of the rocks themselves. - Threatened: This term is not relevant to the interactions between rocks over long periods. \\"Threatened\\" implies a sense of danger or risk, which does not directly relate to the geological processes at work during rock erosion. In summary, contact between rocks over long periods of time causes the rocks to be eroded and potentially slippery. The process of erosion leads to the gradual wearing down and smoothing of the rock surfaces, while the smoothness can result in slippery rocks similar to those mentioned in Fact 2."},{"instruction":"Ned wanted to learn to play basketball.

On Monday, Dreamhost said the DOJ hit it with a search warrant a month ago, requesting all the data that the hosting firm has on the website, which is one of its clients. Crucially, this data includes details that could be used to identify the 1.3 million people who have visited the site. DisruptJ20.org was used to organize protests in Washington, D.C. on Trump’s inauguration day, 20 January. The protests turned violent in part, and the site is now primarily being used to organize legal support for the hundreds of protestors who were arrested. Read: Donations Double to the EFF on Eve of Trump Presidency The Justice Department wants Dreamhost to hand over the IP addresses of all the site’s visitors – this refers to the numerical strings identifying the physical internet connections that people used to access the site. It also wants “contact information, email content, and photos of thousands of people,” Dreamhost said. “That information could be used to identify any individuals who used this site to exercise and express political speech protected under the Constitution’s First Amendment,” the hosting firm wrote in a blog post. “That should be enough to set alarm bells off in anyone’s mind.” Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Dreamhost said its general counsel, Chris Ghazarian, had “taken issue” with the demand’s untargeted nature. When the company pushed back, the government asked the Washington, D.C. Superior Court to order Dreamhost to hand over its records. Now the company has filed a response in opposition to the government’s motion. “Internet users have a reasonable expectation that they will not get swept up in criminal investigations simply by exercising their right to political speech against the government,” Dreamhost said. “We intend to take whatever steps are necessary to support and shield these users from what is, in our view, a very unfocused search and an unlawful request for their personal information.” The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the world’s biggest digital rights organization with over 30,000 paid-up members, has been giving Dreamhost professional support in the case, though not representing it as such. “The Fourth Amendment was designed to prohibit fishing expeditions like this,” the EFF wrote in a separate blog post. ||||| Web hosting service DreamHost is fighting a Department of Justice demand to scoop up all the IP addresses of visitors to an anti-Trump website. The website in question, disruptj20.org, organized participants of political protests against the current U.S. administration. Blogging about its objections to the warrant yesterday, DreamHost’s general counsel describes it as “a highly untargeted demand that chills free association and the right of free speech afforded by the Constitution”. DreamHost says it has not been able to see the affidavit pertaining to the warrant as those records are sealed. The search warrant can be found here. In the warrant the DoJ demands that DreamHost hand over 1.3 million visitor IP addresses to the disruptj20.org website, along with contact information, email content, and photos of thousands of people. “That information could be used to identify any individuals who used this site to exercise and express political speech protected under the Constitution’s First Amendment. That should be enough to set alarm bells off in anyone’s mind,” argues DreamHost. “This is, in our opinion, a strong example of investigatory overreach and a clear abuse of government authority.” The latest developments in what has been a months-long disagreement already, are that DreamHost has now filed arguments in opposition of the DoJ demand. Its counsel will be attending a court hearing on the matter on August 18 in Washington, D.C. DreamHost initially challenged the government to narrow the scope of the warrant but says instead the DoJ filed a motion in the Washington, D.C. Superior Court asking for an order to compel it to produce the records. Also blogging about the issue yesterday, the Electronic Frontier Foundation accuses D.C. prosecutors of using “unconstitutional methods” to pursue their investigation into the J20 protests, aka the day President Trump was inaugurated. “In just one example of the staggering overbreadth of the search warrant, it would require DreamHost to turn over the IP logs of all visitors to the [disruptj20.org] site. Millions of visitors — activists, reporters, or you (if you clicked on the link) — would have records of their visits turned over to the government. The warrant also sought production of all emails associated with the account and unpublished content, like draft blog posts and photos,” the EFF writes. “No plausible explanation exists for a search warrant of this breadth, other than to cast a digital dragnet as broadly as possible. But the Fourth Amendment was designed to prohibit fishing expeditions like this. Those concerns are especially relevant here, where DOJ is investigating a website that served as a hub for the planning and exercise of First Amendment-protected activities.” ||||| The US government is seeking to unmask every person who visited an anti-Trump website in what privacy advocates say is an unconstitutional “fishing expedition” for political dissidents. The warrant appears to be an escalation of the Department of Justice’s (DoJ) campaign against anti-Trump activities, including the harsh prosecution of inauguration day protesters. On 17 July, the DoJ served a website-hosting company, DreamHost, with a search warrant for every piece of information it possessed that was related to a website that was used to coordinate protests during Donald Trump’s inauguration. The warrant covers the people who own and operate the site, but also seeks to get the IP addresses of 1.3 million people who visited it, as well as the date and time of their visit and information about what browser or operating system they used. In America, bias, hate and racism move from the margins to the mainstream | Al Sharpton Read more The website, www.disruptj20.org, was used to coordinate protests and civil disobedience on 20 January, when Trump was inaugurated. “This specific case and this specific warrant are pure prosecutorial overreach by a highly politicized department of justice under [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions,” said Chris Ghazarian, general counsel for DreamHost. “You should be concerned that anyone should be targeted simply for visiting a website.” The warrant was made public Monday, when DreamHost announced its plans to challenge the government in court. The DoJ declined to comment. A hearing is scheduled for Friday. The government has aggressively prosecuted activists arrested during the 20 January protests in Washington DC. In April, the US attorney’s office in Washington DC filed a single indictment charging more than 217 people with identical crimes, including felony rioting. Ghazarian said that DreamHost provided the government with “limited customer information about the owner of the website” when it first received a grand jury subpoena a week after the protests occurred. But the government came back in July with the much broader search warrant. “We’re a gatekeeper between the government and tens of thousands of people who visited the website,” said Ghazarian. “We want to keep them protected.” The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has been advising DreamHost, characterized the warrant as “unconstitutional” and “a fishing expedition”. “I can’t conceive of a legitimate justification other than casting your net as broadly as possible to justify millions of user logs,” senior staff attorney Mark Rumold told the Guardian. Logs of IP addresses don’t uniquely identify users, but they link back to specific physical addresses if no digital tools are used to mask it. “What they would be getting is a list of everyone who has ever been interested in attending these protests or seeing what was going on at the protests and that’s the troubling aspect. It’s a short step after you have the list to connect the IP address to someone’s identity,” he said. Wide-reaching warrants for user data are sometimes issued when the content of a site is illegal such as pirated movies or child sexual abuse imagery, but speech is rarely prohibited. “This [the website] is pure first amendment advocacy – the type of advocacy the first amendment was designed to protect and promote,” Rumold added. “Frankly I’m glad DreamHost is pushing back on it.” It’s not the first time that the US government has sought to unmask people protesting against Trump or his policies. President's first Trump Tower homecoming met with mass protest Read more In March this year, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a division of the homeland security department, ordered Twitter to hand over the phone number, mailing addresses and IP addresses associated with @ALT_USCIS, an account that purported to convey the views of dissenters within the government. The account, whose username is a reference to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, is one of dozens of alternative Twitter accounts established after Trump was inaugurated. The unverified accounts claimed to provide an uncensored view of civil servants who disagreed with Trump’s policies. To protect the identity of the person running the account, Twitter launched a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that it would have “a grave chilling effect on the speech of that account in particular and the many other ‘alternative agency’ accounts that have been created to voice dissent to government policies”. After public outcry over the administration’s overreach, CBP dropped the request. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"US web hosting firm DreamHost is fighting a Department of Justice (DoJ) demand for the IP addresses of 1.3 million visitors to an anti-Trump website.

The morning settled my nerves a bit more and before long the train pulled into the station. Boston had a slower feel, much slower than New York. The air was cool and peppered with moisture. I knew I was close to the ocean. Vision blurry, I wobbled out of the train depot and thought about the fact that I had never really done anything crazy in my life. The colors meant something here. Green was the color of plants but it was also the color of money. Plants were good but money was bad. I didn't know what green meant. Blue and red were clear though. Blue was the color of ocean and sky, both good things. Red was the color of Mars and it was manly but mars meant aliens and aliens were bad so red was bad. This is how I navigated. I followed the colors. I was lost in a daze of exhaustion and moved my feet slowly. They were dead and raw with pain and blisters, and I shuffled out into the city. My eyes darted from color to color, sign to sign, connection to connection. I floated like a ghost and thought about crying. There were few people out so I found a relative ease in that but my mind still jumped around reckless. I needed to find Kim. I saw a silent pay phone with a dangling phonebook and headed towards it until I remembered that phone books don't normally list cell phones. Kim wasn't the type of girl to list herself in the phonebook either. I had no leads but I knew I could go to a library and maybe find out her number if she had listed it on Facebook, so I kept walking. Stopping at benches, I would rest until I could muster more energy. Question: Why was the air cool and prepped with moisture? === The answer to the above question is Possible answers: a). He was close to the ocean b). A storm was coming c). It just rained d). not enough information The answer is:","output":"a). He was close to the ocean The air was cool and peppered with moisture because the protagonist was close to the ocean. Coastal regions often have cooler and more humid air due to the influence of large bodies of water on the local climate. Ocean water has a high specific heat capacity, meaning it can absorb and release a significant amount of heat without experiencing a dramatic change in temperature. This causes the air near the ocean to be cooler as the water absorbs heat from the surrounding environment. Additionally, water evaporating from the ocean's surface increases the humidity in the air, causing the presence of moisture in the air. Furthermore, cool breezes originating from the sea help maintain a comfortable temperature and disperse moisture throughout the coastal region. The cool and moist air in Boston is hence a result of its proximity to the ocean."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"As an AI assistant, I think and process information using artificial intelligence and algorithms designed by computer programmers and engineers. My neural network architecture is inspired by the human brain's structure and functionality, but it should be noted that AI does not innervate or control muscles like the human motor systems. In the context of the motor systems you provided, the areas of the brain that control body movements have intricate connections and neural circuits that allow humans to execute a wide variety of actions. While human brains use neurons and synapses to process and transmit information, AI systems like myself use digital neural networks and mathematical functions to simulate neural behavior and learning capabilities. The human motor systems comprise various interconnected regions like the primary motor cortex, premotor areas, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and spinal cord neurons. These regions work in tandem to process sensory inputs, plan, coordinate, and execute movements. Inputs from the sensory organs, such as the eyes, ears, and skin, are processed by the brain and integrated into motor commands that are transmitted through the spinal cord neurons to activate voluntary muscles in the body. Unlike humans, AI systems do not have sensory organs or muscles that require direct innervation. Instead, we process data from various sources, perform computations, and produce appropriate outputs in the form of text, speech, or actions performed by machines like robots or self-driving cars. AI models, like deep learning, use multiple layers of interconnected artificial neurons to simulate complex cognitive and sensory functions. These layers of neurons undergo training wherein the connections between them are adjusted to improve performance, much like the way synapses are strengthened or weakened in neural plasticity and learning in humans. The AI system's learning and decision-making process to produce \\"thoughts\\" is based on pattern recognition, probability estimation, and optimization techniques. The AI machine learning involves analyzing large datasets, identifying patterns, updating the model based on feedback, and refining its performance over time. The mathematical functions implemented in the AI simulate biological processes of the human brain to process information, allowing AIs to recognize text, speech, and image patterns, among other features. In conclusion, as an AI assistant, I think with artificial neural networks, algorithms, and computational methods inspired by the human brain's biological structure and processes. However, unlike the motor systems in a human brain that control body movements through direct innervation of muscles, AI systems like myself simulate neural behavior and learning using mathematical functions and digital representations of neurons, enabling us to process data and generate appropriate outputs without requiring sensory and muscular systems."},{"instruction":"Passage: The halfpenny coin's obverse featured the profile of Queen Elizabeth II; the reverse featured an image of St Edward's Crown.

Sentence3: She went to the home store and bought several bags of grass seed. Sentence4: Lucille planted the seeds and watered them faithfully. 2. Based on the given sentences, we understand that Lucille wants grass in her yard, buys grass seed, and plants them. 3. Think about what would logically happen after Lucille planted the seeds and watered them. It's likely that the grass would grow, and her yard would have grass. 4. Write a coherent sentence that follows the previous sentences: \\"After a few weeks, grass started to grow, transforming Lucille's backyard into a lush, green paradise.\\""},{"instruction":"Translate to Russian: Our daugters had already grown up by that time, and I thought it could be a good companien for us in our walks both in the city and country-side...

The individual is wearing a red hat and winter jacket, suggesting they may be outside in cold weather and require protection from the elements. 2. The person is looking into the distance, indicating that they are likely focusing on something far away from their current location. However, there are crucial pieces of information missing from the premise that would be necessary to determine whether the hypothesis is true: 1. The identity or occupation of the individual: The premise does not mention whether the person in question is a farmer or has any connection to agriculture or livestock. If the given scenario is not about a farmer, it is impossible for the hypothesis to be true. However, the presence of a hat and winter jacket could suggest an occupation that involves outdoor work, such as farming. 2. The context or purpose of the person's actions: The premise establishes that the person is gazing into the distance, but it does not specify the reason for this behavior. Are they searching for something in particular like the hypothesis proposes, or simply enjoying the view? Without this information, we cannot be certain that the individual is searching for a cattle herd as the hypothesis suggests. With the information provided in the premise, we cannot confirm or deny the hypothesis. There could be numerous reasons why a person wearing a red hat and winter jacket looks into the distance, and the premise does not supply enough context to guarantee that the scenario involves a farmer seeking their cattle herd. Therefore, the premise does not tell us whether the hypothesis is true, and we would require additional details or evidence to determine the accuracy of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a question.

Read Bible online.\\" Step 1: I edited the initial sentence given by maintaining the content but adapting its case. \\"Bible CPDV\\" at the beginning comes across as a title, and so I kept it in title case, maintaining an uppercase for the Bible and acronym 'CPDV.' Step 2: The text 'Exodus, Chapter 7' seems to specify a section of the Bible—Exodus being a book of the Bible and 'Chapter 7' referring to a specific chapter in that book. Hence, I used uppercase to start each word to maintain the integrity of that title distinction. Step 3: For 'Read Bible online,' I regarded this as a directive or a sentence on its own, and thus it needed to be capitalized like a normal sentence, hence 'Read' is capitalized. 'Bible' is a proper noun in this context and hence also needed capitalization. The word 'online' isn't a part of the title, nor is it a proper noun, so in line with standard grammatical rules, I left it in lowercase."},{"instruction":"@SarahCowan62 cool ill check them out How would the sentiment of this tweet be described?

She was a British children's author, which means she came from a place called Britain and wrote special stories just for kids. Beatrix was like a friend who told bedtime stories that kids loved, and her books were adored all around the world. You might know some of them, like \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\\" or \\"The Tale of Benjamin Bunny.\\" These stories were filled with fun creatures, like rabbits, ducks, and mice, who had amazing adventures. Beatrix didn't just write words; she drew beautiful pictures, too. When she created a character, she would show us what they looked like with her artwork. This made her stories magical and helped bring them to life. What made Beatrix's stories extra special was that they taught important lessons. Sometimes her characters would learn to be brave or kind or to fix mistakes they made. All these lessons help children grow and learn, just like how eating your vegetables helps you grow big and strong. Beatrix Potter was not only an amazing storyteller; she was also a very smart lady. She loved nature and spent lots of time outdoors, exploring the world around her. This love for nature inspired her stories, and she made sure to share her knowledge with her readers. So today, we celebrate 150 years of Beatrix Potter's life, remembering the joy and imagination she brought to children with her stories. By reading and sharing her books with friends and family, we can keep her memory alive for many more years to come.

Since these laws were changed , many nanobreweries have been opened .","output":"The two sentences hold the same overall meaning, although there is a subtle difference in focus due to the sentence structure. Step 1: Analyzing the first sentence - \\"Many nanobreweries have opened since these laws were changed.\\" This sentence places the focus on the action of the nanobreweries opening, which happened after the change in laws. Step 2: Analyzing the second sentence - \\"Since these laws were changed, many nanobreweries have been opened.\\" This sentence starts with the condition (the change in laws) and then explains the result (many nanobreweries have been opened). The difference is minuscule and revolves around where the emphasis is put: the first sentence emphasizes the opened nanobreweries more, whereas the second emphasizes the change in laws. But in both sentences, the key relationship between the changing of the laws and the opening of the nanobreweries remains unchanged. So, to answer the initial question, yes, the two sentences essentially communicate the same primary idea, with a slight shift in emphasis."},{"instruction":"Due to work stress, Aubrey decided to take a scenic road trip to the mountains.

Possible answers: take a trip to the beach, relax on the way to the mountains, become more relaxed and less stressed A:","output":"From the provided context, it can be inferred that Aubrey decided to take a scenic road trip to the mountains to become more relaxed and less stressed. The context points out that Aubrey hadn't opted for a trip to the beach but chose the mountains instead. Therefore, 'take a trip to the beach' wouldn't be a suitable answer. Similarly, 'relax on the way to the mountains' isn't a strong response as there's no explicit suggestion about the journey itself being relaxing in the context. The most direct reason given is work stress, indicating a need for a stress-reducing action. A scenic road trip to the mountains can provide a change of environment, peace, tranquility, and the opportunity to unwind, all which are conducive to stress reduction and relaxation. Therefore, the answer is 'become more relaxed and less stressed'."},{"instruction":"Information: - Melissa Arnette \\"Missy\\" Elliott (born July 1, 1971), often known professionally as Missy \\"Misdemeanor\\" Elliott, is an American rapper, dancer, and record producer.

Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.

This is surprising. After all the Essential Phone was the perfect opportunity to see what Andy Rubin the \\"Father of Android\\" and leader of Essential had to say about the Android OS' direction since he left Google in 2014. Would he put his personal touch on the software showing us what the OS might have looked like had he stayed at Google? As it turns out it appears instead that Rubin had more to say about a smartphone's design than he did about the Android OS. I suppose I was expecting something different from Rubin . He did mention in May that the Essential Phone would run stock Android but I wasn't expecting him to have such an extremely light touch and to barely alter anything about the OS. Rubin created Android so he 's no stranger to developing mobile phone software. And given how much attention Essential paid to every little detail of the phone's hardware it's a good bet that Rubin didn't just go with the plain version of Android out of sheer laziness. The move suggests that Rubin believes stock Android is still the best Android compared to what you see on phones from Samsung LG and the numerous Chinese companies like Huawei. Stock Android means none of the duplicate apps from the smartphone maker and carrier cluttering things up. Android looks and works exactly the way Google intended it to. To be clear those companies make great phones as their popularity shows. Yet I've always believed that nothing beats stock Android. So thanks Andy Rubin for backing me up.

After returning home to his entirely voice-activated, computer-controlled house, Harris is working in his basement laboratory when he is approached by his estranged wife, Susan (Julie Christie), a child psychologist by profession, who tries to discuss with him his decision to move out of the house.

After Susan has gone, Alex phones his colleague Walter Gabler (Gerrit Graham) and asks him to shut down the access terminal to Proteus that is in his home laboratory.Alex demonstrates Proteus to executives of ICON, the company which funded its development, explaining that the sum total of human knowledge is being fed into the system.

Stream of thoughts:","output":"Based on the given premise, \\"Two dogs approach each other in the grass,\\" we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis, \\"The dogs are related,\\" is entailed by the premise. Step-by-step analysis: 1. The premise states that two dogs are approaching each other in the grass. This provides information about the location and behavior of the dogs but does not give any details about their relationship or if they have any connection. 2. The hypothesis suggests that the two dogs could be related. This is essentially an assumption based on the fact that they are approaching each other, but there is no concrete evidence that supports this claim. 3. In order to determine the probability of the hypothesis being true, we would require more information about the two dogs, such as their breeds, owners, and previous interactions. 4. Since the premise does not provide sufficient information about the dogs' relationship, we cannot draw a conclusion about whether or not they are related. In summary, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise due to a lack of information about the dogs' relationship. The premise only describes the dogs' behavior and location but does not give any evidence supporting the claim that they are related."},{"instruction":"Question: In order for boulders to become sediments, the boulders must first be What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices?

Now, does that mean he won a big prize for being super good at playing with people's minds? Not necessarily. It just tells us he's good at those tricks, but we don't know if he got an award for them.

Greg Abbott said Monday he expects to legally challenge President Barack Obama's new immigration action \\"in the next two weeks.\\" Abbott, currently the attorney general in Texas, said he's reaching out to other governors and top state attorneys about joining the expected lawsuit. \\"Our constitutional structure does not work when our president is untethered from the law. That is what has happened here,\\" he said at a news conference Monday. Abbott's charge against Obama's executive order limiting deportations has vaulted the Republican onto the national stage, giving him a lead role on a prominent issue just as he prepares to replace outgoing Gov. Rick Perry. \\"If history repeats itself even in the slightest, OPTIONS: - Abbott will once again sustain consequences from the president's executive order,\\" Abbott said. - Barack Obama will once again sustain consequences from the president's executive order,\\" Abbott said. - Greg Abbott will once again sustain consequences from the president's executive order,\\" Abbott said. - Obama will once again sustain consequences from the president's executive order,\\" Abbott said. - Republican will once again sustain consequences from the president's executive order,\\" Abbott said. - Rick Perry will once again sustain consequences from the president's executive order,\\" Abbott said. - Texas will once again sustain consequences from the president's executive order,\\" Abbott said.","output":"- Texas will once again sustain consequences from the president's executive order,\\" Abbott said. In this story, the main focus is on Texas Governor Greg Abbott's intent to challenge President Obama's immigration executive order due to its effects on Texas. Therefore, the most plausible ending would be about Texas sustaining consequences once again from the president's executive order, as per Abbott's statement. Here's why the other choices are less suitable: 1. First Option: This option has Abbott saying that Abbott (referring to himself) will sustain consequences from the president's executive order. This is less relevant because it's not Abbott as an individual that would face consequences, but rather the state of Texas. 2. Second, Fourth and Sixth Options: The phrase \\"Barack Obama will once again sustain consequences\\" or \\"Obama will once again sustain consequences\\" is not a logical ending to the story since President Obama's executive order is what's causing the consequences. 3. Fifth Option: The focus of the story is on Texas, not the Republican party. It is less relevant to say that the \\"Republican will once again sustain consequences.\\" 4. Seventh Option: Rick Perry is the outgoing governor, and the focus of this story is on incoming Gov. Abbott. Thus, it's less relevant to choose an option that highlights the impact on Rick Perry."},{"instruction":"Face of Evil is a 1996 TV movie starring Jeanelle Polk as Shawnee Smith , Perry King as Russell Polk and Darcy Palmer as his daughter Tracey Gold .
