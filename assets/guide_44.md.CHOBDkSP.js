First, let's consider the Sylow 5-subgroup Q. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 8 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, n_5 can be either 1 or 8. If n_5 = 1, then Q is a normal subgroup of G. If n_5 = 8, then the action of G on the set of its Sylow 5-subgroups by conjugation gives a homomorphism from G to S_8. Since the order of G is 40, the image of this homomorphism has order dividing 40. However, the only non-trivial normal subgroup of S_8 with order dividing 40 is A_5, which has order 60. This is a contradiction, so n_5 must be 1, and Q is a normal subgroup of G. Now, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroup P. By the third Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 5 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 5. If n_2 = 1, then P is a normal subgroup of G. If n_2 = 5, then the action of G on the set of its Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation gives a homomorphism from G to S_5. Since the order of G is 40, the image of this homomorphism has order dividing 40. However, the only non-trivial normal subgroup of S_5 with order dividing 40 is A_5, which has order 60. This is a contradiction, so n_2 must be 1, and P is a normal subgroup of G. Since both P and Q are normal subgroups of G, their intersection P ∩ Q is also a normal subgroup of G. However, since the orders of P and Q are coprime, their intersection must be trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Therefore, G is the internal direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ P × Q. Now, we know that P has order 8 and Q has order 5. The only abelian groups of order 8 are C8 and C4 × C2, and the only group of order 5 is C5. Since Q is normal in G, we can use the following isomorphism theorems: 1. If P ≅ C8, then G ≅ C8 × C5 ≅ C40. 2. If P ≅ C4 × C2, then G ≅ (C4 × C2) × C5 ≅ C4 × (C2 × C5) ≅ C4 × C10 ≅ D20. In both cases, G is isomorphic to an abelian group, either C40 or D20. Now, let's consider the non-abelian groups of order 40. There are eight such groups, which can be obtained by taking a non-abelian group of order 8, such as the dihedral group D4 or the quaternion group Q8, and forming the direct product with the cyclic group C5. In each case, the resulting group will have order 40 and will be non-abelian.

Prove that if G has an element of order 5, then G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C40 or the dihedral group D20.","output":"Let G be a group of order 40, and let x be an element of order 5 in G. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of the subgroup generated by x, denoted as ⟨x⟩, is 5. Since 5 is a prime, ⟨x⟩ is a cyclic group of order 5. Now, let's consider the possible orders of elements in G. By Cauchy's theorem, G must have an element of order 2, since 2 divides the order of G. Let y be an element of order 2 in G. Note that the order of the subgroup generated by y, denoted as ⟨y⟩, is 2. Since the orders of ⟨x⟩ and ⟨y⟩ are coprime (5 and 2 are coprime), by the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, there exists a subgroup H of G such that G is the internal direct product of ⟨x⟩ and ⟨y⟩, i.e., G = ⟨x⟩ × ⟨y⟩. This means that every element g in G can be uniquely represented as g = x^i * y^j, where 0 ≤ i ≤ 4 and 0 ≤ j ≤ 1. Now, we have two cases to consider: Case 1: xy = yx In this case, the elements of G commute with each other, which means G is an abelian group. Since G is generated by x and y, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C40, which is the direct product of C5 and C2. Case 2: xy ≠ yx In this case, the elements of G do not commute with each other. We can show that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D20. Recall that the dihedral group D20 is generated by two elements a and b, where a has order 20, b has order 2, and b * a = a^(-1) * b. Define a mapping φ: G → D20 as follows: φ(x^i * y^j) = a^i * b^j We will show that φ is an isomorphism. 1. φ is a homomorphism: Let g1 = x^i * y^j and g2 = x^k * y^l in G. Then, φ(g1 * g2) = φ(x^i * y^j * x^k * y^l) = φ(x^i * x^k * y^j * y^l) (since y has order 2, y^2 = e) Now, since xy ≠ yx, we have xy = yx^(-1). So, φ(g1 * g2) = φ(x^i * x^k * y^j * y^l) = φ(x^(i+k) * y^(j+l)) = a^(i+k) * b^(j+l) = (a^i * b^j) * (a^k * b^l) = φ(x^i * y^j) * φ(x^k * y^l) = φ(g1) * φ(g2) 2. φ is injective: Suppose φ(g1) = φ(g2) for some g1, g2 in G. Then, a^i * b^j = a^k * b^l Since a and b generate D20, we must have i = k and j = l. Thus, g1 = g2, and φ is injective. 3. φ is surjective: Every element of D20 can be written as a^i * b^j for some 0 ≤ i ≤ 19 and 0 ≤ j ≤ 1. Since G has order 40 and ⟨x⟩ and ⟨y⟩ have orders 5 and 2, respectively, there exist elements x^i * y^j in G such that φ(x^i * y^j) = a^i * b^j. Thus, φ is surjective. Since φ is a homomorphism, injective, and surjective, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to D20.

We know that the order of G is 40, and we have elements of order 5, 2, 2, and 2. Since there is an element of order 5, G cannot be a dihedral group D20 (as all elements in D20 have order 1, 2, or 4). Now, let's consider the cyclic group C40. In a cyclic group, there is a single generator element, say g, such that every other element in the group can be expressed as a power of g. However, in G, we have elements of order 2 and 5, which cannot be expressed as powers of a single generator element. Therefore, G is not isomorphic to C40. Next, let's analyze the eight non-abelian groups of order 40. These groups can be represented as semi-direct products of cyclic groups. In particular, we can represent G as a semi-direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 (generated by a) and a cyclic group of order 8 (generated by b, c, and d).  The structure of G can be described as follows: 1. The cyclic subgroup generated by a has order 5: {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4}. 2. The cyclic subgroup generated by b, c, and d has order 8: {e, b, c, d, bc, bd, cd, bcd}. 3. The product of elements from the two subgroups results in the remaining elements of G. Since G can be represented as a semi-direct product of cyclic groups, it must be isomorphic to one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40. To determine which one, we can look at the relations between the generators a, b, c, and d. In G, we have the following relations: 1. a^5 = e 2. b^2 = c^2 = d^2 = e 3. bcd = e (since bcd is the only element of order 2 in the subgroup generated by b, c, and d that is not included in the list) Now, let's compare these relations to the eight non-abelian groups of order 40: 1. C5 ⋊ C8: This group has a similar structure to G, but it has a single element of order 2 in the second cyclic subgroup, which is not the case for G. 2. C5 ⋊ Q8: This group has a quaternion structure in the second cyclic subgroup, which is not the case for G. 3. C5 ⋊ D4: This group has a dihedral structure in the second cyclic subgroup, which is not the case for G. 4. C5 ⋊ (C2 × C4): This group has a similar structure to G, but it has two elements of order 4 in the second cyclic subgroup, which is not the case for G. 5. C5 ⋊ (C2 × Q4): This group has a quaternion structure in the second cyclic subgroup, which is not the case for G. 6. C5 ⋊ (C2 × D2): This group has a dihedral structure in the second cyclic subgroup, which is not the case for G. 7.

Two groups are isomorphic if there exists a bijective function between the groups that preserves the group operation. Now, let's consider the given group G of order 40.

However, we are given that every Sylow 5-subgroup is cyclic, which implies that there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup (otherwise, the intersection of two distinct Sylow 5-subgroups would be non-trivial, contradicting the fact that they are cyclic). So n_5 = 1. Let P be the unique Sylow 5-subgroup of G. Since P has order 5, which is prime, P is cyclic and isomorphic to C5. Now, let's find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2.

Now, since n_5 = n_2 = 1, both P and Q are normal subgroups of G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are coprime (5 and 8), their intersection is trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. By the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, G is the internal direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ P x Q. Since P is isomorphic to C5, we have three possibilities for G: 1. G ≅ C5 x C8, 2.

Similarly, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can be either 1 or 8. Now, we consider the possible cases: 1. n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 1: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 8 and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup Q of order 5. Since both P and Q are normal in G, their product PQ is also a subgroup of G. The order of PQ is |PQ| = |P| * |Q| / |P ∩ Q| = 8 * 5 / 1 = 40. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is the cyclic group of order 40, C_40. 2. n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 8: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 8, but there are 8 Sylow 5-subgroups. Since P is normal in G, G has a semidirect product structure with P as the normal subgroup. The action of the Sylow 5-subgroup on P determines the group structure. Since P is abelian, there are two possible actions: the trivial action and the non-trivial action. The trivial action gives the direct product C_8 × C_5, which is isomorphic to C_40.

Now, we will use the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, which states that every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. We will consider the partitions of the exponents of the prime factors. For the exponent of 2 (which is 3), we have the following partitions: 1. 3 2. 2, 1 3. 1, 1, 1 For the exponent of 5 (which is 1), we have only one partition: 1. 1 Now, we will find the direct products of cyclic groups corresponding to these partitions. 1.

We can use the semidirect product to combine the Sylow subgroups. However, since the automorphism group of Z_5 is of order 4, which is coprime to 8, the action of the Sylow 2-subgroup on the Sylow 5-subgroups is trivial. This means that the semidirect product is actually a direct product, and we have already considered these cases in Case 1.

The conjugacy classes in D20 are as follows: one class for the identity, 19 classes of order 2 (corresponding to the 20 reflections), and two classes of order 20 (corresponding to the 20 rotations).

Using this theorem, we can find the non-isomorphic groups of order 40 by considering the possible semi-direct products of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups. 1. Sylow 2-subgroups: Since 40 = 2^3 * 5^1, there are two possibilities for the order of a Sylow 2-subgroup: 2^2 = 4 and 2^3 = 8. For order 4, there is only one group up to isomorphism, which is the cyclic group Z_4. For order 8, there are three groups up to isomorphism: the cyclic group Z_8, the dihedral group D_4, and the quaternion group Q_8. 2.

Z_4 and Z_5: There is only one non-trivial homomorphism from Z_5 to Aut(Z_4), which is given by the automorphism x -> x^3 in Z_4. This gives us two semi-direct products: the direct product Z_4 × Z_5, which is isomorphic to Z_20, and the non-abelian group of order 40 with presentation ⟨a, b | a^4 = b^5 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^3⟩. 2. Z_8 and Z_5: There are two non-trivial homomorphisms from Z_5 to Aut(Z_8), which are given by the automorphisms x -> x^3 and x -> x^7 in Z_8. Both of these homomorphisms give the same semi-direct product up to isomorphism, which is the non-abelian group of order 40 with presentation ⟨a, b | a^8 = b^5 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^3⟩. 3.

We can use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups and their structures. Let G be a group of order 40. By Sylow's theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups, n_5, must divide 2^3 = 8 and n_5 ≡ 1 mod 5. So n_5 can be 1 or 8. If n_5 = 1, then there is a unique normal 5-Sylow subgroup, which we denote by P_5. If n_5 = 8, then the 5-Sylow subgroups are not normal. Similarly, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 5 and n_2 ≡ 1 mod 2. So n_2 can be 1 or 5. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique normal 2-Sylow subgroup, which we denote by P_2. If n_2 = 5, then the 2-Sylow subgroups are not normal. Now we can consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups: 1. Both P_2 and P_5 are normal: In this case, G is a direct product of P_2 and P_5, and since both subgroups are abelian, G is abelian. This case doesn't give us a non-abelian group. 2. P_2 is normal, but P_5 is not: In this case, G is a semidirect product of P_2 and P_5. Since P_5 is cyclic of order 5, it has an automorphism group of order 4. The 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 can have orders 4 or 8. If P_2 has order 4, it is isomorphic to either Z_4 or V_4 (the Klein four-group). If P_2 has order 8, it is isomorphic to one of Z_8, Q_8 (the quaternion group), or D_4 (the dihedral group of order 8). This gives us 5 possible non-abelian groups in this case. 3. P_5 is normal, but P_2 is not: In this case, G is a semidirect product of P_5 and P_2. Since P_2 is a 2-group, its automorphism group is also a 2-group. However, P_5 has order 5, which is not a power of 2, so there is no nontrivial action of P_2 on P_5. This case doesn't give us a non-abelian group. 4. Neither P_2 nor P_5 are normal: In this case, G is a non-split extension of P_2 by P_5. Since P_5 has an automorphism group of order 4, there are 3 possible non-abelian groups in this case.

This group has order 40, with elements of order 10 and 4. The relation ab = ba^(-1) indicates that the group is non-abelian. Since a has order 10, the 5-Sylow subgroup generated by a is normal in the group. This means we are in case 2 above, where P_2 is not normal and P_5 is normal. The 5-Sylow subgroup is generated by a, and the 2-Sylow subgroup is generated by b. Since b has order 4, the 2-Sylow subgroup is isomorphic to Z_4. The action of b on the 5-Sylow subgroup is given by conjugation: bab^{-1} = ba^1b^{-1} = ba^{-1} = a^9. This is an automorphism of order 4 on the 5-Sylow subgroup. Thus, the group defined by the presentation is a semidirect product of a normal 5-Sylow subgroup isomorphic to Z_10 and a 2-Sylow subgroup isomorphic to Z_4, with the action of the 2-Sylow subgroup on the 5-Sylow subgroup given by the automorphism of order 4.

We need to count the number of non-trivial homomorphisms from each of these groups to Z_4.    a) For Q = Z_8, there are three non-trivial homomorphisms to Z_4 (since Z_4 has three non-identity elements).    b) For Q = Z_4 x Z_2, there are three non-trivial homomorphisms from Z_4 to Z_4 and one non-trivial homomorphism from Z_2 to Z_4. However, we need to subtract the one homomorphism that is the direct product of these two (to avoid double counting), so there are 3 + 1 - 1 = 3 non-trivial homomorphisms.    c) For Q = Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms to Z_4, since Z_4 has no non-trivial elements of order 2. 5.

Since both subgroups are normal, their product P_2 * P_5 is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since P_2 and P_5 have trivial intersection, the order of P_2 * P_5 is 8 * 5 = 40, which is the order of G. Thus, G is the direct product of P_2 and P_5, i.e., G = P_2 x P_5. Since P_5 is cyclic (of prime order), the only possibility for G to be non-abelian is if P_2 is non-abelian. The only non-abelian group of order 8 is the dihedral group D_4. Therefore, in this case, G is isomorphic to D_4 x Z_5.

We can now analyze the possible structures of the 2-Sylow and 5-Sylow subgroups. For the 2-Sylow subgroups of order 8, there are three possibilities: Z_8 (cyclic group), Z_2 × Z_4 (direct product of two cyclic groups), and D_4 (dihedral group). For the 5-Sylow subgroups of order 5, there is only one possibility: Z_5 (cyclic group). Now, we can analyze the possible combinations of these subgroups and their semi-direct products. A semi-direct product is a generalization of the direct product, allowing for non-abelian groups. It is denoted as ⋊. We have: 1. Z_8 ⋊ Z_5 2. Z_2 × Z_4 ⋊ Z_5 3. D_4 ⋊ Z_5 Each of these semi-direct products can be further analyzed based on the possible homomorphisms between the groups. For example, for the second case (Z_2 × Z_4 ⋊ Z_5), there are two possible homomorphisms from Z_5 to Aut(Z_2 × Z_4), leading to two distinct non-abelian groups. Similarly, for the third case (D_4 ⋊ Z_5), there are four possible homomorphisms from Z_5 to Aut(D_4), leading to four distinct non-abelian groups. In total, we have 1 + 2 + 4 = 8 non-abelian groups of order 40. To show that these groups are non-abelian, we can look at the semi-direct product structure. If the semi-direct product is isomorphic to a direct product, then the group is abelian. However, for the cases we have analyzed, the semi-direct products are not isomorphic to direct products, and thus, the groups are non-abelian."},{"instruction":"Determine the number of distinct groups of order 40 up to isomorphism, and identify each group as either cyclic, dihedral, or non-abelian.","output":"To determine the number of distinct groups of order 40 up to isomorphism, we first find the prime factorization of 40.

The possible structures for a group of order 8 are Z_8 (cyclic) and Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 (elementary abelian). If n_2 = 5, then there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups, and each has 7 elements of order 2 (since the identity element is not of order 2). In this case, there are 5 * 7 = 35 elements of order 2 in G.

Recall that the order of a group is the number of elements in the group. The Sylow theorems provide information about the possible structure of a group based on its order. First, let's find the Sylow subgroups of G. The order of G is 40, which can be factored as 2^3 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must satisfy: 1. n_2 divides 5 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2) 2. n_5 divides 8 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5) For n_2, the possible values are 1 and 5. For n_5, the possible values are 1 and 8. Case 1: n_2 = n_5 = 1 In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 8 and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5. Both P_2 and P_5 are normal in G since they are unique. The product of their orders is equal to the order of G, so by the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, G is a direct product of P_2 and P_5, i.e., G ≅ P_2 × P_5. Since P_2 and P_5 are cyclic (orders 8 and 5 are prime powers), G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C40. Case 2: n_2 = 1, n_5 = 8 In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 8 and eight Sylow 5-subgroups of order 5. P_2 is normal in G, but the Sylow 5-subgroups are not. Since P_2 is normal and has order 8, it must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C8, C4 × C2, or D4. We can rule out C8 and C4 × C2 because they would force G to be abelian, which contradicts the assumption that G is non-abelian. Therefore, P_2 must be isomorphic to D4. Now, let P_5 be one of the Sylow 5-subgroups. Since P_5 has order 5, it is cyclic and isomorphic to C5. The semi-direct product of P_2 and P_5 gives a non-abelian group of order 40.

P_5 is normal in G, but the Sylow 2-subgroups are not. Since P_5 is normal and has order 5, it must be isomorphic to C5. The semi-direct product of one of the Sylow 2-subgroups and P_5 gives a non-abelian group of order 40. There are eight such non-abelian groups, which are distinct from the cyclic group C40 and the dihedral group D20.

For the Sylow 2-subgroups, there are two possibilities: either there is one Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8 (which we denote as n_2 = 1) or there are five Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8 (n_2 = 5).

The structure of this semidirect product depends on the action of Q on P, which is determined by a homomorphism φ: Q → Aut(P). Now, |Aut(P)| = |Aut(Z_5)| = 4, where Z_5 is the cyclic group of order 5. Since |Q| = 8, we have two possibilities for φ: 1. φ is trivial, i.e., φ(q) = id for all q in Q. In this case, the semidirect product P ⋊ Q is actually a direct product, and G is isomorphic to Z_5 × Z_8, which is an abelian group. 2. φ is non-trivial, i.e., there exists q in Q such that φ(q) is not the identity automorphism. In this case, the semidirect product P ⋊ Q is not a direct product, and G is non-abelian. Since we are looking for a non-abelian group, we consider the second case. The non-trivial automorphisms of P are of order 2 or 4. If φ(Q) has an element of order 4, then Q must have an element of order 4 as well. However, this would imply that Q is not a 2-Sylow subgroup, which is a contradiction. Therefore, φ(Q) must have an element of order 2.

The order of C7 is 7 and the order of C8 is 8. Since 7 and 8 are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), the order of the group C7 × C8 is 7 * 8 = 56. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to C7 × C8 since their orders are different (40 ≠ 56). Now let's consider the other possibilities: 1. Cyclic group C40: A cyclic group of order 40 has a single generator, and every element can be expressed as a power of the generator. If G is isomorphic to C40, then G is a cyclic group of order 40. 2. Dihedral group D20: The dihedral group D20 has order 2 * 20 = 40. It consists of 20 rotations and 20 reflections, and its elements can be represented as {r^n, sr^n} where n = 0, 1, ..., 19 and r is a rotation and s is a reflection.

We will consider each case separately. Case 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1 In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 16 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q of order 3. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are coprime, we have G = PQ, and G is isomorphic to the direct product P × Q. Since P is a group of order 16, it is either cyclic (C16) or a direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 and 8 (C2 × C8). In either case, G is isomorphic to a cyclic group of order 48 (C48). Case 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1 In this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 16, and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q of order 3. Since Q is unique, it is normal in G. Let P be any Sylow 2-subgroup. Then, since the orders of P and Q are coprime, we have G = PQ, and G is a semidirect product P ⋊ Q. The action of Q on P can be either trivial or nontrivial. If the action is trivial, G is isomorphic to the direct product P × Q, and we are in the same situation as in Case 1. If the action is nontrivial, G is one of the non-abelian groups of order 48. Case 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4 In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 16 and four Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3. Since P is unique, it is normal in G. Let Q be any Sylow 3-subgroup. Then, since the orders of P and Q are coprime, we have G = PQ, and G is a semidirect product P ⋊ Q. The action of Q on P can be either trivial or nontrivial. If the action is trivial, G is isomorphic to the direct product P × Q, and we are in the same situation as in Case 1. If the action is nontrivial, G is one of the non-abelian groups of order 48. Case 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4 In this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 16 and four Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3. Let P be any Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be any Sylow 3-subgroup. Since the orders of P and Q are coprime, we have G = PQ, and G is a semidirect product P ⋊ Q. The action of Q on P can be either trivial or nontrivial. If the action is trivial, G is isomorphic to the direct product P × Q, and we are in the same situation as in Case 1. If the action is nontrivial, G is one of the non-abelian groups of order 48. In summary, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C48, the alternating group A4 × C4 (which occurs when the action of Q on P is trivial in Cases 2, 3, or 4), or one of the non-abelian groups of order 48 (which occurs when the action of Q on P is nontrivial in Cases 2, 3, or 4)."},{"instruction":"Let G be a group of order 48.

Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, divides 2^4 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be either 1 or 4. Case 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1 If both n_2 and n_3 are 1, then G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup Q. Both P and Q are normal in G, and G is the internal direct product of P and Q. Since |P| = 2^4 and |Q| = 3, P is isomorphic to C16 and Q is isomorphic to C3. Thus, G is isomorphic to C16 × C3, which is isomorphic to C48. Case 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1 In this case, G has a unique 3-Sylow subgroup Q, which is normal in G. Let P be any 2-Sylow subgroup of G. Then |P ∩ Q| = 1, since their orders are coprime. By the second isomorphism theorem, we have G/Q is isomorphic to a subgroup of PQ/Q, which is isomorphic to P. Since |G/Q| = 3, G/Q is isomorphic to C3. Thus, G has a normal subgroup of order 16. Now, let H be a normal subgroup of order 16 in G. Then G/H is isomorphic to C3, and G is an extension of H by C3. Since Aut(H) has order 32, which is coprime to 3, there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) semi-direct product of H by C3, denoted as H ⋊ C3. In this case, G is isomorphic to H ⋊ C3. Since H is a group of order 16, it can be isomorphic to C16, C8 × C2, C4 × C4, or C2 × C2 × C2 × C2. For each of these possibilities, we can find a semi-direct product with C3, which gives us 4 non-abelian groups of order 48. However, we need to find an isomorphism between G and one of the given groups. If H is isomorphic to C4 × C4, then G is isomorphic to (C4 × C4) ⋊ C3.

By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 16 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4. Now, let's analyze the possible structures of the groups: 1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup.

The group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup.

If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, both Sylow subgroups have more than one possible conjugate. In this case, we can't determine the structure of the group directly, but we can use the fact that the total number of groups of order 48 is 10 (including abelian and non-abelian). Since we have already found 4 groups in the previous cases (1 abelian and 3 non-abelian), there must be 6 non-abelian groups in this case.

By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy: 1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2) 2. n_3 divides 2^4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3) From these conditions, we have n_2 ∈ {1, 3} and n_3 ∈ {1, 4}. We will analyze each case separately. Case 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1 In this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 16 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since both subgroups are unique, they are normal in G. Moreover, P_2 ∩ P_3 = {e}, where e is the identity element. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3, which has order 48. Since P_2 is a group of order 16, it can be isomorphic to either C16, C8 × C2, C4 × C4, or C4 × C2 × C2. The only possibility that gives a group of order 48 when taking the direct product with P_3 is C16, so G is isomorphic to C48 in this case. Case 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4 In this case, G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Let P_2 be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups and P_3 be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. Since n_3 = 4, the action of G on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups by conjugation is a homomorphism from G to S_4. The kernel of this homomorphism, K, is the largest normal subgroup of G contained in P_2. Since |K| divides |P_2| = 16, we have |K| ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}.  If |K| = 16, then K = P_2, which contradicts the fact that P_2 is not normal in G. If |K| = 8, then G/K is a group of order 6, which is isomorphic to either C6 or S_3. If G/K is isomorphic to C6, then G is abelian, which implies that G is isomorphic to A4 × C4. If G/K is isomorphic to S_3, then G is one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48.

If G is isomorphic to C48, then it must have a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup (since a cyclic group has a unique subgroup of each order dividing the group order). This means n_2 = n_3 = 1. This is a possibility, so G could be isomorphic to C48. Case 2: G is isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C4. The group A4 × C4 has order 48, and its Sylow 2-subgroups are isomorphic to C4 × C4, while its Sylow 3-subgroups are isomorphic to A4. In this case, n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4.

Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. The order of P_2 * P_3 is |P_2| * |P_3| = 16 * 3 = 48, which is the order of G.

Therefore, there exists a subgroup H of G with order 4. Since H is a subgroup of both N(P_2) and N(P_3), it follows that H is normal in both N(P_2) and N(P_3). Now, consider the semidirect product of P_2 and P_3 with respect to H. Since H is normal in both N(P_2) and N(P_3), this semidirect product is well-defined and has order 48.

If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which is a cyclic group of order 48, denoted as C48. 2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and one Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, we have two non-isomorphic groups: the semidirect product of C16 and C3, denoted as C16 ⋊ C3, and the semidirect product of Q16 (the generalized quaternion group of order 16) and C3, denoted as Q16 ⋊ C3. 3. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, the group is a semidirect product of C16 and C2, denoted as C16 ⋊ C2. 4. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, we have one non-isomorphic group: the semidirect product of Q16 and C2, denoted as Q16 ⋊ C2. In total, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 48: C48, C16 ⋊ C3, Q16 ⋊ C3, C16 ⋊ C2, and Q16 ⋊ C2. Now, let's determine whether each of the non-abelian groups is isomorphic to C48 or A4 × C4: 1. C16 ⋊ C3: This group is non-abelian and has order 48, so it cannot be isomorphic to the abelian group C48. It also has a different structure than A4 × C4, so it is not isomorphic to A4 × C4. 2. Q16 ⋊ C3: This group is non-abelian and has order 48, so it cannot be isomorphic to C48. It also has a different structure than A4 × C4, so it is not isomorphic to A4 × C4. 3.

Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 48, and it is isomorphic to C48. Case 2: G does not contain an element of order 48. By Sylow's Theorem, we know that there exists a Sylow 16-subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup in G. Let P be a Sylow 16-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 3-subgroup. The number of Sylow 16-subgroups is equal to n_16, which divides 48/16 = 3, and n_16 is congruent to 1 modulo 16. Thus, n_16 can be either 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is equal to n_3, which divides 48/3 = 16, and n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1, 4, or 16. If n_16 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 16-subgroup, which is normal in G. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is also normal in G. In this case, G must contain at least one normal subgroup of order 16 and another normal subgroup of order 3. Now, we have |P| = 16 and |Q| = 3, and since gcd(16, 3) = 1, we have |P ∩ Q| = 1. By the product formula, we have |PQ| = |P||Q|/|P ∩ Q| = 16 * 3 = 48. Thus, G = PQ. Since P and Q are both normal in G, G is a semidirect product of P and Q.  There are 15 possible groups of order 48 that can be formed as a semidirect product of P and Q. One of them is the direct product A4 × C4, which is abelian. The other 14 groups are non-abelian.

Let G be a non-abelian group of order 48. The order of G can be factored as 48 = 2^4 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy the following conditions: 1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2. 2. n_3 divides 16 and n_3 is congruent to 1 mod 3. From condition 1, we see that n_2 can be either 1 or 3. From condition 2, we see that n_3 can be either 1, 4, or 16. Now, let's consider the center of G, denoted as Z(G). The center of a group is the set of all elements that commute with every element in the group. In other words, Z(G) = {g ∈ G | gx = xg for all x ∈ G}. We want to determine if Z(G) is trivial (i.e., contains only the identity element) or non-trivial. Suppose that Z(G) is non-trivial. Then, by the class equation, we have: |G| = |Z(G)| + ∑[G:C_G(x)], where the sum is taken over a set of representatives x of the non-central conjugacy classes, and C_G(x) denotes the centralizer of x in G. Since G is non-abelian, |Z(G)| < |G|. Also, |G:C_G(x)| divides |G|, so it must be a multiple of 2, 3, or 6. If |G:C_G(x)| = 2, then C_G(x) has index 2 in G, which implies that C_G(x) is a normal subgroup of G. However, this would mean that G has a non-trivial normal subgroup, contradicting the assumption that G is non-abelian. Therefore, |G:C_G(x)| must be a multiple of 3 or 6. Now, let's consider the possibilities for n_3: 1. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal in G. This contradicts the assumption that G is non-abelian. 2. If n_3 = 4 or 16, then there are at least 4 distinct Sylow 3-subgroups. Each of these subgroups has order 3, so they have 2 non-identity elements. Since the Sylow 3-subgroups are distinct, there are at least 4 * 2 = 8 non-identity elements of order 3 in G. Since |G:C_G(x)| must be a multiple of 3 or 6, we have: |G| = |Z(G)| + 3a + 6b, where a and b are non-negative integers. Since |Z(G)| > 1 (as we assumed Z(G) is non-trivial), we have: 48 > 1 + 3a + 6b. However, this inequality implies that there are fewer than 8 non-identity elements of order 3 in G, which contradicts the fact that there are at least 8 such elements.

Now, let's analyze each case: Case 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1 In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. By the Sylow theorems, these subgroups are normal in G. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup of order 16 and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3.

Since there are 47 elements of order 2 in G, there is only one element of order 1, which is the identity element e. This means that all non-identity elements in P must have order 2. P is a group of order 16, and the only group of order 16 with all non-identity elements having order 2 is the elementary abelian group (also known as a vector space over the field with 2 elements) of order 16, which we will denote as V_4(2). So, P is isomorphic to V_4(2). Now, let's consider the Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Since the index of Q in G is 16, which is the smallest prime divisor of the order of G, Q must be normal in G by the Normalizer-Centralizer Theorem. Thus, we have a normal subgroup Q of order 3 in G. Since P and Q are both normal subgroups of G, their intersection P ∩ Q must also be normal in G. However, P and Q have trivial intersection, as their orders are coprime (gcd(16, 3) = 1). Thus, P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element. Now, we have a normal subgroup Q of order 3 and a subgroup P of order 16 with trivial intersection. By the Product Formula, we have |PQ| = |P| * |Q| / |P ∩ Q| = 16 * 3 / 1 = 48. Since |PQ| = |G|, we have that PQ = G. Now, we have G = PQ with P and Q having trivial intersection and Q being normal in G. By the Internal Direct Product Theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ P × Q. Since P is isomorphic to V_4(2) and Q is a cyclic group of order 3 (as there is only one group of order 3, which is cyclic), we have G ≅ V_4(2) × C3.

First, let's find the Sylow subgroups of G. The order of G is 48 = 2^4 * 3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy: 1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2) 2. n_3 divides 2^4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3) From these conditions, we have n_2 ∈ {1, 3} and n_3 ∈ {1, 4}. Case 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1 In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. By the Sylow theorems, these subgroups are normal in G. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup of order 16 and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3. Since P and Q are both normal in G, their product PQ is also a subgroup of G, and |PQ| = |P| * |Q| / |P ∩ Q| = 16 * 3 / 1 = 48. Thus, G = PQ. Since P is a normal subgroup of G and Q is a subgroup of G, G is a semidirect product of P and Q. However, since P and Q have trivial intersection and their orders are relatively prime, G is actually a direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ P × Q. In this case, G is a cyclic group of order 48, so G ≅ C48. Case 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4 In this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Let P be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups and Q be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. Since there are multiple Sylow subgroups for both 2 and 3, neither P nor Q is normal in G. Thus, G cannot be a direct product of P and Q. However, G can still be a semidirect product of P and Q, which would result in a non-abelian group. There are 14 possible non-abelian groups of order 48, and G could be isomorphic to one of them. Case 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4 In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 16, which is normal in G, and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Let Q be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P is normal in G, G can be a semidirect product of P and Q. If G is a non-abelian group, it could be one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48. However, if G is an abelian group, then G ≅ P × Q. Since P has order 16 and Q has order 3, G would be isomorphic to C16 × C3, which is not isomorphic to A4 × C4. In conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C48, one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48, or an abelian group not isomorphic to A4 × C4.

Sylow 2-subgroups: By Sylow's theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 3.

The only possibility is n_3 = 1, so there is a unique (and hence normal) Sylow 3-subgroup, say P_3. 2.

Let Q be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. Since the index of Q in G is 3, which is the smallest prime divisor of |G|, by the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, there exists a subgroup H of order 3 in G such that G is the semidirect product of Q and H, i.e., G ≅ Q ⋊ H.  Now, let's analyze the action of H on Q by conjugation. Since Q is a 2-group and H is a 3-group, the action of H on Q by conjugation is non-trivial. This means that there exists a non-identity element h in H such that hqh^(-1) ≠ q for some q in Q. Since |H| = 3, the action of H on Q by conjugation is equivalent to the action of the cyclic group C3 on Q.  Let's consider the automorphism group Aut(Q) of Q. Since Q has order 16, Aut(Q) has order 32 or 48. In either case, Aut(Q) has a unique (and hence normal) Sylow 3-subgroup, say R. The action of H on Q by conjugation induces an automorphism of Q, which is an element of order 3 in Aut(Q). Thus, the induced automorphism must belong to R.  Now, let's consider the semidirect product of Q and R, i.e., Q ⋊ R. Since R is a normal subgroup of Aut(Q), Q ⋊ R is a subgroup of Aut(Q). Moreover, |Q ⋊ R| = |Q| * |R| = 48, so Q ⋊ R is a group of order 48. By construction, the action of R on Q by conjugation is the same as the action of H on Q by conjugation. Therefore, G is isomorphic to Q ⋊ R, which is the alternating group A4 × C4. In conclusion, given a specific group G of order 48, we can determine which of the three types of groups it is isomorphic to by analyzing its Sylow subgroups and their actions on each other. If G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup, it is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C48 or one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48.

Then, the product of P_2 and P_3, denoted by P_2P_3, is a subgroup of G with order 48. Since |G| = 48, we have G = P_2P_3. Now, we consider the semidirect product of P_2 and P_3, denoted by P_2 ⋊ P_3. Since P_3 ≅ C3, there are two possible actions of P_3 on P_2: the trivial action and the non-trivial action.

A group of order 60 has the form G = P x Q, where P and Q are Sylow subgroups of G. The Sylow theorems tell us that the number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group of order 60 is congruent to 1 mod p and divides 60.  For a group of order 60, we have the prime factorization 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5.

A group is non-abelian if it is not commutative, meaning that there exists at least one pair of elements (a, b) in the group such that ab ≠ ba. For a group of order 60 to be non-abelian, at least one of its Sylow subgroups must be non-abelian. The only Sylow subgroups that can be non-abelian are those of order 4 (Sylow 2-subgroups), since the Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups have prime order and are thus cyclic and abelian. There are two non-abelian groups of order 4: the dihedral group D_4 and the quaternion group Q_8. However, the quaternion group cannot be a Sylow 2-subgroup of a group of order 60, as it would force the group to have a normal 5-subgroup, which would make the group abelian. Therefore, the non-abelian Sylow 2-subgroup must be isomorphic to D_4. Now, we need to consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups that can form non-abelian groups of order 60. We have the following cases: 1. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1: In this case, there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, each isomorphic to D_4. The Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup are unique and normal in G. The group G can be constructed as the semidirect product of the Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup, with the action of the Sylow 2-subgroup on the product. There are 2 possible actions for each Sylow 2-subgroup, giving a total of 2^3 = 8 non-abelian groups in this case. 2. n_2 = 5, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1: In this case, there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups, each isomorphic to D_4. The Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup are unique and normal in G. The group G can be constructed as the semidirect product of the Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup, with the action of the Sylow 2-subgroup on the product. There are 2 possible actions for each Sylow 2-subgroup, giving a total of 2^5 = 32 non-abelian groups in this case. However, we have overcounted some isomorphic groups, as there are some groups that can be constructed in both cases. To correct for this overcounting, we need to subtract the number of groups that can be constructed in both cases. There are 4 such groups, corresponding to the 4 possible actions of the Sylow 2-subgroup on the product of the Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup that can be realized in both cases. Thus, the total number of non-abelian groups of order 60 is 8 + 32 - 4 = 36.

Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 10. 3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) divides 12 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 6. Now let's analyze the possibilities for G: 1. If G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C60, then G has a unique Sylow p-subgroup for each prime p dividing the order of G. In this case, n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1. This would mean that G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4, a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3, and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5. Since these subgroups are unique, they are all normal in G. The product of their orders is 4 * 3 * 5 = 60, which is the order of G. By the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, G is the direct product of these subgroups, which means G is isomorphic to C4 × C3 × C5. Since C4 × C3 × C5 is isomorphic to C60, G could be isomorphic to C60. 2. If G is isomorphic to the alternating group A5 × C2, then G has a normal subgroup isomorphic to A5. The order of A5 is 5!, which is divisible by 3 and 5. Thus, A5 has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which implies n_3 = n_5 = 1. The order of A5 is not divisible by 4, so A5 does not contain a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4. However, since the order of G is divisible by 4, G must have a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4. This means that n_2 > 1. Since A5 × C2 has a normal subgroup isomorphic to A5 and a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4, G could be isomorphic to A5 × C2. 3. For G to be one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, G must not be isomorphic to C60 or A5 × C2. This means that G cannot have a unique Sylow p-subgroup for each prime p dividing the order of G, and G cannot have a normal subgroup isomorphic to A5. Thus, G must have at least one of n_2 > 1, n_3 > 1, or n_5 > 1. Since there are 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, G could be one of these groups. In conclusion, without more information about the specific group G, we cannot definitively determine whether G is isomorphic to C60, A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60. However, we have shown that G could potentially be isomorphic to any of these groups based on the possible values of n_2, n_3, and n_5."},{"instruction":"What are the possible number of non-isomorphic groups of order 60?

If n_5 = 1, there is a normal Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5. If n_5 = 6, the Sylow 5-subgroups are not normal. Now, we consider the possible combinations of normal and non-normal Sylow subgroups: 1. If all the Sylow subgroups are normal (n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1), then the group is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which gives us an abelian group Z_4 × Z_3 × Z_5 ≅ Z_60. This is not a non-abelian group, so we discard this case. 2. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 10, and n_5 = 6, then the group has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4, and non-normal Sylow 3 and 5-subgroups. In this case, the group is a semi-direct product of the form (Z_3 × Z_5) ⋊ Z_4.

By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (let's call them P_5) divides 12 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. This means that there is either 1 or 6 Sylow 5-subgroups. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (let's call them P_3) divides 20 and is congruent to 1 modulo 3, which means there is either 1 or 10 Sylow 3-subgroups. If there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, then it is normal in G. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it is also normal in G. In this case, G would have a normal subgroup of order 3 and a normal subgroup of order 5. Since their orders are coprime, their intersection would be trivial, and by the product formula, G would be isomorphic to the direct product of these two normal subgroups, which is a contradiction since G is non-abelian. Thus, there must be 6 Sylow 5-subgroups and 10 Sylow 3-subgroups. Let P_5 be one of the Sylow 5-subgroups and P_3 be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. Then |P_5| = 5 and |P_3| = 3. Since P_5 and P_3 have coprime orders, by the product formula, the subgroup generated by P_5 and P_3 has order |P_5| * |P_3| = 15. Now, consider the action of G on the set of its Sylow 5-subgroups by conjugation. This action gives a homomorphism φ: G → S_6, where S_6 is the symmetric group on 6 elements. The kernel of φ, K, is the largest normal subgroup of G contained in all Sylow 5-subgroups. Since G is non-abelian, K cannot be G itself, so K must be a proper subgroup of G. Moreover, since G has no normal subgroups of order 15 (as shown above), K cannot be the subgroup generated by P_5 and P_3. Thus, K must be a subgroup of order 2^2 * 3 = 12. Now, consider the quotient group G/K. This group has order 60/12 = 5, so it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C_5. This means that G has a normal subgroup of order 12, which we will denote by N. Now, we have a normal subgroup N of order 12 and a subgroup P_5 of order 5. Since their orders are coprime, their intersection is trivial, and by the product formula, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of N and P_5. The isomorphism type of G is determined by the action of P_5 on N by conjugation. To determine the possible actions of P_5 on N, we can use the fact that the automorphism group of N, Aut(N), has order 12 (since N is isomorphic to A_4, the alternating group on 4 elements). The possible homomorphisms from P_5 to Aut(N) correspond to the possible actions of P_5 on N. Since P_5 is cyclic of order 5, there are at most 5 possible non-isomorphic actions, which correspond to the 5 possible subgroups of Aut(N) of order 5. Therefore, there are at most 5 non-isomorphic groups G that can be formed as the semidirect product of N and P_5.

Determine the action of P_5 on N by conjugation. 3. Identify the corresponding homomorphism from P_5 to Aut(N). 4. Use this homomorphism to construct the semidirect product of N and P_5. 5. Verify that the resulting group is one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.

Since these subgroups are unique, they are normal in G. The order of P_2 is 4, the order of P_3 is 3, and the order of P_5 is 5. Since the orders of P_2, P_3, and P_5 are pairwise coprime, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3 × P_5, which is a cyclic group of order 60. Thus, G is isomorphic to C60. Case 2: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 10, n_5 = 6 In this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 and 10 Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P_2 is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product P_3 ⋊ P_2. The automorphism group of P_3 is isomorphic to C2, so there are two possible semidirect products: the direct product P_3 × P_2, which is abelian, and a non-abelian group of order 12. Since the direct product is already accounted for in Case 1, we consider the non-abelian group of order 12, which is isomorphic to A4. Now, we have a normal subgroup A4 in G, and the quotient group G/A4 has order 5. By the correspondence theorem, there is a subgroup H of G such that H/A4 is isomorphic to C5. Since A4 is normal in G, the intersection of A4 and H is trivial. Thus, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product A4 ⋊ C5. The automorphism group of A4 is isomorphic to S4, which has a subgroup isomorphic to A5.

First, let's consider the Sylow p-subgroups of G. The order of G is 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide 12 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The possible values for n_5 are 1 and 6. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 20 and be congruent to 1 mod 3, so the possible values for n_3 are 1 and 10. Finally, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 15 and be congruent to 1 mod 2, so the possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, and 15. Now, let's analyze the possibilities: 1. If n_5 = n_3 = n_2 = 1, then G has unique Sylow 5, 3, and 2-subgroups, which are all normal.

In this case, G cannot be abelian, since an abelian group of order 60 must have a unique Sylow 5-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Therefore, G must be one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60. 3. If G is isomorphic to the alternating group A5 × C2, then G has a normal subgroup of order 5 (A5). In this case, n_5 = 6, and G has 6 Sylow 5-subgroups. Moreover, G has a normal subgroup of order 2 (C2), so n_2 = 1. The structure of G in this case is different from the structures in cases 1 and 2.

The intersection of these subgroups is trivial, and their product has order 15. Thus, G has a normal subgroup of order 15, which is isomorphic to C3 × C5.

In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, P_2, of order 4. Since there are 15 elements of order 4 in G, all of these elements must be in P_2. This implies that P_2 is cyclic, and G has a normal subgroup of order 4. Let P_3 and P_5 be Sylow 3 and 5-subgroups of G, respectively. Since P_2 is normal in G, the product P_2P_3 is a subgroup of G, and |P_2P_3| = |P_2||P_3|/|P_2 ∩ P_3| = 12. Similarly, the product P_2P_5 is a subgroup of G with order 20.

The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 15 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 ∈ {1, 3, 5, 15}. 2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 20 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 ∈ {1, 10}. 3.

However, if G is isomorphic to any of the latter three, it would have more than one Sylow 2-subgroup, which contradicts the fact that n_2 = 1. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to C60. Case 2: G is non-abelian. If G is non-abelian, then n_2 > 1. We will consider the cases n_2 = 3, 5, and 15 separately. Case 2.1: n_2 = 3. If n_2 = 3, then there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, each of order 4. Let P_2 be one of these subgroups. Since the index of P_2 in G is 15, which is the smallest prime divisor of |G|, P_2 is a normal subgroup of G. Now, let P_3 and P_5 be Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups of G, respectively.

If n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1, then there would be a unique Sylow p-subgroup for each prime p dividing the order of the group, and the group would be the direct product of these subgroups, which would be abelian. So, we must have either n_2 > 1 or n_3 > 1. If n_2 = 3, then there would be 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, each of order 4. Since the intersection of any two distinct Sylow 2-subgroups must be trivial, there would be 3 * (4 - 1) = 9 elements of order 2 in the group. If n_3 = 4, then there would be 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, each of order 3. Similarly, there would be 4 * (3 - 1) = 8 elements of order 3 in the group. However, this would account for 9 + 8 + 1 (the identity element) = 18 elements, which is not enough to form a group of order 60. Therefore, we must have n_3 = 10. So, we have n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 10. In this case, there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups and 10 Sylow 3-subgroups. Let P_2 be a Sylow 2-subgroup and P_3 be a Sylow 3-subgroup. Then |P_2| = 4 and |P_3| = 3. Since P_3 is a Sylow 3-subgroup, it is isomorphic to either Z_3 or the non-abelian group of order 3, but since there is no non-abelian group of order 3, P_3 must be isomorphic to Z_3. Similarly, P_2 must be isomorphic to either Z_4 or the non-abelian group of order 4, which is the Klein four-group V_4. If P_2 is isomorphic to Z_4, then the group would be the direct product of P_2 and P_3, which would be abelian. Therefore, P_2 must be isomorphic to V_4. Now, we can form a non-abelian group of order 60 by taking the semidirect product of P_3 and P_2, denoted as P_3 ⋊ P_2. To do this, we need a non-trivial homomorphism φ: P_2 → Aut(P_3). Since P_2 is isomorphic to V_4, it has three elements of order 2. The automorphism group of P_3, Aut(P_3), is isomorphic to Z_2, so there is a non-trivial homomorphism φ that maps each element of order 2 in P_2 to the non-identity automorphism of P_3.

For n_3, the possible values are 1 and 4. Case 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1 In this case, there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 3-subgroup, both of which are normal in G. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8 and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9. Since P and Q are both normal in G, their product PQ is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since |P| and |Q| are coprime, PQ is isomorphic to the direct product P × Q. Thus, G is isomorphic to a group of order 8 × 9 = 72, which is a cyclic group C72. Case 2: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4 In this case, there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup (P) and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P is normal in G, G has a normal subgroup of order 8. The factor group G/P has order 9, which is a power of 3, so G/P is isomorphic to either C9 or C3 × C3. If G/P is isomorphic to C9, then G is isomorphic to a semidirect product of P and a group of order 9. This gives us 9 non-abelian groups of order 72.

A group of order 72 has the form 2^3 * 3^2, so we can apply the Sylow theorems to find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups. Let n_2 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, n_2 must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). So, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, n_3 must divide 2^3 = 8 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). So, n_3 can be 1 or 4. Now, let's analyze the possibilities: 1. If n_2 = n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Since both are unique, they are both normal in the group. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup. Then, the group is isomorphic to the direct product P × Q, which is a cyclic group of order 72 (C72). 2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, then there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, we cannot guarantee that the group is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups. However, we can analyze the structure of the group further. Since there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, each of order 9, we know that there are 4 * (9 - 1) = 32 elements of order 9 in the group. This leaves 72 - 32 = 40 elements not of order 9. Among these 40 elements, there is the identity element and 39 remaining elements. Since there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, each of order 8, we know that there are 3 * (8 - 1) = 21 elements of order 8 in the group. This leaves 39 - 21 = 18 elements not of order 8 or 9. Now, we can consider the possibility of the group being isomorphic to A4 × C3 × C2. The group A4 has order 12, so A4 × C3 × C2 has order 12 * 3 * 2 = 72. The structure of A4 × C3 × C2 contains elements of order 2, 3, and 4, which can account for the remaining 18 elements not of order 8 or 9. Therefore, it is possible for the group to be isomorphic to A4 × C3 × C2. 3. If the group is not isomorphic to C72 or A4 × C3 × C2, then it must be one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72. In conclusion, without more information about the specific group of order 72, we cannot definitively determine whether it is isomorphic to C72, A4 × C3 × C2, or one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72.

The only possibility is 1, which means the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal. For Sylow 3-subgroups, the possible orders are 3 and 9. Let's find the number of Sylow 3-subgroups for each case: 1. If the order is 3, then the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is congruent to 1 mod 3 and divides 2^3 = 8. The possibilities are 1 and 4.

The only possibility is 1, which means the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal. Now, we can combine the possibilities for Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups: 1. Both Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 3-subgroup are normal (orders 2 and 3): This gives the direct product Z_2 x Z_3 = Z_6. 2. Both Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 3-subgroup are normal (orders 4 and 3): This gives the direct product Z_4 x Z_3 = Z_12. 3.

If n_2 = 1, then there is a normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8. If n_2 = 9, then the Sylow 2-subgroups are not normal. 2.

If n_3 = 1, then there is a normal Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9. If n_3 = 4, then the Sylow 3-subgroups are not normal. Now we consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups: Case 1: Both Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 3-subgroup are normal. In this case, the group is a direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup, which is abelian. So, this case does not give any non-abelian groups. Case 2: Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, but Sylow 3-subgroup is not normal. There are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 8 (Dihedral group D_4 and Quaternion group Q_8), and 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 9 (C_9 and C_3 × C_3). Since the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, the group is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. We have the following possibilities: 1. D_4 ⋊ C_9: There is only one non-trivial homomorphism from C_9 to Aut(D_4), so there is one non-abelian group in this case. 2. D_4 ⋊ (C_3 × C_3): There are two non-trivial homomorphisms from C_3 × C_3 to Aut(D_4), so there are two non-abelian groups in this case. 3. Q_8 ⋊ C_9: There is no non-trivial homomorphism from C_9 to Aut(Q_8), so there are no non-abelian groups in this case. 4. Q_8 ⋊ (C_3 × C_3): There is only one non-trivial homomorphism from C_3 × C_3 to Aut(Q_8), so there is one non-abelian group in this case.

There are 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 8 (C_8, C_4 × C_2, and D_4), and 1 non-isomorphic group of order 9 (C_9).

The action of the group on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation gives a homomorphism from the group to S_9. The kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of all Sylow 2-subgroups, which is a normal 2-subgroup of the group. Similarly, the action of the group on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups by conjugation gives a homomorphism from the group to S_4, and the kernel of this homomorphism is the intersection of all Sylow 3-subgroups, which is a normal 3-subgroup of the group. Let K be the intersection of all Sylow 2-subgroups, and let L be the intersection of all Sylow 3-subgroups. Then K and L are normal subgroups of the group, and their intersection is trivial. Thus, the group is a semi-direct product of K and L. We have the following possibilities: 1. C_2 ⋊ C_3: There are two non-trivial homomorphisms from C_3 to Aut(C_2), so there are two non-abelian groups in this case. 2. C_4 ⋊ C_3: There are two non-trivial homomorphisms from C_3 to Aut(C_4), so there are two non-abelian groups in this case. 3.

Then G has a normal subgroup of order 4, say N, and G/N is isomorphic to a group of order 18. There are two non-isomorphic groups of order 18 (C_18 and C_6 × C_3), and their automorphism groups have orders 6 and 12, respectively. The number of extensions of G/N by N is given by the second cohomology group H^2(G/N, N), which has order equal to the number of non-trivial homomorphisms from G/N to Aut(N). 1. If G/N is isomorphic to C_18, then there are 6 non-trivial homomorphisms from G/N to Aut(N), so there are 6 non-abelian groups in this case. 2. If G/N is isomorphic to C_6 × C_3, then there are 12 non-trivial homomorphisms from G/N to Aut(N), so there are 12 non-abelian groups in this case. In total, we have 6 + 12 = 18 non-abelian groups in this case. Adding up the non-abelian groups from all cases, we have 4 + 10 + 5 + 18 = 37 non-abelian groups of order 72. However, we have overcounted some groups, so we need to subtract the duplicates. There are 14 groups that are counted twice, so the actual number of non-abelian groups of order 72 is 37 - 14 = 23.

If G is isomorphic to A4 × C3 × C2, then G has 4 Sylow 3-subgroups and 9 Sylow 2-subgroups. In this case, n_3 = 4 and n_2 = 9. 3. If G is one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72, then G cannot have unique Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 2-subgroups. In this case, n_3 = 4 and n_2 = 9. From the possible values of n_3 and n_2, we can conclude the following: - If n_3 = 1 and n_2 = 1, then G is isomorphic to C72. - If n_3 = 4 and n_2 = 9, then G can be isomorphic to A4 × C3 × C2 or one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72. Without further information, we cannot determine the exact isomorphism class of G."},{"instruction":"Let G be a group of order 72.

The order of G is 72, which can be factored as 2^3 * 3^2. Therefore, G has Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8 and Sylow 3-subgroups of order 9. Let n_2 and n_3 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups, respectively. By Sylow's theorems, we have: 1. n_2 divides 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2) 2. n_3 divides 8 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3) From these conditions, we have the possible values for n_2 and n_3: n_2 ∈ {1, 3, 9} n_3 ∈ {1, 4} Case 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1 If G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, then both subgroups are normal in G. Let P be the Sylow 2-subgroup and Q be the Sylow 3-subgroup. Since P and Q are normal, their product PQ is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, we have |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 72, so PQ = G. This implies that G is the direct product of P and Q, and thus G is isomorphic to C8 × C9. Since C8 × C9 is isomorphic to C72, in this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C72. Case 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1 If G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, then the Sylow 3-subgroup Q is normal in G. Let H be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then, the group G acts on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation, and this action induces a homomorphism φ: G → S_3. The kernel of φ is the normalizer of H in G, and by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, we have |G : N_G(H)| = 3. Since Q is normal in G, it is contained in N_G(H), and thus |N_G(H)| is divisible by 9. This implies that |N_G(H)| = 9 or 18. If |N_G(H)| = 9, then G = N_G(H), which contradicts the fact that G has three Sylow 2-subgroups. Therefore, |N_G(H)| = 18, and the kernel of φ has order 4. The image of φ is a subgroup of S_3, which has order 6. Since the kernel of φ is normal in G and has order 4, G has a normal subgroup K of order 4. Then, G/K is a group of order 18, which is isomorphic to either C18 or C6 × C3. In either case, G is one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72. Case 3: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4 If G has nine Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups, then neither the Sylow 2-subgroups nor the Sylow 3-subgroups are normal in G. In this case, G is one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72. In conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C72, the alternating group A4 × C3 × C2, or one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72, depending on the number of its Sylow subgroups.

If there are exactly 12 elements of order 3 in G, find the number of elements of order 8 in G.","output":"Let's use the Sylow theorems to analyze the structure of the group G. Since the order of G is 72, we can write it as 2^3 * 3^2. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (let's denote it as n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (let's denote it as n_3) must satisfy the following conditions: 1. n_2 divides 3^2 = 9 and n_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2. 2. n_3 divides 2^3 = 8 and n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3. From condition 1, n_2 can be 1 or 3. From condition 2, n_3 can be 1 or 4. We are given that there are exactly 12 elements of order 3 in G. Since each Sylow 3-subgroup has 3 - 1 = 2 elements of order 3 (excluding the identity element), we must have n_3 = 4 (since 4 * 2 = 12). Therefore, there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. Now let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. If n_2 = 1, then there would be a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8, which would be a normal subgroup of G. In this case, G would be a semi-direct product of the unique Sylow 2-subgroup and one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. However, this would imply that G is not simple, which contradicts the fact that there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups (since a simple group cannot have more than one Sylow p-subgroup for any prime p). Therefore, we must have n_2 = 3, which means there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups. Each Sylow 2-subgroup has order 8, and since 8 = 2^3, there are two types of elements in each Sylow 2-subgroup: elements of order 2 and elements of order 4 or 8. The number of elements of order 2 in each Sylow 2-subgroup is 2^2 = 4 (excluding the identity element). Therefore, there are 3 * 4 = 12 elements of order 2 in G. Now, let's count the total number of elements in G that are not of order 1, 2, or 3. There are 72 - 1 (identity element) - 12 (order 2 elements) - 12 (order 3 elements) = 47 such elements. Since each Sylow 2-subgroup has 8 - 1 = 7 elements that are not of order 1 or 2, there must be 3 * 7 = 21 elements of order 4 or 8 in G. Finally, we need to determine how many of these 21 elements are of order 8. Note that if an element x has order 4, then x^2 has order 2. Since there are 12 elements of order 2 in G, there can be at most 12 elements of order 4. Therefore, there must be at least 21 - 12 = 9 elements of order 8 in G. In conclusion, there are at least 9 elements of order 8 in the group G."},{"instruction":"w many non-abelian groups of order 72 are there, and can you provide an example of one such group?","output":"To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 72, we first need to find the prime factorization of 72.

There are three abelian groups of order 72: Z_72, Z_2 x Z_36, and Z_4 x Z_18. So, the number of non-abelian groups of order 72 is: 672 - 3 = 669 Now, let's provide an example of a non-abelian group of order 72. One such group is the semidirect product of Z_9 and Z_8, denoted as Z_9 ⋊ Z_8. This group is non-abelian because the semidirect product of two non-trivial groups is non-abelian if and only if the action of one group on the other is non-trivial.

One normal 2-Sylow subgroup and one normal 3-Sylow subgroup: In this case, the group is a direct product of the Sylow subgroups, which are C8 and C9. The group is C8 × C9, which is abelian, so it doesn't count. 2. One normal 2-Sylow subgroup and four 3-Sylow subgroups: In this case, the group is a semidirect product of the Sylow subgroups. The action of the 3-Sylow subgroup on the normal 2-Sylow subgroup can be non-trivial, resulting in a non-abelian group. There is one such group, which is (C8 ⋊ C3) × C3. 3. Nine 2-Sylow subgroups and one normal 3-Sylow subgroup: In this case, the group is a semidirect product of the Sylow subgroups. The action of the 2-Sylow subgroup on the normal 3-Sylow subgroup can be non-trivial, resulting in a non-abelian group.

All other groups of order 72 are not cyclic and have more complex structures. A4 × C3 × C2 is a direct product of the alternating group A4, the cyclic group C3, and the cyclic group C2. It is also non-abelian, but its structure is different from the other non-abelian groups of order 72. For example, it has a normal subgroup isomorphic to A4, while the other non-abelian groups do not.

To determine which of these subgroups are normal, we need to consider the index of the subgroup in the group. A subgroup H of G is normal if and only if the index [G:H] is the smallest prime dividing the order of G. In this case, the smallest prime dividing 72 is 2, so we are looking for subgroups of index 2, which means the subgroups of order 36. Thus, the normal subgroups are: 1. Order 36: Subgroups of the form Z_36, Z_18 x Z_2, Z_12 x Z_3, Z_9 x Z_4, or Z_6 x Z_6. Now, we need to identify which of the three possible isomorphisms the given group must have. The three possible isomorphisms are: 1. G is isomorphic to Z_72, the cyclic group of order 72. 2. G is isomorphic to Z_36 x Z_2, the direct product of a cyclic group of order 36 and a cyclic group of order 2. 3. G is isomorphic to Z_18 x Z_4, the direct product of a cyclic group of order 18 and a cyclic group of order 4. To determine which isomorphism G must have, we need to consider the number of normal subgroups of each type. If G is isomorphic to Z_72, then it has a unique normal subgroup of each order dividing 72. If G is isomorphic to Z_36 x Z_2, then it has more than one normal subgroup of order 36. If G is isomorphic to Z_18 x Z_4, then it has more than one normal subgroup of order 18 and order 4. Since we found multiple normal subgroups of order 36, G cannot be isomorphic to Z_72. However, we cannot determine whether G is isomorphic to Z_36 x Z_2 or Z_18 x Z_4 based on the information given. We would need more information about the structure of G to make this determination."},{"instruction":"Find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72 among the given three types of groups, i.e., cyclic group C72, the alternating group A4 × C3 × C2, and the non-abelian groups of order 72.","output":"To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we will consider each of the given types of groups separately. 1.

Justify your answer using the given subtopics of group theory.","output":"To find the number of distinct subgroups K of order 9 in G such that HK is a subgroup of G, we will use the following concepts from group theory: Lagrange's theorem, Sylow theorems, and the product formula for the order of a product of subgroups. First, let's recall Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of any subgroup H of a finite group G divides the order of G. Since the order of G is 72 and the order of H is 8, we know that the order of K must divide 72 as well. Since we are looking for subgroups of order 9, we can conclude that K must be a 9-Sylow subgroup of G. Now, let's use the Sylow theorems to determine the number of 9-Sylow subgroups in G. The third Sylow theorem states that the number of 9-Sylow subgroups, denoted by n_9, must divide the order of G and must be congruent to 1 modulo 9. The order of G is 72 = 2^3 * 3^2, so the possible values for n_9 are 1, 2, 4, and 8. However, since n_9 must be congruent to 1 modulo 9, the only possible value for n_9 is 1. Therefore, there is exactly one 9-Sylow subgroup K in G. Now, we need to check if HK is a subgroup of G. To do this, we will use the product formula for the order of a product of subgroups, which states that |HK| = |H| * |K| / |H ∩ K|. Since H and K are subgroups of orders 8 and 9, respectively, and their orders are relatively prime (i.e., gcd(8, 9) = 1), their intersection must be the identity element, so |H ∩ K| = 1. Therefore, |HK| = (8 * 9) / 1 = 72, which is the order of G. Since HK has the same order as G and is a subset of G, HK must be a subgroup of G by Lagrange's theorem.

The number of Sylow 2-subgroups (denoted by n_2) must divide the index of the 2-subgroup, which is 3^2 = 9. So, n_2 must be a divisor of 9. 2. n_2 must be congruent to 1 modulo 2. 3. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups (denoted by n_3) must divide the index of the 3-subgroup, which is 2^3 = 8. So, n_3 must be a divisor of 8. 4. n_3 must be congruent to 1 modulo 3.

This action induces a homomorphism from G to Aut(P_2), where Aut(P_2) is the automorphism group of P_2. The order of Aut(P_2) is at most 8, so the image of G under this homomorphism has order at most 8. Thus, G/P_2 is a subgroup of Aut(P_2), and G is an extension of P_2 by G/P_2. Since there are 51 non-abelian groups of order 72, G must be isomorphic to one of these groups. Case 2: G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 9.

So, n_2 can be 1 or 3. 2. n_3 divides 32 and n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3. So, n_3 can be 1 or 4. Now, let's analyze the possible structures of the group G: 1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, G would be isomorphic to the direct product of these two subgroups, which would be a group of order 2^5 * 3^1 = 96. However, this group would be abelian, which contradicts the given information that G is non-abelian. So, this case is not possible. 2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, then G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, G would have a normal Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3, and G would be a semi-direct product of this subgroup and a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32. This structure would result in a non-abelian group of order 96. 3. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, G would have a normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32, and G would be a semi-direct product of this subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3. This structure would also result in a non-abelian group of order 96. 4. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, then G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, G would not have any normal Sylow subgroups, and the structure of G would be more complicated. However, this case would also result in a non-abelian group of order 96. Since G is non-abelian, we can eliminate the first case. Now, let's analyze the orders of the elements in the group G. We can see that all elements of G have orders that are powers of 2 (either 2 or 4). This means that G must have a normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32. Therefore, G is isomorphic to a semi-direct product of a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32 and a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3 (case 3).

Cyclic group C96: A group of order 96 is cyclic if and only if it has an element of order 96. By the Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups, if a group G is cyclic, then the number of elements of order d in G is φ(d), where φ is the Euler's totient function, and d divides the order of G. The order of G is 96, which has prime factorization 2^5 * 3. The divisors of 96 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, and 96. We need to find an element of order 96, so we need to compute φ(96). Using the formula for the Euler's totient function, we get: φ(96) = 96 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3) = 96 * (1/2) * (2/3) = 32 So, there are 32 elements of order 96 in a cyclic group of order 96.

Since the direct product of groups is a group, A4 × C4 × C2 is a group of order 96. To determine if our group is isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2, we can analyze the structure of the group. A4 is a non-abelian group, while C4 and C2 are abelian. The direct product of a non-abelian group and abelian groups is non-abelian. Therefore, if our group is isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2, it must be non-abelian. 3.

By the Third Sylow Theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in a group of order 96 must divide 3, and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide 32. If our group has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup or a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, then that subgroup is normal. If our group has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup or a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, then it cannot be isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2, since A4 is not a normal subgroup of A4 × C4 × C2. If our group has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, then it is a semi-direct product of these subgroups, and it is non-abelian. In this case, our group is isomorphic to one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96.

By Sylow's Theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy: 1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2) 2. n_3 divides 2^5 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3) From these conditions, we can deduce that n_2 ∈ {1, 3} and n_3 ∈ {1, 4}.  Case 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1 In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Since both P and Q are normal in G, their product PQ is also normal in G. Moreover, since |P| = 2^5 and |Q| = 3, we have |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 2^5 * 3 = 96, which implies that G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ C_2^5 × C_3. Since C_2^5 × C_3 is a cyclic group of order 96, G is isomorphic to C96 in this case. Case 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4 In this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G and Q be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since n_2 = 3, P is not normal in G. However, since n_3 = 4, Q is normal in G.  Now, let's consider the semidirect product of P and Q, denoted as P ⋊ Q. Since |P| = 2^5 and |Q| = 3, we have |P ⋊ Q| = |P| * |Q| = 2^5 * 3 = 96. Thus, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product P ⋊ Q.  By analyzing the possible actions of Q on P, we can show that G is isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2 in this case.  Therefore, if G is a group of order 96, it must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C96 or the group A4 × C4 × C2. If G is non-isomorphic to either of these groups, it must be one of the 196 possible non-abelian groups of order 96.

The kernel of this homomorphism is the normalizer of a Sylow 2-subgroup, which has index 3 in G. Thus, the image of the homomorphism is a subgroup of S_3 of order 32. However, the largest order of a subgroup of S_3 is 6, which is a contradiction. Therefore, this case is not possible. Case 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4 or 16 In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P, which is normal in G. The group G acts on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups by conjugation, and this action induces a homomorphism from G to S_4 or S_{16}. The kernel of this homomorphism is the normalizer of a Sylow 3-subgroup, which has index 4 or 16 in G. Thus, the image of the homomorphism is a subgroup of S_4 or S_{16} of order 24 or 6. In either case, the image is isomorphic to the symmetric group S_3 or the alternating group A_4. The preimage of A_4 in G is a non-abelian group of order 96, which we denote by G_1. Case 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4 or 16 In this case, there are multiple Sylow 2-subgroups and multiple Sylow 3-subgroups. The group G acts on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation, and this action induces a homomorphism from G to S_3. The kernel of this homomorphism is the normalizer of a Sylow 2-subgroup, which has index 3 in G. Thus, the image of the homomorphism is a subgroup of S_3 of order 32. However, the largest order of a subgroup of S_3 is 6, which is a contradiction. Therefore, this case is not possible. From the above analysis, we conclude that there is only one non-abelian group of order 96, which is G_1. The defining property of G_1 is that it has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup and its action on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups by conjugation induces a homomorphism with image isomorphic to A_4. Now, let's prove that every group of order 96 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C96, the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2, or G_1. Let G be a group of order 96. If G is abelian, then by the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: 1. C96 2. C48 × C2 3. C32 × C3 4. C24 × C4 5. C16 × C6 6. C8 × C12 7. C8 × C4 × C3 8. C4 × C4 × C6 Out of these groups, only C96 is cyclic. The group A4 × C4 × C2 is isomorphic to the group C8 × C4 × C3, which is abelian. Therefore, if G is abelian, it is isomorphic to either C96 or A4 × C4 × C2. If G is non-abelian, then by our previous analysis, G is isomorphic to G_1.

Thus, there are either 1 or 3 distinct Sylow 2-subgroups of G. Now, let's consider the possible structures of G. If G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, then that subgroup is normal in G. Let P_2 be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G, and let P_3 be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since the orders of P_2 and P_3 are relatively prime, by the Schur-Zassenhaus Theorem, G is a semidirect product of P_2 and P_3. In this case, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C96 or one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96. If G has 3 distinct Sylow 2-subgroups, then G is not a simple group. Let N be a normal subgroup of G with order 2^4 = 16. Then G/N has order 6, and by the Correspondence Theorem, G/N has a normal subgroup of order 3. Let H be the preimage of this subgroup under the quotient map. Then H has order 3, and since the orders of N and H are relatively prime, G is a semidirect product of N and H. In this case, G is isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2, since A4 has order 12 and is the smallest non-abelian group of order divisible by 3. In conclusion, a group of order 96 has either 1 or 3 distinct Sylow 2-subgroups, and it is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C96, the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2, or one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96."},{"instruction":"w many non-isomorphic groups of order 96 are there?","output":"To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we can use the following steps: 1.

If G is isomorphic to C96, then G must have a unique 2-Sylow subgroup and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup, i.e., n_2 = n_3 = 1.

If G is non-abelian, then it cannot be a direct product of abelian groups. Since the 2-Sylow subgroup P is abelian (as all groups of order 2^5 are abelian), it must not be normal in G.

In this case, we would have n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1. However, we know that n_2 can be either 1 or 3, so it is possible for the group to be cyclic. 2. Direct product: If the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, then it would be isomorphic to a group of the form C_(2^5) x C_(3^1) = C_32 x C_3. In this case, we would have n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4. Since these values are possible, the group could be a direct product. 3. Non-abelian: If the group is non-abelian, then it cannot be a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, and it must have more than one Sylow 2-subgroup or more than one Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, we could have n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, 4, or 16. Since these values are possible, the group could be non-abelian. In conclusion, based on the possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups, the group of order 96 could be cyclic, a direct product, or non-abelian."},{"instruction":"w many non-isomorphic groups of order 96 are there?","output":"To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we can use the following steps: 1.

Thus, if G has either n_2 = 3 or n_3 = 4, it has the same properties as A4 × C4 × C2. However, this does not guarantee that G is isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2. It could still be one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96. In conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C96 if both 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups are normal (case 1). If either n_2 = 3 or n_3 = 4 (case 2), G has the same properties as A4 × C4 × C2, but we cannot guarantee that G is isomorphic to A4 × C4 × C2.

The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1. Using the formula for the number of groups of a given order, we have: Number of groups of order 96 = (p(5) - 1) * (p(1) - 1) = (7 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 6 Now, we need to find the number of abelian groups of order 96. The number of abelian groups of a given order is equal to the number of partitions of the exponents in the prime factorization. In this case, we have the exponents 5 and 1. The partitions of 5 are: 5 4 + 1 3 + 2 3 + 1 + 1 2 + 2 + 1 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 Since the exponent of 3 is 1, there is only one partition for it: 1. So, the number of abelian groups of order 96 is the product of the number of partitions of the exponents, which is 7 * 1 = 7. Now, we can find the number of non-abelian groups of order 96: Number of non-abelian groups of order 96 = Total number of groups - Number of abelian groups = 6 - 7 = -1 However, this result is incorrect, as there cannot be a negative number of groups. The error comes from the formula used to calculate the total number of groups of order 96, which is not applicable in this case. Instead, we can use the fact that there are 7 abelian groups of order 96 and that there are 15 groups of order 96 in total (as per the classification of finite groups). Therefore: Number of non-abelian groups of order 96 = Total number of groups - Number of abelian groups = 15 - 7 = 8 So, there are 8 non-abelian groups of order 96.

We have 96 = 2^5 * 3. Now, we use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups. Let n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups. 1. Sylow 2-subgroups: By Sylow's third theorem, n_2 must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal.

By the direct product theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_3, i.e., G ≅ P_2 × P_3. Since P_2 is abelian and P_3 is abelian, their direct product is also abelian. Thus, this case does not yield a non-abelian group. Case 2: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4 or 16 In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 32 and multiple Sylow 3-subgroups. P_2 is normal in G, but none of the Sylow 3-subgroups are normal. We can use the semidirect product to construct non-abelian groups in this case. The action of a Sylow 3-subgroup on P_2 determines the structure of the semidirect product. Since P_2 is of order 32, it can be isomorphic to either C32, C16 × C2, C8 × C4, C8 × C2 × C2, or C4 × C4 × C2. We can analyze each possibility and find the non-isomorphic semidirect products.

P_3 is normal in G, but none of the Sylow 2-subgroups are normal. Similar to Case 2, we can use the semidirect product to construct non-abelian groups in this case. The action of a Sylow 2-subgroup on P_3 determines the structure of the semidirect product. In total, we find 48 non-isomorphic non-abelian groups in this case.

First, we can easily see that none of these groups are isomorphic to the cyclic group C96, as C96 is abelian, and all of these groups are non-abelian. Next, we can see that none of these groups are isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2. The group A4 × C4 × C2 has a normal subgroup of order 4 (C4 × C2), while none of the non-abelian groups of order 96 listed above have a normal subgroup of order 4.

(C2^2 × C2^2 × C2) ⋊ C3 has no normal subgroup of order 8, while all the other groups have a normal subgroup of order 8.

The cyclic group C96 is an abelian group, so it is fundamentally different from the non-abelian groups. The elements in C96 commute, meaning that for any elements a and b in C96, ab = ba. This property does not hold for non-abelian groups. The alternating group A4 × C4 × C2 is a direct product of three groups, where A4 is the alternating group of degree 4, C4 is the cyclic group of order 4, and C2 is the cyclic group of order 2. This group has a more complex structure than the cyclic group C96, but it is still abelian since the direct product of abelian groups is abelian. Therefore, it also differs from the non-abelian groups of order 96 in that its elements commute.

The cyclic group C120 is an abelian group of order 120, and it is the group of all integers modulo 120 under addition. The alternating group A5 × C2 × C2 is a non-abelian group of order 60, which is half the order of C120. It is formed by taking the direct product of the alternating group A5, which is the group of even permutations of 5 elements, and the cyclic groups C2 and C2, which are groups of order 2. In the context of group theory, the cyclic group C120 and the alternating group A5 × C2 × C2 are not directly related, as they have different orders and structures.

Sylow's Second Theorem: All Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate. 3. Sylow's Third Theorem: The number of Sylow p-subgroups (n_p) divides the order of G and n_p ≡ 1 (mod p). Let's find the possible number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime dividing the order of G: For p = 2, n_2 divides 120/2^3 = 15, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). So, n_2 can be 1 or 3.

This is the cyclic group C120. Case 2: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 6 In this case, G has multiple Sylow subgroups for each prime.

Sylow 2-subgroups: There are either 1, 3, or 15 Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8. If there is only one, it is normal, and the group is a semi-direct product of the form (C8 × C3) ⋊ C5 or (C4 × C2) ⋊ C5.

We are only considering non-abelian groups, so we don't need to worry about this case. A5 × C2 × C2 is a direct product of the alternating group A5 of order 60 and two cyclic groups of order 2. The order of A5 × C2 × C2 is 60 × 2 × 2 = 120. Since A5 is simple and non-abelian, any group isomorphic to A5 × C2 × C2 must have a normal Sylow 5-subgroup and a normal Sylow 3-subgroup. This eliminates the cases where there are 10 Sylow 3-subgroups or 15 Sylow 2-subgroups. Thus, we are left with the following non-abelian groups of order 120: 1. (C8 × C3) ⋊ C5 2. (C4 × C2) ⋊ C5 3.

First, let's consider the possibility that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C120. If G is cyclic, then it has an element of order 120. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G, denoted by n_5, must divide 24 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility for n_5 is 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G, denoted by n_2, must divide 15 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. The possibilities for n_2 are 1, 3, 5, or 15.

For n = 120, we have the following divisors: k = 2, φ(2) = 1 k = 3, φ(3) = 2 k = 4, φ(4) = 2 k = 5, φ(5) = 4 k = 6, φ(6) = 2 k = 8, φ(8) = 4 k = 10, φ(10) = 4 k = 12, φ(12) = 4 k = 15, φ(15) = 8 k = 20, φ(20) = 8 k = 24, φ(24) = 8 k = 30, φ(30) = 8 k = 40, φ(40) = 16 k = 60, φ(60) = 16 k = 120, φ(120) = 32 There is no k > 1 that satisfies φ(k) = 120/k, so G could be isomorphic to C120.

Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide 40 (120/3) and be congruent to 1 mod 3. The only possibility is 1, so there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must also be normal. Thus, G has a normal subgroup of order 3 and a normal subgroup of order 5. Since their orders are coprime, their intersection is trivial, and their product has order 15. By the second isomorphism theorem, G has a subgroup isomorphic to C3 × C5, which is isomorphic to C15. Now, G has a normal subgroup of order 15, and since 120/15 = 8, G has a subgroup of order 8. By the first Sylow theorem, G has a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8, which can be either C8, C4 × C2, or C2 × C2 × C2. Since G has a normal subgroup of order 15, by the direct product theorem, G can be isomorphic to C120, which is the direct product of C15 and one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. Therefore, G can have the isomorphic structure C120. 2. A5 × C2 × C2: A5 is the alternating group of degree 5, which has order 60. The order of G is 120, so the order of A5 × C2 × C2 is also 120. Since A5 is a simple group, it has no nontrivial normal subgroups. Therefore, G cannot have the isomorphic structure A5 × C2 × C2, as it would imply that G has a nontrivial normal subgroup. 3.

The complement of A, denoted as A', is given by: A' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A} So, we can list out the elements in A' as follows: A' = {1, 3, 5} Now, we need to prove that the complement is unique. To do this, we will use a proof by contradiction. Let's assume that there exists another set B such that B ≠ A' and B is also a complement of A. This means that: 1. B ⊆ U 2. A ∩ B = Ø (A and B are disjoint) 3. A ∪ B = U (A and B together form the universal set) Now, let's compare the sets A' and B: Since A' and B are both complements of A, they must satisfy conditions 2 and 3.  For condition 2, we know that A ∩ A' = Ø and A ∩ B = Ø. This means that both A' and B do not share any elements with A. For condition 3, we know that A ∪ A' = U and A ∪ B = U. This means that both A' and B, when combined with A, form the universal set U. Now, let's consider an element x that belongs to A'. Since A' is a complement of A, x must belong to U but not to A. Since A ∪ B = U, x must also belong to B. This means that x belongs to both A' and B.  Since x is an arbitrary element, this implies that all elements of A' also belong to B. Therefore, A' ⊆ B. Similarly, we can show that for any element y in B, y must also belong to A'. This implies that B ⊆ A'. Since A' ⊆ B and B ⊆ A', we can conclude that A' = B. This contradicts our initial assumption that there exists another set B such that B ≠ A' and B is also a complement of A.

Let AA_{1}, BB_{1}, CC_{1} be the altitudes of triangle ABC. The lines AA_{1}, BB_{1}, CC_{1} intersect the circumcircle of triangle ABC again at points A_{2}, B_{2}, C_{2}, respectively. The Simson lines corresponding to points A_{2}, B_{2}, C_{2} form a triangle A_{3} B_{3} C_{3}, where A_{3} is the intersection of the Simson lines of B_{2} and C_{2}, and similarly for B_{3} and C_{3}.

We begin by considering the properties of the Simson lines of points on the circumcircle of a triangle. 1. **Orthogonality of Simson Line and Altitude:**     - Observe that the Simson line of a point, say A_{2}, which lies on the circumcircle of triangle ABC, is perpendicular to the side BC of triangle ABC. Thus, the Simson line of A_{2} is perpendicular to B_{1}C_{1}. 2. **Intersection with Midpoints:**     - We know that the Simson lines corresponding to A_{2}, B_{2}, C_{2} will pass through the midpoints of the segments from these points on the altitudes to the orthocenter H. For A_{2}, the Simson line passes through the midpoint of A_{1}H. 3. **Simson Lines as Altitudes:**     - Given that the Simson lines of A_{2}, B_{2}, C_{2} are perpendicular to B_{1}C_{1}, C_{1}A_{1}, and A_{1}B_{1} respectively, we infer that these Simson lines act as altitudes of some triangle. Hence, they form the triangle A_{3}B_{3}C_{3} where A_{3} is the intersection of the Simson lines of points B_{2} and C_{2}, and similarly for B_{3} and C_{3}. 4. **Centroid of A_{1}B_{1}C_{1}:**     - The centroid G_1 of triangle A_{1}B_{1}C_{1} is the point where its medians intersect. By construction, G_1 is the average of the position vectors of A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}. 5. **Centroid of A_{3}B_{3}C_{3}:**     - Let H be the orthocenter of triangle ABC. The Simson lines intersect at points which form triangle A_{3}B_{3}C_{3}. Since each Simson line passes through the midpoints of A_{1}H, B_{1}H, C_{1}H, it not only affects the positioning but ensures that triangle A_{3}B_{3}C_{3} is centrally symmetrical with respect to H.  6. **Coincidence of Centroids:**     - To show that G_1 coincides with G_3 (the centroid of triangle A_{3}B_{3}C_{3}), we utilize the fact that each median intersecting at the centroid implies that they must coincide due to symmetry and the configuration involving midpoints of the segments from A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1} to H. 7. **Concurrency of Lines A_{2}A_{3}, B_{2}B_{3}, C_{2}C_{3}:**     - Since the Simson lines intersect at A_{3}, B_{3}, and C_{3} respectively and these points already provide necessary concurrency, the lines A_{2}A_{3}, B_{2}B_{3}, C_{2}C_{3} must intersect at the orthocenter H or some circumcenter-related point influencing symmetry and concurrency. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that: - The centroids of triangles A_{1}B_{1}C_{1} and A_{3}B_{3}C_{3} coincide. - The lines A_{2}A_{3}, B_{2}B_{3}, and C_{2}C_{3} are concurrent. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Let a bowtie b = a+sqrt{b+sqrt{b+sqrt{b+...}}}.

This implies that:    [    angle AFP = 180^circ - angle AEF    ]    Therefore, points A, E, F, and P are concyclic. 6.

But, since we only have the set up to 1982, values 45 and 46 must not be included in the potential products under consideration. 3. **Remove elements in a systematic way**:     - We start by removing elements from ({1, 2, ldots, 44}) because these numbers are in range and create several products that might be under 1982.      4. Following set calculations:     - We examine for sets like ({k, 89-k, k(89-k)} text{ for } k = 2,3, ldots, 44 ).       For any such (k), ( k(89-k) ) would be in the range of ( [k(45), k*44] ), needing special care. 5. **Count elements to be removed**:     - If we remove 43 elements {2,3 ldots 44}, then the remaining set will not fulfill the (a cdot b = c) condition as there would be no lower products forming a risk. 6. **Verification of minimum required deletions**:     - By not removing up to 42 elements and examining substructures (e.g., ({k, 89-k, k(89-k)})), at least one combination fails the condition where (k, 89-k) are impactful.

Based on the monotonicity, the range of f(x) can be found, which leads to the conclusion that for all x_1, x_2 in mathbb{R}, |f(x_1) - f(x_2)| < 2. **Solution** (1) Since f(x) is an odd function defined on mathbb{R}, let x > 0, then -x < 0, thus:   f(-x) = e^{-x}(-x+1) = -f(x);   therefore f(x) = e^{-x}(x-1);   therefore this proposition is incorrect;   (2) Since f(-1) = 0, f(1) = 0;   Also, f(0) = 0;   therefore f(x) has 3 zeros;   therefore this proposition is incorrect;   (3) When x < 0, f(x) = e^x(x+1);   therefore when -1 < x < 0, f(x) > 0;   When x > 0, f(x) = e^{-x}(x-1);   therefore when x > 1, f(x) > 0;   therefore the solution set of f(x) > 0 is (-1,0) cup (1,+infty);   therefore this proposition is boxed{text{correct}};   (4) When x < 0, f'(x) = e^x(x+2);   therefore when x < -2, f'(x) < 0, when -2 < x < 0, f'(x) > 0;   therefore f(x) is decreasing on (-infty,0) and increasing on (-2,0);   therefore when x = -2, f(x) reaches its minimum value -e^{-2}, and when x < -2, f(x) < 0;   therefore f(x) < f(0) = 1;   Thus, -e^{-2} < f(x) < 1;   When x > 0, f'(x) = e^{-x}(2-x);   therefore f(x) is increasing on (0,2) and decreasing on (2,+infty);   When x = 2, f(x) reaches its maximum value e^{-2}, and when x > 2, f(x) > 0;   therefore f(x) > f(0) = -1;   therefore -1 < f(x) leqslant e^{-2};   therefore the range of f(x) is (-1,e^{-2}] cup [-e^{-2}, 1);   therefore for all x_1, x_2 in mathbb{R}, |f(x_1) - f(x_2)| < 2;   therefore this proposition is boxed{text{correct}};   therefore the correct propositions are (3) and (4), i.e., the number of correct propositions is boxed{2}.

When 20 more students are accommodated, the average expenditure per student decreases by Rs. 5, making the new average expenditure per student A - 5. The total number of students now is 100 + 20 = 120. The new total expenditure for 120 students is 120 * (A - 5). According to the problem, the new total expenditure is Rs. 5400. So we can set up the equation: 120 * (A - 5) = 5400 Now, let's solve for A: 120A - 600 = 5400 120A = 5400 + 600 120A = 6000 A = 6000 / 120 A = 50 So the original average expenditure per student was Rs. 50. The original total expenditure for 100 students was: 100 * 50 = 5000 The new total expenditure is Rs. 5400, as given in the problem. To find out by how much the total expenditure increased, we subtract the original total expenditure from the new total expenditure: Increase in total expenditure = New total expenditure - Original total expenditure Increase in total expenditure = 5400 - 5000 Increase in total expenditure = Rs. 400 Therefore, the total expenditure increased by Rs. boxed{400} ."},{"instruction":"Assume plane alpha is parallel to plane beta.

Primes ( q ) and ( r ) can be either both odd or one of them can be 2 (the only even prime number).  1.2. We check the case in which both ( q ) and ( r ) are odd primes: - Both ( q^3 ) and ( r^3 ) are odd, making ( q^3 - r^3 ) even. - The left-hand side of our equation ( 5p ) must be even. Since 5 is odd, ( p ) must be even. - However, the only even prime is 2, so ( p = 2 ), leading to the equation: [ 10 = q^3 - r^3 ] This equation cannot be satisfied with odd primes ( q ) and ( r ) as it violates the priem odd property transaction.

Let's denote the added number as k, and the original 9 numbers as a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{9}. 1. **Finding the sum of the original 9 numbers**:    Since the average of these 9 numbers is 8, we can write the equation for their sum as:    [    a_{1}+a_{2}+ldots+a_{9} = 9 times 8 = 72    ] 2. **Finding the sum after adding k**:    With the new average of 10 numbers being 9, the sum of these numbers is:    [    a_{1}+a_{2}+ldots+a_{9}+k = 10 times 9 = 90    ] 3. **Solving for k**:    From the above two equations, we can find k by subtracting the first sum from the second:    [    k = 90 - 72 = 18    ] 4. **Calculating the original variance**:    Given the variance is 12, we know that:    [    frac{1}{9}sum_{i=1}^{9}(a_{i}-8)^{2} = 12    ]    Multiplying both sides by 9 gives us the sum of squares of deviations from the mean for the original set:    [    sum_{i=1}^{9}(a_{i}-8)^{2} = 108    ] 5. **Finding the variance of the new set**:    The variance formula for the new set of 10 numbers, with the new average of 9, becomes:    [    frac{1}{10}left[sum_{i=1}^{9}(a_{i}-9)^{2}+(k-9)^{2}right]    ]    Expanding this using the given and derived values, we get:    [    frac{1}{10}left[sum_{i=1}^{9}(a_{i}-8)^{2}-2sum_{i=1}^{9}(a_{i}-8)+9cdot9+81right] = frac{1}{10}left[108-2cdot0+9+81right] = frac{198}{10} = 19.8    ] Therefore, the variance of the new sample data is boxed{19.8}, which corresponds to choice C."},{"instruction":"The function f(x) = 2sin xcos x is A.

This ensures that the first ( 2k ) chips become red.    - **Case 2: There is a half with more than ( k ) red chips.**      - If one half has more than ( k ) red chips, we can join all the red chips into one contiguous block by moving chips one at a time from the half with fewer chips to the half with more chips. This takes at most ( k-1 ) moves.      - If the red chips end up as the last ( 2k ) chips, we can swap the two halves, costing one additional move.

This is because the sum of all vertex degrees (total number of 'ends' of edges) in any graph is always even (each edge contributes 2 to the total degree count). 3. **Analyzing the degrees**:    - Here, we have 7 islands, and hence their corresponding graph will have 7 vertices.    - Each vertex (island) has an odd degree (1, 3, or 5), implying that the total sum of degrees is odd. 4. **Sum of degrees**:    - Let's denote the degrees of the islands as ( d_1, d_2, ..., d_7 ).    - According to the degree-sum formula:      [      d_1 + d_2 + ... + d_7 = 2E      ]    - Here, ( E ) is the number of edges (bridges). The left side, however, is the sum of seven odd numbers, which is odd. 5. **Contradiction**:    - Since the sum of all vertex degrees must be equal to twice the number of edges (total number of 'endpoints' of bridges), it contradicts the property that degrees must sum to an even number in any graph.    - This contradiction implies that such a graph where none of the bridges connect to the shore (creating an odd sum from internal vertices) cannot exist. 6. **Conclusion**:    - Therefore, at least one of these bridges must necessarily connect to the shore to avoid the total odd-degree sum contradicting the even requirement from graph theory. Thus, it is **true** that at least one of these bridges must lead to the shore.

Taking the union of complement_R B with A gives us (complement_R B) cup A = {x mid x leq 3}. **(2)** From part (1), we know A = {x mid 1 leq x leq 3}. If C is a subset of A (C subseteq A), C can be either an empty set, in which case a leq 1, or a non-empty interval which implies 1 < a leq 3.

The volume of the parallelepiped Let's proceed step-by-step. 1. **Identifying the position and implications of the sphere:**    - Since the center of the sphere is the midpoint of (C_{1} M), it lies within the plane of the face (B C C_{1} B_{1}). Hence, the sphere does not touch this face.    - According to the problem, the sphere touches four faces of the parallelepiped, including one at a point lying on the edge (B_{1} B). 2. **Using the given measurements:**    - Since (B M = 1) and (C M = 8), the total length of (B C) is:      [      B C = B M + M C = 1 + 8 = 9      ] 3. **Finding the length of (B_{1} C_{1}):**    - Consider the parallelogram (B B_{1} C_{1} C).

According to the Law of Cosines, we have a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}-2bccos A. Given that {a}^{2}={b}^{2}-{c}^{2}+sqrt{3}ac, we can equate the two expressions for a^2: [b^{2}+c^{2}-2bccos A = b^{2}-{c}^{2}+sqrt{3}ac] 2.

On the first move, a player removes any number of matches from 1 to n1, and on each subsequent turn, a player can take no more matches than were taken by their opponent on the previous turn. The player who takes the last match wins. Find all n for which the first player can guarantee a win.","output":"Consider a game where there are n matches on the table (n > 1). Two players alternately take matches from the table. On the first turn, a player can take any number of matches from 1 to n-1, and on subsequent turns, each player can take no more matches than were taken by the previous player. The player who takes the last match wins. We need to determine all values of n for which the first player can guarantee a win.  Case 1: n is odd 1. If n is odd, the first player can always win by taking one match on the first move.  2. After taking one match, n-1 matches remain, which is even. 3. Each player is required to take at most one match per turn. 4. Since the number of moves alternates between both players until one match remains, the first player will ultimately take the last match and win the game.  Case 2: n is even When n is even, the game becomes more complex. - Suppose that the first player takes k matches such that 1 leq k leq n - 1. Let's examine what happens when k is even or odd. # Sub-case: First player takes an even number of matches (textit{Steps}) 1. If the first player takes an even number of matches, then (n - k) matches remain, where (n - k) is also even. 2. Each subsequent move must preserve an even remainder of matches if strategic parity maintenance is employed. 3. The second player can always mirror the first player's moves such that the number of matches remains even, leading to a situation where the second player takes the last match. # Sub-case: First player takes an odd number of matches 1. If the first player takes an odd number of matches, then (n - k) matches remain, where (n - k) is odd. 2. The second player will have an advantage similar to the first player in previous cases because the second player can always ensure to leave an even count for the first player’s turn, leading to the first player being forced to take the last match. This suggests that the subsequent moves' parity determines the game's strategy, specifically whether the remaining pile of matches shares properties with powers of 2.  Pairing strategy For n = 2, 4, 8, 16, ldots = 2^k where k in mathbf{N}: 1. If n = 2^k, the first player loses if the second player mirrors the moves. 2. Any move by the first player leaves a non-power of 2 number, enabling this mirroring strategy.  Conclusion Thus, from the above analysis, we deduce that: - The first player loses if n = 2^k. - The first player wins for any n that isn’t a power of 2.

First, let's find the remainder when 27^27 is divided by 28. Since 27 is 1 less than 28, we can say that 27 ≡ -1 (mod 28). Now, let's raise both sides to the power of 27: (27)^27 ≡ (-1)^27 (mod 28) Since (-1)^27 is just -1, we have: 27^27 ≡ -1 (mod 28) Now, let's add 27 to both sides: 27^27 + 27 ≡ -1 + 27 (mod 28) -1 + 27 is 26, so we have: 27^27 + 27 ≡ 26 (mod 28) Therefore, the remainder when (27^27 + 27) is divided by 28 is boxed{26} ."},{"instruction":"Given the equation x^2+kx+6=0 has one root as 2, find the other root and the value of k.","output":"Let the other root of the equation be x_1.

For option B, consider the domains of f(x) and g(x): - The domain of f(x) = lg(x^2) is {x mid x neq 0} because the logarithm of 0 is undefined. - The domain of g(x) = 2lg(x) is {x mid x > 0} since you cannot take a logarithm of a non-positive number. - Since the domains are different, f(x) and g(x) cannot be the same function. For option C, let's examine the function forms and their domains: - The domain of f(x) = frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} is {x mid x neq 1} because the denominator cannot be zero. - However, factorizing the numerator, we have x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1). Upon canceling the common factor (x - 1), for x neq 1, we get f(x) = x + 1. - The domain of g(x) = x + 1 is the set of all real numbers, mathbb{R}. - Therefore, f(x) and g(x) might seem like the same function, but they have different domains due to the point of discontinuity at x = 1, so they are not the same. For option D, let's compare the functions and their domains: - The domain of f(x) = sqrt{x + 1} cdot sqrt{x - 1} is {x mid x geq 1}. This results from the fact that both square roots must have non-negative arguments. - The domain of g(x) = sqrt{x^2 - 1} is {x mid x leq -1 text{ or } x geq 1} because the expression inside the square root must be non-negative. - These two functions have overlapping but not identical domains, and in the range where they are both defined, they produce the same values. - However, since their domains do not match completely, they cannot be considered the same function.

This implies Statements 2, 3, 4, and 5 are false, totaling four false statements, contradicting Statement 1.     - If Statement 2 is true, then there are exactly two false statements. This combination of true/false among the remaining leads to an inconsistent number of false statements.     - If Statement 3 is true, then there must be three false statements. This setup would imply that Statements 1, 2, and 4 or 5 are false. However, Statement 5 indicates that only one statement is true, compatibly with Statement 3 being true, and the others (1, 2, 4, and 5) being false. This checks out consistently.     - If Statement 4 is true, then there must be four false statements. This setup would immediately contradict because it would invalidate its own truth claim (it can't be true and false simultaneously).     - If Statement 5 is true (exactly one statement is true), this situation leads to a valid Conclusion only if Statement 5 is the singular true statement which makes Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 false. This also matches the claim of Statement 5. - **Logical Consistency Check**:   Among the scenarios, Statements 3 and 5 bring out consistent setups without contradictions. If Statement 3 is true, then Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are false, fitting the claim. Similarly, if Statement 5 is true, then Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are false.

Thus we conclude that there are four false statements on the card.

The midpoint of the segment formed by the intersection of these two lines with the unknown line is at the origin, which implies that the unknown line is equidistant from the points where l_1 and l_2 intersect it.

However, since we are not explicitly calculating the slopes and using the property of the midpoint being at the origin, we directly conclude that the equation of the line that has its midpoint at the origin and is intercepted by l_1 and l_2 can be represented as a linear combination of l_1 and l_2 that passes through the origin.

So, when we factor 37a out of 37a^2 + 111a, we get: begin{align*} 37a^2 + 111a &= 37a cdot a + 37a cdot 3  &= 37a(a + 3) end{align*} Therefore, the factored form of the expression is boxed{37a(a+3)}."},{"instruction":"Find the solution to the equation under the domain restrictions ( x neq 2 ), ( x neq 6 ), and ( a  7x + 39 geq 0 ): [ x^{2}4x21+left(frac{|x2|}{x2}+frac{|x6|}{x6}+aright)^{2}=0 ] or [ (x2)^{2}+left(frac{|x2|}{x2}+frac{|x6|}{x6}+aright)^{2}=25. ] Consider different cases based on the value of ( x ) and find the suitable values of ( x ) parameterized by ( a ): 1.

We now show that the construction gives the ( x )-coordinate of ( P ) based on the hyperbola equation from the given ( y_1 ). We need to prove that the abscissa of ( P ) (which is ( OS )) equals the corresponding value derived from the hyperbola equation: [ x_{1} = frac{a}{b} sqrt{b^{2} + y_{1}^{2}} ] **Proof:** - Let the positive ( X )-axis intersect ( e ) at ( T ), the circle ( k ) at ( U ), and the tangent at ( U ) intersect ( OQ ) at ( V ). - Triangles ( ORS ) and ( OUV ) are congruent, and triangle ( OTQ ) is similar. Thus,  [ OS = OV = frac{OU}{OT} cdot OQ = frac{a}{b} sqrt{OT^{2} + TQ^{2}} = frac{a}{b} sqrt{b^{2} + y_{1}^{2}} = x_{1} ] Hence, our construction is valid. **Reverse Process:** - Given the abscissa of ( P ), mark it on the ( X )-axis to get ( S ). - Draw perpendicular ( n ) at ( S ) and draw the tangent to ( k ) from ( S ). - Find the intersection of this tangent with ( OQ ), and the perpendicular ( q ) from this intersection will cut ( n ) at ( P ). These processes can also be seen as constructing the intersection of the hyperbola (or ellipse) with lines parallel to its axes.

The nails should not pass through ( P ), but they can touch its edges. We need to find the minimal number of nails required to fix ( P ) such that it cannot move on the table. 2. **Parallelogram Case:**    First, consider ( P ) as a parallelogram. To immobilize ( P ), we need to place nails appropriately. If one side of the parallelogram is not covered by a nail, ( P ) can be moved parallel to that side. Therefore, at least four nails are needed to ensure that every side of the parallelogram is constrained by a nail. 3. **General Convex Polygon Case:**    Assume ( Omega ) is the largest circle inscribed in ( P ) with center ( O ). Let ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k ) be the points where ( Omega ) touches the sides of ( P ). These points form a convex hull ( H ). 4. **Special Case of Two Vertices Forming a Diameter:**    Suppose there exist two vertices ( U ) and ( V ) of ( H ) such that ( UV ) is the diameter of ( Omega ) (Fig. left). If we drive nails into the points ( U ) and ( V ), the sides of ( P ) containing ( U ) and ( V ) are parallel. Thus, ( P ) can still move perpendicular to ( UV ). To prevent this movement, two more nails are required, which constrain ( P ) in this perpendicular direction. 5. **Case with ( O notin H ):**    If sides or diagonals of ( H ) do not contain ( O ), consider side ( PQ ) of ( H ) that separates ( H ) and ( ( O ). Let ( P ) and ( Q ) be tangent points of ( Omega ) on ( P ). Extend the tangents at ( P ) and ( Q ) to intersect at point ( T ). There must be a homothety centered at ( T ) with a coefficient greater than 1, mapping ( Omega ) to a larger circle inside ( P ). This results in a contradiction since ( Omega ) is the largest possible inscribed circle. Hence, ( O ) must lie within ( H ). 6. **Fixing the Polygon ( P ):**    Since ( O in H ), then there exists a triangle ( ABC ) containing ( O ) (Fig. right). The points ( A, B, ), and ( C ) are the tangents from the circle to sides of ( P ). Three nails driven at ( A, B ), and ( C ) will fix ( P ) because these points provide sufficient constraints. 7. **Conclusion:**    To ensure any convex polygon ( P ) is fixed on the table, 4 nails are sufficient as demonstrated by the general convex case and special cases.

The next number, 97, is a prime number, so its only prime factor is 97 itself, and ( P = 97 ). The square root of 97 is approximately 9.85. Since ( P > sqrt{z} ), 97 is not prime saturated. We can stop here because any number less than 97 will have a smaller product of prime factors or a larger square root, making it less likely to be prime saturated than 98.

How much more did the green beans weigh compared to the sugar?","output":"Let's denote the weight of the sugar as S kg. According to the information given, the green beans weighed 60 kg, which is some kg more than the sugar. So, we can write: Green beans = S + some kg Since the green beans weighed 60 kg, we have: S + some kg = 60 Now, Lyla bought rice weighing 30 kg less than the green beans. So, the weight of the rice before any loss would be: Rice = Green beans - 30 kg Rice = 60 kg - 30 kg Rice = 30 kg However, 1/3 of the rice was lost, so the remaining rice would be: Remaining rice = Rice - (1/3 * Rice) Remaining rice = 30 kg - (1/3 * 30 kg) Remaining rice = 30 kg - 10 kg Remaining rice = 20 kg For the sugar, 1/5 of its weight was lost, so the remaining sugar would be: Remaining sugar = Sugar - (1/5 * Sugar) Remaining sugar = S - (1/5 * S) Remaining sugar = (4/5) * S Now, the total remaining stock weighed 120 kg, which is the sum of the remaining rice, remaining sugar, and the green beans (since it's not mentioned that any of the green beans were lost): Remaining stock = Remaining rice + Remaining sugar + Green beans 120 kg = 20 kg + (4/5) * S + 60 kg Now, let's solve for S: 120 kg = 20 kg + (4/5) * S + 60 kg 120 kg = 80 kg + (4/5) * S 120 kg - 80 kg = (4/5) * S 40 kg = (4/5) * S To find S, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (4/5), which is (5/4): S = 40 kg * (5/4) S = 10 kg * 5 S = 50 kg So, the sugar weighed 50 kg before any loss.

She wants to pair all the cards such that each pair has the same modulus of the difference between the numbers. How many ways are there to do this?","output":"Given: Vicky has 60 cards with numbers from 1 to 60. She wants to pair all the cards such that each pair has the same modulus difference of numbers. We need to determine the number of ways this can be done. 1. Let's denote the modulus of the difference as ( d ). Clearly, ( d ) must be a natural number. 2. Consider the first pair involving 1 (the smallest number), which would pair with ( 1 + d ). Hence, the pair is ( (1, d+1) ).  3. Similarly, the second smallest number, 2, must pair with ( 2 + d ), i.e., ( (2, d + 2) ), and so on. The ( d )-th smallest number would pair with ( d + d ), i.e., ( (d, 2d) ).  4. Therefore, the first ( 2d ) natural numbers are broken into pairs ({ (1, d+1), (2, d+2), ldots, (d, 2d) } ). 5. Now consider the number ( 2d + 1 ). It must form a pair with ( 3d + 1 ), i.e., ((2d+1, 3d+1)). Similarly, (2d+2) will pair with (3d+2), and this continues until (3d) pairs with (4d ). 6. This analogy extends, dividing the full set of 60 numbers ({ 1, 2, ldots, 60 }) into disjoint groups of (2d) numbers. Each group creates (d) pairs with an identical modulus difference (d). 7. Therefore, to form pairs throughout the 60 cards, 60 must be divisible by (2d):    [    60 = 2d cdot k    ]    Where (k) is the number of groups of (2d). 8. Simplifying,    [    30 = d cdot k    ]    Thus, (d) must be a divisor of 30. 9. The natural divisors of 30 are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. 10. Thus, there are 8 possible values for ( d ) that equally partition the cards into pairs with the same modulus difference: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. 11. Each divisor (d) naturally partitions the set ({1, 2, ldots, 60}) into pairs with modulus difference ( d ). # Conclusion: [ boxed{8} ]"},{"instruction":"f f(x) is differentiable on mathbb{R} and f(x) = x^2 + 2f'(2)x + 3, find the value of f'(1).","output":"This problem involves the operation of derivatives.

The derivative is given by f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}left(frac{x^2}{e^x}right) = frac{(2x)e^x - x^2e^x}{(e^x)^2} = frac{x(2 - x)}{e^x}. Suppose the tangent point is (a, frac{a^2}{e^a}). Then the slope of the tangent line at this point, denoted as k, is f'(a) = frac{a(2 - a)}{e^a}. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is: y - frac{a^2}{e^a} = frac{a(2 - a)}{e^a}(x - a). Substitute the point M(0,0) into the equation to find the value of a: 0 - frac{a^2}{e^a} = frac{a(2 - a)}{e^a}(0 - a), which simplifies to a = 1. Hence, the tangent point is (1, frac{1}{e}), and the slope is k = frac{1}{e}. The equation of the tangent line passing through the tangent point and M(0,0) is: y - frac{1}{e} = frac{1}{e}(x - 1), which simplifies to: y = frac{x}{e}. So the equation of the tangent line is y = frac{x}{e}. (2) To find the maximum and minimum values of f(x), we need to study the derivative f'(x) = frac{x(2 - x)}{e^x}. - For f'(x) > 0, this leads to 0 < x < 2. - For f'(x) < 0, this occurs when x > 2 or x < 0.

Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) is 0 and the maximum value is f(-3) = frac{9}{e^3}.
