On Wednesday the network announced it is partnering with super-producer Dick Wolf for a true crime spinoff of the \\"Law & Order\\" franchise. The first, eight-episode season of the anthology series will focus on the notorious case of Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were eventually convicted of the 1989 murder of their wealthy parents. Similar to the trial of O.J. Simpson, which was dramatized in FX's widely praised anthology series \\"American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson,\\" the Menendez case was a media sensation in the early to mid-'90s, and the trial was broadcast on Court TV, captivating much of the nation. Lyle and Erik were just 18 and 21, respectively, at the time of the murders, and grew up in an affluent Cuban American family. The brothers argued that they had been the victims of sexual, physical and mental abuse at the hands of their parents. The series is the latest offering in a growing trend of true crime fare on the small screen, including \\"The Jinx\\" and \\"Making a Murderer.\\" It also adds to Wolf's ever-expanding fiefdom at NBC, which includes \\"Law & Order: SVU,\\" now in its 17th season, \\"Chicago Fire,\\" \\"Chicago P.D.\\" and \\"Chicago Med.\\" In a press statement, Wolf said he was \\"excited to extend the franchise with a scripted limited anthology series that focuses on a high-profile trial. There is no shortage of compelling real-life criminal cases, and the Menendez trial was more scintillating than most crime fiction.” The Menendez case was also made into a television movie, \\"Menendez: Killing in Beverly Hills\\" in 1994. Follow @MeredithBlake on Twitter. ||||| The first season of the project will center on the Menendez brothers, who were found guilty of murdering their parents in 1996. NBC is getting into the true crime business. Fresh off the finale of FX's The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, NBC announced Wednesday that it is developing its own true crime anthology series with prolific producer Dick Wolf. Like Ryan Murphy's American Crime Story, the project will focus on a different real-life crime every season. Titled Law & Order: True Crime — The Menendez Brothers, the first eight-episode season of the project will focus specifically on brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in 1996. The brothers, who were 21 and 18 years old, respectively, at the time of the murders, were tried separately but eventually found guilty in a third trial after no verdicts were rendered in the first two trials because of hung juries. Defense attorney Leslie Abramson represented the brothers during all three trials and claimed that they had suffered a lifetime of abuse from their parents. Their father, Jose Menendez, was accused of sexual abuse as well as being unusually cruel while their mother, Kitty Menendez, was accused of being mentally unstable, with a violent history of drug and alcohol abuse. However, jurors believed the brothers killed their parents to inherit their money. Jose and Kitty were found murdered in their Beverly Hills home in August 1989. The brothers were arrested six months later and are both still serving life sentences in the California Department of Corrections. Like the Simpson trial, the Menendez brothers trial became an early hit for then-burgeoning cable channel CourtTV. The case was also the basis for a 1994 film in which Edward James Olmos and Beverly D'Angelo played the victims. Like American Crime Story, the events surrounding the murders and subsequent trials will be recreated for the NBC series. True crime series have been a hot trend on the small screen, thanks to other success stories, such as HBO's True Detective. Season one of American Crime Story, more commonly known as The People v. O.J. Simpson, has been averaging 7.7 million viewers. True crime docuseries have also carved a niche thanks to HBO's The Jinx and more recently Netflix's Making a Murderer. Wolf will executive produce the project through his Wolf Entertainment banner in association with Universal Television. If picked up to series, this would mark his fifth at NBC, joining Law & Order: SVU, Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D. and Chicago Med. Wolf has also a fourth Chicago show, Chicago Justice, in development, as well as unscripted series You the Jury. The series are part of his lengthy overall deal at the network, which extends to 2020. The extension of the Law & Order brand comes a year after talks stalled on a revival of the long-running drama series, which was canceled in 2010. The Emmy-winning series was known for ripped-from-the-headlines storylines, with a season-one episode based on the Menendez case. “We’ve been talking with Dick about how to create an event series coming out of the Law & Order ripped-from-the-headlines brand,\\" NBC Entertainment president Jennifer Salke said Wednesday in a statement. \\"This case captured the public’s attention like nothing before it as it examined taboo issues such as patricide and matricide in gruesome detail, all against a backdrop of privilege and wealth. We will recreate the cultural and societal surroundings of both the murders and trials when people were not only obsessed with the case but examining how and why these brothers committed these heinous crimes.” Wolf added: “[NBC chief Bob Greenblatt], Jen and I have been focused on the natural evolution of the Law & Order brand for the last several years and are excited to extend the franchise with a scripted limited anthology series that focuses on a high-profile trial. There is no shortage of compelling real-life criminal cases, and the Menendez trial was more scintillating than most crime fiction.” ||||| What is a summary?","output":"NBC has announced it is partnering with producer Dick Wolf to create a true crime spinoff of the \\"Law & Order\\" franchise.

The identity of the donor has not been established, although a number of suggestions have been advanced over the last 200 years. Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from Lucca, who was active in Bruges. From this Dhanens theorises the piece was commissioned as a wedding gift for the couple.

The premise \\"Now where were we?\\" Bork asked.\\" suggests that Bork is trying to remember or recall a previous point in the conversation or situation they were in before something interrupted it or diverted their attention. It implies that Bork may be confused or looking for clarification on the matter. The hypothesis \\"Where were we before all this?,\\" Bork asked his friends.\\" expands upon the premise by providing a slightly different angle: Bork is specifically asking his friends to help him remember where they were before a certain event or situation occurred. This adds additional context that helps us understand the question Bork is asking. Based on this analysis, it is plausible that the hypothesis is true, as it aligns with Bork's apparent confusion and desire to clarify the circumstances. However, without further context or information, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true, as there may be alternative explanations or interpretations based on the information presented. For instance, Bork might not be asking his friends for help, but rather posing the question rhetorically, possibly to make a point or provoke thought. Additionally, although Bork is asking for clarification, the hypothesis could misinterpret his intentions.

Why? Because if my Cuban exile parents would ever found out I saw this movie about this despicable mass murderer of the Cuban revolution, I would be grounded for life. Hey wait? I am an adult, they can't ground me no mas. Director Steven Soderbergh, and newbie commie (sorry Steven, but I had to take Soder shots here) divides the movie in two partes on Commander Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara's revolutionary life. \\"Che: Part 1\\" presents how Che in the mid 1950's joined Fidel Castro's guerilla crew in their revolutionary quest to overthrow Cuban President Fulgencio Batista's regime; which as we all know was a revolutionary success for them, but a gargantuan guerilla disaster to many Cubans as it revolted into Communism. \\"Che: Part 2\\" presents Che trying to revolutionize the T-Shirt industry by pitching T-Shirts with his appalling bearbado face to T-Shirt manufacturers. OK, I am che-chatting a lot of crap towards your way! I meant to say the 'Che: Part 2\\" focuses on Che in the late 60's trying to bring back the revolution, this time to a poverty-stricken Bolivia, but with far different results. In fact, Che ended up being dead meat enchelada when he was captured and killed by the Bolivian militia in 1967. Soderbergh does not include the in-between time of those two instances in Che's life when he commanded the despicable La Cabana Fortress Prison in Cuba, where he mass murdered many Cubans who opposed Communism. That is where I think Soderbergh executed a cinematic injustice by not showing the viewers how atrocious Guevara really was. I did decide to see \\"Che\\" in hopes that Soderbergh would not glamorize him, but instead present how disturbed he really was. Unfortunately, Soderbergh did not do the latter and sadly decided to present Guevara as a Revolutionary hero, which he was not. He was a sick man who thank God is now probably at the bottom of the devil barrel. Now, I do have to be an objectivistic reviewer and must admit that Benicio Del Toro's performance as Che was extremely commanding, and worthy of merit. And that Demian Bichir was a haunting dead-ringer as Fidel Castro in his meticulous performance. But the rest of the cast of \\"Che\\" was primarily comprised of mediocre performances of actors portraying Guerilla soldiers. And as much as I do admire Matt Damon, why did Sodebergh throw him in the revolutionary mix in a Spanish-speaking cameo performance portraying a Bolivian delegate? Soderbergh did not have to present this biopic which is mostly \\"too much talk and not enough action\\" in 4 hours and 30 minutes. We have had too much of Che already, even posthumously with those ridiculous t-shirts, so why give us too much more of him? But I guess when you have the Del Toro by the horns (as you did here Steven), I guess it is your saving grace for not totally executing \\"Che: Parts 1 &2\\". *** Average What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is mostly negative. The reviewer does not like how the director, Steven Soderbergh, chose to present Che Guevara as a revolutionary hero rather than show his darker side.

Bobby studied a small, isolated group of mammals. Will studied a large, healthy population of the same species. Which person didn't observe any loss in genetic diversity? Hint: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show.

Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal. Pelecanos knows a thing or two about capturing the authenticity of urban America with an ethnically and socially diverse cast.

Cotton is now charged with reckless manslaughter. Center Point Fire and Rescue and Jefferson County Sheriff's deputies responded to the Jefferson County Housing Authority complex at 8:19 p.m., said Center Point Fire Chief Donnie West. When medics arrived on the scene, Dezmend was being carried from the apartment. A dispatcher had been providing CPR instruction while first responders were en route and paramedics took over and continued to try to revive the baby while en route to Children's of Alabama. Christian said the boy was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at the hospital. Early information from the scene, he said, was that the father of the child placed him in the bathtub and left the room. When he returned, he found the child unresponsive. Christian on Tuesday said Cotton was questioned by detectives and told them he turned the water on and put the boy in the tub. He then left the room to go play a video game and forgot about the child. When he returned to the bathtub about an hour later, he found Dezmend unresponsive. Dezmend's mother was not home at the time. Two other children live in the home, but only one was there at the time. The children were placed in the care of a grandmother pending a DHR investigation. Sheriff's investigators reviewed the case with Jefferson County District Attorney's Office on Monday and obtained the felony warrant against Cotton. He remains in the county jail.

Iceland, once known only for the midnight sun and the Blue Lagoon hot springs, is now attracting people for its high-adrenalin activities, as well as its unique landscape. Part of it is its accessibility. Anyone using Reykjavik as a layover point from Europe to North America or vice versa can get off the plane and be snowmobiling on a glacier within an hour. Or if the weather is right, skydive or ultra-glide and see the wondrous land from above. Add another day or two to your trip and you can include dog sledding and diving or snorkeling in pure glacier water in the Silfra rift (the divide between the Eurasian and North American continents), where you will swim between the continents and take a good look at the crack beneath the surface. To get the most out of the land of fire and ice, take a week to travel around the entire island. Hire Arctic Surfers, the country's only surf tour company, to take you to some amazing swells, stand-up paddle among icebergs or catch a wave in unusual, picturesque locations. Go rafting down some challenging rivers, or spend the day kayaking around a fjord. And don't forget Iceland’s newest attraction Into The Glacier, the ice tunnel in Langjökull that takes tourists 90 feet below the surface of Europe’s second largest glacier, with a series of tunnels and caverns that will leave you aghast.

After triumphing, he morphs into modern day Ned Thacker (also played by Fairbanks). Ned is born and raised in Kansas by a mother who passes along to him her love of D'Artagnan and The Three Musketeers, despite his father's concern that it is not good for him. In fact, Ned does get into trouble with his (sometimes unwanted) chivalrous attempts to help women. Finally, Ned can stand it no more; he decides to leave dull Kansas. In mirroring scenes, D'Artagnan is astride a somewhat less-than-noble steed, a present from his father for his departure from home, while Ned's father gives him the modern equivalent: a car.

Wolf wants to redeem his father's reputation, but finds that such a feat will be harder than he thought after he encounters hostility from the villagers. Aside from his family, Wolf's only friend is the local policeman Inspector Krogh (Lionel Atwill) who bears an artificial arm, his real arm having been \\"ripped out by the roots\\" in an encounter with the Monster as a child. While investigating his father's castle, Wolf meets Ygor (BÃ©la Lugosi), a demented blacksmith who has survived a hanging for graverobbing and has a deformed neck as a result. Wolf finds the Monster's comatose body in the crypt where his grandfather and father were buried; his father's sarcophagus bears the phrase \\"Henrich von Frankenstein: Maker of Monsters\\" written in chalk. He decides to revive the Monster to prove his father was right, and to restore honor to his family. Wolf uses the torch to scratch out the word \\"Monsters\\" on the casket and write \\"Men\\" beside it. When the Monster (Boris Karloff) is revived, it only responds to Ygor's commands and commits a series of murders; the victims were all jurors at Ygor's trial. Wolf discovers this and confronts Ygor. Wolf shoots Ygor and apparently kills him. The Monster abducts Wolf's son as revenge, but cannot bring himself to kill the child. Krogh and Wolf pursue the Monster to the nearby laboratory, where a struggle ensues, during which the Monster tears out Krogh's false arm. Wolf swings on a rope and knocks the Monster into a molten sulphur pit under the laboratory, saving his son. The film ends with the village turning out to cheer the Frankenstein family as they leave by train. We also see Krogh has a new false arm.

With over 3.7 million members, the group took on a life of its own. Pantsuit Nation's founder, Libby Chamberlain, saw a greater purpose for the group, especially after the shocking election outcome. The New York Times recently reported that Flatiron Books, a division of Macmillan Publishers, is set to publish Chamberlain's upcoming book based on the group’s shared narratives. The Pantsuit Nation book will be released on May 9th and—as described by Chamberlain in a Facebook post—is a \\"book of YOU.

Although Chamberlain refers to it as a book \\"of you, by you,\\" some Pantsuit Nation members are upset that she will potentially profit from their personal stories, which were shared within the confines of a \\"safe space.\\" Some have called it a \\"disgusting betrayal of trust,\\" while others have asked for clarification regarding the book's proceeds.

The fact that Safety Pin Box, a group founded by Mac and another woman of color, was removed from Pantsuit Nation for allegedly attempting to profit has drawn accusations of hypocrisy against Chamberlain.

How many bottles are in the box? Your thoughts:","output":"To find the total number of bottles in the box, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Determine the number of water bottles. A box has 2 dozen water bottles. We know that 1 dozen equals 12, so we should multiply the number of dozens by 12: 2 dozen * 12 = 24 water bottles. Step 2: Determine the number of apple bottles. The box has half a dozen more apple bottles than water bottles. First, let's find how many bottles are half a dozen more: 0.5 dozen * 12 = 6 more apple bottles than water bottles. Since there are 24 water bottles, to find the total number of apple bottles, we need to add the additional 6 apple bottles to the water bottles: 24 water bottles + 6 more apple bottles = 30 apple bottles. Step 3: Find the total number of bottles in the box. Now that we know there are 24 water bottles and 30 apple bottles, we simply add them together: 24 water bottles + 30 apple bottles = 54 bottles. So, there are 54 bottles in the box."},{"instruction":"Melanie does her weekly shopping at the farmer's market. She starts with an 8-ounce wheel of brie cheese. Next is a 1 pound loaf of bread. She grabs a pound of tomatoes and 2 pounds of zucchini. After that, she grabs 1 1/2 pounds of chicken breasts and treats herself to 8 ounces of fresh raspberries and 8 ounces of fresh blueberries. How many pounds of food does she buy? Let's answer step by step:","output":"To determine the total weight of the purchases, we first need to convert all values into the same unit of measurement. Since most of the products are measured in pounds, let's convert the 8-ounce brie cheese, 8-ounce raspberries, and 8-ounce blueberries into pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound. Step 1: Convert ounces to pounds - Brie cheese: 8 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 0.5 pounds - Raspberries: 8 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 0.5 pounds - Blueberries: 8 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 0.5 pounds Now that we have all the different products in pounds, let's add them together to find the total amount of food bought. Step 2: Add the weight of each item in pounds - Brie cheese: 0.5 pounds - Bread: 1 pound - Tomatoes: 1 pound - Zucchini: 2 pounds - Chicken breasts: 1.5 pounds - Raspberries: 0.5 pounds - Blueberries: 0.5 pounds Total weight of food: 0.5 (cheese) + 1 (bread) + 1 (tomatoes) + 2 (zucchini) + 1.5 (chicken breasts) + 0.5 (raspberries) + 0.5 (blueberries) = 7 pounds Melanie buys a total of 7 pounds of food during her weekly shopping at the farmer's market."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the following text. Parenting a child was natural for Cynthia but not Jennifer because","output":"Cynthia grew up in a close-knit family, surrounded by love, care, and nurturing. It was her family's bond and values that ingrained in her the wisdom and instincts necessary for being an effective parent. Cynthia was always very close to her mother, who was a great role model for her. She admired her mother's strength, compassion, and ability to juggle various responsibilities with grace. With time, Cynthia developed a profound understanding of what was required to raise a child successfully. While growing up, Cynthia often found herself taking care of her younger siblings, which gave her hands-on experience in understanding a child's needs. This experience made her empathetic and attentive, equipping her with the ability to anticipate potential challenges a child might face. Moreover, Cynthia had natural leadership qualities and was a skilled problem-solver. As a result, she proved to be an excellent negotiator when it came to helping her siblings navigate their emotions and conflicts. On the other hand, Jennifer grew up in a very different environment. She was an only child, and her parents were often busy with their demanding careers, leaving her independent from a very young age. Jennifer did not have the same kind of support and guidance that Cynthia received, which made it challenging for her to cultivate the necessary skills to excel at parenting naturally. Jennifer's parents did their best to provide for her, but they were not always available to actively teach her the nuances of parenting. As she grew up, Jennifer focused more on her education and career and did not have the opportunity to observe or engage in parenting interactions closely. Consequently, Jennifer lacked the exposure and confidence that Cynthia possessed when it came to nurturing a child. Furthermore, Jennifer had limited exposure to various aspects of child development, such as behavioral patterns, emotional intelligence, and effective communication. This lack of understanding made it hard for her to naturally tackle challenges that came with parenting. Given their contrasting backgrounds, Cynthia's natural inclination towards parenting stemmed from her strong family values, close relationships with her mother and siblings, and her practical experiences in providing care and guidance to her younger siblings. On the other hand, Jennifer, who did not have similar experiences, found it difficult to adapt to the role of a parent seamlessly. However, Jennifer's struggles with parenting did not mean that she was incapable of being a good mother. Understanding her weaknesses, Jennifer took it upon herself to learn and grow as a parent. She attended parenting workshops, read books, and surrounded herself with positive influences to acquire essential knowledge and skills. Through determination and perseverance, Jennifer slowly but steadily gained the confidence and ability to become a loving and nurturing parent. In conclusion, the individual upbringing and life experiences of Cynthia and Jennifer played a significant role in shaping their natural aptitude towards parenting. While Cynthia's background offered her hands-on experiences in nurturing and caring for children, Jennifer's circumstances led her to develop parenting skills later in life. Nevertheless, both Cynthia and Jennifer were dedicated to becoming the best parents they could be, which is a testament to their love and commitment to their children."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"Commensalism describes a relationship between two living organisms where one benefits and the other is not significantly harmed or helped.

Options: - outside - hospital - cabinet - doctor's office - drawer The answer is \\"hospital\\" because Answer:","output":"In a hospital, thermometers are a vital tool used by healthcare professionals in a variety of settings to measure and monitor patients' body temperatures. This is an essential component of medical care as it allows doctors and nurses to assess a patient's overall health, diagnose illnesses, and determine the most appropriate treatment or intervention based on their body temperature. Here's a more in-depth look at how thermometers are used in a hospital setting: 1. Triage and Emergency Room (ER): When a patient is admitted to the ER, their vital signs (including blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature) are assessed to determine the level of urgency for their care. Body temperature can indicate the presence of an infection, inflammation, or other medical conditions that may require immediate attention, which is why thermometers are commonly used during this initial assessment. 2. Inpatient care and intensive care units (ICUs): Patients who are hospitalized for an extended period or are in critical condition may have their body temperature monitored regularly to track the progression of their illness or recovery. Continuous temperature monitoring can help healthcare providers adjust treatments, such as medication dosages or intravenous fluids, to ensure a patient's body temperature remains stable. 3. Surgical suites: Before, during, and after surgery, patients' body temperatures are closely monitored using thermometers to ensure they remain within a safe range. Anesthesia and surgical procedures can cause fluctuations in body temperature, which can be a risk factor for complications if not properly controlled. 4. Pediatrics: Children, especially infants, are more susceptible to rapid shifts in body temperature due to their developing immune systems and smaller body size. Pediatric wards and clinics in hospitals often use thermometers to check children's body temperatures to detect infections, fevers, or other illnesses at an early stage. 5. Obstetrics and gynecology: Thermometers are crucial in both prenatal care and during labor and delivery to monitor the mother's and baby's body temperatures. It helps to identify any potential concerns, such as fever or infection, which may impact the health of both mother and child. 6. Diagnostic testing: Used alongside other diagnostic tools, thermometers can aid in identifying specific medical conditions. For example, a patient with a high body temperature might undergo additional testing to pinpoint the cause of the fever, such as blood tests or imaging studies. While you may also find thermometers in other locations like doctors' offices and some outdoor settings (such as weather stations) for measuring environmental temperatures, their usage in a hospital stands out due to the critical role they play in patient care, diagnostics, and treatment planning.

You should find the minimum absolute difference between 2 integers in the list. The absolute difference is the absolute value of one integer subtracted by another. The output should be a single integer which is the smallest possible absolute distance. [5, -94, -73, -85] A:","output":"To use the definition to come up with the answer, first, we need to understand the provided definition which is to find the minimum absolute difference between 2 integers in the list. This means we need to find the smallest positive difference between any two integers in the list. Now, we have the list of integers: [5, -94, -73, -85]. To accomplish the task, we'll follow these steps: 1. Sort the list in ascending order: [-94, -85, -73, 5]. Sorting the list will make it easier to compare neighboring elements and find the minimum difference. 2. Initialize a variable to store the minimum absolute difference, let's say 'min_difference', and set its value to the largest possible integer (float('inf') or sys.maxsize, for example). 3. Iterate through the sorted list, finding the absolute difference between each neighboring pair of elements. For our list, we have the pairs: - [-94, -85]: difference = |-94 - (-85)| = |-94 + 85| = |9| = 9 - [-85, -73]: difference = |-85 - (-73)| = |-85 + 73| = |12| = 12 - [-73, 5]: difference = |-73 - 5| = |-73 + (-5)| = |-78| = 78 4. Compare each computed difference with the current value of 'min_difference'. If the computed difference is smaller, update the value of 'min_difference' to the current difference. Since the initial value of 'min_difference' is the largest possible integer, it will be updated on the first iteration. - min_difference: initially float('inf') - min_difference after comparing with 9: 9 - min_difference after comparing with 12: 9 (still, as 12 is greater than 9) - min_difference after comparing with 78: 9 (still, as 78 is greater than 9) 5. Once the iterations are completed, the value of 'min_difference' contains the minimum absolute difference between the integers of the list. The final answer is the value of 'min_difference' after all comparisons, which is 9 in this case."},{"instruction":"Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In Rome, to honour the success of his campaigns of conquest, several provinces of the Roman Empire arrive in the city to offer gifts to Julius Caesar.

He co-authored the first medical textbook in English on homosexuality in 1897, and also published works on a variety of sexual practices and inclinations, as well as on transgender psychology. He is credited with introducing the notions of narcissism and autoeroticism, later adopted by psychoanalysis. Ellis was among the pioneering investigators of psychedelic drugs and the author of one of the first written reports to the public about an experience with mescaline, which he conducted on himself in 1896. Ellis, son of Edward Peppen Ellis and Susannah Mary Wheatley, was born in Croydon, Surrey (now part of Greater London). He had four sisters, none of whom married. His father was a sea captain, his mother the daughter of a sea captain, and many other relatives lived on or near the sea. When he was seven his father took him on one of his voyages, during which they called at Sydney, Callao and Antwerp. After his return, Ellis attended the French and German College near Wimbledon, and afterward attended a school in Mitcham. In April 1875, Ellis sailed on his father's ship for Australia; soon after his arrival in Sydney, he obtained a position as a master at a private school. After the discovery of his lack of training, he was fired and became a tutor for a family living a few miles from Carcoar. He spent a year there and then obtained a position as a master at a grammar school in Grafton. The headmaster had died and Ellis carried on the school for that year, but was unsuccessful. At the end of the year, he returned to Sydney and, after three months' training, was given charge of two government part-time elementary schools, one at Sparkes Creek, near Scone, New South Wales and the other at Junction Creek. He lived at the school house on Sparkes Creek for a year.

The justification for the step is as follows: Firstly, before the water can be in the air to form tiny ice crystals, it's important that the temperature conditions in the atmosphere are conducive, which involves the temperature dropping below freezing. This is typically how the water vapor in the air turns into ice crystals. When the temperature drops below the freezing point, the water vapor in the air cools down and condenses to form tiny ice crystals.

In this case, the like terms are 299*c and -321*c. 2. Calculate the result of -350 - 128 3. Calculate the result of 299*c - 321*c 4. Rewrite the equation with the simplified terms. 5. Solve for c. Step-by-step: 1. Combine the like terms (299*c and -321*c): 299*c - 321*c = 299c - 321c This simplifies to: -22c 2. Calculate the result of -350 - 128: This results in: -350 - 128 = -478 3. Rewrite the equation with the simplified terms: -478 = -22c + 908 4. Isolate the term with the variable (c) by subtracting 908 from both sides of the equation: -478 - 908 = -22c This results in: -1386 = -22c 5. Solve for c by dividing both sides of the equation by -22: -1386 / -22 = c This results in: c = 63 So, the solution to the equation is c = 63."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence that about [The Waterman food French; The Waterman priceRange more than £30; The Waterman customer rating 5 out of 5; The Waterman area riverside; The Waterman familyFriendly yes].","output":"Step 1: Identify the key pieces of information: - The Waterman is a French food restaurant. - The price range is more than £30. - The customer rating is 5 out of 5. - It is located in a riverside area. - The restaurant is family-friendly.

The miner is fighting four tax bills issued by the federal tax authority, totaling 30.5 billion reals (15.83 billion) on its earnings abroad. Vale said this is tantamount to double taxation as it paid taxes to foreign governments. The Superior Court of Justice ruled in favor of the federal tax authority in its appeal against an injunction granted in March that suspended payment of the taxes by Vale. Vale says it will now appeal in order to reinstate that suspension. \\"Vale remains confident in its arguments and will continue to pursue all appropriate legal actions until a final decision on the merits is reached,\\" it said in a statement. A statement on the court's website confirmed that the company still had the right to appeal the decision. A Vale spokesperson said the company would not have to make an immediate payment should the tax authority request it, since it planned to appeal against the latest ruling. The dispute over whether the taxes are due is waiting to be judged and is part of a run of appeals begun in the last decade, including one by the National Industry Confederation (CNI), against payment of tax on earnings on foreign operations.

Context: It was a dream, then a place, then a memory. My father built it near the Suwannee River. I like to think it was in the heart of Florida, because it was, and is, in my heart. Its name was Dogland. Some people say you can know others if you know the central incidents that shaped their lives. But an incident is an island in time, and to know the effect of the island on those who land there, you must know something about the river they have traveled. And I must warn you before we begin, I don't know that river well. I visit that time and place like a ghost with poor vision and little memory. I look up the river and see fog rolling in. I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes. And then Grandma Bette wouldn't say a word for half an hour or more, a very long time for Grandma Bette to be quiet. Question: What is probably true about the author? Answer: Available choices: --the author doesn't like their family. --the author hates Grandma Bette. --the author does not know the river in Dogland well. --not enough information. The answer is:","output":"the author does not know the river in Dogland well. The author admits in the context that their knowledge of the past, the river, and the events surrounding their family history is limited and unclear.

The author tries to rely on the stories told by their father, but these stories are often contradicted by Grandma Bette, further complicating their understanding of their family's past.

I work know security and one night at around 2am I walked in the bathroom because a customer complained about a man yelling in the bathroom. I told my partner I would go check it out by myself so he could stay and keep quality control of who comes in the venue. I walk in and in the first cubicle I could see lots and lots of blood on the floor and a pair of feet placed as if he was sitting down. I quickly go to the next cubicle asking at the same time if the person was OK obviously with no response. I look over and it was a horrible bloody mess. I quickly get on the radio and tell my partner to call police and ambulance and to put the place on lock down. I walk around to the from of the cubicle and kick open the door. The man had grabbed a straight razor and cut his arms extremely deep from the wrist downwards all the way to his elbow palms up. On both arms mind you. A good example of what it would look like would be the scene from the terminator 2 where Arnold cuts the skin off from his arm. The ambulance came and had to call another team to collect the body. The building was closed for around a day and a half they had to repaint and do all sorts of things because of so much blood. Ill say they do not train you for seeing such horrible things or even mention that it can happen I'm lucky enough to have a strong head and can handle seeing such horror.

It should also be noted that, in the pre-national era, Catholic religious orientation did not necessarily equate with Croat ethnic identity in Dalmatia.

As more clouds form overhead, it is expected that the grass will grow faster. This phenomenon can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. The direct impact of the rain is clearly visible when talking about the steps involving the wood; rain falling on the wood, seeping into its surface, permeating the wood, and affecting its finish. However, the grass growing faster, while it may be related to the overall weather conditions, is not directly involved in the process of the wood losing its luster or paint. So, despite not being directly related to the process specified, the grass growing faster can be considered as an indirect perturbation for the following reasons: 1. The faster-growing grass indicates increased levels of moisture and precipitation. This increased moisture in the environment may contribute to the wood being subject to more rainwater exposure, further exacerbating the issue. 2. The growth rate of grass may indirectly influence the rate at which the wood is exposed to and affected by different weather conditions. The more grass grows, the higher the likelihood of trapping additional moisture in the area, which could accelerate the effect of the rain on the wood. Therefore, the supposed perturbation caused by more clouds forming overhead and affecting grass growth can be categorized as indirectly impacting a step of the process."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Given recent developments and the need for sustainable energy resources, I will choose renewable energy as my foundation topic. Step 2: Decide on a specific context Now that we have a general topic, it is necessary to narrow it down to something specific within that topic. As there are various sources of renewable energy, I will focus on solar power, which is rapidly becoming a popular and efficient form of alternative energy. Step 3: Determine relevant factors To establish context, it is important to consider the factors that influence solar power adoption and efficiency. This can include technological advancements, geographic location, government policies or incentives, financial considerations, and environmental impact. Step 4: Formulate the context statement Taking all the relevant factors into account, our context statement is as follows: \\"In the current global environment, there is an increasing demand for renewable energy sources to move away from fossil fuels and mitigate climate change. Solar power has emerged as a viable and efficient option, with technology improvements, supportive government policies, and environmental benefits driving its adoption worldwide.\\" Step 5: Create a hypothesis Now that we have a context, we need to propose a hypothesis that predicts a cause-effect relationship in that context. In this case, I will hypothesize about the future of solar power adoption and its impact on the energy market. Step 6: Compose the hypothesis statement Considering the context and factors in play, our hypothesis can be formulated as: \\"Increasing efficiency and affordability of solar power technology, combined with widespread government support, will lead solar energy to become one of the most dominant sources of power, eventually outcompeting fossil fuels in the global energy market by 2050.\\" So our context is the current rise of solar power as a renewable energy source, and our hypothesis is that due to its increasing efficiency, affordability, and government support, solar power will become the dominant energy source and outcompete traditional fossil fuels by 2050."},{"instruction":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

He was somewhere on a dark road, possibly driving to Richmond to kill his former in-laws. That’s when Valentine went on Facebook and started broadcasting live. “She lied on me, had warrants taken out on me,” he told the camera early Tuesday, as he divided his gaze between the phone and the road. “She drug me all the way down to nothing. I loved my wife, but she deserved what she had coming.” In his chilling Facebook livestream, which was later reposted on YouTube, Valentine acknowledged that the violent chain of events he started could end in his own death. “Pleasure knowing all y’all,” he said. “I’ve been very sick for months. And this is something that I could not help. So I don’t know if I’m gonna make it where I’m going, but if I don’t, I wish all of you a good life.” [Pregnant woman executed for refusing abortion, family says] Police in Norlina, a town of 1,100 people just south of the North Carolina-Virginia state line, spent Tuesday and Wednesday trying to unravel what caused Valentine allegedly to kick in the door of his ex-wife’s single-story home and open fire — and then admit to the crime on social media. But more than anything, they wanted to find Earl Valentine. Authorities from the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service joined local and regional law enforcement agencies in a manhunt stretching from Virginia to South Carolina, Norlina Police Chief Taylor Bartholomew told The Washington Post on Wednesday afternoon. Within hours, authorities located Valentine at a motel in Columbia, S.C., about 280 miles south of Norlina. Officials said Valentine committed suicide after being surrounded. He was pronounced dead at the scene. “He shot himself in the head,” Bartholomew told CBS affiliate WLTX. “Think he felt the pressure of being surrounded by marshals. He died alone. At the end of the day, he is a coward.” A man who bragged about killing his wife & teen son was found at the Days Inn on Plumbers Rd in Richland Co. pic.twitter.com/tEgyyjJbz8 — Van Lott (@VanWLTX) September 8, 2016 Hours earlier, Bartholomew said he had talked to Valentine on the phone; the Norlina police chief described the suspected killer as “cold and callous,” saying he showed no remorse for the shootings. “For somebody that had just done something like that, he was calm but he was aggressive,” Bartholomew told The Post on Wednesday. “He was trying to pump me for information. His main focus was to make sure his ex-wife was dead.” Bartholomew quoted Valentine as saying that he wouldn’t be taken alive and that he planned to kill his in-laws, then himself. Police said later that Valentine drove to Richmond after killing his son and injuring his ex-wife, then turned around and drove south, to Columbia. Keisha Valentine and her teenage son had moved to Norlina nearly nine months ago to get away from her abusive ex-husband, Bartholomew said. She was granted a year-long domestic violence restraining order, but it expired last month. The police chief said there’s evidence that Earl Valentine had exchanged heated words with his ex-wife’s family on Facebook. Still, it’s unclear what prompted Tuesday morning’s assault on Hyco Street. [A man beat a 7-month-old girl to death after finding out he wasn’t her father, prosecutor says] About 1:30 a.m., Earl Valentine burst through the front door of the house and marched to his ex-wife’s bedroom, Bartholomew said. Keisha Valentine leaned against the door, trying to keep him out, but he managed to shoot her anyway. Their son, awakened by the commotion, confronted his father. But the teenager fell to the floor and was shot in the chest. Before he died, he called police and told them what had happened. If he had been captured alive, Earl Valentine faced a first-degree murder charge in his son’s death, Bartholomew said. Since Facebook Live launched in April, millions have used the service to offer a glimpse into the big moments and small details of their lives. The view isn’t always pretty. Earl Valentine is the latest example of a person using Facebook Live to discuss a violent act — or to showcase the act itself. In June, Larossi Abballa, a terrorism suspect accused of killing a French police captain and his partner in their home, broadcast the aftermath of the attack on Facebook Live. An occasionally tearful Abballa, speaking a mix of French and Arabic, swore allegiance to the Islamic State militant group and encouraged others to follow his example and kill police. A month later, a Georgia mother went on her daughter’s Facebook account to broadcast herself beating the teenager — punishment for posting sexually explicit pictures on the site. “This is my page now,” Shanavia Miller told the camera after she fixed her hair. “Now I’m gonna need y’all to send this viral. Please share this because I’m not done. More to come.” A July shooting in Norfolk that injured three men was inadvertently captured on Facebook Live. In the video, three men are sitting in a car, smoking and listening to rap music. Five minutes into the video, there’s a series of 30 gunshots. And after police in Minnesota fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop in July, his girlfriend opened Facebook and began livestreaming the aftermath. The video was viewed millions of times, sparking outrage and widespread protests. The nascent live-streaming service is raising philosophical questions about the power of unfiltered Internet video that can reach millions instantly. As The Post’s Caitlin Dewey wrote in July: Facebook Live, which launched globally in April, has quickly emerged as one of the Internet’s dominant platforms for streaming unfiltered, real-time video. As Facebook has learned in the past week, however, that status comes with unique challenges. Real-time video is exceedingly difficult to moderate, as it reaches its largest audience instantaneously and can be redacted only after that moment of impact. That limits the power of even a dedicated, 24-7 moderation team, which Facebook Live has. Despite growing concern that the tool could be abused — several shootings, a police standoff and an accused jihadist’s confession have streamed on Facebook already — the company has remained intentionally (and characteristically) vague on the composition and guidelines of its moderation team. 1 of 17 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × 17 shocking crime stories from 2016 View Photos A beloved mayor in Fairfax faced allegations of a meth-for-sex scheme, and a man (successfully) used a “the-stop-smoking-pill-made-me-do-it” defense after shooting his wife.

(WNCN) – A Warren County man wanted after shooting his ex-wife and then his 15-year-old son in the chest was found dead in South Carolina from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said. The shooting incident happened on Tuesday around 1:30 a.m. at a home located at 403 Hyco St. in Norlina. Police say Earl Valentine kicked in the back door of his ex-wife’s house and shot her, then his son in the chest. The 15-year-old boy, who called 911, died while talking to the operator. Keisha Valentine, his ex-wife, is in critical, but stable condition. “I’ve been in law enforcement 20 years and I’ve never seen anything like this this guy is bragging about it on social media. No remorse whatsoever. When we spoke to him on the phone he told us he is basically armed and dangerous,” Norlina Police Chief Taylor Bartholomew said. Keisha Valentine and her son moved to Norlina from the Charlotte area to escape Earl Valentine’s abuse, Bartholomew said. A restraining order against Earl Valentine expired last month. Earl Valentine posted a Facebook Live video where he admitted to the shooting. “What’s up everybody? I just killed my (expletive) wife,” Valentine said in part of the video. “I don’t feel no (expletive) remorse for what I did.” Bartholomew said he has been in contact with Earl Valentine by phone, but his phone has now been turned off. “He shot his own son. And for me and my guys? It’s hard to wrap your brain around that. We’re pretty angry about it especially the way he’s acting over it,” Bartholomew said. At the time of the phone calls, police say the suspect was believed to be in the Richmond area. Police say they tracked him to Richmond then to Columbia, SC where the U.S. Marshals Service found Valentine in a motel on Wednesday. The marshals found Valentine dead when they went into the room, according to police. Keisha Valentine underwent surgery Wednesday for wounds to her chest.

Although he does not show any overt signs of mental illness, he hopes to avoid hard labor and serve the rest of his sentence in a more relaxed hospital environment. McMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a strict authoritarian woman who passive-aggressively employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients and keep them submissive. McMurphy finds that they are actually more fearful of Nurse Ratched and her methods than they are focused on their main goal of eventually becoming functional in the outside world. In order to help them achieve this (as he believes), McMurphy establishes himself immediately as the leader of his fellow patients. The ward's other patients include Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), a nervous, anxiety-prone young man with a noticeable stutter; Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), a man disposed to childish fits of temper; Martini (Danny DeVito), who is delusional; Dale Harding (William Redfield), a high-strung, well-educated paranoid; Max Taber (Christopher Lloyd), who is chronically belligerent and profane; Jim Sefelt (William Duell), an epileptic man; and \\"Chief\\" Bromden (Will Sampson), a silent Native American-descended man of very imposing stature who is believed to be both deaf and mute.

The area is an inlet in the inner Oslofjord, situated between Gamlebyen and Akershus Fortress. It serves as an outlet for the river Akerselva. Since the 2000s, it has been undergoing urban redevelopment, being transformed from a container port. When completed, the Bjørvika neighborhood will be a new cultural and urban center in Oslo. The multi-purpose medium-rises of the Barcode Project is nearing its completion to the north; to the east the residential area of Sørenga is under construction. The National Opera is located at Bjørvika, and both the Oslo Public Library and the Munch/Stenersen museum is currently under construction here, the latter replacing the existing Munch Museum in 2020. - Akerselva or Akerselven ( English : Aker River ) is a river which flows through Oslo . It starts at Maridalsvannet in Oslomarka , and follows the urban areas Nordre Aker , Sagene , Grünerløkka , Oslo centre and Grønland , whereby it finally ends at Paulsenkaien and Oset in Bjørvika . The river is considered to be a part of the Nordmarkvassdraget , and has the watercourse number 006.Z . The entire river is about 8.2 kilometres ( 5.1 mi ) long , and has a difference in elevation between source and mouth of approximately 149 metres ( 489 ft ) . Earlier , the river gave power to numerous industry companies in Oslo . Akerselven is \`\` Oslo 's green lung '' ; many parks and nature trails are to be found by its path , from Grønland to Maridalsvannet . A walk from along Akerselven from the rural Frysja down through the different parts of Oslo all the way down to the city centre is an amazing experience and a walk through the history of Oslo . Salmon run and spawn in the upper part of the river . Aker River in the 1970s was heavily contaminated after 150 years of industrial and sewage discharges along river . In the 1980s , a local initiative to limit emissions and revive the flora and fauna of the river began . Early in March 2011 , Oslo 's water and wastewater department accidentally discharged 6,000 litres ( 1,600 US gal ) of chlorine into the river near its headwaters , rendering the river virtually dead as of 11 March 2011 . According to Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation , the discharge occurred at the water treatment plant Oset . - The Oslofjord is an inlet in the south-east of Norway, stretching from an imaginary line between the Torbjørnskjær and Færder lighthouses and down to Langesund in the south to Oslo in the north. It is part of the Skagerrak strait, connecting the North Sea and the Kattegat sea area, which leads to the Baltic Sea. The Oslofjord is not a fjord in the geological sense - in Norwegian the term \\"fjord\\" can refer to a wide range of waterways. The bay is divided into the inner (\\"indre\\") and outer (\\"ytre\\") Oslofjord at the point of the Drøbak Sound.

Development of \\"Push the Button\\" began while the Sugababes travelled to the United States to work on their fourth studio album, Taller in More Ways (2005). American producer and songwriter Dallas Austin collaborated with the group during the album's initial stages of development. He visited London to work with them, although the group later travelled to the US and stayed with him at his mansion in Atlanta, Georgia. Austin wrote five tracks for the album, including \\"Push the Button\\", which he composed in collaboration with the Sugababes. According to group member Heidi Range, the song was \\"the very last thing\\" completed for the album.\\"Push the Button\\" was conceptualised after group member Keisha Buchanan developed an infatuation with another artist who was collaborating with Austin. Buchanan told Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian that she made advances towards the man, but he was unaware of her intentions: \\"I really liked this guy, so I'd be like, there's this good movie coming out, you know, dropping hints. And he'd be like, that movie sounds great, let me know what it's like if you go see it.

What is the main ingredient of this dish?","output":"The phrase \\"mess of pottage\\" refers to a story from the Bible, specifically in the Book of Genesis, where Esau sells his birthright to his younger brother, Jacob, in exchange for a meal. The main ingredient of this dish is lentils. The story is found in Genesis 25:29-34, and it goes as follows: \\"Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished. He said to Jacob, 'Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I’m famished!' (That is why he was also called Edom). Jacob replied, 'First, sell me your birthright.' 'Look, I am about to die,' Esau said. 'What good is the birthright to me?' But Jacob said, 'Swear to me first.' So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and the lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright.\\" In the context of this narrative, the mess of pottage is essentially a lentil stew or soup, which is the primary component of the dish. Lentils, being a type of legume, were a common food source in the region and time in which the story takes place. They are rich in protein, fiber, and various essential nutrients, making them an important dietary staple in ancient times. Today, various versions of lentil stew or soup exist in different cultures, often with added ingredients such as vegetables, spices, and sometimes meat. The specific details of the recipe that Jacob prepared for Esau are not provided in the biblical text, but it is likely that it contained some combination of the aforementioned elements. It is important to note that the significance of this story goes beyond the mess of pottage itself. In the cultural context of the time, the birthright carried a tremendous amount of weight, as it not only determined the inheritance of the family's wealth and property but also the spiritual responsibilities and blessings of the family line. Selling his birthright for the lentil stew showed Esau's disregard for these responsibilities and prioritization of his immediate physical needs, while Jacob's cunning manipulation of his brother's hunger demonstrated his opportunistic and ambitious nature."},{"instruction":"Complete the following sentence.

Article: The first time I went for a walk around my father-in-law's neighborhood was garbage day, and I was shocked to see what people were throwing out. It was back in 1981, and I saw many people gathered in someone's front yard. As I went nearer to see what was happening I got my first introduction to yard sales. For the few dollars I had in my wallet, I was able to buy a seven-inch black-and-white portable TV. I also bought a flashlight. The following weekend, at another yard sale, I saw a 14-inch color1 TV being sold for almost nothing. I felt I could not miss the offer and bought it. Now I had two sets and couldn't wait to see what else I could afford the next weekend. Spring ended, and by then I had accumulated almost every type of electronic equipment I had always wished to have back home. Then this new idea came to mind. I had heard about a man who traveled back home every few months. He drove a truck filled with boxes of new and used stuff that people were sending to s. So I told my father that I would send as many types of items as I could so that he could start his resale business. Every few months I would gather several boxes of American \\"junk\\" --- televisions, toasters, fans, hair dryers, etc. and send them home.

According to new research, our bodies are highly evolved for running long distances, an ability that allowed our ancestors to conquer the African savannahs.","output":"The topic of this discussion revolves around the notion that humans are naturally adapted and evolved for long-distance running. This idea is backed by recent research which suggests that our bodies have developed unique characteristics over time, enabling our ancestors to thrive in the African savannahs. Such evolutionary adaptations allowed early humans to outrun their prey, secure resources, and ultimately expand their territories. In the following paragraphs, we will delve deeper into the biological, scientific, and historical aspects that support this idea, as well as discussing its implications for modern-day human health and fitness. One of the main distinguishing characteristics of humans in comparison to other primates, is our bipedal locomotion. Our ancestors developed an upright posture and the ability to walk on two legs, freeing up our hands to manipulate objects, create tools, and engage in complex social behaviors. Bipedalism was an evolutionarily advantageous characteristic because it allowed our ancestors to cover vast distances more energy-efficiently. In addition to bipedalism, the human body exhibits other unique adaptations that are specifically designed to support long-distance running. For example, the ability to dissipate heat through sweating is one such adaptation. This cooling mechanism, which is more efficient in humans than in most other mammals, prevents our bodies from overheating during extended periods of physical activity, such as running. Another significant adaptation is the presence of a large Achilles tendon, which stores and releases energy during running, acting as a spring for each stride. This tendon, along with other elastic elements in our legs, enables us to conserve energy while running, and is a key component of our endurance capabilities. The nuchal ligament is another characteristic feature that supports our ability to run long distances. Found at the base of the skull, this ligament stabilizes the head during running, preventing it from bobbing up and down and helping us maintain a clear line of vision. This, in turn, allows for better navigation and awareness of our surroundings while in motion. Our ancestors, particularly Homo erectus and early members of the Homo sapiens species, relied heavily on persistence hunting, a technique that involved chasing prey over long distances until the animal became exhausted. Early humans lacked the physical strength of predators like lions or the speed of a cheetah but made up for it with their incredible endurance. Persistence hunting favored individuals with the physiological capacity to run long distances, leading to the selection of these traits in succeeding generations. The physiological benefits of endurance running can also be seen in the mental aspect of human development. Long-distance running has been proven to stimulate the production of endorphins, also known as the \\"feel-good\\" hormones, reducing stress and promoting overall well-being. In addition, the ability to maintain focus and mental clarity during long runs would have been essential for our ancestors in tracking and outsmarting prey. These evolutionary adaptations still hold significance in the modern era. Today, many people participate in long-distance running events like marathons or practice endurance sports for personal fitness and mental health benefits. Moreover, the idea that humans are inherently \\"born to run\\" may alter the way people view physical activity and wellness, potentially encouraging a more active lifestyle for those who embrace this notion. In conclusion, the compelling evidence supporting the idea that humans are born to run offers fascinating insights into our evolutionary history. Our unique physiological adaptations for long-distance running have not only provided us with a means to survive and thrive in challenging environments, but they have also shaped our mental and emotional well-being. By exploring and appreciating these evolutionary traits, we can better understand our inherent potential for physical endurance and its continuing relevance to modern human life."},{"instruction":"Q: Where is Somtal network located?

We can reach this conclusion by carefully examining the premise and extracting relevant information that supports the hypothesis. First, let us break down the premise into various components: 1. The technician wanted to escape into tomorrow: This part of the premise indicates that the technician possibly wished to move forward from his present situation or move away from some event in the recent past. His eagerness to escape might affect his physical movements. 2. The technician regained consciousness: This part of the premise suggests that the technician was previously unconscious or not fully conscious. Regaining consciousness might imply that he had recently experienced some physical or mental strain, which could impact his balance and stability. 3. The technician jumped on his feet: This action demonstrates that the technician got up quickly and urgently, likely driven by his desire to escape into tomorrow. This sudden movement can lead to unsteadiness, especially if the person was not fully conscious or experienced a recent strain. 4. The technician's feet were not all that stable: This statement directly addresses the technician's physical stability. It suggests that his feet were not providing adequate support and balance, making it more difficult for him to avoid stumbling or falling. Taking all these components into account, we can deduce that the technician was attempting to quickly stand and escape a situation, but his stability was compromised partly due to regaining consciousness, the urgency to escape, and the possible physical or mental strain experienced before becoming unconscious. This unsteadiness accurately aligns with the hypothesis \\"The technician was having trouble keeping his balance.\\" Therefore, given the detailed explanation of the premise, it is reasonable to conclude that it does entail the hypothesis \\"The technician was having trouble keeping his balance.\\""},{"instruction":"The Jolly Fisherman has been redrawn with the words \\"go away\\" on his chest on the cover of the Remain-supporting New European magazine.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: Let's think about this question step by step. First, we need to identify the smallest positive even integer. An even integer is a whole number that is divisible by 2. In the positive integers (which are all the numbers greater than 0), the smallest one that satisfies this condition is 2. Next, we need to figure out the smallest positive odd integer. An odd integer is a whole number that is not divisible by 2. In the positive integers, the smallest odd integer is 1. Now we have the two numbers we need to add together: 2 (the smallest positive even integer) and 1 (the smallest positive odd integer). Doing the math, we find the sum: 2 + 1 = 3.

Your words won’t feel genuine unless you really are sincere about wanting to patch things up. Your friend might also benefit from some time to cool down, but don’t wait for her to reach out to you. If you’re prepared to let bygones be bygones, give her a call. Take the time to consider your friend’s perspective and why she might be hurt. Thinking about the reasons she might be angry or hurt will help you have a more open conversation. If you’ve considered the disagreement from your friend’s perspective, your own actions might seem different than they did at the time. You might realize that you acted in a way that was unnecessarily hurtful or dismissive. Even if your friend also behaved badly, this shouldn’t keep you from taking a careful look at your own part in the disagreement. No matter what she did, you’re still responsible for your own words and actions. Think ahead of time what you plan to apologize for, being as specific as you can. When you have a talk with your friend, you’ll want her to know that you’re prepared to completely let go of the negative feelings that came up during the disagreement. Disagreements are natural among friends, but they don’t have to mean the end of the friendship. Be prepared to say everything you need to say, but keep it in a polite, friendly tone. Allow your friend to say whatever she needs to say. Listen carefully to what she says, and don’t interrupt her while she’s talking. Thank your friend for taking the time to talk to you even if it doesn’t go the way you’d have preferred. Regardless of how your friend responds to your overtures, it’s best if you can try to completely forgive your friend for any hurts you still may feel. Reliving the disagreement, reminding yourself how right you were (and how wrong she was) won’t help either of you. Know that sometimes a friendship can tolerate the disagreement, and sometimes it can’t. Keep an open mind as you work to repair the friendship, and hopefully your friend will come around in time. If your friend’s behavior is consistently unpredictable, erratic or volatile, you might not be able to repair the friendship. Instead, focus on finding solutions for your disagreement. Political views are deeply personal to people, and you won’t be able to find a solution by trying to force agreement. Instead, try reminding each other of what you value in your friendship. If your disagreement was about different political viewpoints, one way of resolving the differences is to focus on what you have in common. At the same time, don’t feel like you have to back away from your own political views. Be open and honest about your views without feeling pressured to relive the disagreement with your friend. Sometimes a friendship may need a break. During political campaigns, or when feelings are running high surrounding particular political issues, you may not be able to repair a broken friendship. Realize that you and your friend may make up your differences in the future, and stay open to reconciliation if possible. Don’t do or say anything to remove the possibility of eventual repair. Agreeing to go your separate ways for now doesn’t have to be a permanent break. Don’t beat yourself up for having had this disagreement.

She didn't get a buzz from it. What might she have experienced when drinking? Options: - intoxication - toxicity - getting laid - sickness - nausea Let's think carefully first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"Loraine did not enjoy drinking alcohol and did not feel any buzz from it. We will examine each of the given options to understand her possible experiences when drinking alcohol. 1. Intoxication: Intoxication refers to the state of being under the influence of alcohol or other substances. This is usually associated with feelings of euphoria, relaxed inhibitions, and a \\"buzz.\\" Since Loraine did not get a buzz from alcohol, she might not have experienced intoxication. 2. Toxicity: Toxicity refers to the harmful effects of a substance on the body. While alcohol can be toxic in high doses, it is unlikely Loraine experienced toxicity as an immediate result of consuming alcohol, especially if she did not drink much. 3. Getting laid: This term typically refers to engaging in sexual activity. It is unlikely that Loraine experienced \\"getting laid\\" as a direct consequence of not enjoying alcohol. However, it is important to note that social scenarios involving alcohol might increase the chances of sexual encounters, but this doesn't directly relate to her experience with drinking alcohol. 4. Sickness: Sickness can encompass a variety of symptoms, both physical and mental, that people may experience after consuming alcohol. These may include dizziness, headaches, feeling faint, or even vomiting. If Loraine did not like drinking alcohol, she might have experienced sickness as a result of consuming it. 5. Nausea: Nausea is a sensation of discomfort in the upper stomach, typically accompanied by an urge to vomit. Many people experience nausea after consuming alcohol, particularly if they are not used to it or have consumed too much. It is possible that Loraine experienced nausea when she drank alcohol, contributing to her dislike for it. Based on the step-by-step analysis of the options, it seems that Loraine might have experienced sickness and/or nausea when she consumed alcohol since she didn't like it and didn't get a buzz from it. Intoxication and toxicity are less likely, as they did not seem to match her experience. \\"Getting laid\\" is unrelated to her physical or emotional experience from drinking alcohol."},{"instruction":"Twelve new stars have been recently added to the CIA's Memorial Wall, which pays tribute to the 102 men and woman who lost their lives in the line of duty for the spy agency.

When a mysterious signal broadcasts a message promising hope and salvation, a group of diverse survivors will face their personal demons and unite in a perilous journey to seek out the source of the signal, known only as \\"The Smithereens.\\" Act 1: Years after an apocalyptic event, the Earth is left in ruins and the remaining population has adapted to a harsh and unforgiving environment. Resources are scarce, and remnants of advanced technology exist only in fragments, referred to as \\"Smithereens\\". These Smithereens hold the key to survival, as they serve various purposes such as power generation, communication, and transportation. An enigmatic signal called \\"The Smithereens\\" starts broadcasting, speaking of a haven that promises a chance to rebuild civilization. Intrigued by the message, five survivors from diverse backgrounds decide to team up to seek out the origin of the signal: 1. Sam, a skilled mechanic who lost his family in the apocalypse and has dedicated his life to preserving the legacy of their inventions. 2. Luna, an ex-soldier with untapped leadership skills, struggling to find her place in the world. 3. Avery, an intelligent medic who holds vital knowledge of ancient medical practices. 4. Keon, a fearless nomad with a mysterious past and unmatched combat prowess. 5. Cass, a brilliant engineer, focused on finding a way to restore lost technology. Act 2: The group embarks on a treacherous journey across the wasteland, facing various obstacles, including hostile warlords, mutated creatures, and weather anomalies. Along the way, they collect essential Smithereens, which allow them to overcome the challenges they encounter. As they grow closer, they learn more about each other's pasts and motivations, forming an unshakable bond. Cass, in particular, becomes determined to reverse-engineer the Smithereens to create a device that might restore order and connection to the world. Act 3: Upon reaching the source of the signal, they discover that it was an ancient, advanced AI system that autonomously created and broadcasted the message to gather any remaining survivors. The AI informs them that multiple signals were sent across the globe to form communities centered around the restoration of humanity. The group decides to join the AI's effort and establish a haven for global survivors. Assembling their collected Smithereens, they work tirelessly to develop new technologies, share valuable knowledge, and expand their reach to connect with others.

But as of Sept. 9, ICE had made 43% more arrests year-over-year, reports the Washington Post. Why hasn't that translated into more deportations? According to ICE agents, policy experts, and immigration lawyers, illegal border crossings are down, reducing the number of would-be immigrants who can be more rapidly deported. There has also been a boost in financial support for advocacy groups offering free legal help for those facing deportation. Of those arrested between Jan. 22 and Sept. 2, 28,000 are \\"non-criminal\\" violators, triple what it was for the same period in 2016. An Atlanta immigration attorney says the increase, and the overall increase in ICE arrests, shows ICE agents are targeting \\"low-hanging fruit\\": relatives of alleged violators and immigrants who've agreed to regular meetings with ICE. Arrests are ongoing. In a four-day span ending Wednesday, 498 people—64% with criminal convictions—were arrested in a crackdown on so-called \\"sanctuary cities\\" like Los Angeles and Denver, reports the New York Times. Because of pro bono legal help from groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center leading to a backlog of cases, however, it could be years before detainees are deported, the Post reports. Expand this summary.","output":"In 2017, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported 211,068 immigrants by the end of the fiscal year, showing a decrease of around 30,000 compared to the previous year and almost half of the 410,000 deported in 2012. Despite a 43% increase in arrests year-over-year, deportations have not risen proportionally. This can be attributed to several factors, according to ICE agents, policy experts, and immigration lawyers. Firstly, illegal border crossings have declined, which in turn reduces the number of would-be immigrants who can be deported swiftly. Increased surveillance, enforcement, and various deterrence policies have made it more difficult for individuals to cross the border illegally, contributing to the decrease in deportations. Secondly, financial support for advocacy groups offering free legal assistance to those facing deportation has significantly grown. This additional support has enabled more individuals to access legal representation and mount a defense against deportation, leading to a backlog of cases. Of the individuals arrested between January 22 and September 2, 28,000 are classified as \\"non-criminal\\" violators, which is three times the number for the same period in 2016. This increase highlights a shift in focus by ICE agents, who are now targeting what has been termed \\"low-hanging fruit\\". These are primarily relatives of alleged violators and immigrants who have agreed to regular meetings with ICE. In a four-day operation targeting so-called \\"sanctuary cities\\" like Los Angeles and Denver, ICE agents arrested 498 people, 64% of whom had criminal convictions. The availability of pro bono legal help from advocacy groups such as the Southern Poverty Law Center has led to a significant backlog of cases, which means it could take years for detainees to be deported. This increased legal support has enabled individuals to challenge their removal from the country more effectively, thus prolonging the deportation process and contributing to the overall reduction in deportations despite the increase in arrests. In conclusion, although the number of arrests by ICE agents has increased, deportations have not risen proportionally due to several key factors. These include a decrease in illegal border crossings, increased financial support for advocacy groups providing free legal help to those facing deportation, a backlog of cases in the legal system, and a shift in focus by ICE agents towards non-criminal violators who are easier to apprehend."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Rhode Island is the smallest in area, the eighth least populous, and the second most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states, following New Jersey. Its official name is also the longest of any state in the Union. Rhode Island is bordered by Connecticut to the west, Massachusetts to the north and east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound. The state also shares a short maritime border with New York. - Biotechnology is the use of living systems and organisms to develop or make products, or \\"any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use\\" (UN Convention on Biological Diversity, Art. 2). Depending on the tools and applications, it often overlaps with the (related) fields of bioengineering, biomedical engineering, biomanufacturing, molecular engineering, etc. - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade. - New Hampshire is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States.

The city proper covers with an estimated population of 667,137 in 2015, making it the largest city in New England and the 23rd most populous city in the United States. The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area known as Greater Boston, a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) home to a census-estimated 4.7 million people in 2014 and ranking as the tenth-largest such area in the country. Alternately, as a Combined Statistical Area (CSA), this wider commuting region is home to some 8.1 million people, making it the sixth-largest as such in the United States. - Homestead Records was a Long Island, New York-based sublabel of music distributor Dutch East India Trading. It was founded in 1984 by Sam Berger, who was the American independent buyer for Dutch East India Trading. Berger was finding that many bands who had perhaps released their own first 45 were having difficulty coming up with the finances to press followups. He was able to convince the owner of the company to press and distribute records for bands that already had recorded an album, and have the bands supply the artwork. It is considered instrumental in launching the post-hardcore and noise rock genres. When Berger left to work with Midnight Records, he recommended 18-year-old Gerard Cosloy, whom he knew from Boston and who published a fanzine that Homestead distributed. Cosloy went on to sign many of the notable acts. Cosloy was succeeded by Ken Katkin and later by Steven Joerg. The label's last release was Ivo Perelman's \\"Cama de terra\\" in 1996. - WFMU is a listener-supported, independent community radio station headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey, United States, broadcasting at 91.1 (at 90.1 as WMFU, and at 91.9 as W219DQ) MHz FM, presenting a freeform radio format.

This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and most of the important technological innovations were British. The social, economic and political changes in the previous centuries in Great Britain contributed. Whereas absolutism stayed the normal form of power execution through most parts of Europe, institutions ensured property rights and political safety to the people in the UK after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Aided by these legal and cultural foundations, an entrepreneurial spirit and consumer revolution drove industrialisation in Britain, which would be emulated in countries around the world. A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby encouraging economic development. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm.

It was originally self-released by Barlow on cassette in 1987, under the Sentridoh name, the solo home-recording project of American rock musician and Sebadoh member Lou Barlow, and sold at record stores in his native Massachusetts in an approximate run of 100. - Britpop is a UK based music and culture movement in the mid 1990s which emphasised \\"Britishness\\", and produced bright, catchy pop music partly in reaction to the US led grunge music and the UK's own shoegazing music scene. The most successful bands associated with the movement are Oasis, Blur, Suede and Pulp; those groups would come to be known as its \\"big four\\". The timespan of Britpop is generally considered to be 1993-1997, with 1994-1995, and a chart battle between Blur and Oasis dubbed \\"The Battle of Britpop\\", being the epicentre of activity. While music was the main focus, fashion, art, and politics also got involved, with artists such as Damien Hirst being involved in creating videos for Blur, and being labelled as Britart or Britpop artists, and Tony Blair and New Labour aligning themselves with the movement. - Bloomington is a city in and the county seat of Monroe County in the southern region of the U.S. state of Indiana. It is the seventh-largest city in Indiana and the fourth-largest outside the Indianapolis metropolitan area. According to the Monroe County History Center, Bloomington is known as the \\"Gateway to Scenic Southern Indiana.\\" The city was established in 1818 by a group of settlers from Kentucky, Tennessee, the Carolinas and Virginia who were so impressed with \\"a haven of blooms\\" that they called it Bloomington. - Robert Pollard (born Robert Ellsworth Pollard Jr. on October 31, 1957) is an American rock musician and singer-songwriter who is the leader and creative force behind indie rock group Guided by Voices. In addition to his work with Guided by Voices, he continues to have a prolific solo career with 21 solo albums released so far. - Louis Knox Barlow (born July 17, 1966) is an American alternative rock musician and songwriter. A founding member of the groups Dinosaur Jr., Sebadoh and The Folk Implosion, Barlow is credited with helping to pioneer the lo-fi style of rock music in the late 1980s and early 1990s. His first band, in Amherst, Massachusetts, was Deep Wound. Barlow was born in Dayton, Ohio and was raised in Jackson, Michigan and Westfield, Massachusetts. - Sebadoh ( / sbdo / ) is an American indie rock band , currently signed with Joyful Noise Recordings . Sebadoh were formed in 1988 in Northampton , Massachusetts , by Eric Gaffney and Dinosaur Jr bass player Lou Barlow . Along with such bands as Pavement and Guided by Voices , Sebadoh helped pioneer lo - fi music , a style of indie rock characterized by low - fidelity recording techniques , often on four - track machines . The band 's early output , such as 1990 's The Freed Man and Weed Forestin ' and 1991 's Sebadoh III , was typical of this style . After a 14 - year recording hiatus , during which time members pursued other projects while occasionally touring as Sebadoh , the group returned in 2013 with the Secret EP and a full - length album titled Defend Yourself , which were both self - recorded . Lead singer Lou Barlow says of the band 's resurrected sound , \`\` We kept to ourselves during the recording and did n't have much , if any , outside intervention . That , to my mind , makes it a true Sebadoh record and aligns the style of Defend Yourself with our early releases . '' - Joyful Noise Recordings is an independent record label from Indianapolis, Indiana.

It has made frequent personnel changes but always maintained the presence of principal songwriter Robert Pollard. - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.

Considered the \\"father of tubular designs\\" for high-rises, Khan was also a pioneer in computer-aided design (CAD). He was the designer of the Sears Tower, since renamed Willis Tower, the tallest building in the world from 1973 until 1998, and the 100-story John Hancock Center. Khan, more than any other individual, ushered in a renaissance in skyscraper construction during the second half of the 20th century. Khan's central innovation in skyscraper design and construction was the idea of the \\"tube\\" structural system for tall buildings, including the framed tube, trussed tube, and bundled tube variants. His \\"tube concept\\", using all the exterior wall perimeter structure of a building to simulate a thin-walled tube, revolutionized tall building design. Most buildings over 40 stories constructed since the 1960s now use a tube design derived from Khan's structural engineering principles. Lateral loads (horizontal forces) such as wind forces, seismic forces, etc., begin to dominate the structural system and take on increasing importance in the overall building system as the building height increases. Wind forces become very substantial, and forces caused by earthquakes, etc. are important as well. The tubular designs resist such forces for tall buildings. Tube structures are stiff and have significant advantages over other framing systems. They not only make the buildings structurally stronger and more efficient, but also significantly reduce the structural material requirements. The reduction of material makes the buildings economically more efficient and reduces environmental impact. The tubular designs enable buildings to reach even greater heights. Tubular systems allow greater interior space and further enable buildings to take on various shapes, offering added freedom to architects. These new designs opened an economic door for contractors, engineers, architects, and investors, providing vast amounts of real estate space on minimal plots of land. Khan was among a group of engineers who encouraged a rebirth in skyscraper construction after a hiatus of over thirty years. The tubular systems have yet to reach their limit when it comes to height. Another important feature of the tubular systems is that buildings can be constructed using steel or reinforced concrete, or a composite of the two, to reach greater heights. Khan pioneered the use of lightweight concrete for high-rise buildings, at a time when reinforced concrete was used for mostly low-rise construction of only a few stories in height. Most of Khan's designs were conceived considering pre-fabrication and repetition of components so projects could be quickly built with minimal errors. The population explosion, starting with the baby boom of the 1950s, created widespread concern about the amount of available living space, which Khan solved by building upward. More than any other 20th-century engineer, Fazlur Rahman Khan made it possible for people to live and work in \\"cities in the sky.\\" Mark Sarkisian (Director of Structural and Seismic Engineering at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill) said, \\"Khan was a visionary who transformed skyscrapers into sky cities while staying firmly grounded in the fundamentals of engineering.\\" Ask a question about this article.","output":"Could you provide examples of other notable buildings designed by Fazlur Rahman Khan using his tubular designs?"},{"instruction":"What happens next in this paragraph?

The Gloucester County School Board is trying to prevent Gavin Grimm from using the bathroom that matches his gender identity when school resumes later this year, saying it will \\"put parents' constitutional rights in jeopardy.'' Grimm sued the school district last year for the right to use the boys’ restroom after the school board enacted a policy limiting bathroom use to the one corresponding with a person’s biological sex rather than the gender with which the student identifies. Grimm was born female but identifies as male. \\"Depriving parents of any say over whether their children should be exposed to members of the opposite biological sex, possibly in a state of full or complete undress, in intimate settings deprives parents of their right to direct the education and upbringing of their children,'' attorneys for the school board wrote. The ACLU, which is defending Grimm, has argued that forcing him to use the girls' bathroom is a violation of Title IX and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The issue is one that has been hotly debated in schools, courts and state legislatures across the U.S. The Obama administration in May directed the nation’s public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity or risk losing their federal funding. Twenty-one states have sued to overturn the directive. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Grimm in April. The court reinstated Grimm's Title IX claim and sent it back to the district court for further consideration. The school board wants the Supreme Court to put Grimm's district court case on hold until the justices decide whether to review the appeals court decision. The board says it plans to file its petition for Supreme Court review by late August.

Unfortunately, my recent movie experience turned out to be a frustrating and unsatisfying event as I sat through the suspense thriller, \\"Derailed Journey,\\" directed by Edward Donovan. Step 2: Plot summary Next, I'll provide a brief plot summary, highlighting key points, and express my disappointment in the storyline and its execution. The movie follows a group of strangers on a train journey that takes a terrifying turn when they become trapped in a deadly game of cat and mouse. The plot had potential, but the uninspired storytelling and predictable twists ultimately derailed my enjoyment. Step 3: Acting Now I'll focus on the acting and share my thoughts on the performances, specifically pointing out some weaknesses. Despite having a promising cast, including some well-known actors, the performances were disappointingly lackluster. It felt as though the actors were struggling to breathe life into their two-dimensional characters, who never managed to evoke any sense of empathy or intrigue. Step 4: Technical aspects I'll discuss the technical aspects of the movie, such as editing, sound design, and visual effects, and emphasize my dissatisfaction with these elements. The technical aspects of \\"Derailed Journey\\" also left much to be desired. The editing was disjointed, and the sound design failed to amplify the suspenseful moments effectively. To top it off, poor visual effects and uninspired set design further detracted from any sense of realism. Step 5: Conclusion To wrap up the review, I'll provide a concise summary of my thoughts and share a final assessment of the movie. In conclusion, \\"Derailed Journey\\" is a disappointing movie experience that fails to deliver on its suspenseful premise. With lackluster performances, a predictable plot, and subpar technical aspects, I cannot recommend this film even to the most devoted thriller fans. My final rating for \\"Derailed Journey\\" is a mere 1.5 out of 5 stars, and I hope upcoming titles from the same director will showcase much-needed improvement."},{"instruction":"\\"You too!

Jackson joins O'Neil and other soldiers as they pass through the wormhole, though expresses concern at a nuclear bomb they brought as a last resort. On the arid desert planet, they find themselves in a pyramid-like structure. Jackson locates the Stargate and its controls, but lacks the coordinates to return home. O'Neil orders some men to stay behind to guard the Stargate. Nearby, they discover a tribe of humans working to mine a strange mineral from the planet. Jackson is able to communicate with them as they speak a variation of Ancient Egyptian, and finds the tribe sees them as emissaries of their god Ra (Jaye Davidson). The tribe's chieftain Kasuf (Eric Avari) presents Jackson with his daughter Sha'uri (Mili Avital) as a gift, and though Jackson initially refuses her, he becomes romantically attached to her. O'Neil befriends the teenaged boy Skaara (Alexis Cruz) and his friends, in part because Skaara reminds him of his long-deceased son. Through hidden markings and discussions with the tribe, Jackson learns that Ra is an alien being who had come to Earth during the Ancient Egyptian period, looking to possess human bodies to extend his own life.

He had a sister, Julie J. Boucher, the Associate Director of the Library Research Service at the Colorado State Library (who died in a mountain-climbing accident on October 12, 1996). As a child, Eric developed an interest in international politics that was encouraged by his parents. An avid news watcher, one of his earliest memories was of the John F. Kennedy assassination. In June 1979, Biafra co-founded the record label Alternative Tentacles, with which the Dead Kennedys released their first single, \\"California Uber Alles\\". The label was created to allow the band to release albums without having to deal with pressure from major labels to change their music, although the major labels were not willing to sign the band due to their songs being deemed too controversial. After dealing with Cherry Red in the UK and IRS Records in the US for their first album Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables, the band released all later albums, and later pressings of Fresh Fruit on Alternative Tentacles. The exception being live albums released after the band's break-up, which the other band members compiled from recordings in the band partnership's vaults without Biafra's input or endorsement.. Biafra has been the owner of the company since its founding, though he does not receive a salary for his position; Biafra has referred to his position in the company as \\"absentee thoughtlord\\". Biafra is an ardent collector of unusual vinyl records of all kinds, from 1950s and 1960s ethno-pop recordings by the likes of Les Baxter and Esquivel to vanity pressings that have circulated regionally, to German crooner Heino (for whom he would later participate in the documentary Heino: Made In Germany); he cites his always growing collection as one of his biggest musical influences. In 1993 he gave an interview to RE/Search Publications for their second Incredibly Strange Music book focusing primarily on these records, and later participated in a two-part episode of Fuse TV's program Crate Diggers on the same subject. His interest in such recordings, often categorized as outsider music, led to his discovery of the prolific (and schizophrenic) singer/songwriter/artist Wesley Willis, whom he signed to Alternative Tentacles in 1994, preceding Willis' major label deal with American Recordings. His collection grew so large that on October 1, 2005, Biafra donated a portion of his collection to an annual yard sale co-promoted by Alternative Tentacles and held at their warehouse in Emeryville, California. In 2006, along with Alternative Tentacles employee and The Frisk lead singer Jesse Luscious, Biafra began co-hosting The Alternative Tentacles Batcast, a downloadable podcast hosted by alternativetentacles.com. The show primarily focuses on interviews with artists and bands that are currently signed to the Alternative Tentacles label, although there are also occasional episodes where Biafra devoted the show to answering fan questions. who did he co-found it with?","output":"Eric Biafra co-founded the record label Alternative Tentacles in June 1979. The article does not explicitly mention the name of the person he co-founded it with. However, the main purpose of creating the label was to allow the Dead Kennedys band to release albums without having to deal with pressure from major labels to change their music."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral Answer:","output":"The final step of the process described is the formation of fossils.

Solve 4046 = -52*u - 171*u - 15*u for u.","output":"Okay, let's make this really easy to understand, just like a story. First, we need to find out the total of \\"-52*u\\", \\"-171*u\\" and \\"-15*u\\". These three can be added together because they all share the same \\"u\\", just like if you had 52 apples, 171 apples, and 15 apples, you could add them all together to find out how many apples you had in total. Now, if we add -52, -171, and -15 together, we will get -238. So our equation is now \\"4046 = -238*u\\". Now, we want to find the value of \\"u\\". To do that, we can imagine that we are sharing 4046 candies equally into 238 baskets (assuming that we can divide candies down to the smallest bit). Each basket will represent the value of \\"u\\". Finally, we divide 4046 by -238. When you divide a positive number by a negative number, the answer will be negative. So, after doing the division, we find out that \\"u\\" is approximately equal to -17. Just like if you divided 4046 candies equally into 238 baskets, each basket would have about -17 candies.

After being wounded in battle he was assigned to the Fuhrer’s SS Escort. Leader: Adolf Hitler, pictured here giving the Nazi salute from his car in 1934, was served by Misch during the Second World War. He. steadfastly claimed after the war that he never heard Hitler talking. about the destruction of the Jews, nor was he ever asked to transmit a. message about the Holocaust through the equipment entrusted to him. ‘He. was so nice, so friendly,’ he would say. ‘The Boss was good to me.

Answer:","output":"The priory where Roger de Birthorpe was imprisoned for trespass after a raid is located in England. Roger de Birthorpe was a 14th-century English knight who lived during the reigns of King Edward III and King Richard II. In 1392, Roger de Birthorpe and a group of armed men carried out a raid on Thomas Kellam's manor in Lancashire. Following the raid, Birthorpe was charged with trespass and subsequently imprisoned in a priory located in England. The specific priory in which Birthorpe was imprisoned is not well-documented in historical records. However, it is likely that the priory was affiliated with the Knights Hospitallers or Knights of St. John, a medieval Christian religious order that provided care for sick pilgrims and also operated as a military order. This is because Roger de Birthorpe was a member of this order, having held the position of turcopolier, a high-ranking military officer responsible for leading the order's light cavalry. During the time of Roger de Birthorpe, England was home to numerous priories and monasteries, which were often used as detention centers for high-ranking prisoners. Monastic orders like the Knights Hospitallers played a significant role in the administration of justice and thought to act as custodians for certain prisoners. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the priory in which Roger de Birthorpe was imprisoned was of the same religious order as the one he was a member. Unfortunately, due to the lack of specific information available on the details of Birthorpe's imprisonment, it is not possible to accurately identify the exact location of the priory in England. Nevertheless, such historical events give us a glimpse into the connection between monastic institutions, the nobility, and the legal system in medieval England."},{"instruction":"Write a \\"[a].\\" movie review (Available choices: [a]. negative; [b]. positive;).","output":"I will write a negative movie review, as the user has selected option \\"[a].\\" Title: Disappointment at the Cineplex - A Review of \\"Falling Star\\" As a sincere lover of cinema, I always look forward to a new release with open curiosity. Unfortunately, my experience watching \\"Falling Star\\" left me with a profound sense of disappointment. Despite a promising premise, the film failed to deliver on multiple levels. First and foremost, the plot was poorly developed and riddled with inconsistencies. The story revolves around the lead character, Tom, who aspires to become a renowned astronomer despite numerous obstacles. While this concept initially intrigued me, the execution turned out to be bland and predictable. The film's climax, intended to be a game-changing revelation, was obvious within the first 30 minutes. Moreover, some elements felt entirely disjointed, with irrelevant subplots diluting the central theme. The lack of character development further hindered my ability to connect with the story. Tom, played by Michael Jameson, had a surface-level personality that felt two-dimensional. This issue was exacerbated by the palpable lack of chemistry between Jameson and his co-star, Isabella Bernard, who portrayed Tom's love interest, Lucy. Despite multiple attempts, their on-screen relationship never appeared genuine, making it difficult to root for their characters. Moreover, \\"Falling Star\\" was visually underwhelming. The production quality was mediocre, with unsophisticated cinematography that left much to be desired. Even the locations and sets felt uninspired, which is tremendously disappointing considering the potential to explore celestial themes. The film's astronomical backdrop could have easily lent itself to captivating visuals, but instead, the director chose mundane settings. Lastly, the dialogue was stilted and unnatural, causing numerous cringe-worthy moments. Characters frequently delivered monologues that felt more like exposition than genuine interactions. The script could have benefited significantly from revisions and more nuance, lending itself to a greater emotional impact. In summary, \\"Falling Star\\" is a regrettable misfire in terms of storytelling, character development, visuals, and dialogue. This once-promising concept was ultimately bogged down by its poor execution. I'd recommend skipping this film in favor of a brighter cinematic gem."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Step 1: Choose a language other than English for the sentence.

After a brief talk to Meek, he flicks his beak at his face and marches to a hay stack. Meek chops the stack various times and on the last chop, he thinks he kills the duck. Daffy fakes his death by squirting ketchup and throwing his feathers around (\\"You crushed my little head!\\") This fools Meek by pretending he is beheaded and runs rapidly. Meek feels sad and goes back to his house, where Daffy is seen putting lots of sugar cubes into a cup of coffee. Meek guiltily tells him that he has killed a duck. Daffy cheers up Meek into giving him a cup of coffee and asks how many lumps (of sugar) his wife usually gives him. Meek shows Daffy a 'lump' (a bump on his head), and Daffy hits him on the head (giving him another 'lump') and pours cream on it. Daffy dances on the cakes and pies, singing \\"Shortening Bread\\", and Meek immediately recognizes the duck he thought he killed (\\"Say.

He says that \\"loud noises can cause animals to startle\\" and \\"all mammals are animals\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","output":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, we can deduce the answer step by step: Step 1: Recognize that all mammals are animals. The teacher mentioned that \\"all mammals are animals,\\" which is a true statement and helps us categorize mammals as a subset of animals. Step 2: Understand the effect of loud noises on animals. The teacher also mentioned that \\"loud noises can cause animals to startle.\\" This tells us that animals in general can get startled due to loud noises.

Kate leaves a note in the mailbox for the next tenant to forward her letters should some slip through the system, further adding that the paint-embedded pawprints on the walkway leading into the house were already there when she arrived. Two years earlier in 2004, Alex Wyler (Reeves), an architect, arrives at the lake house and finds Kate's letter in the mailbox. The house is neglected, with no sign of paw prints anywhere. During the house's restoration, a dog runs through Alex's paint and leaves fresh paw prints right where Kate said they would be. Baffled, Alex writes back, asking how Kate knew about the paw prints since the house was unoccupied until he arrived. On Valentine's Day 2006, Kate witnesses a traffic accident near Daley Plaza and tries to save the male victim, unsuccessfully. She impulsively drives back to the lake house, finds Alex's letter and writes back. Both Alex and Kate continue passing messages to each other via the mailbox, and each watches its flag go up and down as the message leaves and the reply arrives as they wait at the mailbox. They cautiously look around each time the flag changes, hoping to somehow spot the other. It is in vain as they are alone at the mailbox. They then discover that they are living exactly two years apart. Their correspondence takes them through several events, including Alex finding a book, Persuasion, at a train station where Kate said she had lost it, and Alex taking Kate on a walking tour of his favorite places in Chicago via an annotated map that he leaves in the mailbox. Alex eventually meets Kate at a party but he doesn't mention it in their letter relationship to her because she did not \\"know\\" him at that time. She did remember the meeting as a vague memory in the past. For Alex, the meeting happened in the Present but for Kate, it had already taken place in the past without her knowing that it was Alex.

(A) The gravitational force (B) The speed of sound in the gas (C) The type of gas particles (D) The pressure of the gas Stream of consciousness reasoning: To determine the answer, let's consider the properties of gases and their behavior in varying conditions. It is essential to understand how gas properties such as pressure, volume, and temperature are interrelated. We can begin by analyzing the Ideal Gas Law, expressed as PV=nRT. This equation provides crucial information about a gas's properties: P represents pressure, V represents volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature. As we are interested in the primary factor influencing the density of a gas at constant temperature, we focus on conditions where T remains the same. Density of a gas can be represented as ρ = n/V, or the number of moles of the gas divided by its volume. Now let's examine each option and think about how much they influence density: (A) The gravitational force may have an effect on the distribution of gas in a gravitational field, but it does not determine the density of the gas at constant temperature. (B) The speed of sound in the gas depends upon factors such as temperature and the type of gas particles, but not directly on density. (C) The type of gas particles affects the mass of each particle, which influences the total mass and the magnitude of the gas constant R. However, this is still not the primary factor determining the density of a gas at a constant temperature. (D) The pressure of the gas generally has a direct influence on gas density. According to the given condition of a constant temperature, an increase in pressure would force the gas particles to occupy a smaller volume (from the Ideal Gas Law equation). Since density is directly proportional to the number of moles and inversely proportional to the volume, when volume decreases, the density increases. Thus, the pressure of the gas has a significant impact on its density when the temperature is constant. Final Answer: (D) The pressure of the gas is the primary factor influencing the density of a gas at constant temperature."},{"instruction":"Question: Two neighbors attended the same school. Mike learned about biology while Dan learned more about the weather. They both were among the best in the school. Which person read more about humidity? Hint: Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen. Treaties and voluntary actions are needed to reduce emissions to lessen the amount of global warming that will take place in the future.

The record's two singles—the title track and \\"Prove It\\"—both charted on the UK Top 30. Its commercial success in the UK was partly fueled by Nick Kent's rave two-page review of the album for NME.While holidaying in London after Marquee Moon's completion, Verlaine saw that Television had been put on NME's front cover and notified Elektra's press department, who encouraged the band to capitalize on their success there with a tour of the UK. However, the label had already organized for the band to perform on Peter Gabriel's American tour as a supporting act. Television played small theatres and some larger club venues, and received more mainstream exposure, but were not well received by Gabriel's middle-American progressive rock audiences, and found the tour unnerving.In May, Television embarked on a highly successful theatre tour of the UK with Blondie as their supporting act. They were enthusiastically received by audiences there, and Verlaine said it was refreshing to perform at large theatres after playing smaller clubs for four years. He nonetheless felt that Blondie did not suit their show because they were too different artistically, even though both groups had emerged from the music scene at CBGB. Blondie guitarist Chris Stein said that Television were \\"so competitive\\" and unaccommodating on the tour, and that they did not treat it like a joint effort.

Milunovich calls it the Applesphere. “The interaction among products and services is becoming more real,” he writes. “Appleites soon will be able work on the Mac in the office; surf the Net on the iPad in the living room; play games or watch TV on Apple TV in the den; use CarPlay for automotive services; interact with iBeacon in stores; transact with a payment capability; rely on iWatch for health and athletic monitoring on a run; and use the iPhone everywhere as the digital hub. The introduction of Continuity at WWDC, allowing handoffs between products, makes the experience more seamless. “Apple judges itself by product experience and customer satisfaction/loyalty. Those are important metrics for any business but especially so if trying to lay the foundation for future related products and services. Since technology provides choice—the days of lock-in largely are past—loyalty will be critical to maintaining a premium brand and margins.

People from all around the UK gathered to celebrate music in special parties called music festivals. These festivals had big stages for the most important musicians who everyone wanted to listen to, called headline acts. But one day, some people who like to study things made a discovery. They noticed that most of the headline acts at the music festivals were the same kind of singers, who were men, and they played the same type of music, which was rock music. It was like seeing the same crayon color over and over again in a big beautiful crayon box! The researchers wanted to know if this meant that the UK festivals were not showing the true colors of music, so they wrote down what they found in a study. This study made people think about the music festivals. They started to wonder how it would be if different musicians, like ones who sing pop songs or play hip-hop music, were also given a chance to be headline acts. Maybe it was time to share the stage with other talented performers who were not just male rock acts. It would make the whole music festival scene a colorful and interesting place for everyone to enjoy. So, children, the music festivals need to become like a magical rainbow of music acts from all kinds of styles and backgrounds! This way, people can see how amazingly diverse the UK music scene is, and every musician gets the chance to shine at these festivals.

A high school cheerleader whose dad secretly filmed her in her bedroom and the bathroom has revealed that she has forgiven him - and even encouraged her mother not to file for a divorce. Michaela Smith, from Pell City, Alabama, was just 15 when she saw a red flashing light between her trophies in her bedroom in April 2011 and realized it was a camera. Investigations revealed that her father, Michael Smith, had filmed her on four separate occasions and stashed the images on his computer. He was jailed for a year. Now Michaela, who is 18, has spoken out as she receives the Bryant-Jordan Student-Athlete Achievement Award, which honors student-athletes who have overcome hardship, on Monday. Ordeal: Michaela Smith, a high school cheerleader in Alabama, has said she forgives her father for recording her in her bedroom and in the bathroom - a crime that saw him locked up for a year. Even though she was initially distraught that her father had recorded her, she said she has since learned to forgive him because the experience has allowed her to help other victims. 'I lost my innocence that day,' Michaela, who does not believe in sex before marriage, told AL.com. 'I realize it was horrible but it was a necessary price. in order to help my father and to use this experience to help others. That sacrifice has created positive changes in so many other people.' Now that he has been in prison, he realizes what he has done wrong, she said. 'Sometimes it takes hitting rock bottom. for us to make a change and that is what happened to my father,' she. said. 'I am so thankful for the year he spent in prison because it truly. saved his life.' Michaela also described her horror when she changed from her church clothes into a more comfortable t-shirt - and saw the camera flashing. Her mother was also in the room and said she immediately feared the worst, but tried to cover up her bad thoughts, for Michaela's sake. Support: Her mother Rhonda, left, walked out on her father when they discovered he had been filming Michaela, but she has not divorced him and they still attend the same church. 'I said something like I put it up there while I was cleaning and didn't know how to shut it off,' Rhonda said. 'I didn't want to worry her.' But she told her other daughter, Janet, who asked a friend adept at computer forensics for help and pictures of Michaela were later found on her father's computer. He was arrested in April 2011 and indicted the following November. 'This man was supposed to protect me from all the bad in the world,' Michaela said. 'He put that camera in my room and had been using it to look at me for months. I've never felt so destroyed.' Ahead of the incident - when her mother was struggling to cope with her father's drinking - Michaela had told her mother that she didn't want her to get a divorce. 'Families are supposed to stick together,' she said. 'Marriages are not easy. A man and wife should stay together. They made a promise to God. There is always counseling and help if things get bad.' But her mother wishes she had stayed with her gut instinct and divorced him. Still, she remains married to him and they attend the same church. Forgiving: Michaela said that she realizes her father had hit rock bottom and is aware of how much he hurt their family. She said she is thankful for the incident because it has allowed her to help other victims. Moving on: Michaela, pictured with fellow cheerleaders, missed a lot of school amid the stress of the case but has maintained a solid GPA and now hopes to attend Auburn following her senior year. Michaela said she never blamed her mother for staying with her father, calling her 'the best thing in my world'. As the case dragged on, Michaela struggled to eat or sleep and rarely attended school. Her father had been bailed out by wealthy relatives, and she lived in fear she would see him. After her father was sentenced, she started therapy and realized that she could take her bad experiences and use them to help others at church groups, youth groups and after school. Her father was released from prison last March but if he tries to speak with her, he will be sent back. This arrangement could change with Michaela's consent - but she said she is not ready yet. He told AL.com that he had long struggled with an addicted to pornography and regretted how it had destroyed his family. He said he had not watched it since his wife and daughter left him three years ago.

However, I can provide a general interpretation based on the given lines of the conversation. Before the current conversation, there was most likely a discussion happening between two individuals, one identified as 'W' while the other one referred to as 'M'. During the prior conversation, it seems that the topic deviated from the main subject, or there was an attempt to bring up a separate, unrelated matter. It's also possible that the discussion became too complex or tangential, losing focus on the core issue at hand. Person 'W' made an effort to streamline and refocus the conversation, suggesting that the current subject be the primary focus, and the unrelated matter could be discussed later. This indicates that person 'W' was concerned about time management and effective communication, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the focus on a single point or topic. In response, person 'M' agreed to the suggestion made by person 'W', showing their willingness to return to the main topic and concentrate on the matter at hand. Maintaining cooperation and staying aligned on what is being discussed is crucial to achieving a productive conversation and ensuring that the primary goal or objective is understood and achieved. In summary, the lines of conversation provided suggest that there was a discussion taking place, which might have strayed off topic or introduced unrelated matters. Person 'W' attempted to regain focus by suggesting that the unrelated topic be discussed later, while person 'M' agreed to this proposal, showing their commitment to concentrate on the main subject for the time being.

When you want to hang a picture, it is common practice to place it inside a frame first. The frame provides stability, protection, and aesthetic appeal to the picture. Framed pictures can then be hung on walls using nails or other hanging mechanisms. So, it makes sense that putting a picture in a frame is a step towards hanging it. Sentence B: \\"You can hang a picture putting it into a concrete block.\\" - This sentence is not logical. Concrete blocks are typically used for building structures, and they are not suitable for displaying pictures. Embedding a picture within a concrete block would render the picture inaccessible and non-viewable. Furthermore, hanging a concrete block from a wall to display the picture is impractical due to the weight and rigidity of the block. Consequently, putting a picture in a concrete block is not a logical way to hang it.

Greenhouse gases have the ability to absorb and emit infrared radiation, which increases the overall temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. The production of meat, particularly from livestock such as cattle, pigs, and chickens, contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions. This is due to multiple factors, including: 1. Methane Emissions: Ruminant animals like cows and sheep produce methane during digestion through a process called enteric fermentation. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, around 28 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. 2. Deforestation: To create space for livestock farming and the cultivation of crops used as animal feed, vast areas of forests have been cut down. Deforestation contributes to the increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing and storing carbon dioxide. 3. Manure Management: Animal manure emits greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide and methane. Nitrous oxide, in particular, is approximately 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. 4. Fossil Fuels: The production of meat requires considerable energy for purposes like animal feed production, heating, and cooling livestock buildings, as well as the transportation and processing of meat products which contribute to the carbon dioxide emissions. By making meat illegal, various indirect consequences would affect the global warming process: 1. Lower Methane Emissions: If meat production were to be banned, there would be a significant reduction in the number of livestock, thus reducing methane emissions from enteric fermentation. 2. Reduced Deforestation: The elimination of meat production would decrease the demand for agricultural land dedicated to livestock and animal feed crops, reducing deforestation rates and allowing forests to thrive and absorb more carbon dioxide. 3. Better Manure Management: A decrease in livestock numbers would lead to reduced manure production, which in turn, would lower nitrous oxide and methane emissions from manure management systems. 4. Decreased Fossil Fuel Usage: Banning meat production would mean fewer resources would be spent on livestock production processes, reducing fossil fuel consumption and associated carbon dioxide emissions. In conclusion, making meat illegal would indirectly impact the global warming process by influencing multiple factors contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Although this action would not have a direct impact on any specific step in the global warming process, it would lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that exacerbate climate change."},{"instruction":"Q:I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Enemy Mine Movie plot: In the late 21st century, an interstellar war between the humans (associated as the Bilateral Terran Alliance, or BTA) and the Dracs (a sentient, bipedal reptilian humanoid race) is fought. Battles are periodically fought between fighter spacecraft, and no human pilot hates the Dracs more than Willis E. Davidge (Dennis Quaid). During one such battle, Davidge and Drac pilot Jeriba Shigan (Louis Gossett, Jr.) engage in a dogfight which results in both crash-landing on Fyrine IV, an alien world uninhabited by intelligent life, with two moons, a breathable atmosphere, water, native fauna, and a hostile environment. After initial hostilities, the two eventually learn to cooperate to survive. They work together to build a shelter for protection against meteorite storms, a natural phenomenon that periodically strikes the planet. Over the next three years, they overcome their differences, become friends and learn each other's languages and cultures. Each saves the other's life several times. Davidge, haunted by dreams of spaceships landing on the planet, leaves in search of help. He finds evidence of humans, but learns that the planet has only been periodically visited by human miners known as \\"Scavengers\\", who use Dracs as slave labor. He returns to warn Jeriba, (nicknamed \\"Jerry\\"), only to discover that Jeriba is pregnant. It is revealed that Dracs reproduce asexually. A blizzard and an attack by an indigenous predator forces Davidge and Jeriba to flee their shelter. To pass the time Jeriba teaches Davidge his full lineage. Jeriba later slowly dies in childbirth, but not before making Davidge swear to take the child back to the Drac homeworld and recite his full ancestry, so that he can join Drac society. Davidge raises the child Zammis (Bumper Robinson). Davidge and Zammis form a very close bond and the young Drac loves Davidge as any sentient child loves a parent, despite referring to Davidge as \\"uncle\\".

Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"When two nuclear warheads of equal power impact, the resulting explosion and effects would be significantly devastating. The incident could either occur due to an intentional nuclear strike or an accidental event. Regardless of the specific context, the detonation would generate a sequence of catastrophic consequences, as discussed below. 1. Blast damage: Upon impact, the explosive force from the simultaneous detonation of two warheads would first demolish structures and infrastructures. The blast radius could span several kilometers, with buildings being flattened or severely damaged. The destruction would also extend to bridges, roads, and other crucial transport links. 2. Thermal radiation: The explosion would release an immense amount of thermal radiation, affecting a vast area. Objects and people within proximity would be instantaneously vaporized, while individuals farther from the epicenter would experience severe burns and blisters. In addition, the extreme heat would ignite wildfires, causing widespread devastation. 3. Electromagnetic pulse (EMP): The detonation of two nuclear warheads would emit a powerful EMP, which could overload and damage electrical and electronic devices within a considerable radius. Communication, transportation, and power systems would be impaired, causing widespread blackouts and compromising essential services. 4. Radiation: People exposed to the immediate nuclear radiation risk acute poisoning, which could cause rapid illness or death. Additionally, the affected areas would be contaminated with radioactive fallout, rendering them unsafe for habitation or agriculture for extended periods. 5. Environmental consequences: The nuclear detonation would produce a dust cloud with millions of tonnes of particulate matter, which could block sunlight temporarily and cause a drop in regional temperatures. This phenomenon, known as a nuclear winter, could lead to crop failures and famine, endangering ecosystems and human lives. Now, let's address the second part of your query: \\"Are ATM services back to normal?\\" This question seems to be unrelated to the consequences of nuclear warhead impact. Given the context of a nuclear event, it is essential to emphasize that the aftermath would severely disrupt everyday services, including banking systems. ATMs would likely not function due to power outages, loss of communication channels, and destruction within the affected region. Recovery could take an extended period, and the resumption of essential services like ATM functioning would depend on the scale of the disaster, infrastructure restoration, and communication network repair. In conclusion, the two questions do not have the same meaning and pertain to different scenarios. The first question sheds light on the catastrophic consequences of two nukes impacting, while the second question discusses the restoration of ATM services, which would be severely compromised in the aftermath of a nuclear detonation."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this \\"Mod your Xbox 360.

The complexity of the task depends heavily on the type of material the statue is made of and the intricacy of the designs. Here are two proposed solutions to clean a statue: Solution 1: Professional Conservation If the statue is a costly art piece, an antique, or has significant historical or sentimental value, it is recommended to consult with a professional conservator. These professionals have specialized training in the care and preservation of artistic and historic objects. They can assess the state of the statue, identify the type of material it is made from, and establish the correct cleaning procedure it requires. The conservators will usually perform a series of tests on inconspicuous areas to ascertain the safest means of cleaning. They might utilize specific equipment (like lasers) or chemicals that aren't usually available to the general public. The conservator will not only clean the statue but also provide guidelines about how to maintain it, considering the statue's patina or intended aged look, which might be appealing for some and should be preserved. Solution 2: DIY Cleaning For less valuable statues, a DIY approach can be sufficient. You just need to make sure you understand the material the statue is made from - wood, marble, brass, bronze, etc. Each type of material requires a specific cleaning technique. For instance, if it’s a brass statue, soapy warm water, a soft cloth, and brass cleaner are sufficient. Additional efforts may be needed if patina has formed. A marble statue often requires a gentler method involving a pH-neutral stone soap and warm water. Wooden statues need dry cleaning methods because water can cause swelling and deformation of the statue. Regardless of the material, it's crucial to be as gentle as possible. Use soft brushes (like the ones used for watercolor) to remove loose dirt. For more substantial dirt or residue, the gentle use of a toothbrush might help. Remember to always dry the statue after cleaning to avoid any water damage or stains. In conclusion, the optimal solution depends on the statue's value (monetary or sentimental) and the owner's resources and ability. In general, professional conservation is the best approach for high-value statues since professionals have the right skills, knowledge, and equipment to handle intricate cleaning tasks. General maintenance or cleaning can be done by the owner, but only if it involves minimum risk and uses appropriate and gentle cleaning methods. If you are unsure, it is best to seek advice from professionals."},{"instruction":"\\"Party at the NSA\\" is a protest song and charity single originally recorded by electropop music group Yacht released in August 15, 2013.

This is not to say that Sicily was completely isolated from trends elsewhere in Europe. Architecture in the island's major cities was strongly influenced by the family of the sculptor Domenico Gagini, who arrived from Florence in 1463. This family of sculptors and painters decorated churches and buildings with ornate decorative and figurative sculpture. Less than a century after his family had begun to cautiously decorate the island's churches (1531–37), Antonio Gagini completed the proscenium-like arch of the \\"Capella della Madonna\\" in the \\"Santuario dell'Annunziata\\" at Trapani. This pedimented arch to the sanctuary has pilasters — not fluted, but decorated heavily with relief busts of the saints; and, most importantly in terms of architecture, the pediment is adorned by reclining saints supporting swags linked to the central shield that crowns the pediment. This ornate pediment, although still unbroken, was one of the first signs that Sicily was forming its own style of decorative architecture. Similar in style is the Chiesa del Gesù (Illustration 14), constructed between 1564 and 1633, which also shows early signs of the Sicilian Baroque. Thus a particular brand of Baroque architecture had begun to evolve in Sicily long before the earthquake of 1693. While the majority of those buildings that can be clearly classified as Baroque in style date from around 1650, the scarcity of these isolated, surviving examples of Sicily's 17th-century architectural history makes it hard to fully and accurately evaluate the architecture immediately before the natural disaster: the earthquake destroyed not only most of the buildings, but also most of their documentation. Yet more information has been lost in subsequent earthquakes and severe bombing during World War II. The earliest example of Baroque on the island is Giulio Lasso's Quattro Canti, an octagonal piazza, or circus, constructed around 1610 at the crossroads of the city's two principal streets. Around this intersection are four open sides, being the streets, and...","output":"The name of the pediment adorned by reclining saints is the \\"Capella della Madonna\\" in the \\"Santuario dell'Annunziata\\" at Trapani."},{"instruction":"Next question: how many pennants did the braves win in a row?","output":"Well, the Atlanta Braves, which is a baseball team, won 14 pennants in a row.

Smaller species survived; the large, slow-growing animals were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something similar could be happening in the oceans. That the seas are being over-fished has been known for years and researchers such as Ransom Myers and Boris Worm have shown how fast things are changing. They have looked at half a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods do not attempt to estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish species in particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time. According to their latest paper published in Nature, the biomass of large predators (animals that kill and eat other animals) inanes fishery is reduced on average by 80% within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas, it has halved again since then. Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative . One reason for this is that fishing technology has improved. Today's vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar, which were not available 50 years ago. That means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines would have been more saturated with fish. Some individuals would therefore not have been caught, since baited hooks would have been available to trap them, leading to an underestimate of fish stocks in the past. Furthermore, in the early days of longline fishing, a lot of fish were lost to sharks after they had been hooked. That is no longer a problem, because there are fewer sharks around noise. Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future management efforts must take into account. They believe the date support an idea current among marine...

He started studying the weather there as well. Which city didn't have rain that can kill aquatic life? A:","output":"Aspen is the city that didn't have rain that can kill aquatic life. In this scenario, the ecologist moved from Aspen, where there was no air pollution, to Seattle, which experienced a significant amount of air pollution. Air pollution, especially when in high levels, is known to have various negative impacts on the environment, human health, and the well-being of ecosystems, including aquatic life. One specific effect of air pollution that can be detrimental to aquatic life is the formation of acid rain. Acid rain is a result of the presence of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the atmosphere, which are released primarily from burning fossil fuels. These substances combine with atmospheric water vapor, resulting in the formation of acids such as sulfuric acid and nitric acid. Consequently, these acids fall back to the Earth's surface in the form of precipitation, commonly known as acid rain. When acidic rain falls in water bodies such as rivers, lakes, or oceans, it can lead to several adverse effects on aquatic life. Acid rain can lower the pH levels of aquatic habitats, potentially making the water toxic to entire ecosystems, killing off sensitive species, and disrupting the natural balance. Acid rain can also alter the concentrations of essential nutrients in the water, leading to imbalances in the populations of various species of microorganisms, plants, and animals. Since Aspen had no air pollution, it indicates that the air quality in this city is generally clean and, therefore, does not have the necessary conditions to develop harmful acid rain that can kill aquatic life. In contrast, Seattle has a high level of air pollution, which increases the chances of experiencing acid rain that can negatively impact aquatic ecosystems in that area. For these reasons, it is Aspen that didn't have rain that can kill aquatic life."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Je mange une pomme.

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.

First and foremost, it is essential to understand that different wavelengths of light can have distinct effects on human eyes and skin. The electromagnetic spectrum includes various categories of light, differing in wavelengths and energies. Specifically, Ultraviolet (UV) light, which covers the range of 100-400 nanometers (nm), is present in sunlight and has known detrimental effects on human eyes and skin. UV light can be further classified into three types based on its wavelength: 1. UVA (320-400 nm) 2. UVB (290-320 nm) 3. UVC (200-290 nm) UVA and UVB rays, which constitute most of the UV light from the sun, are responsible for causing skin aging, DNA damage, sunburns, and even skin cancer. Although UVC rays are the most dangerous, they are typically absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere; hence, they do not pose a significant threat to humans from natural sources. Moreover, artificial sources of UV light, such as tanning beds, welding arcs, blacklights, and certain malfunctioning light sources—as mentioned in the provided sentence—can also cause harm to human eyes and skin. These sources might not be as intense as natural sunlight, but prolonged exposure can lead to negative impacts on health, such as photokeratitis, cataracts, melanoma, and other skin cancers. However, it is not only UV light that can be harmful; intense visible light can also damage the eyes. For instance, visible light emitted from high-powered lasers, or staring directly at the sun, can cause retinal damage and lead to vision problems, such as macular degeneration or even blindness. In conclusion, to answer the question, \\"What light can harm human eyes or skin?\\" various types of light can be harmful, including different types of ultraviolet light (UVA, UVB, and UVC) and intense visible light. It is essential to protect one's eyes and skin from excessive exposure to these harmful radiations and follow safety guidelines to prevent long-term damage."},{"instruction":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: (29075) 1950 DA, epoch, 2011-Aug-27; (29075) 1950 DA, periapsis, 124950000000.0","output":"On August 27, 2011, which we call an \\"epoch,\\" a big space rock named (29075) 1950 DA, came really close to Earth, at a distance called \\"periapsis,\\" which measures 124,950,000,000, or one hundred twenty-four billion, nine hundred and fifty million, spaces away from our home planet."},{"instruction":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: it is a member of the Federation of Adequate Towers.

Karwai Tang/WireImage/Getty Images Sarah's mother, Sonia Lopez-Puentes, shared an image of her daughter with the pop star in her hospital room on Friday, showing Timberlake smiling and crouching at her bedside. Lopez-Puentes thanked him and other special visitors, including Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt, in a separate post on Saturday. \\"JJ Watt, Justin Timberlake ... school officials, board members, teachers, fellow classmates, friends and family have taken time to visit Sarah this week showing their love and support bringing smiles to her beautiful face,\\" she wrote, adding that her daughter appeared to be \\"making progress.\\" Scott Olson/Getty Images Brett Coomer/Houston Chronicle via AP \\"Sarah is sad for the loss of her classmates and would love to see other survivors ...

The GoFundMe campaign had raised about 21,000 in donations as of Tuesday morning, a little more than one-third of its fundraising goal. The alleged gunman, 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis, was charged with capital murder in the wake of the shooting. Police said he was armed with a shotgun and a .38-caliber revolver, both of which were legally owned by his father. Police have yet to declare a motive.

Over this period of several hundred years, some have suggested, Jewish economic activity was focused on trade, business management, and financial services, due to several presumed factors: Christian European prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews, preventing certain financial activities (such as \\"usurious\\" loans) between Christians, high rates of literacy, near universal male education, and ability of merchants to rely upon and trust family members living in different regions and countries.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"Individuals who could be relied on to read detailed documentation during the time of the Crusades and subsequent Jewish migration into Eastern Europe were likely educated Jewish merchants, scholars, and community leaders. This is because of several factors that contributed to the high literacy rates and strong business networks among the Jewish population during these centuries. First, one of the key reasons for the strong focus on trade and business management was the Christian European prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews. These restrictions limited the types of work Jews could engage in, leading them to specialize in trade, finance, and other areas that were not prohibited. Second, there was a widespread emphasis on male education within the Jewish community. Nearly all Jewish males received an education, primarily focusing on religious studies and commandments (known as the Torah and Talmud). This education fostered a culture of literacy and, by extension, the capability to read and understand detailed documentation. Third, the ability of Jewish merchants to rely upon and trust their family members living in different regions and countries was crucial for maintaining their business networks. Jewish communities were connected by a shared language (Yiddish), religious practices, and social customs, which facilitated communication and trust between community members both locally and across international borders. Therefore, family members and other community members in prominent positions would have been relied upon to read and understand detailed documentation relating to trade, finance, or other essential matters. In conclusion, the educated Jewish merchants, scholars, and community leaders were the ones who could be relied upon to read detailed documentation during the time of the Crusades and the following centuries of Jewish migration into Eastern Europe. Their literacy rates and strong connection to a broader network of trusted individuals enabled them to manage trade, business, and financial matters effectively."},{"instruction":"Here is a dialogue: Pete: Sup? Lionel: I'm at a meeting, can't talk. Pete: OK, sorry. What were they talking about?","output":"In this brief conversation, Pete and Lionel discuss Lionel's current activity and inability to carry on a longer conversation. This is a casual exchange between two acquaintances or friends who want to connect and interact with each other. The dialogue can be analyzed for its content, tone, context, and implications. 1. Content: The conversation begins with Pete greeting Lionel with a slang term \\"Sup?\\", which is short for \\"What's up?\\". This greeting is a friendly and informal way of asking how someone is doing or what they are currently involved in. Pete's use of this informal greeting suggests that he feels comfortable and have a friendly relationship with Lionel. Lionel responds by informing Pete that he is currently engaged in a meeting and, as a result, is unable to engage in a conversation at the moment. This implies that Lionel might be at work or part of a professional or personal gathering. Lionel conveys this information to Pete in a brief and direct manner, indicating that his current focus is on the ongoing meeting. Upon receiving Lionel's response, Pete acknowledges the situation and apologizes for potentially interrupting or distracting Lionel from his meeting. This shows that Pete respects Lionel's time and responsibilities and does not want to interfere with his commitments. Their brief interaction comes to an end at this point. 2. Tone: Throughout the conversation, both Pete and Lionel maintain a casual and informal tone. Pete starts the conversation using a slang greeting, while Lionel provides a brief, matter-of-fact response. Pete's final message conveys genuine concern and politeness as he apologizes for the interruption. 3. Context: This conversation could be taking place in-person, over the phone, or through a text or instant messaging platform. Based on Lionel's response, it is apparent that he may not have the freedom or ability to converse because of his current involvement in a meeting. The context of their dialogue further suggests that it is spontaneous in nature; Pete did not know that Lionel was in a meeting and reached out to initiate a conversation without prior knowledge of Lionel's schedule or availability. 4. Implications: This casual exchange between Pete and Lionel reveals a few aspects of their relationship and personalities. The informal nature of their conversation suggests they have an existing connection or a friendly rapport. Pete demonstrates maturity and politeness by acknowledging and respecting Lionel's current obligations, and Lionel displays professionalism by prioritizing his meeting and informing Pete that he cannot converse at the moment. While the conversation was short and did not delve into any specific topic, it provided a glimpse into the nature of Pete and Lionel's relationship, their unique communication style, and a general understanding of Lionel's current activity and priorities."},{"instruction":"Title: Super Sharp Photos Review: I have owned this camera for 3 weeks and feel it is the best value in its class.

Question: suppose less muscles available happens, how will it affect more scouring of rocks occurs. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"Acid rain is a significant environmental concern resulting from human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and other industrial processes that release harmful chemicals, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), into the atmosphere. These chemicals then react with water, oxygen, and other substances to form acidic compounds, including sulfuric acid and nitric acid. As these compounds precipitate and fall to the ground as acid rain, a series of interconnected consequences follows. The question you are asking essentially refers to a perturbation in the amount of muscle available, seemingly in the context of the scouring of rocks. However, the process of rock scouring is not directly tied to the availability of muscles or muscle power and is primarily a result of the corrosive effects of acid rain itself. So, we will first explore the acid rain phenomenon and how it is related to rock scouring. When acid rain falls to the ground, it can have several detrimental effects on the environment, including the accelerated weathering and erosion of rocks. The acid rain gradually weakens the chemical bonds within rocks, causing them to break down more quickly than they would under normal conditions. This scouring effect is particularly prominent in susceptible rock types, such as limestone and marble, which contain significant amounts of calcium carbonate that readily reacts with the acids in the rain. As rocks are scoured and eroded by acid rain, the surrounding vegetation also faces destruction. The increased acidity of the soil makes it difficult for many plants to extract vital nutrients, leading to a decline in plant health and, in extreme cases, widespread deforestation. This lack of vegetation, in turn, destabilizes the surrounding environment, as plants typically play crucial roles in soil stability, nutrient cycling, and providing habitat for other species. Now, considering the proposed scenario of less muscle availability, it is essential to clarify that the scouring of rocks by acid rain is primarily a chemical process, not one directly influenced by muscular force or work. As such, any perturbation in muscle availability would not have a direct impact on the rate at which acid rain scours rocks. Instead, the critical factors influencing the severity of acid rain's effects on rocks and the environment include the concentration of acidic compounds in the rain, the sensitivity of local rock types, and the buffering capacity of the soil and surrounding watershed. Given the lack of a direct relationship between muscle availability and the scouring of rocks by acid rain, it is reasonable to conclude that the supposed perturbation would have no effect on this environmental process. The more important focus for mitigating the impacts of acid rain would be to address the underlying sources of the pollutants that are driving this harmful cycle, such as reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from power plants and other industrial processes."},{"instruction":"Question: what is bevo in text terms?

Commonly, electronic devices contain circuitry consisting primarily or exclusively of active semiconductors supplemented with passive elements; such a circuit is described as an electronic circuit. - KAJA ( 97.3 FM ) San Antonio , \`\` KJ97 '' is a Country Music station owned by iHeartMedia , Inc. ( formerly Clear Channel Communications until September 2014 ) . Its studios are located on Interstate 10 in Northwest San Antonio near Balcones Heights , TX , and the transmitter site is in unincorporated Bexar County near Government Canyon . - Alternating current (AC), is an electric current which periodically reverses polarity, whereas direct current (DC, also dc) flows only in one direction with a single polarity either positive or negative. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electric energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions and electric lamps into a wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. The abbreviations \\"AC\\" and \\"DC\\" are often used to mean simply \\"alternating\\" and \\"direct\\", as when they modify \\"current\\" or \\"voltage\\". - Radio frequency (RF) is any of the electromagnetic wave frequencies that lie in the range extending from around to , which include those frequencies used for communications or radar signals. RF usually refers to electrical rather than mechanical oscillations. However, mechanical RF systems do exist (see mechanical filter and RF MEMS). - Jacksonville is a seaport city and the seat of Duval County, Florida, United States. With an estimated 868,031 residents as of 2015, Jacksonville is the most populous city in both the state of Florida and the southeastern United States. It is estimated to be the 12th most populous city in the United States and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Jacksonville metropolitan area has a population of 1,573,606 and is the 40th largest in the United States and fourth largest in the state of Florida. The city is situated on the banks of the St. Johns River, in the First Coast region of North Florida, about south of the Georgia state line and north of Miami. - In electronics and telecommunications a transmitter or radio transmitter is an electronic device which generates a radio frequency alternating current. When a connected antenna is excited by this alternating current, the antenna emits radio waves. - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County. - Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Question: suppose less steam rises happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER satelites in space. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"The question seems to be asking about how a hypothetical decrease in the amount of steam rising would affect smaller satellites in space and how that would influence the second effect mentioned. From the process provided, the second effect after launching the rocket is the satellite going into orbit. This is a relatively complex situation to unpick, so let's break the question down into smaller parts: 1. Firstly, does a decrease in steam rising impact small satellites? The answer here would be 'no effect'. The steam produced during a rocket launch doesn't have any direct effect on satellites in the space. The steam is a byproduct of rocket fuel combustion, typically occurring when hydrogen fuel combines with oxygen. Once it leaves the rocket, it disperses and doesn't have any direct influence on the satellite. In space, steam would not matter due to the vacuum environment. 2. Secondly, how does this influence the 'going into orbit' event? Since the decrease in the amount of rising steam won't affect the satellites directly, we can also infer it won't influence their ability to go into orbit. Therefore, the answer would also be 'no effect'. It's important to note that precise rocket fuel combustion, which gives rise to steam, is vital to providing the necessary thrust for a rocket to overcome Earth's gravity and launch a satellite into its designated orbit. However, once in space, factors such as gravitational forces, the satellite's velocity, and its altitude above the Earth primarily govern its ability to maintain a stable orbit, not the presence or absence of steam. The nature and operations of satellites, once in space, are largely independent of the conditions of their launch phases. As such, reducing the steam originating from their launch would not directly alter the behaviours or functions of smaller satellites in their orbits."},{"instruction":"When land is cleared, habitats are lost.

With such deep historical links between the two countries - surely the UK can cut through the bureaucratic smog that saw Brussels spend nearly a decade negotiating, but ultimately fail to agree a deal with the world's fastest growing economy. But Indian business leaders are confused. No-one knows what the UK's relationship with Europe will eventually look like, and many are unsure about how much can be usefully discussed until the UK has withdrawn from the EU - a point that is at least two years away.

However, one Australian TV presenter has recently made headlines with an unusual and daring fashion experiment – wearing the same blue suit on-screen for an entire year without eliciting any remarks or complaints from viewers. Justification: The introduction sets the stage for the story by highlighting the fashion industry's fast-paced nature and how the TV presenter's experiment defied the norms. Body: Background on the TV presenter: Karl Stefanovic, a popular Australian morning TV presenter, embarked on this bold fashion experiment to highlight the unrealistic standards applied to women in the media when it comes to their wardrobe. Stefanovic's experiment began in response to the criticism his female colleagues faced for their daily outfit choices, often leading to unnecessary discussions about their appearances rather than their work. Justification: Providing background information about the TV presenter and the reasoning behind the experiment is crucial in helping readers understand the context and motive. Experiment Details: As part of Stefanovic's experiment, he decided to wear the same blue suit daily while co-hosting his morning show \\"Today\\" on Channel 9. Throughout the year, he paired the suit with various shirts and ties, but the suit remained the same. Remarkably, no viewers or co-workers made any comments or observations about his repetitive wardrobe choice during the 12-month period. Justification: Explaining the details of the experiment, including the outcome, is essential to convey the core idea. Repercussions and Discussion: The results of Stefanovic's year-long experiment have sparked a much-needed conversation about fashion expectations and gender biases in the media. He pointed out that his female co-host, Lisa Wilkinson, faced constant scrutiny and negative feedback about her wardrobe choices, despite her professional accomplishments. Gender equality advocates have since praised Stefanovic's efforts in raising awareness about the different standards applied to professional men and women in terms of appearance. The experiment has since received international attention and encouraged further discussions about perceived inequity in the workplace, especially within the entertainment industry. Justification: Discussing the repercussions and broader implications of the experiment brings the article full circle, connecting it to broader social issues and real-life consequences. Conclusion: Karl Stefanovic's daring fashion experiment has undoubtedly challenged the status quo and brought attention to the unfair expectations and judgments placed on female professionals in terms of their appearance. By wearing the same blue suit for a year and going unnoticed, Stefanovic has shown that the media and its audience have the capacity to focus on substance over style. This thought-provoking experiment serves as a reminder to question the existing norms and strive for change towards a more equitable work environment for all. Justification: The conclusion summarizes the main points of the story, reflects on the broader implications, and leaves the reader with a thought-provoking take away."},{"instruction":"Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: This sounds like one guy playing an organ or synthesizer.

These actions occur in response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system. Constriction occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels contract. This reduces the amount of blood that can flow through the vessels (see Figure below ). Dilation occurs when the walls relax. This increases blood flows through the vessels. Now, I have a new situation: The blood vessels of two different people are being studied at a laboratory. Jim's blood vessels are narrowing, and Bob's blood vessels are widening. This information alone doesn't tell the scientists much about Jim and Bob so they will need to run more tests to see if there are issues with the blood. Answer this question please: Is the amount of blood flowing through Bob's blood vessels increasing or decreasing? A:","output":"The amount of blood flowing through Bob's blood vessels is increasing. This is because his blood vessels are widening, which is referred to as dilation. When dilation occurs, the walls of the blood vessels relax, which in turn causes the blood vessels to become wider. As the blood vessels get wider, it means that there is more space for the blood to flow through, effectively increasing the amount of blood flowing through them. This change in blood flow can be a response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system, as mentioned in the background information. These signals may be triggered by a variety of factors, including changes in body temperature, oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, exercise, stress, or certain hormones and chemicals in the body. While the dilation of Bob's blood vessels does indicate an increase in blood flow, further tests and information would be needed to determine the cause and whether there are any underlying issues that are causing this response."},{"instruction":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Ash suggested Bailey play basketball in order to do some sport and Bailey loved it.

Article: Creativity is the key to a brighter future, say education and business experts. Here is how schools and parents can encourage this important skill in children. If Dick Drew had listened to his boss in 1925, we might not have an important product: a new type of tape. Drew worked for the Minnesota Mining Company. At work he developed a kind of material strong enough to hold things together. But his boss told him not to think more about the idea. Finally, using his own time, Drew improved the tape, which now is used everywhere by many people. And his old company learned from its mistake. Now it encourages people to spend 15 percent of their work time just thinking and developing new ideas. Creativity is not something one is just born with, nor is it necessarily a character of high intelligence . Just because a person is highly intelligent does not mean that he uses it creatively. Creativity is the matter of using the resources one has to produce new ideas that are good for something. Unluckily, schools have not tried to encourage creativity. With strong attention to test results and the development of reading, writing and mathematical skills, many educators give up creativity for correct answers. The result is that children can give back information but can't recognize ways to use it in new situations. They may know the rules correctly, but they are unable to use them to work out practical problems. It is important to give children choices. From the earliest age, children should be allowed to make decisions and understand their results. Even if it's choosing between two kinds of food for lunch, decision-making helps thinking skills. As children grow older, parents should let their children decide how to use their time or spend their money, but not help them too much if they make the wrong decision. The child may have a hard time, but that is all right. This is because the most important character of creative people is a very strong desire to find a way out of trouble. Question: What did the company where Dick Drew work learn from its mistake? Options: A: They encouraged people to work a longer time. B: They discouraged people to think freely. C: They asked people to spend all their work time developing new ideas. D: They encouraged people to spend some of their work time thinking and improving new ideas.

Question: suppose there are more calm unwindy days than usual happens, how will it affect LESS sediment being transported. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: less If there are more calm and unwindy days than usual, it will lead to less sediment being transported. The process of sediment transportation is heavily reliant on the movement of wind and water, as these natural forces can effectively pick up, carry, and deposit sediment particles in different locations. When there are fewer windy days, the wind's ability to erode and transport sediment will be significantly reduced. On calm, unwindy days, sediments will remain more likely to stay in place rather than being picked up and transported. As a result, there will be less overall movement and deposition of sediment at new locations. Similarly, with less water or wave action occurring, the transport of sediment through water will also be reduced. This leads to fewer particles being broken down or moved, ultimately resulting in less sediment transport taking place. The effect of calm and unwindy days is particularly significant in areas where wind erosion and transportation are the dominant driving forces for sediment movements, such as arid regions and coastal environments. In these areas, a significant decrease in the number of windy days can lead to a noticeable reduction in sediment transportation and the overall redistribution of sediment in the landscape. In conclusion, when more calm and unwindy days occur than usual, sediment transportation is significantly impacted, leading to less movement and deposition of sediment particles across different environments. This effect can be particularly noticeable in areas where wind plays a vital role in the erosion, transport, and deposition processes."},{"instruction":"In April 2005, Comcast and Time Warner Cable announced plans to buy the assets of bankrupted Adelphia Cable.

The common opinion in the past was that tips both rewarded the efforts of good service and reduced uncomfortable feelings of inequality. And also, tipping makes for closer relations.

I have forgotten the name of an old lady, who was a customer on the paper route in my home town when I was a twelve-year-old boy. Yet it stays in my memory, for she taught me a lesson of forgiveness that I shall never forget. On a winter afternoon, a friend and I were throwing stones onto the leaning roof of the old lady's house from a spot near her backyard. The object of our play was to observe how the stones changed to missiles as they rolled to the roof's edge and shot out into the yard. I found myself a perfectly smooth rock and threw it out. The stone, however, slipped from my hand and headed straight for a small window on the old lady's back porch. At the sound of fractured glass, we knew we were in trouble. We ran as fast as possible. I was too scared about getting caught to be concerned about the old lady with the broken window in winter. However, a few days later, when I was sure that I hadn't been discovered, I started to feel guilty for her misfortune.

Hermina Hirsch has been a Tigers fan since moving to the Detroit area more than 60 years ago. Earlier this week, Hirsch shared her biggest bucket list wish with WWJ’s Roberta Jasina. “At my age, I figure that this would do it,” said Hirsch, who lives in Southfield with her husband. “I don’t want to die before I sing at a baseball game.” Ron Colangelo, the Vice President of Communications for the Tigers, said they’re going to make Hirsch’s dreams come true. “On Saturday, May 21, Hermina is going to perform the National Anthem,” Colangelo said live on WWJ Newsradio Friday morning. “That’s the beauty of baseball, isn’t it? She has gotten a tremendous amount of support and it’s just fantastic that she has wanted to do this and that she’s a Tigers fan. Maybe it brings us a lot of luck for a magical 2016 season.” Hirsch’s granddaughter Andrea said her grandmother was thrilled when she heard the news. “She just couldn’t believe it,” said Andrea Hirsch. “Everything happened so quickly, she just didn’t know that this was ever going to happen when she decided ‘Hey, this is my dream.'” Nearly 70,000 people have watched WWJ’s video alone, and others of Hirsch singing have tens of thousands of views. “At first when I told her that her video went viral and there’s so many people that caught wind of her story, she didn’t really understand,” said Andrea Hirsch. “You know, she didn’t really understand how or why, how something like this could happen through social media. She just couldn’t believe how it progressed. … I didn’t even believe this could happen. We’re so excited.” May 21 is during the Sabbath, but Hirsch doesn’t mind bending the rules — just this once. “There was some discussion about that being an issue but the game is at 4 p.m. so she just felt that that was just the best option for her,” said Andrea Hirsch. “There was another date in mind but she just thought that the one that we chose in May was the best option.” Hirsch’s story started in 1927, when she was born in Kosice in what was then known as Czechoslovakia, one of nine children in her family. In 1944, at age 17, her family was sent to live in the ghetto and a brick factory, according to her granddaughter. From there, she was shuffled between five different concentration camps including Auschwitz with her oldest sister. She was separated from her parents and other siblings. But she survived. “She was liberated from a concentration camp (she doesn’t remember the name) in either Germany or Poland on Jan. 21, 1945,” Andrea Hirsch wrote in an email. “She walked and hitched rides with strangers to get back to where she was born.” Hirsch ended up in a sanatorium for a year, regaining her health. After that, her cousin set her up with a man named Bernard Hirsch. They got married in 1947 in Košice, and ended up in New York. Two of her siblings went to Detroit, so she and her husband moved there in 1953. They immediately embraced the hometown baseball team, regularly attending games. Is it the secret to their marital success? There are more ingredients in the mix than that, but the Hirsch’s have been married for 69 years — she’s 89 and he’s 96. She also loved to sing, belting out the national anthem each week during holocaust survivor meetings at The Jewish Center in West Bloomfield. She is a member of B’Nai Moche and has been singing in the choir for the past 40 years to a congregation that once had at least 400 people. ||||| Holocaust survivor chosen to sing national anthem at Tigers game Local News Holocaust survivor chosen to sing national anthem at Tigers game An 89-year-old Southfield woman has a wish to sing the national anthem at Comerica Park and, after what she's been through, singing in front of thousands of people doesn't scare her. - An 89-year-old Southfield woman has a wish to sing the national anthem at Comerica Park and, after what she's been through, singing in front of thousands of people doesn't scare her.

Title: Don't Look in the Basement Movie plot: Dr. Stephens (Michael Harvey) presides over a small hospital for the insane; the asylum is a large three-story white house located in an isolated, rural setting. With only himself and a small staff to care for the patients, his approach to psychiatric care is considered very liberal. He allows the patients access to their individual manias, believing that by encouraging them to act out their inner conflicts, they can resolve them.As the film opens, he is working with a patient named Oliver Cameron (Gene Ross), a former judge who is obsessively striking a wooden log with an ax. Nurse Jane St. Claire (Jessie Lee Fulton) is inside the sanitorium packing her suitcase, as if to leave. She has a confrontation with a patient named Harriet (Camilla Carr), a young woman who carries a baby doll and believes it to be real. Harriet accuses Jane of wanting to steal her baby, and threatens to kill her if she does. Jane rushes outside to tell Dr. Stephens that she has decided to leave the sanitarium for good; she can no longer tolerate the madness that runs rampant there. As she is talking to Stephens, the Judge suddenly turns and strikes Stephens with his ax, felling him. Jane shrieks, but suddenly another woman rushes towards them; she is Dr. Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick), and she tells Jane to go inside, she will take care of everything. Inside the hospital, Jane rushes to get her suitcase and leave, but Harriet appears. Her \\"baby\\" is in Jane's room, planted there by some unseen person. Furious, Harriet attacks Jane and kills her, strangling her and then slamming her head inside the suitcase.That evening, a new nurse comes to the asylum; young, pretty Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik). Dr. Masters seems hostile to her presence, claiming she was unaware that Dr. Stephens had hired her, and she tells her that Dr. Stephens has been killed by the Judge. Masters tells Charlotte that she can't have the job, since she was hired by Dr. Stephens and he is now dead. Charlotte is distraught, not only because the doctor has...

AT the beginning of Ellen Conley's ''Soon To Be Immortal,'' Sasha Flynn has gone back to her old job in a hospital laboratory in the hope that science will bring order back into her life, that it will help to structure what seems to her a chaos of enthusiasms and discontents. She feels that she needs a bulwark, or a discipline of some sort to defend her against her own New York City's teeming life. If she had her way - if her husband, Hatch, had not objected - she would have lived on Roosevelt Island, ''soothed on that little atoll.'' With Hatch and her two children, she is torn, like most emancipated wives and mothers, between her despotic love for them and her fidelity to the idea of civil liberty. Her husband is an artist, a painter, and she has nothing but personality and motherhood for credentials. Determined to produce something that comes out of her soul rather than her memory, she is reading a book sent to her by her mother: ''Write Your Novel in 90 Days.'' As if nature were rebuking her for being insufficiently appreciative, Sasha becomes pregnant again at the age of 40. Hatch wants her to have an abortion, but she has seen bad fetuses in their plastic sacks in the hospital. She imagines them bursting their sacks and crying all at once, crying for ''the tears in things.'' On one page of the ''Time-Life Book of Conception'' the live fetuses look like ''a cross between a jellyfish and a skydiver.'' On the next page, they seem ''less amphibian and more human, with an ironic wistfulness.'' Hatch contends that they don't have money, space, time or energy enough for a third child. The second one has just emerged from diapers, and Hatch feels that he has exhausted diapers as canvases. ''You're too old,'' he said to Sasha. ''The child may be defective.'' ''What if it were?'' she answers. ''Couldn't you think of that autistic child as a pet?'' ''If we ever had a kid that way,'' he says, ''I'd give him to you as a parting gift, a piece of sculpture from me.'' At that, Sasha punches him in the nose - the last resort of tolerance and understanding -and he goes out to get drunk, only to discover that he hasn't enough money even for that. Mrs. Conley knows her way around pregnancies and hospitals. There is a strong scene in the cancer ward when an elderly terminal case nostalgically asks Sasha if he can feel the baby kick, and soon she is surrounded by dying grandfathers eager to feel the beginning of life. Her stomach is so heavy that the obstetrician advises her to sleep in a slanted bed. When she points out that her bed is a mattress on the floor, he advises her to unhinge a closet door and prop it up on telephone books. She wishes she could be gay and heedless about this baby, like the two paraplegics, lovers apparently, who careen through the hospital corridors at top speed in their wheelchairs. She would like to be cool and collected, like the woman in the next bed when she had her last child, who was calmly doing a crossword puzzle and asked Sasha if she knew a five-letter word for ''a bitter vetch.'' Better still, she would like to have her child delivered by three young policemen with golden hair as they speed in a squad car through the city with the sirens notifying the world of her offspring's arrival. In the hospital room with Sasha are three tiny young women from Taiwan who have come to New York City on visitors' passes to have their babies, so that they will be born as American citizens, enabling their parents to move up the immigration list. Listening to them, Sasha realizes that life, even babies, is a series of strategies. As in her first novel, ''Soho Madonna,'' Mrs. Conley explores the conventions of the unconventional family, the often irrational improvisations that, like two willing but unsynchronized dancers, she and her husband muddle through. Sasha is a nurse-mother in the sense that she will do anything on earth that seems right to her. She is a modern heroine, a woman who approaches life as if it were a novel that could be written in 90 days - and then revised where necessary. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article is a review of Ellen Conley's novel \\"Soon To Be Immortal,\\" which follows the story of Sasha Flynn, a woman who returns to her hospital laboratory job to find solace and structure in her life.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","output":"If there are less synapses firing, it suggests that there is less active flow of water taking place in the area. This would likely have an impact on the formation of LESS or SMALLER ravines by indirectly impacting several steps of the process mentioned. Let's analyze how this situation affects the stream and ravine formation process: 1. An area is at a higher elevation than the surrounding area - This step will not be impacted because the elevation of the area is a geographical factor and not influenced by the amount of synapses firing or water flow. 2. Rain falls - A decrease in synapses firing could reflect less frequent or less intense rainfall. This means that there would be less water available to create streams or contribute to their flow. This step is indirectly impacted by the situation. 3. Water is in the area of high elevation - With less rain or lower intensity rainfall, the amount of water available for stream and ravine formation is also reduced, indirectly impacting this step. 4. The water creates a stream - Since there is less water available, the formation of streams might be limited or restricted, indirectly impacting this step as well. 5. The stream moves towards lower elevation - Streams formed from the reduced water sources may still move towards lower elevation but, with less water volume, they would be transporting less sediment and exerting less erosional force. This step is indirectly impacted by the situation. 6. The stream continues along the same path for a long time - Smaller, potentially shorter-lived streams may not have the same impact on the landscape, indirectly impacting this part of the process. 7. The soil and rocks erode where the stream touches them - Erosion is likely to occur at a slower rate with less water flowing and moving at a potentially slower pace. This step is indirectly impacted by the situation. 8. The stream moves deeper into the soil - With less erosion occurring, streams would not penetrate the soil as deeply as they would with greater water flow, indirectly impacting this step. 9. The stream is smaller than the eroded area - This would still be the case, but with less synapses firing and reduced water flow, both the size of the stream and the eroded area may be smaller overall, indirectly impacting this final step. In conclusion, if less synapses firing results in less water flow and less frequent or intense rainfall, it will indirectly impact several steps of the ravine and stream formation process, leading to less or smaller ravines forming. The perturbation is indirectly impacting a step of the process."},{"instruction":"- sport is baseball - player team is northern colorado - coach team is saddleback austin northern colorado cc -lrb- asst. -rrb- austin -lrb- asst. -rrb- - current conference is western athletic conference - player years is 1981 -- 1984 - coach years is 2002 2011 -- present -- 2003 2003 -- 2004 2005 -- 2010 - current team is northern colorado - current title is head coach - birth date is 1961 - awards is great west coach of the year : 2013 - overall record is 197 -- 272 - birth place is hawaii Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Article:","output":"Title: Perfecting Your Pool Game: Setting Up the Billiard Rack for a Randomized Break Introduction Pool enthusiasts know that the success of a game often begins with the initial break. Over the years, players have debated and experimented with strategies for preparing the perfect break. One commonly debated topic is the arrangement of balls within the billiard rack. In this article, we will explore a method that promotes randomness by starting with the 1-ball at the front of the rack and arranging the other balls at random. We'll also discuss how lining up the apex of the rack with the middle diamond on the side of the pool table can set you on the path to billiards success. The Randomized Rack: Starting with the 1-Ball In many traditional pool games, such as 8-ball and 9-ball, the positioning of the 1-ball is crucial. Placing the 1-ball at the front of the rack guarantees that it will be the first ball to receive the impact from the cue ball, providing a player with the opportunity to start scoring points right off the bat. Moreover, including all other balls arranged randomly behind the 1-ball promotes an element of unpredictability, which can level the playing field among players with varying skill levels. A randomized setup reduces the likelihood of running intentional patterns or sequences by the players, making the game more dynamic and skill-based. Aligning the Apex with the Middle Diamond One essential aspect of achieving a successful break is targeting the proper contact point for the cue ball. A widely accepted guideline suggests lining up the apex of the billiard triangle, where the 1-ball is positioned, with the middle diamond on the side rail of the pool table. The middle diamond on the rail is typically found halfway between the corner pocket and the side pocket. Lining up the apex with the middle diamond serves as a perfect starting point for your break shot. Successfully executed, this alignment will allow the cue ball to transfer optimum energy and momentum to the 1-ball, creating a powerful and effective opening spread. Perfecting Your Break While a randomized rack and proper alignment can have a significant impact on your break shot, there are other factors to consider as well. Some tips for achieving a successful break include: 1. Squarely striking the cue ball: Ensure that your cue strikes the cue ball's center to minimize any unnecessary spin that could result in a miscue or a poor initial shot. 2. Power and accuracy: Find a balance between the power of your break and the accuracy needed to retain control of the cue ball and avoid fouls. 3. Stance and grip: Maintain a stable stance and firm grip on your cue, allowing you to direct the cue in a smooth, straight line during your stroke. 4. Follow through: The more natural and fluid your follow-through, the better the energy transfer from the cue to the cue ball. Practice a smooth and rhythmic follow-through to maximize your break shot's effectiveness. In Conclusion A randomized billiard rack, starting with the 1-ball at the apex and aligning with the middle diamond on the side rail, can enhance your pool game by balancing unpredictability and skill. By incorporating this setup technique alongside other break shot best practices, you can improve your game's overall enjoyment and bring your pool-playing abilities to new heights. So, grab your cue, chalk up, and let the balls roll!"},{"instruction":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Step 2: Choose the appropriate vocabulary words: To describe the weather, I will need to know the words for weather (el tiempo), sunny (soleado), and today (hoy). Step 3: Determine the appropriate verb and conjugation: To express the weather, I'll use the verb \\"estar\\" (to be) in the present tense and conjugate it according to the subject. Step 4: Conjugate the verb and construct the sentence: Since I'm talking about the weather today, I will use the third person singular form of the verb \\"estar\\" which is \\"está\\". Then I will construct the sentence: \\"Hoy está soleado.\\" Step 5: Justify the sentence: This sentence, \\"Hoy está soleado,\\" means \\"Today is sunny\\" in English.

Combining these elements results in the sentence provided above."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: How they do so may be within our control. Sentence 2: We can change how they write the laws. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Step 1: Identify the subjects and actions in both sentences. In Sentence 1, the subject is \\"they\\" and the action is \\"do so\\" (referring to some unspecified action). In addition, it is mentioned that this action may be \\"within our control.\\" In Sentence 2, the subject is still \\"they,\\" but the action is now \\"write the laws.\\" And the focus is on the fact that \\"we\\" can \\"change\\" how they do this. Step 2: Determine if the actions in the two sentences are related or connected. Sentence 1 implies that \\"our control\\" might influence how \\"they\\" perform an action. Sentence 2 explicitly specifies that the action in question is \\"writing laws\\" and suggests that \\"we\\" can \\"change\\" the way \\"they\\" do this. Step 3: Evaluate whether one sentence entails the other. After analyzing both sentences, we can say that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence to a certain extent. The first sentence talks about an unspecified action that may be within our control, and the second sentence provides an example of such an action – writing laws – and the possibility of changing how it is done. However, there could be many such actions that are within our control, so the second sentence is not the only possible conclusion or consequence of the first sentence."},{"instruction":"What concepts are described in the following sentence? \\"Wildwood pub offers low priced fast food and holds an average customer rating.\\" Return the answer as pairs of triples.","output":"1.

Was the AK-47 used in the Seven Years' War? What is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: no?","output":"To arrive at the answer \\"no\\" for the question about whether the AK-47 was used in the Seven Years' War, we can follow a step-by-step reasoning process: Step 1: Identify the time period of the Seven Years' War. The Seven Years' War took place from 1756 to 1763. It was a global conflict involving many European powers, including Great Britain, France, Prussia, Russia, and their allies. Step 2: Determine when the AK-47 was invented. The AK-47 (Avtomat Kalashnikova) was designed by Russian engineer Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1947. The \\"AK\\" stands for \\"Avtomat Kalashnikova,\\" and the \\"47\\" represents the year it was created, which is 1947. Step 3: Compare the dates to establish a timeline. The Seven Years' War occurred between 1756 and 1763, while the invention of the AK-47 took place in 1947. That means the AK-47 was created approximately 184 years after the end of the Seven Years' War. Step 4: Evaluate whether the AK-47 could have been used in the Seven Years' War. Since the AK-47 did not exist until well after the Seven Years' War, it is impossible for the weapon to have been used during that conflict. Conclusion: Based on the timeline and the fact that the AK-47 was invented long after the Seven Years' War, the answer is no, the AK-47 was not used in the Seven Years' War."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Given the below context: Minogue's third album, Rhythm of Love was released in November 1990 and was described as \\"leaps and bounds more mature\\" than her previous albums.

Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the eccentric appearance and persona of Devin Townsend. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets. It was not until the 2003 release of Accelerated Evolution when Townsend formed a separate band, called The Devin Townsend Band, to act as his full-fledged solo band.

Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - Flanders is the Dutch-speaking northern portion of Belgium, although there are several overlapping definitions, including ones related to culture, language, politics and history. It is one of the communities, regions and language areas of Belgium. The demonym associated with Flanders is Fleming, while the corresponding adjective is Flemish. The official capital of Flanders is Brussels, although Brussels itself has an independent regional government, and the government of Flanders only oversees some cultural aspects of Brussels life. - The Flemish Region ( Dutch : Vlaams Gewest ; French : Région flamande ) is one of the three official regions of the Kingdom of Belgium -- alongside the Walloon Region and the Brussels - Capital Region .

The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky. - Western Europe, also West Europe, is the region comprising the western part of the European continent.

Answer:","output":"In India, the main cause of water pollution can be attributed to a combination of various factors, including rapid industrialization, unchecked urbanization, poorly managed waste disposal, agricultural activities, and inadequate water treatment facilities. Let us delve deeper into these factors to comprehend their impact on India's water resources. 1. Rapid Industrialization: Over the past few decades, India has significantly increased its industrial growth. While the growth has led to job creation and economic development, it has also created a significant pollution problem. Many industries tend to discharge untreated or partially treated wastewater into nearby rivers and water bodies, thus contaminating them. Key pollutant emitters include chemical factories, pharmaceuticals, textile mills, and tanneries. 2. Unchecked Urbanization: As the population grows and more people move to urban areas, there is an increase in demand for housing, infrastructure, and public utilities. This rapid and unplanned expansion puts considerable strain on water resources, leading to the destruction of natural water catchment areas and contaminating the remaining water sources. Inadequate sanitation systems further contribute to pollution by releasing untreated sewage into water bodies. 3. Poorly Managed Waste Disposal: Many cities and towns in India lack proper waste management systems, leading to large quantities of solid waste being dumped into water bodies. This waste, which includes both non-biodegradable materials such as plastics and hazardous substances, poses a severe threat to aquatic life and human health. Additionally, electronic waste, which contains toxic metals such as mercury, lead, and cadmium, is often disposed of improperly, further polluting water sources. 4. Agricultural Activities: Agriculture plays a vital role in India's economy and employs a significant portion of the population. However, unsustainable farming practices contribute to water pollution. Excessive use of fertilizers, pesticides, and insecticides leads to the leaching of harmful chemicals into the soil, which eventually seep into groundwater and surface water resources. This not only contaminates the water but also leads to eutrophication and algal blooms, affecting aquatic life and water quality. 5. Inadequate Water Treatment Facilities: Many rural and urban areas in India lack proper sewage treatment plants. As a result, untreated or partially treated wastewater is discharged directly into rivers, lakes, and other water sources. The situation worsens during monsoons when the combined flow of stormwater and sewage overwhelms existing treatment facilities, causing more pollutants to enter water bodies. 6. Religious and Cultural Practices: Ritualistic bathing and idol immersions in rivers during religious events also contribute to water pollution. Mass bathing during festivals, such as Kumbh Mela, leads to the release of large amounts of organic matter, detergents, and oils, causing river pollution. Similarly, after the immersion of idols made from non-biodegradable materials and toxic paints, heavy metals and chemicals leach into the water, further degrading the water quality. 7. Groundwater Contamination: Over-extraction of groundwater coupled with pollution from agriculture, industries, and household waste has led to a significant decline in the quality of India's groundwater resources. Contaminants, including harmful chemicals like fluorides and nitrates, seep into the groundwater, rendering it unsafe for human consumption and other uses. While addressing the main cause of water pollution in India is a complex issue, it is essential to focus on implementing stricter pollution regulations, promoting sustainable industrial practices, raising public awareness, and improving waste management and water treatment infrastructure. Concerted efforts by the government, industries, and citizens are necessary to conserve India's precious water resources and prevent further environmental degradation."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to weatherproof a door Use adhesive weatherproofing strips.

A: A:","output":"Plant responses are primarily governed by a variety of molecules called plant hormones or phytohormones, which function as chemical messengers to regulate growth, development, and environmental adaptations. Unlike the nervous system found in animals, plants rely on these hormones to manage their responses to various stimuli and orchestrate intricate biological processes. There are several main types of plant hormones, each with distinct roles and functions. These include: 1. Auxins: These hormones play a critical role in cell elongation, apical dominance (the suppression of lateral bud growth), and the development of roots. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the most common naturally occurring auxin. Auxins also help plants respond to gravity and light by regulating the growth direction of various plant parts. 2. Gibberellins: Gibberellins participate in numerous plant developmental processes, such as stem elongation, seed germination, and flowering. They affect cell division and cell elongation, enabling rapid growth in response to environmental cues. 3. Cytokinins: Cytokinins are crucial for cell division, root and shoot growth, and the differentiation of cells into various tissues. They often act in conjunction with auxins to regulate growth and development. For instance, the proper balance of cytokinins and auxins determines whether a plant will produce roots or shoots from its meristem cells. 4. Abscisic acid (ABA): ABA is a vital hormone involved in regulating plant responses to environmental stress, such as drought, cold, and high salinity. It promotes dormancy in seeds, stomatal closure (to conserve water), and the synthesis of proteins that protect plants from stress-induced damage. 5. Ethylene: Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that regulates various aspects of growth and development, particularly in response to stress. It is critical for processes such as fruit ripening, leaf abscission (detachment), and the senescence (aging) of plant tissues. 6. Jasmonates: These hormones are important for plant defense against herbivores and pathogens. They induce the production of secondary metabolites and other defense-related proteins, helping plants to fend off pests and diseases. 7. Brassinosteroids: Brassinosteroids control cell elongation and cell division, as well as the synthesis of proteins involved in photosynthesis and stress responses. They also help protect plants from adverse environmental conditions, such as extreme temperatures and high light intensity. 8. Salicylic acid: Salicylic acid is involved in mediating plant defense responses to pathogens, particularly those that cause local infections. It plays a role in the activation of systemic acquired resistance, a phenomenon where a plant becomes more resistant to a pathogen after initial exposure. Collectively, these hormones and their interactions orchestrate the complex process of plant growth, development, and adaptation to the environment. Unlike animals, which employ a centralized nervous system to coordinate their responses, plants rely on these chemical messengers to regulate their various functions and facilitate their survival in diverse ecosystems."},{"instruction":"Do these questions have the same meaning? What is your new year resolution for 2017 or goal for 2017? Do you have any New Years resolutions for 2017?","output":"While the two questions are related and are inquiring about New Year resolutions for 2017, they do not have the exact same meaning. Let's break down the two questions individually to see the difference. 1. What is your new year resolution for 2017 or goal for 2017? This question asks for either a new year resolution or a goal for the year 2017. A resolution typically refers to a personal decision or commitment to change or improve oneself, often made at the beginning of a new year. A goal, on the other hand, is a specific target or objective that a person wants to reach, which might not necessarily involve self-improvement or personal change. While resolutions and goals can be related, this question allows for more flexibility in the response, as it can include a personal new year resolution or a specific goal/objective that the respondent has in mind for 2017. 2. Do you have any New Years resolutions for 2017? This question explicitly inquires about New Year resolutions and does not mention goals. Here, the focus is on whether the respondent has any personal commitments or decisions to change/improve themselves for the year 2017. It does not provide the same flexibility for the respondent to mention specific objectives or targets that may not be considered as resolutions. In conclusion, the two questions are very similar and both inquire about new year resolutions for 2017. However, the first question is more open-ended and allows the respondent to provide either a resolution or a specific goal for 2017, while the second question is focused solely on new year resolutions."},{"instruction":"Translate to French: Ratification or accession shall be effected by the deposit of an instrument with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.","output":"La ratification ou l'adhésion sera effectuée par le dépôt d'un instrument auprès du Secrétaire général des Nations Unies."},{"instruction":"This question has options.

But many years ago, there were millions of rats in Newtown. They attacked the cats and dogs. Sometimes a lot of them knocked down a man or woman walking home at night. The rats were very big in size and they hurt many people. The government ordered everybody to kill rats. Most people were lazy, so they did not kill many. Then the government decided to pay some money for each dead rat. That made the people very happy. They killed thousands of rats every day. A government officer put all the dead rats in a big pile . Sometimes a man brought hundreds in one day. After two weeks there were not many rats in the city, but people still brought many rats to the government office. The government officer thought that people were stealing dead rats from the pile. He ordered his men to dig a deep hole and put the rats in it.

In this sentence, we can understand that there are different stages in the life cycle of a being. These stages can be compared to the natural progression of seasons on Earth. After maturity, the next life stage that individuals experience is old age. Maturity refers to the state of being fully developed in the mental, physical, and emotional aspects. It is when an individual has reached their prime in terms of growth and development. Old age, on the other hand, represents the later stage of life, where individuals experience a decline in their physical and mental capacities. This stage can be associated with a decrease in energy levels, potential health issues, and a waning ability to perform various tasks. The comparison of old age to the season of autumn is quite apt. Autumn signifies the transition period between the warmth and growth of summer, and the cold, dormancy of winter. Just as trees shed their leaves during autumn, preparing for the cold and harsh conditions of winter, so too do beings enter a phase of decline as they age. In essence, the sentence highlights the inevitability of old age and how it reflects the natural progression of life, akin to the changing seasons on our planet. Each being undergoes a terrestrial life cycle, from birth to growth and maturity, eventually reaching old age and entering a period of decline, akin to the autumn season."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Article: Humans may be a bad influence on their best friends---at least when it comes to problem-solving. In a task that wasn't very tough, wolves performed must better than dogs. All the animals had to do was pull the lid off a food container, containing a sausage treat. Monique Udell studies animal behavior at Oregon State University in Corvallis. She tested 10 pet dogs and another 10 dogs from an animal shelter. In one set of tests, a person was nearby but did not encourage or discourage the dogs. Those dogs typically spent 10 to 15 percent of their time gazing at the person. They spent a mere 5 percent of their time or less touching the container. Udell offered the same challenge to wolves. These animals had been raised and fed by people but still lived outdoors. Here, the wolves didn't look at the nearby person. Instead, they devoted about 90 percent of the time to struggling with the box holding a treat. When someone walked around the dogs and actively encouraged them to keep trying to open the box, the dogs did spend more time handling the problem. A few more even managed to open the box. But their success rate still did not match the wolves. The dogs and wolves were also tested when no one was present. But even then, the dogs didn't paw or teat the box much more than they did when a human was present. Question: What was the effect of encouragement on the dogs?

Fisher?","output":"The domestic appliance invented in 1901 by Alva J. Fisher is the electric washing machine, specifically the \\"Thor\\" washing machine. Alva J. Fisher, an American engineer and inventor, recognized the need for a more efficient and convenient method for cleaning clothes, as the existing methods were predominantly manual and labor-intensive. This led him to develop a groundbreaking appliance that would revolutionize the way people did their laundry. The Thor washing machine, named after the Norse god of thunder, was the world's first electric washing machine and was patented by Fisher on August 9, 1904 (U.S. Patent No. 966,677). Initially, the patent covered a washing machine with electric motor components, and Fisher later added to the patent the improvements and several design features that catered to the convenience of users. The Hurley Machine Company of Chicago, Illinois started manufacturing the Thor washing machines in 1908, making this innovative device available to the general public. The original Thor washing machine was a drum-based design that consisted of a galvanized metal tub mounted on wooden legs. The tub had several small holes for water circulation and drainage, and it was equipped with a reversible electric motor. The motor powered a system of gears that turned the tub at a controlled speed, creating agitation to clean the clothes inside. This innovative design effectively replaced the manual scrubbing and washing that was commonly used at that time. One of the key features that made Fisher's invention revolutionary was the capability to reverse the motor's direction, allowing the tub to change its rotation direction. This feature helped to eliminate excess wear and tear on the motor and tub, thereby increasing the machine's longevity. Additionally, the use of an electric motor instead of manual labor made the laundry process significantly more convenient and less time-consuming. Despite its initial high cost, which made it a luxury item for many households, the Thor washing machine helped pave the way for a wide range of home appliances that would gradually evolve and become more affordable over the years. These advancements would, in turn, transform the way people performed household chores, enabling them to devote more time to other pursuits. In conclusion, the electric washing machine, specifically the \\"Thor\\" washing machine, was invented in 1901 by Alva J. Fisher. This revolutionary invention not only improved laundry cleaning efficiency but also marked the beginning of a new era of electric-powered domestic appliances. The Thor washing machine significantly impacted modern household chores and remains a testament to the ingenuity and forward-thinking of Fisher as an inventor."},{"instruction":"Paragraph: I've been thinking about the mindwipe, now two days away.

In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3. Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3. Question: Why was Saoirse Ronan replaced by Alicia Vikander? Passage 1:In 2009 it was announced that the feature film Testament of Youth was in development by BBC Films and Heyday Films producer David Heyman, and was to be directed by James Kent. This had the support of the Vera Brittain Estate, Brittain's daughter Shirley Williams, and Brittain's biographer Mark Bostridge who is acting as consultant. Saoirse Ronan was cast to play Brittain in 2012 but was replaced in December 2013 when it was announced that Alicia Vikander would play Vera Brittain in the film which was released in late 2014 as part of the First World War commemorations. On 4 February 2014 Kit Harington joined the cast to play the role of Brittain's fiancé Roland Leighton. On 13 February 2014, Colin Morgan, Taron Egerton, and Alexandra Roach were announced to have joined the film's cast. An ensemble cast was later confirmed as filming began, including Dominic West, Emily Watson, Joanna Scanlan, Hayley Atwell, Jonathan Bailey and Anna Chancellor. It substituted Merton College, Oxford in the scenes showing Brittain's time as a student at Somerville College, arguing that filming in Somerville itself would been too difficult in light of the new buildings constructed there since the film's time period. Passage 2:In 2004, Mendler got her first acting role in the animated Indian film The Legend of Buddha, in which she portrayed Lucy. When she was 13 years old, she got an acting role as a guest star on the soap opera General Hospital. She portrayed the dream child of character Lulu Spencer, in which the two have an argument on Mendler's character's birthday. The scene, lasting just under a minute, is later revealed to be a dream. That same year, Mendler was the voice of the character Thorn in the video game Bone: The Great Cow Race, which was based on the Bone comic series. In 2007, Mendler made her film debut in the film adaption of the Alice series, titled Alice Upside Down. Mendler starred alongside Disney Channel actress Alyson Stoner and Lucas Grabeel. Mendler portrayed the antagonistic role of Pamela, who is the rival of Stoner's character, Alice. For the film's soundtrack, Mendler provided backing vocals on the song \\"Free Spirit\\", performed by Stoner. Also in 2007 Mendler auditioned for Sonny with a Chance for the role of Sonny Munroe, but Demi Lovato was chosen. In 2008, it was announced that Mendler would play the role of Kristen Gregory in the film adaption of the popular teen novel series The Clique by Lisi Harrison. Mendler had the role of Kristen, a girl who attends OCD on a scholarship, and works hard to keep her good grades. Passage 3:He was born John Miller in County Clare, Ireland. His father was John Miller and his mother, John's wife, Anne née Browne. He was educated at Dalston School and Eton College before joining the British Army in 1760 as a cornet. He was on active service in the Battle of Emsdorf and at Belleisle, France in 1761, before retiring from the army in 1763. He was admitted to study at the Middle Temple in 1765, though does not seem to have made any progress with his legal studies. He also studied at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, though he did not graduate. In August 1765 he married Anna née Riggs (1741–1781), adding her name to his own. They had a son and a daughter. In July 1762 he inherited his family estates; they were worth little, but his wife brought substantial wealth to the marriage, enabling him to build a prestigious house at Batheaston, Somerset. The couple there held a fortnightly literary salon along with competitions and prizes. The prizes were drawn from an ornately decorated Roman vase and the affair was mocked as Lady Miller's Vase, though that did not dissuade distinguished contributions from the like of David Garrick and Christopher Anstey. In 1778 he was created a Baronet, of Ballicasey in the County of Clare. Anna died on 24 June 1781; on 9 September 1795 he married Jane née Sell, widow of Sir Thomas Davenport. He was elected Member of Parliament for Newport, Cornwall in 1784.","output":"1"},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"Two young ladies gaze out of a store window at \\"\\"hair at hart\\"\\".\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"The two women are speaking adamantly to the hair dresser through the mirror.\\" is true?

Houston’s Cole Hammer birdied four of his final five holes to cap the afternoon round of 2-under 68 at Northwood Club in Dallas. He finished one stroke behind medalist Mark Silvers, a Web.com Tour player from Thunderbolt, Ga. Hammer will be the fourth-youngest golfer ever to compete in the U.S. Open when the tournament takes place June 18-21 at Chambers Bay in University Place, Wash. Dallas’ Cody Gribble posted matching rounds of 67 to tie for third, earning his second straight U.S. Open spot. The Highland Park graduate, who played with Jordan Spieth on Texas’ national championship team of 2012, finished tied for 21st in last year’s Open at Pinehurst (N.C.) Resort. Kyle Jones, who just closed his career at Baylor, also tied for third along with Jason Allred of Scottsdale, Ariz., and amateur Matt Mabrey of Little Rock, Ark. When Hammer hit his approach on 18 to 4 feet, he drew loud applause from club members and fans on the patio above the picturesque hole where Julius Boros accepted his Open trophy 63 years ago. “This means the world to me,” Hammer said. “I’ve dreamed about it my whole life. It’s going to be awesome.” With a growth spurt over the last 10 months, Hammer has added 4 inches and 15 pounds — to 5-9, 125. The distance increase helped him stay with playing partners Martin Flores, a PGA Tour player from Fort Worth, and Jon Trasamar of Blue Earth, Minn. (Flores fell three short of the qualifying number). “This gives me a lot of confidence,” Hammer said. “I was coming in thinking I was a bit of a long shot, but why not? Just give it my best shot.” Having won four of his last five junior events, Hammer had momentum on his side. He made few mistakes in the morning, shooting a six-birdie, no-bogey 64. After going 24 holes without a bogey, he made his first on No. 7 and then bogeyed 12. Needing to make up ground, Hammer birdied four of the final five holes. “I was confident,” he said. “I’ve been hitting it well and putting well, so I thought if I continue doing that here I’ll have a chance.” Hammer has already committed to UT. So he headed straight to Gribble to offer congratulations. Gribble was well aware of Hammer’s game “It’s great that he got in,” Gribble said. “He’s a great kid. I love his game, love his demeanor.” Gribble, a Web.com Tour member, was concluding a busy stretch. He played in the Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial and the AT&T Byron Nelson on special exemptions and then the Greater Dallas Open, which concluded Sunday. But he was no worse for wear at Northwood. Although he said it was not a great ball-striking day, he managed his game and the course well. “It really wasn’t anything special,” he said. “I made some good saves, which really helps, but it was just a solid day. I minimized mistakes.” Last year Gribble made it through qualifying in Memphis, Tenn. At Pinehurst, he shot 69 on Sunday to improve 14 places. It remains his biggest payday (98,598). “Looking back on it, I’d say the U.S. Open was the kickoff of my pro career,” Gribble said. “Not many people can say they qualified for the U.S. Open twice in a row.” SMU’s DeChambeau, veteran Elder qualify to compete in U.S. Open A week after winning the NCAA Championship, SMU junior Bryson DeChambeau qualified for the U.S. Open on Monday. He tied for third in sectional qualifying at Columbus, Ohio, finishing at 11-under 133 over 36 holes. Fifteen players in Columbus qualified for the June 18-21 Open at Chambers Bay in University Place, Wash. DeChambeau will play his first PGA Tour event at this week’s FedEx St. Jude Classic in Memphis. Dallas’ Brad Elder also qualified.

Question 2: What are some ways to end a letter to a friend? Available choices: -no. -yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1: What are the best ways to end a letter? Ending a letter will depend on the context and the relationship between the sender and the recipient. A strong closing matches the tone and purpose of the letter. Here are some of the best ways to end a letter based on the context: 1. Formal Letters: For official and business-related letters, using a formal closing is ideal. Examples include: - Yours sincerely (if you started the letter with \\"Dear [recipient's name]\\") - Yours faithfully (if you began the letter with \\"Dear Sir/Madam\\" or \\"To Whom It May Concern\\"] - Yours truly - Best regards - Kind regards - Respectfully 2. Informal letters: For informal letters to friends, family, or closer acquaintances, it's best to use a warm and friendly closing tone. Examples of informal closings include: - Yours - Best wishes - Warm regards - Take care - Cheers - Hugs and kisses (if appropriate) 3. Thank-You Letters: In a letter expressing gratitude, it's essential to end it with a sincere closing that shows genuine appreciation. Some examples are: - With gratitude - Many thanks - Warmest thanks - Yours appreciatively 4. Personal or Emotional Letters: For letters where you're conveying feelings or personal matters, it's essential to select a closing that appropriately captures the essence of your message. Some examples include: - Love - Fondly - With all my heart - Forever yours Question 2: What are some ways to end a letter to a friend? Ending a letter to a friend may be more casual and light-hearted. Here are some examples: - Yours - Best - Take care - Cheers - Talk soon - Until next time - Keep in touch - Hugs (if appropriate) Response to the available choices: As evident from the examples and explanations above, the answer to the two questions is not the same. The selection of the letter ending mainly depends on the context and the relationship between the two individuals involved in the correspondence.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"The supposed perturbation in this case would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. Let's analyze the situation and elaborate on it further. When fewer people have been eating, it implies that there are fewer dirty dishes to be cleaned. As a result, the dishwasher may not be filled to its full capacity, and the same amount of detergent would still be used. The issue that arises here is that the detergent may have to work harder to clean the remaining dishes in the dishwasher due to the lower density of soiled dishes and food debris in the water. This is because the dishwasher's cleaning mechanism relies on the water pressure and detergent concentration to remove the grease and grime from the dishes, and an imbalance between these two factors can affect the cleaning efficiency. This change in the number of people eating, and the subsequent decrease in dirty dishes, indirectly impacts the second step of the process - placing the dishes into the dishwasher. This connection is indirect because the number of people eating does not immediately cause a change in how the dishwasher is loaded, but rather the effects of fewer dirty dishes lead to an imbalance in the process. To address this issue and promote efficient use of the detergent, some possible solutions can be: 1. Adjusting the amount of detergent used: If you know that there are fewer dirty dishes than usual, you can manually reduce the amount of detergent added to the detergent dispenser to maintain the proper balance between the water pressure and detergent concentration. 2. Running the dishwasher on an appropriate cycle: Modern dishwashers come with a variety of cycles, some of which are tailored for smaller loads or for lightly soiled dishes. Using the right dishwasher cycle can help ensure that the correct amount of detergent, water, and energy is used for cleaning, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the appliance. 3. Waiting until the dishwasher is full: If there are only a few dirty dishes, it might be a good idea to wait until there are enough dishes to fill the dishwasher before running it. This way, the detergent can work effectively across a full load of dirty dishes, preventing waste and promoting optimal cleaning results. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of fewer people eating and thus having fewer dirty dishes indirectly impacts a step of the dishwasher process. It affects the step of placing the dishes into the dishwasher and can be resolved by adapting the amount of detergent used, choosing the proper cycle, or waiting for a full load."},{"instruction":"I am testing my students' logic. What is the answer they should choose between \\"patio\\" and \\"sand lot\\"? Logic test: A patio is smoother than a sand lot. This means that when a bird runs across the _____ it experiences more friction (A) patio (B) sand lot","output":"Based on the logic test provided, the answer your students should choose between \\"patio\\" and \\"sand lot\\" is (B) sand lot. The test states that a patio is smoother than a sandlot, meaning that the patio has a more even and level surface. Therefore, when a bird runs across these surfaces, it experiences different amounts of friction. Friction is the force that opposes an object's motion against another surface, such as the contact between a bird's feet and the ground. Rougher surfaces tend to create more friction, while smoother surfaces create less friction. This is because the irregularities on the rough surfaces generate more contact points and resistance against the moving object (in this case, a bird). Since the sand lot is described as less smooth than the patio, it is, therefore, rougher by comparison and has more irregularities on its surface. This means that when a bird runs across a sand lot, it experiences more friction than it would on a patio. To summarize, the logic test leads to the conclusion that if a bird runs across and experiences more friction, it must be on surface (B) sand lot. This is the answer your students should choose based on the information provided in the test."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"A man dramatically kissing a woman on a path.\\" can we conclude that \\"A man kisses a woman.\\"?

The research is from poor to middle-income countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Robert Black from the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University in prefix = st1 /Marylandwas the leading writer of the research. He says more than 3.5 million mothers and children under five die in poor countries each year because of hunger. He says more than two million children die from underdevelopment, either before or after birth. Millions of others who survive face a lifetime of disabilities or early death. And the effects are not just physical. Poor brain development can limit economic success as children become adults. Then the cycle of poverty and hunger often repeats for their children. Doctor Black says hungry children are also more likely to have conditions like high blood pressure and heart disease as adults. He says the studies show that food programs need to place the greatest importance on the first two years of life. Hungry children can suffer the whole life damage from age two. So it is high time to improve their diets. Diets should include foods rich in vitamin A and other useful things. The researchers say early help like these could reduce child deaths by 25%. The research has faced some criticism . A medical aid group says the researchers underestimate the number of child deaths from hunger. The researchers say there are findings that support this treatment but more studies are needed to compare it to hospital care. What can we learn from this passage?

But in an extraordinary act of forgiveness the 75-year-old victim has sent one of the burglars £20 to help him turn his life around. The generous act came after career criminal Kevin Derbyshire wrote her a letter apologising for his crime. Loretta Smith said she hoped that by giving the burglar the money, it would help 'bring him to his senses' Apology: Kevin Derbyshire (left) wrote a letter to Mrs Smith while he was awaiting sentencing for the burglary, which took place in August last year. The pensioner wrote back to the 24-year-old, accepting his apology – and enclosed a £20 postal order. She explained: ‘He just said he was very, very sorry. ‘His writing was appalling [with] really bad spelling. He said he was really sorry for what had happened and he had been under the influence of valium.’ She continued: ‘I felt sorry for him. He obviously wasn’t very bright. I answered his letter and said thank you for your letter and that I hoped he understood the trauma he’d caused me.’ It appears Derbyshire’s partner in crime had also realised the trouble the pair had caused by their actions. During the raid on Mrs Smith’s home last August Derbyshire and Graham Llewellyn, also 24, grabbed £10,000 worth of gems including several rings and watches. But after CCTV pictures of them committing the burglary where broadcast, Llewellyn bundled some of the stolen property into a black bin bag and left it outside Mrs Smith’s home. The release of the CCTV pictures led to their arrest. Llewellyn has also written to Mrs Smith – but has so far not had a response. Speaking about her letter to Derbyshire, Mrs Smith said: ‘I made it very short and sweet, thanking him for the letter and said I was sure that he had not only upset me. He must have upset his partner or wife both financially and emotionally. ‘I thought at first I’d send him some stamps so he could send letters to loved ones – but I sent him £20.’ After he was arrested for burgling Mrs Smith’s home, a repentant Derbyshire wrote to his victim. Here is his letter (with spelling mistakes corrected) To the victims of my really horrible crime that I’ve committed, I just want to say that I’m really sorry for my stupid actions. I can assure you that I’m not a bad person, and I do not do things like this. I feel really bad, and I know I should. Things like this shouldn’t happen at all, and I didn’t even know what I was doing at the time. It was only when I went on Facebook and read all the horrible messages about me that it clicked what I had done. After the 75-year-old replied, sending him £20, he wrote back:. Dear Mr and Mrs Smith,. I just wanted to say thank you ever so much for your kindness towards me and replying to my letter. I really can’t say how much that letter meant to me in words, but I can assure you that it made me feel a lot better. Thank you so much for taking your spare time out of your way to write back to me. And if there’s anything I can do for you when I am released, I will not hesitate to do unpaid work and also, when I’m released, I will drop you a bunch of flowers and a bottle of good wine. I am so sorry for my silly actions. Her gift came despite Derbyshire and his accomplice leaving Mrs Smith with a £500 bill to repair the broken window at her home in Bolton and several stolen items not being returned. Mrs Smith added: ‘If people think I’m silly then hey ho.’ ‘I thought his letter came from the heart but maybe I’m just gullible. I’m hoping it will bring him to his senses and make him realise he has to go out and work.’ She added: ‘He did say when he comes out of prison he is going to buy me a bunch of flowers and the best bottle of wine he can afford.’ Details of Derbyshire’s written apology emerged at court, where the two men were jailed for 32 months each after admitting burglary. In Bolton Crown Court Derbyshire’s lawyer Nicholas Ross said his client was ‘remorseful’ and said of Mrs Smith’s gift: ‘It was out of remarkable sympathy, and I might say, in an almost saintly way, a token of her generosity.’ Revelation: Details of the apology emerged at Bolton Crown Court (pictured) where Derbyshire's lawyer used it to help with his plea for mitigation. Mrs Smith said that she thought the letter 'came from the heart' Write highlights for this article.","output":"1. 75-year-old burglary victim Loretta Smith sends burglar £20 in an act of forgiveness. 2.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Visitor Q Movie plot: The film's plot is often compared to Pier Paolo Pasolini's Teorema, in which a strange visitor to a wealthy family seduces the maid, the son, the mother, the daughter, and finally the father, before leaving a few days after, subsequently changing their lives.[5] The film starts off with a question: \\"Have you ever done it with your Dad?\\"; the viewer then sees Miki Yamazaki, a young prostitute, trying to persuade her father, Kiyoshi, into having sex with her. Her father is videotaping the scene for a documentary he is preparing on Japanese youths. Once it appears the father is letting himself be persuaded, she tells him the price (50,000 Yen). They have sex, the father ejaculates after a very short time and the disappointed daughter informs him it will be 100,000 Yen now, because of this. The father then realizes the camera has been on all along. In the next scene, called \\"Have you ever been hit on the head?\\", a man (Visitor Q) hits the father over the head with a rock for no apparent reason. The film then moves on to a scene titled \\"Have you ever hit your mom?\\" In this scene, the mother, Keiko is working on a jigsaw puzzle, and her hands are shown to have red marks, showing where she was beaten. Her young son, Takuya, comes in and starts throwing things at the already broken apartment walls because he is unhappy with the toothbrush his mother bought him. He then hits his mother with a rug beating stick. Later, bullies from the son's school come to the front of the house and shoot fireworks through the son's bedroom window. The mother is later seen injecting heroin. It does not seem to have a huge effect on her, though, suggesting she is a regular user. On his way back from work, the father is yet again hit on the head by the same man. They both arrive at the father's home and the mother serves them dinner. The father announces that the man will be staying with the family for a while. The son comes down while they are eating and starts beating the mother again. This does not surprise or bother the father, or... My question: How much does Miki charge her dad to have sex with her?

I want to be happy . Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question What may be a fact about this person ?","output":"Based on the preceding passage, it can be inferred that the person is experiencing emotional turmoil and periods of feeling low. They seem to have built metaphorical \\"walls\\" as a defense mechanism to protect themselves from their thoughts, emotions, or the chaos in their life. During those periods when the walls crumble, they express a deep desire to find someone who can help them escape their current emotional state and lead them towards happiness. It is evident that the person is seeking comfort, companionship, and a sense of emotional stability. This could potentially indicate that they may be going through difficult times or battling mental health issues like depression, stress, or anxiety. The fact that they mention wanting to \\"be happy\\" implies that their current emotional well-being is not at a satisfactory level, and they're hoping to change this by finding someone who can offer support and understanding. Furthermore, the use of the term \\"ruckus\\" suggests that their life might be surrounded by chaos, discord, or relentlessness, which could contribute to their emotional struggles. This person may be trying to cope with external stressors or internal conflicts, and the mention of a \\"wall\\" indicates that they prefer keeping those issues concealed to protect themselves from vulnerability or pain.

Julia's deceased sister gave the baby boy up for adoption, but Julia now wants to make him her heir, and will pay Blanche 10,000 if the man, Edward Shoebridge, can be found. George Lumley discovers that Shoebridge is thought to be dead, but he tracks down another criminal, Joseph Maloney (Ed Lauter), who paid for the tombstone over an empty grave. Shoebridge murdered his adoptive parents, faked his own death and is now a successful jeweler in San Francisco known as Arthur Adamson (William Devane). He and his live-in girlfriend, Fran (Karen Black), kidnap millionaires and dignitaries, returning them in exchange for ransoms in the form of valuable gemstones. Arthur conceals an enormous diamond in plain sight in their crystal chandelier. Arthur enlists Maloney, who had helped murder his adoptive parents, to kill Blanche and George. Maloney initially refuses to help, but then contacts Blanche and George, telling them to meet him at a cafÃ© atop a mountain. He cuts the brake line of Blanche's car, but the couple manage to survive a dangerous high-speed descent. Maloney then tries to run them over, but dies in a fiery explosion when he swerves to avoid an oncoming car and tumbles down the mountain. At Maloney's funeral, his mother (Katherine Helmond) tearfully confesses to George that Shoebridge's name is now Arthur Adamson. George has to go to work, so Blanche tracks down various A.

Question 2: Why is submitting a question on Quora so difficult? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Let's break down each question to better understand them: Question 1: How easy is it to submit a question on Quora? This question aims to gather information about the process and user experience of submitting a question on Quora. It assumes that the person asking might not be familiar with the platform or is unsure about how to ask a question. The answer to this question should provide a general overview of the process as well as any tips or guidance for successfully submitting a question on the platform. Answer: Submitting a question on Quora is relatively easy, provided you follow a few simple steps. First, create an account on Quora, or log in with your existing one. After that, you will see a \\"What is your question?\\" box at the top of the Quora homepage. Click on it and start typing the question you want to ask. As you type, Quora will suggest similar questions that have already been asked – this is to help you avoid asking duplicate questions. When you write your question, be sure to clearly and concisely phrase it to make it easy for others to understand what you're asking. Once you've composed your question, you can also add relevant topics, which will help direct it to the right audience and experts on the platform. After adding topics, simply click on \\"Submit,\\" and your question will be live for others on Quora to answer. Question 2: Why is submitting a question on Quora so difficult? This question assumes that submitting a question on Quora is inherently difficult, and the person asking the question might have faced some challenges with the process. The answer to this question should address common issues or problems people encounter when asking questions on Quora, as well as solutions or guidance on how to make the process easier. Answer: While many users find submitting a question on Quora simple and straightforward, there could be a few potential reasons why some people perceive the process as difficult. These could include: 1. Ambiguity in question phrasing: Quora encourages users to ask specific questions with clear context and phrasing. It might be challenging to submit a question if your question is vague, broad, or lacks context. In such cases, refine the question and provide appropriate context to help clarify what you're looking for. 2. Duplicate questions: As you type your question, Quora suggests similar questions that may have already been asked. If your question is very similar to one that has already been answered, you may be required to rephrase or reconsider your question to avoid redundancy. 3. Selecting the right topics: Finding and choosing the most relevant topics for your question can be time-consuming, as there might be multiple options within Quora's categorization system. Make sure to select the most appropriate topics for your question so that it reaches the right audience and experts for a satisfactory response. 4. Inappropriate or offensive content: Questions that contain inappropriate or offensive content, personal attacks, or violate Quora's policies could be flagged or removed from the platform, making the submission process difficult in such cases. Ensure that your question adheres to the platform's guidelines before submitting it. By addressing these potential issues and following Quora's guidelines, the process of submitting a question should become more manageable and efficient."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given two sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2, and the genre they belong to.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did the group pick the color orange? Options: A. Because the FBI likes it B. not enough information C. Because hunters wear it while hunting D. Because the NRA likes it Answer:","output":"C.

Here are possible answers to this question: - vacuum tube - television - computer - cathode ray - oscilloscope I believe the correct choice is \\"oscilloscope\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","output":"Oscilloscope. An oscilloscope is an electronic test instrument used to display and analyze the waveform of electronic signals. The device measures variations in voltage and time over a period and visualizes these signals as a waveform on a display screen. Typically, the oscilloscope uses a cathode ray tube (CRT) or other screen technology to display these waveforms. The CRT in an oscilloscope functions in a similar manner to the CRT used in older televisions and computer monitors. It has an electron-emitting cathode that directs a beam of electrons toward phosphor-coated screens. The CRT allows for the visualization of voltage and time on a graph, where the x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents voltage. In summary, an oscilloscope is the correct choice because it is a device used to measure and display electronic signal waveforms using a cathode ray tube. It is different from a television or computer, which primarily serve as entertainment or work devices. It is also not just the cathode ray or vacuum tube by itself, as these are components within an oscilloscope or other devices, not the entire instrument."},{"instruction":"Princess Antoinette of Monaco, Baroness of Massy (Antoinette Louise Alberte Suzanne Grimaldi; 28 December 1920 – 18 March 2011) was a member of the princely family of Monaco and the elder sister of Prince Rainier III and aunt of Albert II, Prince of Monaco.

Let's analyze both sentences to understand the connection between them. Sentence 1: Carolyn McCarthy, who launched a political career after her husband was killed by a crazed gunman on a Long Island commuter train. This sentence provides several pieces of information: 1. Carolyn McCarthy is the subject. 2. She launched a political career. 3. The reason she launched a political career was the tragic event involving her husband. 4. Her husband was killed by a crazed gunman. 5. The event took place on a Long Island commuter train. Sentence 2: Carolyn McCarthy's husband was murdered. This sentence also provides information: 1. Carolyn McCarthy's husband is the subject. 2. Her husband was murdered. The word \\"murdered\\" in the second sentence is synonymous with the phrase \\"killed by a crazed gunman\\" in the first sentence. Both statements describe the same event: the death of Carolyn McCarthy's husband due to a violent act committed by another person. So, the information in the second sentence is directly entailed or implied by the information in the first sentence.

The presence of the International Court of Justice in The Hague highlights the city's unique position in the global political landscape. Established in 1945, the ICJ serves as a forum for the resolution of legal disputes between nations, as well as offering advisory opinions on legal questions that may arise. Furthermore, the Peace Palace itself carries a symbolic significance as a center for international law and the pursuit of justice and peace. Built between 1907 and 1913, the Peace Palace was funded by American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie as a gift for the peaceful settlement of disputes among nations. The building's elaborate architecture, which includes elements from various countries, adds to the notion of a shared global heritage and reflects the spirit of international cooperation.

Ashna and Prayash, two friends who have known each other forever, are separated by circumstance from Abhi, their mischievous but poetic friend who chooses ambition over friendship. Years later, at a fateful time in their lives, he realizes that he has to choose again, between keeping his friendship and going after the love of his life. Similarly, Ashna faces the choice between being true to herself and doing right by her family and society. Love demands sacrifice, they all learn: the bigger the sacrifice, the sweeter the reward, sometimes as freedom, and sometimes as the knowledge that the person you love has gained everything you'd wish for them. \\"Kohi Mero\\" is a story about the search for that special person and the special sacrifice it takes for us to show our love for each other. The answer to this question is:","output":"What difficult choices do Abhi and Ashna face in their journey to discover the meaning of love and friendship, and what sacrifices are required for them to show their love for each other?"},{"instruction":"Maitolitran hinta on pudonnut 22-24 senttiin ja maitoalan tuotteiden kysyntä on laskenut äkillisesti erityisesti Aasiassa ja Kiinassa melamiiniskandaalin takia.

Classical scholar Timothy Barnes relates contemporary allegations against Athanasius: from defiling an altar, to selling Church grain that had been meant to feed the poor for his own personal gain, and even violence and murder to suppress dissent. Athanasius used \\"Arian\\" to describe both followers of Arius, and as a derogatory polemical term for Christians who disagreed with his formulation of the Trinity. Athanasius called many of his opponents \\"Arian\\", except for Miletus.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"The disagreement between Athanasius and others in the Christian faith primarily revolved around the nature of the Trinity and the relationship between God the Father and Jesus Christ. This theological dispute became known as the Arian controversy. Step 1: Understand the context provided In the text provided, it describes that Athanasius had many detractors throughout his career, and he used the term \\"Arian\\" to describe both followers of Arius as well as Christians who disagreed with his views on the Trinity. Step 2: Identify the main point of disagreement The main point of disagreement between Athanasius and other Christians is the formulation of the Trinity. Specifically, the relationship between God the Father and Jesus Christ. Step 3: Explain Athanasius' position Athanasius, as a staunch defender of the Nicene Creed, argued for the homoousios doctrine, which states that Jesus Christ and God the Father are of the same substance and therefore co-eternal and co-equal. Step 4: Explain the opposing view On the other hand, Arius and his followers believed that Jesus Christ was not of the same substance as God the Father, but rather a created being, subordinate to and distinct from the Father. This view was known as Arianism. Step 5: Present the answer The disagreement between Athanasius and others in the Christian faith was primarily centered around the nature of the Trinity and the relationship between God the Father and Jesus Christ. Athanasius advocated for the homoousios doctrine, which states that Jesus Christ and God the Father are of the same substance, while his opponents, including those labeled as \\"Arians,\\" believed in the subordination of Jesus Christ to God the Father, denying the co-equality and co-eternality of the two."},{"instruction":"Question: Alannah, Beatrix, and Queen are preparing for the new school year and have been given books by their parents.

On Saturday, she practices piano three times as much as on a weekday. There is no practice on Sunday. How many hours does Elle spend practicing piano each week? Let's answer step by step:","output":"Step 1: Calculate the total practice time from Monday to Friday. Elle practices 30 minutes per day from Monday to Friday, for a total of 5 days. So, we need to multiply the number of minutes per day by the number of days: 30 minutes/day * 5 days = 150 minutes Step 2: Calculate the practice time on Saturday. On Saturday, she practices three times as much as on a weekday. Therefore, we need to multiply the practice time on a weekday by 3: 30 minutes/day * 3 = 90 minutes Step 3: Calculate the total practice time for the whole week. To find the total practice time for the whole week, we need to add the practice time from Monday to Friday (150 minutes) and the practice time on Saturday (90 minutes): 150 minutes + 90 minutes = 240 minutes Step 4: Convert the total practice time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to divide the total practice time in minutes by 60: 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours So, Elle spends a total of 4 hours practicing piano each week."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: It should be able to run Linux systems too but Gigabyte isnt supplying the relevant drivers for download and advises to obtain them from the chipset vendors website","output":"It should be able to run Linux systems, too, but Gigabyte isn't supplying the relevant drivers for download.

And the answer is...","output":"Okay little buddy, let's solve this problem step by step like a puzzle! We have: 0 = -6 * b + 5 * b - 2 First, we need to add the b's together. It's like having -6 apples and adding 5 apples. If you had 6 apples and someone took away 6 apples and then gave you 5 apples, you would have 5 apples left, but since it was -6 initially, we have -1 apples. So it becomes: 0 = -1 * b - 2 Now, we want to find what 'b' is. Imagine we had -1 toy multiplied by a number (that's our 'b') and we added 2 more toys to the toys we already had, we would have a total of 0 toys. So the question is, how many toys did we start with? To find out, we need to add 2 to each side: 0 + 2 = -1 * b - 2 + 2 This becomes: 2 = -1 * b Now, let's think: What number, when we multiply it by -1, gives us 2? It's like we had -1 bags of candy, and we added some amount of candy (our 'b') and in the end, we got 2 bags of candy. If we guess that 'b' is -2, when -2 is multiplied by -1, we get 2. So, we found our answer: b = -2 So our answer is b = -2. Good job solving the puzzle with me!"},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

This easy-to-follow guide will walk you through the process of creating a refreshing, cold glass of iced tea in just a few simple steps. You'll need a mug, boiling water, tea bags, ice, and optional garnishes. Step 1: Fill the mug with boiling water Begin by boiling water on the stovetop or in an electric kettle. Carefully pour about ½ cup (120 milliliters) of the boiling water into a heatproof mug. The use of a heatproof mug is essential, as regular mugs may crack or break when exposed to boiling water. Step 2: Brew the tea Next, select your desired tea bag. Popular choices include black tea, green tea, or herbal tea. Place the tea bag into the mug containing the boiling water and let it steep for 3 minutes. This will allow the flavors and benefits of the tea to be fully extracted and infused into the water. Step 3: Remove the tea bag Once the tea has brewed for 3 minutes, carefully remove the tea bag using a spoon or tongs. Make sure to give the tea bag a gentle squeeze to release any remaining liquid and flavors back into the mug. Discard the used tea bag. Step 4: Prepare the glasses While the tea is still hot, grab 1 to 2 glasses, depending on how much iced tea you want to serve. Fill these glasses with ice, almost to the brim. Using a sufficient amount of ice will ensure that the tea cools rapidly, without diluting the tea too much. Step 5: Pour and garnish Once your glasses are filled with ice, slowly pour the hot brewed tea over the ice. The tea should instantly start to cool, producing a refreshing iced beverage. If desired, garnish your iced tea with a sprig of mint, a slice of lemon, or even some fresh berries. This not only adds visual appeal but can also add a pleasant aroma and tantalizing flavors to your drink. Step 6: Serve and enjoy Finally, serve the iced tea to your guests or enjoy it yourself. The simple yet satisfying taste of a well-made iced tea is perfect for those hot summer days or whenever you need a refreshing break. In conclusion, making iced tea is a quick and easy process that can be done with just a few basic ingredients and steps. Start with boiling water, brew your favorite tea, pour it over ice, garnish if desired, and serve! This refreshing beverage is perfect for social gatherings or quiet moments of personal enjoyment.

It is currently the largest exporter of military small arms in Europe. - The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states) and powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others). Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but a common timeframe is the period (the second half of the 20th century) between 1947, the year the Truman Doctrine (a U.S. policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism) was announced, and 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed. - The FN FNC (French: \\"Fabrique Nationale Carabine\\") is a 5.56×45mm NATO assault rifle developed by the Belgian arms manufacturer FN Herstal and introduced in the late 1970s. - The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949.

Three NATO members are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states: the United States, France and the United Kingdom. NATO's headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, where the Supreme Allied Commander also resides.

An additional 22 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total.

This immunity is temporary and can be naturally or artificially acquired. There are two types of passive immunity: 1. Natural passive immunity: This occurs naturally when a mother transfers antibodies to her fetus during pregnancy (via the placenta) or to her baby through breastmilk (colostrum). These maternal antibodies provide the newborn with initial protection against various pathogens until their own immune system develops and starts producing their own antibodies. 2. Artificial passive immunity: This involves the administration of pre-formed antibodies obtained from another individual or animal, usually through injection or intravenous infusion. This method is often used as a short-term measure to treat certain infections, like rabies or hepatitis B, or to protect an individual who has been exposed to a specific pathogen and has not yet received vaccination. Immune globulins, monoclonal antibodies, and antitoxins are examples of artificially acquired passive immunity. It should be noted that passive immunity is temporary, lasting only for a few weeks or months, and does not provide long-lasting immunity like the one acquired from active immune response, i.e., vaccination or recovery from an infection."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Italian.

Marco, who I had already made turn 180 degrees to drive back to the truck, gave me that look of disapproval when I want to do something totally unreasonable like impulse buy citrus fruit that we can’t keep. “What are we going to do with these?” He questioned. I wasn’t sure. I wanted to taste them, I wanted to photograph them.

These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, which reached as far as the Mediterranean world. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation.

On the surface, these two activities seem incompatible. Playing musical instruments typically involves dedicating attention to the instruments and the music being played, and this could lead to difficulties performing strenuous physical activity like running a marathon. Additionally, running a marathon requires focus and stamina, and it is unlikely that someone could effectively perform an instrument while maintaining a consistent running pace. However, it is not impossible for the two men to engage in both activities within a specific time frame or under certain conditions. For example, they could be running a marathon while stopping at specific points along the route to play their instruments, making both statements true within a broader context. Alternatively, the men could be playing instruments that are designed or modified to be played during strenuous physical activity, such as harmonicas, allowing them to perform music while running. Ultimately, whether the premise \\"Two men play instruments together\\" is true in the context of \\"The men are running a marathon\\" depends on several factors that are not explicitly mentioned in either statement. These factors include the specific instruments being played, the context and the timing of the activities, and any potential modifications that have been made to facilitate the combination of these activities. In conclusion, we cannot definitively determine if the premise \\"Two men play instruments together\\" is true based solely on the information that \\"The men are running a marathon.\\" Further details about the nature of the instruments, any adaptations to the activities involved, and the specific context in which the actions occur would be necessary to ascertain the validity of the premise."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Wang Bei, 24, a former singer on Super Girl, died on Nov 15 during plastic surgery in Wuhan, Hubei province. The young singer's jaw suddenly started bleeding during the procedure, blocking her throat and causing her to suffocate.

Beatrix's mother worked hard in 1953 when Netherlands was hit by huge storm. Fitzwilliams: Dutch have investiture, not coronation; protocol is relaxed. Monarchy unites country with fractious history, the author adds. Article:","output":"Title: Beatrix's Legacy: A Prosperous Nation and a Popular Monarchy Introduction The Dutch monarchy has always held a special place in the heart of the Netherlands and its people. Under the reign of Queen Beatrix, the country experienced not only prosperity but also a strengthened connection between the monarchy and its citizens. In a recent interview, Richard Fitzwilliams, a renowned royal commentator, remarked on the positive impact of Beatrix's rule, her mother's hard work in 1953, and the unique nature of the Dutch investiture ceremony. A Prosperous Nation under Beatrix's Rule When Beatrix ascended to the throne in 1980, she gave her all to ensure that the country would thrive economically and politically. Her efforts proved successful and, during her 33-year reign, the Netherlands grew into a more prosperous and advanced nation. Richard Fitzwilliams notes her contributions to the nation's progress and highlights the popular support the monarchy enjoyed amongst the Dutch populace. In addition to her numerous initiatives that aided her nation's growth, Beatrix gracefully upheld the delicate balance between her role as a reigning monarch and one who is in touch with her people. The resulting popularity of the monarchy under her reign was undeniable, as evidenced by the outpouring of love and affection by the Dutch people during her tenure. Building on the Legacies of the Past The strong foundations of today's prosperous Dutch nation were built not only by Beatrix herself but also by her predecessors. Her mother, Queen Juliana, played a pivotal role in rebuilding the Netherlands following the devastating storm of 1953. Fitzwilliams underlines the importance of the hard work and dedication of Juliana in overcoming this crisis and shaping a hopeful, united nation. The Unique Dutch Investiture Ceremony Contrary to many European monarchies, the Dutch observe an investiture ceremony rather than a coronation when a new monarch ascends to the throne. According to Fitzwilliams, this reflects a decidedly more relaxed protocol in contrast to the pomp and circumstance of traditional coronations. This particular tradition has endeared the Dutch monarchy to the nation and contributed to the deep-rooted connection between the people and their royal family. A Monarchy that Binds the Nation Fitzwilliams emphasizes the role of the Dutch monarchy in uniting a country with a fractious history. The strong bond between the monarchy and the people has helped in maintaining unity, social cohesion, and stability, which are quintessential for the nation's progress and prosperity. The values embodied by Beatrix and the entire Dutch royal family serve as a source of strength and inspiration for the people of the Netherlands. Conclusion As Beatrix's legacy of a prosperous nation and a popular monarchy endures, it is evident that her reign has left an indelible mark on the history of the Netherlands. The dedication and resilience exemplified by Beatrix, her mother Juliana, and the rest of the royal family have played a critical role in shaping the nation's success. By preserving the traditions and values that have solidified its position in the hearts of the Dutch people, the monarchy continues to bring unity, stability, and prosperity to a nation that cherishes and values its royal family deeply."},{"instruction":"Try to write something that will hook your audience so that you immediately grab their attention. Try starting the speech writing process by free-writing. Write as much as you can about your subject as fast as you can. Don't worry about judgment or crafting perfect sentences. Once you have your points on paper, you can start refining them and putting them in order. Use an anecdote or a quote. Sometimes, someone else has already said it better than you ever will. A quote, provided it hasn't been overused, can help you get things started. Just be sure to look for a quote that is surprising or unique, and always credit your source. Be cautious about opening with a joke unless you know your audience well. You may think that a joke is funny, but your audience may find it humorless or even offensive. Make sure that your points are concise and direct. You can start by looking at generic sources like an encyclopedia or Wikipedia, but you need to fact check your ideas with more authoritative sources after you generally understand your subject. Draw on your own experience. If you have a long history with your topic, your experiences and personal stories can be great resources. Just keep these stories succinct so that you don't ramble and lose the audience's attention. Decide whether you want to write out your speech or to outline the speech on index cards. Consider your comfort level with the topic. If you know the topic well and can improvise easily, then use index cards. Use 1 card for the introduction. This card should include your opening statement. Use 1 or 2 cards for each supporting point. Then, create 1 card for the conclusion which ties back to the main idea of your speech. Write brief sentence fragments or even single words on your cards. These words or fragments should contain key phrases that remind you of what you want to say. If you feel insecure or don't know the subject well, write out the words of your speech exactly as you want to say them. The choice to use visual aids will depend on the size of your audience and the length of your speech. A long speech, for example, may be easier to sit through with some visuals to break it up. You may create a Prezi or a PowerPoint presentation to go along with your speech, or you may choose to use paper-based charts and graphs. Keep the visuals to a minimum. You want them to aid your speech, not to overshadow it. Always make sure your speech can stand on its own should technical problems occur. Make sure that the audience can read the content of your visuals. Too big is better than not big enough. Check the facilities of the room in which you will be speaking. If you need Internet or you need a projection screen, be sure that the facility has the equipment. Arrive to the room early to make sure everything is functional for your speech. Providing your credentials before your speech can help you set your tone, and give you the chance to list your credentials without bragging. Use this to let the audience get an assessment of who you are, and take the moment to introduce not only your background but your style of speaking.If someone will be introducing you before your speech, then providing this introduction beforehand will be helpful. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2f/Do-Research-Step-19.jpg/v4-460px-Do-Research-Step-19.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/2/2f/Do-Research-Step-19.jpg/aid9476-v4-728px-Do-Research-Step-19.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} Summary:","output":"1.

The gathering that took place in Sintra, Portugal aimed to discuss the future of the European Constitution and the critical matters pertaining to the future of Europe. The European Union has been dealing with numerous issues and challenges over the years, and this meeting brought together leaders and policymakers to share their thoughts, insights, and potential solutions to help shape the direction of Europe's future. The European Constitution refers to the foundational treaties governing the European Union and its relationship with its member states. While the term \\"constitution\\" might imply a single, overriding document, the reality is a complex web of treaties, protocols, and legislative acts. The European Constitution reflects the EU's values, objectives, and political structure, and its development has been an ongoing project since the Union's inception. Addressing the future of this Constitution is essential if the EU wants to remain a unified and functional institution capable of responding effectively to the various challenges it faces in the 21st century. Key issues discussed in Sintra included the need for reform of current treaties, increased democratic accountability, the protection of human rights, citizens' participation in decision-making processes, and the overall political, economic, and social stability within the Union. Moreover, Europe's future involves various pressing issues that its leaders need to tackle. These include migration and refugees, climate change and environmental concerns, economic and social inequality, challenges related to technological advancements, the threat of terrorism, and the changing political landscape characterized by nationalist and populist movements. All these problems require a collective response from the EU member states, making it crucial for the Union to develop a comprehensive and cohesive strategy in response to these challenges. In conclusion, the meeting in Sintra was a critical step in discussing the future of the European Constitution and examining the central issues that Europe must confront in the coming years. Analyzing possible solutions and making necessary adjustments to the EU's legal framework and policy approaches could lead to a more robust, democratic, and effective Union that is better prepared to address the complex problems of the 21st century."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this \\"Click a video title on your Videos page in YouTube Studio (beta).

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. Paragraph: Uncle Tom and uncle Sam both have high cholesterol. Uncle Tom is on statin drugs and uncle Sam is not.

The war dispersed the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen due to the Japanese American internment. After the war, the local economy dipped. It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading \\"Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.\\"Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago. The Seattle area is still home to Boeing's Renton narrow-body plant (where the 707, 720, 727, and 757 were assembled, and the 737 is assembled today) and Everett wide-body plant (assembly plant for the 747, 767, 777, and 787). The company's credit union for employees, BECU, remains based in the Seattle area, though it is now open to all residents of Washington. Another boom began as the city emerged from the Great Recession which commenced when Amazon.com moved its headquarters from North Beacon Hill to South Lake Union. This initiated a historic construction boom which resulted in the completion of almost 10,000 apartments in Seattle in 2017, which is more than any previous year and nearly twice as many as were built in 2016. Beginning in 2010, and for the next five years, Seattle gained an average of 14,511 residents per year, with the growth strongly skewed toward the center of the city, as unemployment dropped from roughly 9 percent to 3.6 percent.

This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors. - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound.

London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts.

Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience. - Pebble Mill Studios was a television studio complex owned by the BBC located in Edgbaston, Birmingham, England.

The song was penned in 1975 and featured on the band's fourth studio album, A Night at the Opera. Mary Austin and Freddie were introduced in the late 1960s by the Queen's guitarist Brian May. She worked as a staff member at the fashionable Biba boutique in Kensington, London. Their romantic relationship started shortly after their introduction, and Austin is often described as the love of Mercury's life. The couple was together for several years and shared an extraordinary bonding that transcended mere romance and entered into the realm of genuine soulmates. When Freddie Mercury's sexuality evolved, and their romantic relationship ended, their friendship remained strong and intact. Mercury often referred to Mary Austin as his wife, even though they never married, and considered her the driving force behind him during his life. She was a supportive, loyal, and trusted confidante, and their relationship is reflective of an exceptional bond that stood the test of time, even until Mercury's untimely death in 1991 due to complications arising from AIDS. \\"Love of My Life\\" is a heartfelt emotional ballad that captures the extraordinary relationship Mercury shared with Austin. The song has been praised for its deeply emotional lyrics, universally relatable theme, and captivating piano composition. It is indeed a testament to the great love they shared. Throughout the years, the song became particularly famous for Mercury's poignant live performances, in which he would frequently sing the first verse and then let the audience participate in the subsequent parts – a practice still followed by Brian May during his solo concerts. In conclusion, Freddie Mercury wrote \\"Love of My Life\\" as a tribute to Mary Austin, whom he loved intensely and nurtured a deep bond with, despite the changing nature of their relationship over time. The song remains a touching reflection of their unfaltering connection and an enduring testament to their extraordinary love story."},{"instruction":"Article: If you share a computer with one user or more, make sure you are using the administrator account; otherwise, you won't be able to make changes to the system settings.

This revelation highlights the resilience and adaptability of the nation's economy, successfully navigating through uncertain global market conditions and overcoming potential challenges. In this article, we will discuss the factors contributing to this growth and analyze the implications of these newly revised figures. Revised Growth Figures According to the updated data, the UK's economy saw a significant growth at a faster pace than the preliminary estimations suggested. This is an encouraging sign, showcasing the dynamism and strength of the United Kingdom's industries and consumers. The improved performance of the economy can largely be attributed to several factors, including increased consumer spending, investments in infrastructure, and a favorable environment for businesses. Factors Driving Growth 1. Consumer Spending: One of the primary factors driving the UK's economic growth is the increase in consumer spending. British consumers have demonstrated confidence in the economy by continuing to spend, attracting new investments and supporting existing businesses. As demand rises, businesses are better equipped to expand, hire more employees, and contribute to overall economic growth. 2. Infrastructure Investments: Another essential factor in the accelerated growth of the UK economy is the increased investment in infrastructure projects. These include investments in transportation, energy, and housing sectors, amongst others. The government's commitment to upgrading the nation's infrastructure has led to an influx of capital and positive impacts on various industries linked to these projects. 3. Business Environment: A positive business environment has been an instrumental factor in fostering the growth of the UK economy. Continuous government efforts to stimulate growth through tax incentives, business-friendly regulations, and support for innovation have significantly contributed to driving economic expansion. Implications of Revised Figures The revised growth figures not only serve as a testament to the UK's economic resilience but also have a range of implications for both businesses and policymakers. The faster growth rate could result in increased confidence among investors, leading to additional capital being invested in various sectors of the economy. Policymakers could also seize this opportunity to further develop strategies aiming at reinforcing economic growth and addressing potential weaknesses. Additionally, this revised economic growth can support more employment opportunities and help improve the living standards of UK citizens. It could reaffirm the nation's position as a global financial powerhouse and allow for a proactive approach in tackling various economic challenges that may arise in the future. Conclusion The updated growth figures for the UK economy are a clear indicator of the resilience and adaptability inherent within the nation's economic fabric. The favorable conditions for consumer spending, infrastructure investments, and a positive business environment have significantly contributed to the economy's growth. As a result, the UK is now well-positioned to seize new opportunities, create jobs, and ensure sustainable and inclusive growth moving forward. Undoubtedly, these revised figures are cause for optimism, and they have further fortified the UK's reputation as an economic powerhouse."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise \\"As a class they came to even greater power and wealth by organizing trade and controlling the flow of goods in the area.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"They came to great wealth and power through creating a cartel which organized trade.\\" is true (see options)?

Should I validate this answer? Options are: + No + Yes Answer:","output":"No, the suggested answer does not adequately address the specific question, which is asking about the reasons for historical change. The answer provided instead discusses the various aspects of the study of history. A more suitable response addressing the reasons for historical change should mention key factors and influences like economic, political, social, technological, and environmental circumstances. A better answer to the question might be: Historical change can be attributed to a variety of interconnected factors and influences. Some of the core reasons for historical change are: 1. Economic factors: Shifts in trade patterns, changes in production methods, and fluctuations in economic growth can all contribute to historical change. For instance, the Industrial Revolution significantly altered the economic landscape by introducing new ways of producing goods and altering the global trade balance. 2. Political factors: The rise and fall of political powers, the occurrence of revolutions, and the introduction of new governance systems can lead to significant historical change. Examples include the fall of the Roman Empire, the French Revolution, and the rise of various nation-states in the modern era. 3. Social factors: Population growth, migration, changes in social structures, and the spread of new ideas and values can all lead to historical changes. For instance, the Renaissance period witnessed a shift in social values and the rise of humanism, which dramatically shaped European society and culture. 4. Technological advancements: New inventions and technological developments can significantly impact historical change. The introduction of the printing press, for example, revolutionized the dissemination of information, enabling ideas to spread faster and leading to changes in societal beliefs and norms. 5. Environmental factors: Natural disasters, environmental degradation, and climate change can all impact historical change, particularly if they lead to large-scale disruption or migration. The decline of the Mayan civilization, for example, has been linked to a combination of environmental factors and resource depletion. Each of these factors can contribute to historical change, though their significance and interplay can vary depending on the specific society or period in question. Answering the question about the reasons for historical change should encompass these factors, allowing for a holistic and in-depth understanding of the subject."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Article: It's Sunday morning.

Among the given options, the consequences of poisonous substances from insect bites include: 1. Injury: Insect bites might cause the skin to redden, swell, or become irritated where the bite occurred. 2. Toxins: Some insects, such as bees, wasps, ants, and spiders, inject venom into their victims. These venomous substances are toxins that can result in pain, inflammation, and allergic reactions. 3. Death: In extreme cases, particularly in individuals with severe allergies, insect bites can be fatal due to anaphylactic shock or other life-threatening complications. 4. Harm: In general, poisonous substances from insect bites pose harm to the affected living beings, potentially causing a range of health issues, from mild discomfort to severe reactions. While cancer and cell growth are not among the immediate consequences of insect bites, some infections that could potentially result from bites (like certain tick-borne illnesses) may have indirect long-term effects on an individual's health.

But I never really liked being on the water, the way my father did. I liked being in the water, moving through it, having it all around me. I was not a strong swimmer, or one who learned to swim early, for I had my fears. But I loved being in the swimming pool close to my father's office and spending those summer days with my father, who would come by on a break. I needed him to see what I could do. My father would stand there in his suit, the only person not in swimsuit. After swimming, I would go inside his office and sit on the wooden chair in front of his big desk, where he let me play with anything I found in his top desk drawer. Sometimes, if I was left alone at his desk while he worked in the lab, an assistant or a student might come in and tell me perhaps I shouldn't be playing with his office things.

Allow me to explain in detail why the other options do not fit the given context, and why \\"sports complex\\" is the most logical and appropriate answer. 1. Peanut: A peanut is, of course, a type of nut used as a snack and an ingredient in various dishes. It is entirely unrelated to the concept of an area or a facility related to sports or baseball stadiums. Thus, this option is unrelated to the context and can be eliminated. 2. Major city / Large city: While major cities and large cities are vast urban areas that may include numerous attractions, such as sports facilities and baseball stadiums, they don't specifically describe the area around a baseball stadium. Cities contain various types of facilities, residential areas, commercial zones, and other infrastructures, so using these terms would not accurately describe an area that is specifically meant for sports facilities. 3. Urban areas: This term is similar to major or large cities, as urban areas are regions characterized by high population density and infrastructure, including housing, transportation, and commercial spaces. Although urban areas may contain sports facilities, the term still does not specifically describe an area dedicated to sports or a baseball stadium. With the other options ruled out, we are left with \\"sports complex.\\" A sports complex is a large facility or a group of facilities that are designed and built specifically for sports activities and competitions. These complexes often contain multiple sports venues, such as baseball stadiums, football fields, basketball courts, and areas for other sports and recreational activities. They are created to provide a designated space for sports enthusiasts, athletes, and spectators to engage in or enjoy various sports. In the context of your question, the whole area being larger than just the baseball stadium suggests that there are other facilities and venues present in the area that cater to different sports and activities.

Question: If the charge of staying in a student youth hostel 18.00/day for the first week, and 15.00/day for each additional week, How much does it cost to stay for 23 days? Option A: 336 Option B: 289 Option C: 282 Option D: 274 Option E: 286 Output:","output":"To solve this problem, I first used the definition to identify that this is a case of simple arithmetic where the goal is to calculate the total cost of staying in the hostel for 23 days. I broke down the problem into two parts: the cost for the first week (7 days) and the cost for the remaining days (23 - 7 = 16 days). For the first week, the cost is 18.00/day, so I multiplied 18 by 7 to get the cost for the first 7 days: 18.00 * 7 = 126. Now, I need to calculate the cost for the remaining 16 days. Since each additional week costs 15.00/day, I first determined how many full weeks and extra days are in the remaining 16 days. There are 2 full weeks (14 days) and an extra 2 days. The cost for the 2 full weeks is: 15.00/day * 14 days = 210. For the remaining 2 days, I assumed that these two days still cost 15.00/day since it hasn't been explicitly defined otherwise. Therefore, the cost for these extra days is: 15.00/day * 2 days = 30. Finally, I added the costs of the first week, the 2 full additional weeks, and the remaining 2 days: 126 + 210 + 30 = 366. However, since the given options did not have the correct answer that I calculated (366), I analyzed the problem again and realized that perhaps there is a \\"weekly\\" discount implied for the remaining 2 days. In this case, one additional week (7 days) would cost 15.00 * 7 = 105. Thus, the cost per day for those remaining 2 days should be discounted by the same ratio as the weekly discount: 18 - ((18 * 7) - 105) / 7 = 18 - 3 = 15. By considering the discounted daily rate for the remaining 2 days, the new total cost would be: 126 (first week) + 210 (2 full additional weeks) + 30 (2 days at discounted daily rate) = 366. This time, after thorough re-evaluation of the problem, I concluded that none of the provided options matched the correct answer that I calculated based on the given definition and information.

Activity performed by the teenager: In the first situation, the teenager is riding a skateboard, which is an entirely different activity from running. Skateboarding involves using a skateboard, which is a flat, narrow board with four wheels attached underneath. It requires a different set of physical skills and coordination than running. In the second situation, the teenager is running, which is an individual, high-impact exercise that is performed on foot and requires no equipment other than appropriate footwear. Running is a fundamental form of human locomotion that primarily involves the lower body muscles and cardiovascular endurance. 2. Mode of transportation: In the first scenario, the teenager is using a skateboard as their mode of transportation, which means the teenager is riding on the wheels of the skateboard to move. Skateboarding is a popular recreational and sporting activity that is sometimes also used as a means of transportation. In the second scenario, the teenager is on foot, which means they're using their own body's muscular strength, endurance, and energy to move. Running is a natural form of human movement that has been practiced throughout human history for various purposes, such as hunting, escaping danger, or as a form of exercise. 3. Surrounding environment: The environment in each situation is also different. The first scenario involves a metal fence, which is typically made of steel, aluminum, or wrought iron and often used as a boundary or a barrier for protecting properties or other spaces. Fences can vary in height, design, and purpose. The setting could indicate that the teenager is skateboarding in a park, a residential area, or near an industrial site. In the second scenario, the teenager is running near a brick wall, which is made from bricks, a common building material. Brick walls are typically found in residential, commercial, or public spaces and provide structural support and privacy, among other functions. The surrounding environment could be a narrow urban alley, a suburban neighborhood, or even a historical site with old brick architecture. Therefore, based on the provided information, one cannot conclude that the statement \\"A teenager is riding a skateboard alongside a metal fence\\" is true if the context is \\"A teenager runs on foot near a brick wall.\\" The two scenarios are essentially different and have no direct correlation or implications that could lead to this conclusion."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Maliina Abelsen was an MP for which democratic socialist party?

She is finally cornered and eaten by zombies in World War II German uniforms.The movie then moves to seven medical students on Easter vacation. They arrive at a small cabin near Øksfjord, about a 45-minute walk from the road where they have left their cars. The cabin is owned by Sara, another student who is the girlfriend of Vegard (Lasse Valdal), the student in the main group with the most knowledge of the wilderness. She has been skiing across the mountains to meet them, but has not yet arrived.They drink and party until a mysterious hiker (Bjørn Sundquist) arrives. He tells them the dark history of the region; during World War II, a force of Einsatzgruppen led by the dreaded Standartenführer Herzog occupied the area. During three long years the Nazis abused and tortured the local people, and near the end of the war, with Germany's defeat looming, looted all their valuables before starting to withdraw from the area. The citizens managed to stage an uprising and ambushed the Nazis, killing many. The surviving Nazis, including Herzog, were chased into the mountains, and it was assumed that they all froze to death. The hiker says the area still has an evil reputation. He leaves to continue on his way. Later the hiker is murdered by zombies while camped in the snow.The next morning Sara has still not arrived and Vegard takes the group's snowmobile to look for her.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"While both questions are related to replacing iPhone screens, they are not inquiring about the same information. The first question is asking how to replace an iPhone 5 screen, while the second question is asking about where to go to replace an iPhone 4's screen. I'll address both questions in detail below. 1. How can I replace an iPhone 5 screen? Before you start, make sure you have the necessary tools and replacement parts, namely a new iPhone 5 screen, a suction cup, a spudger, a P2 Pentalobe screwdriver, a Phillips #000 screwdriver, and a plastic opening tool. You can easily find these items online or in a mobile repair shop. Follow these steps to replace your iPhone 5 screen: Step 1: Power off your iPhone 5 by holding the power button and then sliding to power off. Step 2: Locate the two Pentalobe screws present at the bottom of your iPhone on either side of the Lightning connector. Use the P2 Pentalobe screwdriver to unscrew them. Step 3: Use the suction cup near the home button to gently lift the screen. Be careful not to pull it straight upward, as there are cables connected internally. Step 4: Once partially lifted, use the plastic opening tool to pry the screen open along the sides, separating it from the case. Step 5: With the screen partially lifted, locate the metallic plate protecting three connectors responsible for the display. Unscrew the three Phillips head (PH #000) screws and remove the plate. Step 6: Use the spudger to gently disconnect the three connectors by prying them up. Now, the screen should be detached. Step 7: Take the new iPhone 5 screen and reconnect the three connectors, ensuring they snap into place. Step 8: Reinstall the metallic plate over the connectors and secure it with the three Phillips head screws. Step 9: Align and gently press down on the edges of the screen to snap it back into place. Step 10: Secure the screen by reinstalling the two Pentalobe screws at the bottom of the iPhone. Step 11: Turn your iPhone back on to confirm if it's working correctly. 2. Where can I go to replace my iPhone 4's screen? If you are not confident that you can replace the screen on your own or prefer to have a professional handle the repair, you have several options: A. Authorized Apple Service Providers or Apple Retail Stores: Visit an authorized Apple service provider or an Apple retail store to have your iPhone 4's screen replaced. Make sure to book an appointment before visiting. It is essential to note that this might be an expensive option, especially if your iPhone 4 is no longer covered by an Apple warranty. B. Third-party cell phone repair shops: You may find many local mobile repair shops that can replace the iPhone 4 screen for a lower cost. However, ensure the shop you choose is reputable and uses quality replacement parts. You can find reviews or recommendations online or from friends and family. Keep in mind that using unauthorized service providers might void any remaining Apple warranty or cause potential issues with future repairs. C. Online repair services: Some online service providers can offer mail-in repair services. They will send you a shipping label to mail your iPhone, and they will return it after repairing your screen. It is essential to research any online service providers thoroughly to ensure they are reputable and can be trusted with your device."},{"instruction":"Single/multi-select question: If \\"A man and a woman standing on a street corner.\\", can we conclude \\"A street corner has a man and woman wearing matching clothes there.\\"? Options are: a). yes. b). it is not possible to tell. c). no.","output":"b). it is not possible to tell. The original statement given is \\"A man and a woman standing on a street corner.\\" With this information alone, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about whether the man and woman are wearing matching clothes or not because there is no mention of their attire in the statement. Elaborating on the reasons why we cannot conclude whether or not they are wearing matching clothes, we can observe the following points: 1. Lack of detail about their clothes: The original statement only provides information about the presence of a man and a woman at a street corner, not about their clothes, the colors they are wearing, or any specific features of their outfits. 2. Assumptions: If we were to conclude that the man and the woman are wearing matching clothes, we would be making an assumption without any supporting evidence. It is essential to base our conclusions on the available facts and not make assumptions in the absence of information. 3. Possibilities: There are several possible scenarios regarding their clothes. They could be wearing clothes that match in color, pattern, or style. Conversely, they could also be dressed entirely differently, with no matching elements in their outfits. Without further information, it is impossible to tell which scenario is accurate. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the statement \\"A man and a woman standing on a street corner,\\" we cannot determine whether the man and woman on the street corner are wearing matching clothes or not.

That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November. The debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients has challenged lawmakers since last September, when U.S. President Donald Trump ended the program, calling on Congress to find a permanent legislative solution. Lawmakers will return to Washington facing an immediate deadline. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican who is one of the leaders of the petition effort, told reporters that June 7 would be the absolute last moment to allow the petition to mature before lawmakers run up against a seven-week summer recess. Denham said talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative voting bloc seeking significant security concessions in return for a citizenship path for DACA recipients, have been productive. \\"We've had an agreement in principle,\\" Denham said of a deal that would provide a 12-year path to citizenship for DACA recipients, known colloquially as Dreamers. \\"Now it's trying to put that information on paper.

Options: - sweating - work out - excitement - anger - getting tired Please answer and provide answer explanation.","output":"When someone loses a soccer match, they can experience a mixture of emotions and physical sensations. Here, the two most relevant options are: 1. Anger: Losing a game may cause some individuals to feel angry or frustrated, especially if they were competitive, had made a considerable amount of effort, or were expecting to win. This emotion might be directed towards one's own performance, teammates, or external circumstances, such as ref calls or the opposing team's behavior. 2. Getting tired: Soccer is a physically demanding sport, and playing an entire match can be extremely exhausting. Regardless of whether a player wins or loses, they are likely to feel tired after the game due to the amount of energy expended while running, kicking, and engaging in various other physical activities. As a side note, while not directly related to losing a game, sweating and feeling a sense of workout are also common physical sensations that players can experience due to the physical exertion involved in soccer."},{"instruction":"Solve 7339 + 17642 = 757*i for i..

He’s really smart (going to Yale Law School next year) and seemed to be really into me. We saw each other for around 2 months, but I was already sort of planning our futures together. Anyway, I’m not fat, but I don’t have any real muscular definition nor am I slim. He, on the other hand, went to the gym everyday.

First, consider the purpose of Bob's action: he wants to prevent the ball bearings from scattering around. This implies that he needs a container or a place to securely hold them. 2. Evaluate each option based on how well it would serve this purpose: - Machines: Machines are not designed for containing loose objects like ball bearings and are meant to serve specific functions. Putting ball bearings into a machine without knowing its purpose might cause damage or malfunction. So, this is not an ideal option. - Pool: A pool is designed for water, not for holding small objects. The ball bearings would sink to the bottom, making it difficult to retrieve them later. Also, putting ball bearings in a pool would not prevent scattering. This option is not suitable. - Can: A can is a container designed to hold and store items. A can with a lid would secure the ball bearings and prevent them from scattering. This option is practical and matches Bob's purpose. - Church: A church is a place of worship and is not designed for storing objects. It would not prevent the ball bearings from being scattered around. Moreover, it is not an appropriate place for such a purpose. This option is not suitable. - High quality motor: Just like with machines, putting ball bearings into a motor without knowing its purpose might cause damage or malfunction.

Subject: Both sentences share the same subject - \\"a woman.\\" Therefore, they have similarity in this aspect. 2. Adjectives: Both sentences use the adjective \\"black\\" to describe an aspect of the woman's clothing. This adds to their similarity. 3. Clothing: The first sentence mentions two specific clothing items - a \\"bikini top\\" and \\"jeans,\\" while the second sentence mentions a \\"hat.\\" While both sentences talk about articles of clothing, their specifics are completely different. This makes them less similar in this aspect. 4. Action/Setting: The first sentence does not provide any information about the woman's actions or setting, while the second sentence has a clear setting (by the subway) and action (\\"standing\\").

The sentence \\"I mixed the eggs with cream\\" can be considered correct by the strictest standards, as it follows the basic sentence structure and grammatical rules of the English language. Linguists tend to analyze sentences based on syntax, morphology, and semantics. When we examine the given sentence, it appears to fulfill these criteria: 1. Syntax: The sentence has a clear subject, verb, and object along with a prepositional phrase, adhering to the proper word order for English sentences. The syntactic structure can be broken down as follows: - Subject (S): \\"I\\" - Verb (V): \\"mixed\\" - Direct Object (DO): \\"the eggs\\" - Prepositional phrase (PP): \\"with cream\\" The word order is S-V-DO-PP, which is considered standard for English. 2. Morphology: The words in the sentence are morphologically well-formed, and the verb \\"mixed\\" agrees with its subject \\"I\\" in terms of tense and number. The noun \\"eggs\\" is in its plural form, which implies that there is more than one egg being mixed. The preposition \\"with\\" is also appropriate in this context to express the combination of eggs and cream. 3. Semantics: The sentence is semantically clear and easily understandable. The meaning conveyed by the sentence is that someone (the speaker) combined eggs and cream in some process, such as during cooking or baking. There are no ambiguities or contradictory meanings in the sentence.

The Qin unified the Chinese Warring States by conquest, but their empire became unstable after the death of the first emperor Qin Shi Huangdi. Within four years, the dynasty's authority had collapsed in the face of rebellion. Two former rebel leaders, Xiang Yu (d. 202 BC) of Chu and Liu Bang (d. 195 BC) of Han, engaged in a war to decide who would become hegemon of China, which had fissured into 18 kingdoms, each claiming allegiance to either Xiang Yu or Liu Bang. Although Xiang Yu proved to be a capable commander, Liu Bang defeated him at Battle of Gaixia (202 BC), in modern-day Anhui. Liu Bang assumed the title \\"emperor\\" (huangdi) at the urging of his followers and is known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu (r. 202–195 BC). Chang'an was chosen as the new capital of the reunified empire under Han.\\" Answer: A:","output":"The first emperor in the Han dynasty was Liu Bang, who defeated Xiang Yu in the decisive Battle of Gaixia in 202 BC. To provide more context, after the fall of the Qin dynasty, China was plunged into a period of chaos and disarray, with numerous rebel factions and kingdoms vying for power. Among these, Xiang Yu and Liu Bang emerged as the most prominent leaders. Xiang Yu was a fearless warrior from the Chu state, while Liu Bang was a commoner from the Han state who rose through the ranks due to his charisma and ability to attract talented followers. The struggle between Xiang Yu and Liu Bang, known as the Chu-Han Contention, saw the formation of 18 contending kingdoms, each pledging their allegiance to either of the two leaders. The power dynamics were complex with shifting alliances and betrayals, but ultimately the contest came down to a series of military confrontations. Despite Xiang Yu's formidable skills as a commander, Liu Bang managed to gain the upper hand through a combination of effective strategies, strong alliances, and competent generals. The Battle of Gaixia marked the turning point in the Chu-Han Contention. Liu Bang's forces managed to outmaneuver and surround Xiang Yu's army, leading to the latter's defeat and eventual suicide. Following this decisive victory, Liu Bang consolidated his power and was urged by his followers to declare himself emperor. He thus assumed the title of \\"huangdi\\" and became known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu, founding the Han dynasty which succeeded the Qin dynasty. The Han dynasty reestablished imperial rule in China and brought a degree of stability and prosperity to the land. Chang'an (modern-day Xi'an) was chosen as the capital of the reunified empire, and its rulers embarked on a path of governance that would see a more lenient legal system compared to the harshness of the Qin dynasty. The Han dynasty went on to have a lasting impact on Chinese history, culture, and society, with its legacy still evident in China today."},{"instruction":"Article: CBS newsman and 60 Minutes correspondent Morley Safer is retiring after more than 50 years. The longest-serving 60 Minutes correspondent will formally retire this week, CBS announced on Wednesday, May 11, and the reporter, who began his career as a CBS regular in 1970, told Us Weekly via a statement that he's incredibly grateful for his amazing career. Roger Kisby/Getty Images “After more than 50 years of broadcasting on CBS News and 60 Minutes I have decided to retire,\\" the 84-year-old said. \\"It’s been a wonderful run, but the time has come to say goodbye to all of my friends at CBS and the dozens of people who kept me on the air,\\" he added. “But most of all I thank the millions of people who have been loyal to our broadcast.” Safer's unparalleled work will be celebrated in an hourlong special, Morley Safer: A Reporter’s Life, which will air following the Sunday, May 15, regular edition of 60 Minutes. “Morley has had a brilliant career as a reporter and as one of the most significant figures in CBS News history, on our broadcast and in many of our lives,” Jeff Fager, executive producer of 60 Minutes, said. “Morley’s curiosity, his sense of adventure and his superb writing all made for exceptional work done by a remarkable man. The best of Morley Safer will be on display in our special broadcast this Sunday.” The show will trace Safer’s life, from his birth in Toronto through his rise in the 1950s and '60s as a distinguished war reporter to his time as a 60 Minutes correspondent.

Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter packed with the latest celeb news, hot pics and more! ||||| Editor's note: Morley Safer died Thursday at age 84, just days after retiring from CBS News, Reuters reported. The International Business Times story below was initially published last week, after word of Safer's retirement plans. Morley Safer is disconnecting his microphone. The 84-year-old, longest-serving correspondent on “60 Minutes” is retiring after more than a half-century of covering the world, CBS News announced Wednesday. “It’s been a wonderful run, but the time has come to say goodbye to all of my friends at CBS and the dozens of people who kept me on the air,” Safer told CBS News. “But most of all I thank the millions of people who have been loyal to our broadcast.” “Morley has had a brilliant career as a reporter and as one of the most significant figures in CBS News history, on our broadcast and in many of our lives,” Jeff Fager, executive producer of “60 Minutes,” said in a statement. Unlike the current age of digital journalism that all too frequently requires online users to cobble together an understanding of news events through a stream of abbreviated quick hits and short video takes, Safer’s work was based in an era that focused on carefully dissecting events and providing readers with a complete picture of a story in carefully crafted segments. Safer may be best known for his work exposing the bleak tactics the U.S. employed during the Vietnam War that alienated the rural population in that country, trapped between the global forces of communism and capitalism during the Cold War. Just a year after joining CBS News in his early 30s in 1964, the Canadian-born reporter followed a group of U.S. Marines on a search-and-destroy mission in the village of Cam Ne. Safer showed Marines instructing locals in English to evacuate their homes as the troops casually light thatched huts afire with their cigarette lighters and flamethrowers. The report helped mark the beginning of increasingly critical media coverage of the U.S. war in Southeast Asia. It angered President Lyndon B. Johnson so much, he had Safer investigated for ties to communism. When told by staffers that Safer was “just a Canadian,” the president replied, “Well, I knew he wasn’t American.” Safer’s early big journalistic coup — few correspondents garner any attention from a U.S. president, much less get probed at the behest of one — was followed by a series of award-winning in-depth analyses and reports, including coverage of the Northern Ireland conflict in 1974 that spotlighted a divided town and a dive into the dark pool of art forgery. Safer won more than two dozen awards, including 12 Emmys and the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for coverage of a school for the homeless. Safer went on to produce hundreds of reports for “60 Minutes,” 919 of them in all. His last piece ran in March, a profile of Danish architect Bjarke Ingels. While much of his work focused on covering global conflicts, exposing injustices or highlighting social issues, Safer often used his great command of the language to produce lighthearted pieces. After U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died this year in Marfa, Texas, Safer’s 2013 profile of the quirky desert town suddenly attracted new interest. And what about those U.S. soldiers he covered back in 1965? “[Safer] was all business and he reported what he saw ... We looked at eternity right in the face a couple times ... and he was as cool as a hog on ice,” U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Joe Stringham told CBS News for a segment about Safer’s career that “60 Minutes” will present Sunday at 8 p.m. EDT. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"CBS newsman and 60 Minutes correspondent Morley Safer has announced his retirement after a career spanning over 50 years.

Answer:","output":"The context provided does not directly mention the location of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain."},{"instruction":"Q:Information: - The Pauline epistles, Epistles of Paul, or Letters of Paul, are the 13 New Testament books which have the name Paul () as the first word, hence claiming authorship by Paul the Apostle. Among these letters are some of the earliest extant Christian documents. They provide an insight into the beliefs and controversies of early Christianity and as part of the canon of the New Testament they are foundational texts for both Christian theology and ethics. The Epistle to the Hebrews, although it does not bear his name, was traditionally considered Pauline for a thousand years, but from the 16th century onwards opinion steadily moved against Pauline authorship and few scholars now ascribe it to Paul, mostly because it does not read like any of his other epistles in style and content. Most scholars agree that Paul really wrote seven of the Pauline epistles, but that four of the epistles in Paul's name are pseudepigraphic; scholars are divided on the authenticity of two of the epistles. - Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. - A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC). - Plutarch (\\"Ploútarkhos\\", ; later named, upon becoming a Roman citizen, Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus; c. AD 46 AD 120) was a Greek biographer and essayist, known primarily for his \\"Parallel Lives\\" and \\"Moralia\\". He is classified as a Middle Platonist. Plutarch's surviving works were written in Greek, but intended for both Greek and Roman readers. - Geneva (, , , ) is the second most populous city in Switzerland (after Zürich) and is the most populous city of Romandy, the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Situated where the Rhône exits Lake Geneva, it is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva. - Stephanus pagination is a system of reference and organization used in modern editions and translations of Plato (and less famously, Plutarch) based on the 1578 edition of Plato's complete works translated by Joannes Serranus (Jean de Serres) and published by Henricus Stephanus (Henri Estienne) in Geneva. Plato's (and Plutarch's) works are divided into numbers, and each number is divided into equal sections: a, b, c, d, and e. This system is often used to reference Plato. For example, 'Symposium 172a' refers to a specific passage of Plato's \\"Symposium\\". Stephanus numbers refer to page numbers in the various volumes of Estienne's edition of 1578. No Platonic work spans more than one volume so there are no multiple occurrences of the same page number for a single work. Since Estienne published three volumes, however, the numbers need to be used in conjunction with a Platonic title to identify a unique text. For example, '172a' by itself could refer to a passage in any one of three dialogues, but \\"Symposium\\" 172a refers only to one passage. - An academy (Attic Greek: ; Koine Greek ) is an institution of secondary education, higher learning, research, or honorary membership. - The Western world or the West is a term usually referring to different nations, depending on the context, most often including at least part of Europe. There are many accepted definitions about what they all have in common. The Western world is also known as the Occident (from Latin: \\"occidens\\" \\"sunset, West\\", as contrasted with Orient). - The Second Letter of Plato , also called Epistle II or Letter II , is an epistle that tradition has ascribed to Plato , though some scholars consider it a forgery . In the Stephanus pagination , it spans III. 310b -- 315a . The Second Letter is addressed to Dionysius II of Syracuse in response to a supposed complaint he lodged against Plato and his associates that they were slandering him . The letter disclaims any responsibility for these slanders and further denies that Plato has even heard of them occurring . It then counsels Dionysius that a concern for his reputation after his death should incline him to repair his relationship with Plato , since the interactions of political men with the wise is a topic of constant discussion . From this subject , the letter turns to an enigmatic discussion of \`\` the First , '' in which Plato warns Dionysius to never write these doctrines down and to burn this letter upon committing its contents to memory . The Second Letter is the source of the oft - cited remark that \`\` no writing of Plato exists or ever will exist , but those now said to be his are those of a Socrates become beautiful and new ( ) '' . R. G. Bury argues of the Second Letter that it is \`\` fairly certain '' that it is inauthentic , based primarily upon conflicts he sees between \`\` the general tone '' and Plato 's Seventh Letter . He considers it to be by the same author as the Sixth Letter . - The New Testament (Koine Greek: , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music. - Henri Estienne (1528 or 1531 1598), also known as Henricus Stephanus, was a 16th-century French printer and classical scholar. He was the eldest son of Robert Estienne. - Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. - Classical Greece was a period of around 200 years (5th and 4th centuries BC) in Greek culture. This Classical period saw the annexation of much of modern-day Greece by the Persian Empire and its subsequent independence. Classical Greece had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire and on the foundations of western civilization. Much of modern Western politics, artistic thought (architecture, sculpture), scientific thought, theatre, literature, and philosophy derives from this period of Greek history. In the context of the art, architecture, and culture of Ancient Greece, the Classical period, sometimes called the Hellenic period, corresponds to most of the 5th and 4th centuries BC (the most common dates being the fall of the last Athenian tyrant in 510 BC and the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC). The Classical period in this sense follows the Archaic period and is in turn succeeded by the Hellenistic period. - An epistle (Greek , \\"epistol,\\" \\"letter\\") is a writing directed or sent to a person or group of people, usually an elegant and formal didactic letter. The epistle genre of letter-writing was common in ancient Egypt as part of the scribal-school writing curriculum. The letters in the New Testament from Apostles to Christians are usually referred to as epistles. Those traditionally attributed to Paul are known as Pauline epistles and the others as catholic (i.e., \\"general\\") epistles.

A model on RevolveClothing.com has found herself the subject of some serious scrutiny in the comments section — and not because of concerns over post-production editing, but, perhaps more sadly, because of her health. There are almost twenty reviews on BCBG’s leather and mesh drape dress — none of which have anything to do with the dress. Instead, they are focused almost entirely on the model’s body and they range from the unfortunately derogatory (“Gross!”) to the genuinely concerned. Says one: I’m not going to join in with the “ews” or the “disgustings!” or the “feed her!” comments, but as someone who has dealt with her own body image issues in the past (like many women have), this makes me feel incredibly uncomfortable. The model in question appears to be Allie Crandell, who is perhaps most well-known for her somewhat single season tenure on The City — Whitney Port’s New York- and fashion-based spinoff of The Hills. Worse yet, Allie’s storyline on the docu-drama featured an anorexia-focused showdown between her and the queen of PR and tough love, Kelly Cutrone. Crandell eventually left the show, telling New York Magazine she wanted to focus on “herself… and [her] career.” Crandell is certainly slim — and slimmer than what most would consider naturally possible, though let’s not forget Ann of ANTM fame — but it’s somewhat fascinating to see what a nerve her image has struck with the customers of the site, and what it is about that image in particular that really got people going. (Crandell appears on at least nine different BCBG pages, none of which have any comments along the same lines.)

The Great Migration brought rural blacks from the South; they were outnumbered by southern whites who also migrated to the city. Immigration brought southern and eastern Europeans of Catholic and Jewish faith; these new groups competed with native-born whites for jobs and housing in the booming city. Detroit was one of the major Midwest cities that was a site for the dramatic urban revival of the Ku Klux Klan beginning in 1915. \\"By the 1920s the city had become a stronghold of the KKK,\\" whose members opposed Catholic and Jewish immigrants, as well as black Americans. The Black Legion, a secret vigilante group, was active in the Detroit area in the 1930s, when one-third of its estimated 20,000 to 30,000 members in Michigan were based in the city. It was defeated after numerous prosecutions following the kidnapping and murder in 1936 of Charles Poole, a Catholic Works Progress Administration organizer. A total of 49 men of the Black Legion were convicted of numerous crimes, with many sentenced to life in prison for murder.\\" Answer: The answer is:","output":"The question asks which place was NOT a destination of the Great Migration. The context provided discusses the racial conflict and discrimination that developed in Detroit during the 20th century, and how the Great Migration brought rural blacks from the South to the city. It also mentions the influx of southern and eastern European immigrants of Catholic and Jewish faith who competed with native-born whites for jobs and housing. The presence of the Ku Klux Klan and the Black Legion, both of which opposed Catholic and Jewish immigrants as well as black Americans, further emphasizes the racial tensions in Detroit at the time. Given this context, it is clear that Detroit was a destination for the Great Migration. However, to answer this question, we need to consider other places that were and were not destinations for this migration. The Great Migration primarily refers to the movement of millions of African Americans from the rural South to the urban North during the early 20th century, particularly between 1916 and 1970. This was primarily driven by the demand for industrial labor in northern cities and the search for better social and economic opportunities. Some of the key destinations of the Great Migration were: 1. Chicago, Illinois: As one of the major industrial cities in the North, Chicago attracted large numbers of African Americans from the South, leading to a significant demographic transformation. 2. New York City, New York: Another major center of economic opportunity, New York City also saw an influx of African Americans, leading to the cultural phenomenon known as the Harlem Renaissance. 3. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Philadelphia's booming industrial sector drew migrants from the South, leading to a significant increase in the city's African American population. Given the focus on northern, industrial cities, one place that was NOT a destination of the Great Migration would be cities in the rural South, from where many African Americans were migrating. For example, regions like the Mississippi Delta, which experienced significant population decline during this period, were not destinations for the Great Migration. Instead, these rural regions were the origin points for individuals and families in search of better opportunities in the urban North."},{"instruction":"(1) He married his first wife , Helie of Semur , about 1033 , and dismissed them in 1048 .

Robert and Helie had five children : Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"While these two sentences have similarities in context, they do not mean the exact same thing because they use different verbs to describe the action Robert took towards his first wife, Helie of Semur. (1) The first sentence uses the verb \\"dismissed,\\" which means to order or allow someone to leave or to reject an idea or proposal. In this context, it suggests that Robert ended his relationship with Helie of Semur in 1048. However, this word choice does not clarify the nature of their separation or if the marriage was officially terminated. (2) The second sentence uses the verb \\"repudiated,\\" which means to refuse to accept, deny the truth or validity, or reject as having no authority or binding force. In the context of marriage, repudiation implies a more decisive action, such as an official and public rejection of the marriage itself. This suggests that in 1048, Robert publicly declared he was no longer recognizing his marriage to Helie of Semur and would no longer be bound by it, possibly due to a fault on Helie's part, religious reasons, or another valid cause. Although both sentences convey that Robert ended his marriage with Helie of Semur around the same timeframe, they differ in the specific nature of the separation.

The world’s leading experts on climate change say fracking will cut greenhouse gas emissions and should be made central to the country’s energy production. It will help the UK move away from ‘dirty’ coal and contribute to saving the environment, according to a report by the influential Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The report added that shale gas may provide electricity and heat for decades to come if scientists can safely develop a technology that traps CO2. A young protestor holds a placard at the entrance gate belonging to a site run by Cuadrilla Resources. The report says it is ‘quite clear’ that fracking is ‘very consistent with low-carbon development’ and the technology could ‘significantly’ reduce emissions. The unexpected endorsement from 235 eminent United Nations scientists and economists will be a welcome boost to David Cameron, who is a keen advocate of the new technology. It is also a blow to green activists, who seek cuts in greenhouse gas emissions but are concerned about the effects of fracking. The IPCC report, published yesterday in Berlin, says natural gas has a role to play for at least the next 35 years as a ‘bridge technology’ while the UK expands its use of wind and solar power. And it says shale may provide electricity and heat for our homes long beyond that if scientists can safely develop an emerging technology that traps carbon dioxide and stores it underground. It is also a blow to green activists, who seek cuts in greenhouse gas emissions but are concerned about the effects of fracking. The scientists say that wind, solar and hydroelectric power need to triple or even quadruple in scale over the next 35 years if global warming is to be safely controlled. But natural gas – whether drilled from conventional wells or extracted from fractured shale deep below the ground – also has a role because it emits roughly half the volume of greenhouse gases as coal. Professor Ottmar Edenhofer, co-chairman of the IPCC authors, said: ‘The shale gas revolution can be very consistent with low-carbon development – that is quite clear. It can be very helpful as a bridge technology.’ The IPCC document is the first major assessment in seven years of the options for dealing with climate change. It will inform the policy decisions of governments around the world and will also be used as a bargaining tool before next year’s UN climate conference in Paris, which aims to set legally-binding targets on every nation to reduce carbon emissions. Britain is thought to have vast reserves of shale gas trapped in rocks thousands of feet underground that can be extracted by firing water and chemicals to fracture rock. Campaigner Bianca Jagger with Vanessa Vine, Manna Mori, and Natalie Bennett leader of the Green Party England & Wales attending an anti-fracking protest in Westminster. Mr Cameron last month said he wanted shale gas wells to be up and running by the end of the year, although industry sources say commercial extraction is not likely until the end of the decade. But there have been fierce protests against the technique, with exploratory drilling near the village of Balcombe, West Sussex, abandoned last year after the site was overrun by demonstrators. The IPCC report is the third of three it has prepared on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change. The first concluded that humans are almost certainly the ‘dominant cause’ of global warming. The second warned that the drastic impacts of climate change are ‘already occurring’ across the world. Yesterday’s report said that by the end of the century global temperatures will rise to a level that will cause irreversible and dramatic damage to the planet if no action is taken. It calls for massive investment in low-carbon alternatives worldwide of around £90billion a year and says governments will need to pour subsidies in to get systems off the ground. Nuclear power could make an ‘increasing contribution to low-carbon energy supply’, the report finds, but says ‘operation risks’ such as disposing of radioactive waste mean there are a ‘variety of barriers’. Last year in Britain, coal provided 36 per cent of electricity, gas provided 27 per cent, nuclear 20 per cent, oil 1 per cent and renewable sources 15 per cent. Highlights:","output":"- Climate scientists say that shale gas could help slow global warming. - Fracking may cut greenhouse gas emissions and be a part of energy production. - Shale gas could help the UK move away from coal and save the environment. - Shale gas could provide electricity and heat for a long time if CO2 can be trapped. - Wind, solar, and hydroelectric power need to grow to help control global warming. - Shale gas emits about half the greenhouse gases as coal. - The report calls for a big investment in low-carbon alternatives."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"\\"Mi gato es muy bonito.\\" This is a Spanish sentence, and it means \\"My cat is very pretty.\\" In this sentence, \\"gato\\" means cat, \\"muy\\" means very, and \\"bonito\\" means pretty."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, You are given an open-domain question that can be answered based on factual information.

They should be given their poems a few days in advance so that they have time to practice, maybe in the presence of a teacher. Read the poem slowly. Most young people speak quickly, and a nervous reader will tend to do the same in order to get the reading over with. Reading a poem slowly is the best way to make sure that the poem will be read clearly and understood by its listeners. Learning to read a poem slowly will not always make the poem easier to hear, however. A poem should not be read too slowly, and a good way for a reader to set an easy pace is to pause for a few seconds between the title and the poem's first line.

The poems selected are mostly written in a natural style and should be read in that way. Let the words of the poem do the work. Just speak clearly and slowly.

Question: What moves horizontally? Context: Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears.

A:","output":"Jim Ryan and Rod Blagojevich are both American politicians who have held significant offices in the state of Illinois. They have several aspects in common, as well as some distinctions in their political careers. Here's a detailed comparison of their background and political history: 1. Political affiliation: Both Jim Ryan and Rod Blagojevich belong to different political parties. Jim Ryan is associated with the Republican Party, while Rod Blagojevich is a member of the Democratic Party. 2. Illinois Attorney General: Jim Ryan served as the Illinois Attorney General from 1995 to 2003. During his tenure, he focused on addressing issues such as consumer protection, internet safety, and crime prevention. In contrast, Rod Blagojevich never held this particular office. 3. Illinois Governor: Rod Blagojevich was the Governor of Illinois from 2003 until his impeachment in 2009. His term was marked by significant controversy and corruption charges, resulting in his impeachment and eventual federal prison sentence. Jim Ryan, on the other hand, ran for Governor of Illinois in 2002 but was defeated by Blagojevich in the election. 4. Legal careers: Prior to their political careers, both Jim Ryan and Rod Blagojevich practiced law. Ryan served as the State's Attorney for DuPage County, Illinois, whereas Blagojevich worked as a private attorney and as an Assistant State's Attorney in Cook County, Illinois. 5. United States House of Representatives: Rod Blagojevich represented Illinois's 5th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 1997 to 2003. Jim Ryan did not serve in the United States Congress. 6. Scandals and controversies: A notable commonality between the two politicians is that both faced significant controversies during their careers. Jim Ryan faced criticism for his handling of the Rolando Cruz and Alejandro Hernandez case, where two innocent men were wrongfully convicted of murder. In contrast, Rod Blagojevich's political career ended notably because of corruption charges and his attempt to sell the Senate seat vacated by President Barack Obama. Blagojevich was sentenced to 14 years in federal prison, although his sentence was later commuted by President Donald Trump in 2020. 7. Connection to Illinois: Both Jim Ryan and Rod Blagojevich were born in Illinois and spent the majority of their lives and careers in the state. In summary, although Jim Ryan and Rod Blagojevich have differing political affiliations and held different positions in Illinois politics, there are several aspects they share.

I guess Tashan when translated will mean style. Second, if you are hell bent on selling style, that does not spare you from having a decent story. Tashan has some story which could have sufficed with some better director. But it is not slick. For example, all three - Saif, Kareena and Akshay - are narrators at different points in the story. But this setup is not utilized to properly. There could have been a better mix and match of their narrations. Actions sequences are from the seventies. Cheoreography of the film is awful. I think Vaibhavi Merchant just sleep walked through this film. Vishal-Shekhar have put up a good score but it does not belong to this film. Why is there a sufi song (Dil Haara) in Tashan? Why is the cool Hinglish song (Dil Dance Maare) not on Anil Kapoor when he is the one who is English crazy? Akshay Kumar is the saving grace of the film. But he is in his stereotyped self.

The review primarily contains critique and dissatisfaction about various aspects of the film \\"Tashah\\". The reviewer starts by expressing the need for filmmakers to understand that just 'style' does not sell a film, suggesting that \\"Tashan\\" lacked substance beyond its visual appeal. This signifies dissatisfaction and sets up the overall negative sentiment. The review further criticizes other aspects of the movie. The reviewer cites the poor handling of the three main characters narrating the story at different points, stating it lacks a proper flow. They also point out outdated action sequences as an additional downside, implying that the film failed to meet expected standards, further solidifying the negative sentiment. They also critique the choreography and the use of music, questioning the placement of a Sufi song (Dil Haara) and a Hinglish song (Dil Dance Maare) in the film without any real connection to it. Finally, although the reviewer briefly acknowledges Akshay Kumar's work, they don't believe it was enough to save the film, and even suggesting that potential viewers won't miss out by not watching it. Essentially, the review contains more negative comments about the film than positive ones, which justifies classifying the sentiment of the review as negative."},{"instruction":"Freemantle Football Club were a football club based in the Freemantle area of Southampton, England who were active at the end of the nineteenth century.

Options: - indictment - embarrassment - penalty - go to jail - jail time","output":"To answer this question, let's first analyze each option and provide reasoning for each choice by understanding the context given in the question: 1. Indictment: An indictment is a formal legal accusation of a crime. Since James was participating in a mock trial, there wouldn't be any real legal consequence for his actions. Therefore, this option doesn't fit the context. 2. Embarrassment: As everyone laughed at James's inept lies during the mock trial, it is clear that he is experiencing some negative emotions due to this reaction. Embarrassment is a likely emotional response in such a situation. 3. Penalty: Similar to an indictment, a penalty involves receiving punishment for violating a law or rule. While there could potentially be a penalty for lying in a mock trial, such as receiving a lower grade, this choice doesn't seem to be the emotional response that the question is looking for. 4. Go to jail: The situation described occurred during a law class mock trial, which means that James won't face any real-world legal consequences such as going to jail. 5. Jail time: This option is similar to the previous one, where the context clearly states that it was a mock trial, not an actual trial. Therefore, James would not be subject to jail time.

When and why did humans evolve different skin colors? Which was first? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Available options: A). no B). yes","output":"B). yes The questions you asked are related because they both talk about why people have different skin colors. Let me explain it in a simple way: A long time ago, people lived in different parts of the world. The sun shines differently in these places, some areas have strong sunlight, and some have less sunlight. Our body needs sunlight to make something called vitamin D, which helps us grow strong and healthy. People who lived in places with strong sunlight, like in Africa, needed to protect their skin. So their bodies made more of something called melanin, which gave their skin a darker color. This darker skin helped protect them from the strong sunlight. On the other hand, people who lived in places with less sunlight, like in Europe, didn't need as much protection. So their bodies made less melanin, which made their skin lighter or white. This is why we see people with different skin colors today. It's because our ancestors lived in different parts of the world, and our bodies adapted to the sunlight in those places."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you're given a review from Amazon's food products.

FIRST THOUGHTS: BRINGS BACK OLD MEMORIES When I recently tried these little wafers I recalled when I worked in an office nearly 20 years ago. Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites. IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, \\"100 calorie packs\\" -- 4.5 inches across! WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + \\"ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS\\" & \\"ARTIFICIAL COLORS\\" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL 2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history. A:","output":"Task: Generate a rating for a food product on a scale of 1-5 based on the given review.

What are the best wiper blades at Walmart? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"The decision to replace the full windshield wiper blades or only the rubber refill depends on several factors, such as the condition of the wiper blades, the wear and tear of the rubber, and your budget. Let's take a closer look at each option. 1. Replacing the full windshield wiper blades: If the wiper blades show signs of damage, such as rust, bent or broken arms, it is best to replace the entire wiper blade assembly. Moreover, if you have not replaced your wipers in a long time or are unsure of their age, it is advisable to replace the full wiper blades as this ensures your windshield will be cleaned effectively and without any issues. Furthermore, new wiper blades usually come with the latest technology designed for optimal performance, such as improved rubber compounds and better tension on the windshield, so replacing the whole assembly can enhance the overall performance of your wipers. 2. Replacing only the rubber refill: If the wiper blades are in good condition and show no signs of damage (such as rust or bend), and only the rubber refill has deteriorated due to regular wear and tear, you can consider replacing only the rubber refill. This can be a more cost-effective option compared to replacing the entire assembly. However, it is crucial to ensure that you choose the correct rubber refill size and type compatible with your wiper blade assembly. Now, regarding the best wiper blades at Walmart, it's essential to understand that there are several brands and types available. Some of the top wiper blades available at Walmart include: 1. Rain-X Latitude Water Repellency Wiper Blades – These wiper blades come with a water-repellent coating that helps to clear the windshield better and increase visibility during rain. 2. Bosch Icon Wiper Blades – Known for their long-lasting performance and durability, Bosch Icon wiper blades feature dual rubber compounds for optimal windshield contact and reduced streaking. 3. Michelin Stealth Ultra Windshield Wiper Blades – These wiper blades have a smart hinge design that ensures even pressure distribution and a clean wipe across the entire windshield. They also feature a protective cover to prevent ice and snow buildup. 4. Anco Contour Wiper Blades – With their advanced design and one-piece construction, these wiper blades provide a streak-free and quiet operation, suitable for various vehicle types. It is important to note that you should choose wiper blades based on your vehicle's make, model, and year, as well as your climate and weather conditions. In conclusion, the questions, \\"Should I replace the full windshield wiper blades or only the rubber refill?\\" and \\"What are the best wiper blades at Walmart?\\" are not the same. The first question deals with deciding if you should replace the entire wiper blade assembly or just the rubber refill, considering their current condition and your budget. On the other hand, the second question focuses on finding the best wiper blade options available at Walmart. The answers to these questions can help you make informed decisions about maintaining your windshield wipers and improving their performance."},{"instruction":"The constitutionality of outlawing partial birth abortion is not an open question .

Understand the context: The first sentence asserts that the constitutionality of outlawing partial birth abortion is not open for debate, meaning it has been resolved or decided. The second sentence discusses defenders of the partial birth abortion ban and their reaction to legal challenges. 2. Identify the key statements: Sentence 1 is about the constitutionality of the issue, and Sentence 2 is about defenders of the ban and their attitude towards legal challenges. 3. Analyze the relationship: If the constitutionality of outlawing partial birth abortion is not an open question, it suggests that there is a legal consensus or ruling backing the ban. Knowing this, defenders of the ban would likely downplay any legal challenges they face, as they believe the matter has already been settled.

The given choices are bedsores, lay down, bed sores, sleep in, and open the curtain. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant choices - \\"bedsores\\" and \\"bed sores\\" refer to a possible negative consequence of staying in bed for an extended period but are not an action people take. - \\"open the curtain\\" might be something people do when waking up or wanting natural light in the room, but it is not necessarily related to planning to stay in bed. Step 3: Choose the most relevant action - \\"lay down\\" is the action that one needs to take before planning to stay in bed, as it is the physical act of getting into the bed. It is a necessary step in the process of staying in bed. - \\"sleep in\\" refers to the act of sleeping for a longer time than usual, but it is not the first action someone takes when planning to stay in bed. It is the result of already being in bed and choosing not to get up immediately. Justification: \\"Lay down\\" is the most reasonable answer because it corresponds to the first action people take before planning to stay in bed. It is a necessary action for staying in bed and precedes other potential actions like \\"sleep in.\\""},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the bio below and try to give details on seantavius jones 's: - highschool - number - position - height in - weight lbs - college - height ft - birth date - name - currentteam - birth place - undraftedyear Bio: seantavius jones -lrb- born august 9 , 1992 -rrb- is an american football wide receiver who currently plays for the new orleans saints in the national football league . he was signed as an undrafted free agent out of valdosta state in 2014 . he was promoted to the active roster in december .

The putrid odor filled the room. Available options: --I clamped my hand over my nose.; --I put the rubber gloves on.;","output":"The correct answer is: --I clamped my hand over my nose. Explanation: The sentence describes a strong and unpleasant smell (putrid odor) filling the room. When faced with a bad smell, people usually react by trying to cover their noses as a form of protection to avoid inhaling the unpleasant odor. So, \\"I clamped my hand over my nose\\" is the correct reaction to the situation described. The other option \\"I put the rubber gloves on\\" is incorrect because it is not directly related to the effect of a bad odor. Rubber gloves are typically used as a protective layer on hands to avoid direct contact with harmful substances or bacteria. Wearing rubber gloves does not protect against the unpleasant smell in the room."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this \\"Purchase a pre-paid phone card. Input the access and PIN number.

Packed with numerous benefits, they provide an excellent solution for making long-distance and international calls without hefty charges. If you're a first-time user or just need a refresher on using a prepaid phone card, this article has got you covered. From purchasing a card to effective tips on using them, continue reading this comprehensive guide. Purchase a Prepaid Phone Card that Suits Your Needs When it comes to prepaid phone cards, there is a myriad of options available in the market. To choose the best one for your needs, consider the following factors: 1. Call Rates: Compare the costs of different cards, especially their charges per minute for the specific countries you intend to call. Also, look at any additional or hidden fees. 2. Expiration Dates: Some cards have expiry dates, which means you need to use the card's balance within a stipulated time frame. Choose a card that provides adequate time to use up the available funds. 3. Access to Customer Support: A card with 24/7 customer support can be invaluable when you need assistance with any unforeseen issues. 4. Brand Reputation: Opt for a reputable company to minimize the risk of facing illegitimate or insecure transactions. Once you have selected the card that aligns with your requirements, make the purchase and collect the access and PIN number. Most times, these numbers are either printed on the physical card or provided via email for digital purchases. Using the Prepaid Phone Card: Access and PIN Number To start making calls using the prepaid phone card, follow these simple steps: 1. Dial the Access Number: The access number is a toll-free or local access number provided by the phone card company. Enter this number in your phone's keypad, and after the dial tone, you'll be prompted to enter the PIN number. 2. Enter the PIN Number: This is a unique identification code that confirms your card's account and allows the system to track the balance. Key in the PIN number when prompted, and wait for the system to confirm your remaining balance. 3. Make a Call: Once your balance is confirmed, you'll be prompted to dial the destination number, which should be the country code followed by the local number. For example, to call a US number, you'd dial 1 + (area code) + (phone number). If the call is successful, you'll hear the person on the other end, and the system will then start calculating your call duration based on the card's rates. Check the Fine Print Before using a prepaid phone card, it's essential to examine the fine print to spot any potential issues that may affect your calling experience: 1. Fees and Charges: Some cards may have additional fees like connection or maintenance charges. Make sure you understand and account for all extra costs before selecting a card. 2. Rounding Rules: Providers may round up the duration of your calls to the nearest minute, 3-minute, or even 6-minute increments. This information should be stated in the card's details, so always review that to avoid unexpected call deductions. 3. Refunds and Exchanges: Take note of the card's refund and exchange policy in case you need it. Conclusion Prepaid phone cards have come a long way in revolutionizing the way we communicate – especially internationally. Affordable, convenient, and easy to use, they cater to various communication needs while providing an excellent way to control your call expenses. Be sure to purchase the right card for your needs, follow the simple steps to make a call, and always study the fine print to guarantee a smooth and pleasant calling experience."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence in English and your task is to translate it into Spanish.

Answer:","output":"To determine the best units for measuring the amount of rain that fell during a thunderstorm, the ideal approach would involve the following steps: Step 1: Identify the common units used for measuring rainfall Common units for measuring rainfall include millimeters (mm), centimeters (cm), inches (in), and meters (m). These units come from the International System of Units (SI) and the Imperial System. Step 2: Consider the scale and accuracy needed for measuring rainfall Rainfall is usually measured in smaller units to allow for greater accuracy in measurement. Since rainfall amounts are generally smaller numbers (not typically measured in whole meters), using smaller units such as millimeters, centimeters, or inches makes more sense. Step 3: Evaluate the consistency with global standards Globally, rain gauges and meteorological reports utilize the metric system (SI) for measurements. Considering this widespread usage, using metric units ensures consistency and a simpler conversion between different units when comparing data across different regions and countries. Step 4: Choose the ideal unit based on the above criteria Given the need for accuracy, consistency with global standards, and the scale of rainfall, millimeters (mm) is the best unit for measuring the amount of rain that fell during a thunderstorm. Millimeters provide the appropriate level of granularity for rainfall measurements and are widely adopted in meteorological reports and systems."},{"instruction":"Definition: You are given a sentence in Portuguese.

This statement directly connects the implementation of emissions caps to the increase in unit generation costs, which in turn suggests that the hypothesis is accurate. First, it is crucial to understand the context of the premise. In this scenario, emissions caps are regulatory limits set on the amount of greenhouse gases that industries, such as power plants or manufacturing facilities, can emit. By implementing emissions caps, the aim is to reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. The emissions caps can affect businesses by either forcing them to upgrade their equipment, use cleaner fuels, or buy allowances – or carbon credits – to meet the stipulated standards. Given the premise, it can be deduced that companies have faced higher operating costs due to the implementation of emissions caps. This increase in operating costs results from new investments or changes in production processes made to comply with the restrictions on emissions. For instance, industries may have had to invest in cleaner technologies, retrofit their operations to be more eco-friendly, or purchase emissions allowances. This increase in unit generation costs ultimately contributes to higher expenditures for businesses and leads to a consequential price change in unit generations. The premise suggests that the emissions caps have played a significant role in influencing the unit generation costs, with an increase of 21% being observed. Additionally, it is important to note that the premise mentions how the increase in unit generation costs caused by emissions caps is offset only slightly by a small decrease in electricity demand. This small decrease in demand may have dampened the desired effect of the emissions caps, as it may not be sufficiently strong to encourage businesses to prioritize investing in greener technologies. In other words, the emissions caps may have caused the price change, but demand has not responded strongly enough to counterbalance the increased costs. In conclusion, the given premise provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that emissions caps have caused a price change in unit generations. The 21% increase in unit generation costs corroborates the fact that forcing industries and businesses to comply with emissions caps has led them to incur higher operating costs, leading to an increase in the price of unit generations. Although there is mention of a slight decrease in electricity demand, the effect of emissions caps on unit generation costs is the primary factor in driving the price change."},{"instruction":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: Afonso Pena International Airport, elevationAboveTheSeaLevel, 911.0; Afonso Pena International Airport, runwayLength, 1800.0; Afonso Pena International Airport, operatingOrganisation, Infraero; Afonso Pena International Airport, location, São José dos Pinhais","output":"Afonso Pena International Airport, located in São José dos Pinhais, operates under Infraero, featuring a 911-meter elevation and an 1800-meter runway length."},{"instruction":"That fall came and I went back to Michigan and the school year went by and summer came and I never really thought about it.

I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth.

Sent 3: The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. Sent 4: The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators.

This is because the word \\"undisciplined\\" generally carries a negative connotation suggesting that the director's debut lacked control or organization.

Maybe it was my marriage, maybe it was my husband. I never wanted to be “that woman“. The one that screwed around on her husband. But, I had an affair about six or seven years ago. It didn’t last long. But, that’s when I knew my marriage was over. It wasn’t a lack of sexual desire, it was a lack of desire for my husband. I didn’t want him or the marriage. There was nothing wrong with my sex drive. I told my husband that I’d had an affair. He changed for about a month or so. He was very loving and attentive. But it didn’t last. He loves differently than I need to be loved and it’s just not in him to love me that way. A few months after I ended the affair, I got involved with someone else. I know. I shouldn’t have. I’ve experienced things with this other man that I never thought possible. Felt things I thought were only possible in movies. He’s a romantic. Not flowers or candy or jewellery, but he talks and listens. He hears me. He tries to understand me and give me what I need. Deep, intimate conversations. Looking into one another’s eyes. Soft caresses. Words of adoration. These things he gives me almost daily. I never knew I needed romance because I’d never had it. This is how I need to be loved.

I've not received any from our county - have not had bad weather but I assume it will work. The user manual is very poor, the on-line help is not any better - be prepared for trial and error to learn how to use it. There is more documentation provided on how to use the AM/FM radio than there is on how to use the weather features. The AM/FM works OK too, but you can only pre-sent 3 stations for each, but that's OK since the main purpose is for the weather information.

On the positive side, they have been able to successfully receive weather channels, gotten an alert which suggests that the alert system works, and can receive AM/FM radio signals. They also seem to have a fair understanding of the primary purpose of the product and have managed to use most of its features, even in the absence of adequate instructional guidance. However, there's a note of significant dissatisfaction in the user's experience, primarily directed at the support information for the product. They express disappointment in the user manual's quality and effectiveness, as well as the online support they attempted to utilize, as neither seems to provide the necessary and well-detailed guidelines for the product's usage. This resulted in trial and error phases for them to figure out the product features, which may be frustrating. Additionally, there seems to be some uncertainty from the user about whether the product would deliver the promised alerts under different circumstances, as they have not experienced bad weather since the product acquisition. In conclusion, they have encountered some issues that could influence a direct recommendation, but they do not explicitly state their disapproval. They might recommend it with some reservations, primarily because the weather and radio features work as expected, but the poor user support and unconfirmed reliability of alerts might lead them to hesitate before making a direct recommendation.

She derives much mirth from the fact that I was born something less than nine or ten months after my parents wed and hints that this indicates a certain amount of premarital hanky-panky. Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour. Headed south, the problem became keeping your car under control so that you didn't go shooting into the trees when the road curved to the left. My parents were taking a trip to the Miramachi in December of '56 and were driving a Pontiac borrowed from one of my father's friends. My mother was pregnant with a bundle of bad attitude and misery that would turn out to be me. I assume that my father was driving with that mix of panache and insouciance that my mother tended to describe as reckless behaviour.

Answer:","output":"William Shippen, an eminent American physician, was born on October 1, 1712, in Philadelphia, Province of Pennsylvania. Renowned for his work in the field of anatomy and his contributions to medicine, Shippen played a significant role in the medical community during his time. Born to a well-established family in Philadelphia, Shippen's early years laid the foundation for his future academic accomplishments. His passion for medicine led him to pursue a career in this field, focusing on the study of anatomy. As a young man, Shippen traveled to Europe to receive a proper education, attending prestigious institutions and acquiring invaluable knowledge to bring back to the American colonies. Upon his return to Philadelphia, Shippen made a name for himself as a physician and an educator. He became a prominent figure in the community, imparting his knowledge of anatomy to aspiring young doctors through lectures and practical demonstrations. At a time when the significance of anatomy was just beginning to be realized, Shippen's teachings were groundbreaking, positioning him as an influential pioneer in the field. His dedication to medicine and education eventually led to the establishment of the first medical school in the American colonies. Shippen, along with his contemporaries, was instrumental in founding the College of Philadelphia's medical department, which later became the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine – a prestigious institution known for its commitment to medical research and education. Outside his academic achievements, Shippen was also a devoted family man. He married and had children, one of whom, William Shippen Jr., followed in his father's footsteps and made his own mark in the medical field. William Shippen Jr. played an important role during the Revolutionary War as the first Surgeon General of the Continental Army, ensuring that Shippen's contributions to medicine extended beyond his own lifetime. In his later years, Shippen continued to work and teach in the field of medicine until his death on November 4, 1801, in Germantown, Philadelphia. With a life dedicated to the advancement of medical knowledge and the betterment of his fellow citizens, William Shippen's legacy remains an essential part of American medical history."},{"instruction":"Sentence: name = The Phoenix, food = Italian, customer rating = average, area = riverside Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","output":"Yes, the content of the given sentence can be represented in a data form such as a dictionary, where key-value pairs are used to store information.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Paragraph: The story notes the price “per squat” at various spas and the cost of a do-it-yourself Internet kit. We think the story’s discussion of possible benefits is far too extensive considering the total lack of evidence to support them. We understand the need to identify some of the claims made by boosters of the therapy, but the story devotes some three paragraphs to seemingly every possible ailment the baths (or the herbs used in them) are purported to treat. It also throws in an anecdote from a woman suggesting the baths helped her to conceive at the age of 45. The caveats about chai-yok stand a good chance of getting lost in this avalanche of discussion about benefits. Aside from burns — the potential for which would seem to be obvious — we’re not sure if there are any harms associated with herbal steam baths for the vagina. The procedure seems less invasive than a douche, which is associated with potential health risks. We’ll call this not applicable. The story states that there are no studies that document the effectiveness of chai-yok for any of the conditions it is claimed to treat. It notes that while there is some biological rationale for why heat in the perineal area might be beneficial, it is impossible to say whether these steam baths do any good. The concept behind chai-yok seems vaguely reminiscent of douching, a treatment that has long been promoted as necessary for vaginal health despite a lack of supporting evidence and indications of possible harm. But while the idea may tap into some of the same psychology that makes the normal vagina seem not quite clean or healthy enough, we don’t see any evidence of overt disease-mongering in this particular story. The story quotes two doctors with expertise in gynecology and fertility. It also solicits comments from a practitioner of traditional oriental medicine. We don’t think the story had to mention alternative treatments for all the myriad problems that chai yok can supposedly help with. But since the story suggests in several places that chai yok increases fertility, we think a brief mention of other approaches that are supported by medical evidence would have been appropriate in this case. The story didn’t provide this information. The story identifies several spas in Los Angeles and New York where vaginal steam baths are offered. It notes that the treatments “are not easy to find” across the country. The story acknowledges the roots of chai-yok in Korean medicine.The approach is described as extremely avant garde in the U.S. — a characterization which is probably accurate. Given the variety of sources quoted, we can be sure the story wasn’t based on a press release. Claim: Vaginal steam bath finds a place among Southern California spa options Student:","output":"To explain the given claim \\"Vaginal steam bath finds a place among Southern California spa options,\\" we can follow these steps: 1. Firstly, the paragraph mentions several spas in Los Angeles and New York where vaginal steam baths are offered, supporting the claim about their growing presence in Southern California spa options. 2. The text acknowledges the roots of the vaginal steam bath (chai-yok) practice as originating in Korean medicine, further emphasizing the treatment's presence in Southern California's diverse wellness landscape. 3. Additionally, the paragraph describes the approach as extremely avant-garde in the U.S., which implies that vaginal steam baths are recognized as a unique and emerging spa trend within the region. 4. While providing caution regarding the lack of evidence supporting potential health benefits, the explanation could also point out that the availability of these treatments in spas indicates a demand and market for them in Southern California. In conclusion, the paragraph supports the claim by mentioning the presence of vaginal steam baths in spas located in Los Angeles and New York, along with the treatment's roots in Korean medicine and its avant-garde status in the U.S., thus highlighting the growing trend of this therapy in Southern California spa options."},{"instruction":"Denny asked: Given the sentence \\"Man waterskiing in the blue ocean.\\" is it true that \\"A man is waterskiing.\\"?.

The second American Basketball Association All-Star Game was played on January 28, 1969 at Louisville Convention Center, now Louisville Gardens, a multi-purpose, 6,000-seat arena, in Louisville, Kentucky, that opened in 1905, as what? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Second American Basketball Association (ABA) All-Star Game, held on January 28, 1969, took place at the esteemed Louisville Convention Center, now known as the Louisville Gardens. This historic event transpired within the confines of a multipurpose, 6,000-seat arena nestled in the heart of Louisville, Kentucky. The venue's rich history harks back to its establishment in 1905, marking it as a prominent destination for various forms of entertainment and athletic events throughout the years. Initially, the Louisville Convention Center opened its doors as the Jefferson County Armory, a building primarily designed to serve as a military installation for local troops and storage for munitions. In its early days, the armory played host to a range of public events, including political rallies and concerts, in addition to its duties as a military hub. Given the diversity of activities held within its walls, the Jefferson County Armory set the stage for the community-oriented transformation of the Louisville Convention Center and Louisville Gardens in the years to come. As time went on, the building gained popularity and evolved into a thriving commercial space. By the 1950s, it shed its military moniker and rebranded as the Louisville Convention Center. Through its metamorphosis, the venue expanded its range of events, becoming increasingly known for hosting a variety of sports competitions, including basketball, boxing, wrestling, and more. Furthermore, it accommodated conventions, trade shows, and even concerts, hosting well-known artists such as Elvis Presley and The Beatles. In the instance of the Second ABA All-Star Game, the event boasted a thrilling lineup of basketball players who showcased their skills and talents on the court. This marked a significant milestone in the venue's history, as it demonstrated the Louisville Convention Center's growth as a versatile and notable location for different types of events, including top-tier professional sporting engagements.

R.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by drummer Bill Berry, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist/backing vocalist Mike Mills, and lead vocalist Michael Stipe. One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality and obscure lyrics, Mills' melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical style of drumming. R.E.M. released its first single—\\"Radio Free Europe\\"—in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \\"The One I Love\\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide. By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors.

His father, Lindberg Styles Mescudi, was a house painter, substitute teacher and World War II Air Force veteran. In a January 2013 interview, Cudi revealed that he had stopped smoking marijuana two years earlier, both for the sake of his child and due to frustration with constantly being associated with the drug and stoner culture.

His uncle","output":"Title: The Price of Passage Genre: Drama, Mystery, Family Plot: Act 1 In the bustling streets of Hong Kong, Hong, a hardworking young man, dreams of seeking a better life in the United States. Determined to provide for his single mother Jiang and the rest of his family, Hong vigorously works multiple jobs to save up for his ticket to America. Unfortunately, the mountains of loans and obligations of the family make it impossible to save enough money for his dream. Thoughts about leaving his hometown behind and starting fresh in the United States, Hong is unexpectedly approached by his estranged, wealthy uncle Edward, who appears outside their doorstep one evening. Edward offers to pay for Hong's passage to the States to begin a new life and even hints at a well-paying job waiting for him there. Suspicious about his uncle's sudden kindness and generosity, Hong hesitates but ultimately takes up the offer to help his mother and younger siblings escape their life of poverty. Act 2 Hong arrives in San Francisco, where he witnesses the new culture, the opportunities, and the challenges that await him. He starts working for his uncle's import and export business in Chinatown, which becomes a vital source for Chinese immigrants and businesses in the city. As Hong delves deeper into the family business, he slowly uncovers the hidden truth that the company is a front for an extensive international smuggling ring. Although disturbed by the discovery, Hong justifies his participation in these criminal activities for the sake of his family's well-being. Back in Hong Kong, Hong's mother Jiang receives regular payments from her son and is grateful for the help. The monetary support starts changing their lives for the better as they can now afford basics and even occasional luxuries. In contrast, Hong's heart grows increasingly heavy with guilt as his new life path digs him deeper into the world of crime. Act 3 One day, an FBI raid at the warehouse where Hong works results in the arrest of key players in Edward's smuggling operation, causing the whole operation to crumble like a house of cards. Fortunately, Hong escapes the scene barely unseen, but he is now on the run. An unexpected call from his mother reveals that his family has been receiving threats and demands to repay Edward's initial generosity they were unaware of, forcing Hong to face the true cost of the passage his uncle provided. Hong determines he will do everything he needs to protect his family from the dangerous ramifications of his uncle's business. Act 4 In a series of daring and decisive moves, Hong risks everything to dismantle his uncle Edward's entire criminal empire. As the plot unravels, it is revealed that Edward had been blackmailing his brother, Hong's father, which ultimately led him to disappear, leaving the family behind in Hong Kong. Fuelled by the heartfelt need to set things right for his family and his missing father's sake, Hong manages to gather enough evidence on his uncle's illicit activities to submit it to the authorities discreetly. This results in Edward's arrest and ultimately the dismantling of the entire operation. Act 5 Despite the immense challenges he faced, Hong manages to find his father, who had fled and gone into hiding out of fear. Hong reunites his family, who agrees to start a new chapter in their lives together in the United States. However, the events of the past weigh heavy on Hong, and he has to reconcile with the fact that he traded one set of problems for another. Hong uses his newfound knowledge of import-export and the money he saved to start a legitimate business that promotes fair trade and provides ethical goods to Chinese immigrants and locals alike. He takes pride in creating a business that enables him and his family to live honorable, fulfilling lives while also helping others. The movie ends with Hong's realization that the price of passage is not only what you pay but also the values you compromise or uphold on the journey."},{"instruction":"I was looking for a new dry cleaner so I gave Polo Cleaners a shot based on the positive reviews.

Cough loudly or make a loud noise. Walk as you fart. Leave the room or area. Spray air freshener.\\" Article:","output":"Title: The Art of Discreetly Farting in Public Spaces Introduction: A Social Dilemma Farting, passing gas, or breaking wind, although a completely natural biological process, has always been a topic surrounded by social stigma in public settings. While most of us can control the urge to pass gas in private, there are certain situations where the need arises in a less-than-convenient social gathering. In such cases, we must rely on multiple techniques to ensure that we can navigate through these situations, saving ourselves from embarrassment and the potential discomfort of others. In this article, we will outline the art of discreetly farting in public spaces by releasing the gas slowly, masking the noise, walking while farting, exiting the area promptly, and using an air freshener to neutralize any lingering odors. Step 1: Release the Fart Slowly One of the key factors in successfully passing gas without drawing attention is controlling the release of the gas itself. Sounds produced while farting are a result of gases being released quickly and under pressure. To minimize any potential noise, attempt to spread the release of gas over a longer period. This technique involves gently and gradually relaxing your muscles to allow the gas to escape at a slower rate. By doing this, you significantly reduce the chances of any loud or noticeable sounds, thus ensuring your gas remains undetected. Step 2: Cough Loudly or Make a Loud Noise If you're unable to control the release of the gas or if you anticipate it causing an audible sound, it's essential to have a backup plan. Timing a cough or creating a distracting noise during the release can be an effective way to mask any gas-related sounds that might occur. If you're with a group and conversation is ongoing, you can also choose to speak louder during the delicate moment. Keep an eye on your surroundings and consider your environment when selecting the most suitable noise to produce. Step 3: Walk as You Fart Another technique for maintaining discretion while farting in public spaces is to walk as you pass gas. The act of walking helps to dissipate the gases more effectively than when you release them while stationary. Additionally, walking aids in minimizing any potential sounds due to the movement of your body and your clothing. Ensure that your walk looks natural, to avoid arousing suspicion. Step 4: Leave the Room or Area If you have the opportunity to do so, moving away from the area where you passed gas is a good practice. This is particularly useful if the gas has an unpleasant odor and you want to create some distance between yourself and the source. By leaving the \\"scene of the crime,\\" you also provide a chance for the smell to dissipate. Moreover, if questioned, you can always feign innocent surprise at the smell, yourself. Step 5: Spray Air Freshener In situations where you have access to an air freshener or deodorizing spray, using it after discreetly passing gas offers an extra layer of protection against residual smell. Make sure to use the freshener in a subtle manner and do not overuse it, as this may arouse suspicion. A brief spritz should be enough to neutralize any lingering odors without drawing unnecessary attention. Conclusion Each passing gas scenario is unique, and learning to adapt to different social circumstances is paramount. By following these five steps in the art of discreetly farting in public spaces, you will ensure that no unnecessary attention is drawn to your normal but often unwelcome bodily function. Most importantly, remember that everyone passes gas, and as much as it's crucial to maintain social etiquette, understanding and empathy towards those who end up falling victim to accidental or involuntary flatulence will create a more accepting and forgiving environment for all."},{"instruction":"Tobeginyourfreefileanalysis,simplydrag-and-dropyour030fileinsidethedottedlinesbelow,orclick\\"BrowseMyComputer\\"andselectyourfile.

By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) What is most likely the author's occupation?

Sentence 2: The church has been renovated a number of times but not the floor. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Options are: A. yes. B. it is not possible to tell. C. no.","output":"Step 1: Analyze Sentence 1. Sentence 1 states that glass plates in the church floor allow you to see fragments of the Byzantine floor mosaics left from the floor of an earlier church. This implies that some element of the floor from an earlier church (Byzantine floor mosaics) is still present. Step 2: Analyze Sentence 2. Sentence 2 states that the church has been renovated a number of times but not the floor. This implies that the overall structure of the church may have been updated, but the original floor is still intact. Step 3: Compare both sentences. By comparing both sentences, we can deduce that if Sentence 1 is true, meaning the Byzantine floor mosaics are still left from the floor of an earlier church, then it can be inferred that the floor has not been completely renovated. Step 4: Choose the appropriate answer based on the analysis. Given the analysis, if Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 is also true.

Article: Trying to recover from a devastating economic crisis, Spain is considering moving the country's clock back by one hour. Many people regard long afternoon naps and late dinners as perfect aspects of the Spanish way of life. Until the 1940s, Spain was on the same time as Britain and Portugal. In World War II, Spain and Portugal moved the clocks forward to align them with Nazi Germany. The same happened in Portugal. After the defeat of Hitler, Portugal returned to Greenwich Mean Time, but Spain did not. \\"The fact that for more than 71 years Spain has not been in its proper time zone means we sleep almost an hour less than the World Health Organization recommends,\\" lawmakers in the Spanish Parliament wrote in a proposal.\\"This has a negative effect on productivity, absenteeism, stress, accidents and school drop-out rates.\\" Last September, a parliamentary commission recommended that the government turn back the clocks by one hour and introduce a regular eight-hour workday. For the time being, the Spanish government is treating the campaign seriously but it hasn't taken any action yet. Spain's time zone issue explains why everything in Spain happens later, from meal times to broadcast entertainment (primetime doesn't start until 10 pm). Many urban Spaniards complain of a never-ending workday that begins in the morning but is interrupted by a traditional late-morning break and then again by the midday siesta--a two-hour long lunch and nap that usually start at 2 pm. If workers return to their desks at 4 pm, they end up working late into the evening. Under the proposed new schedule, the lunchtime break would be cut to an hour or less. The interruption-filled Spanish workday would be replaced by something closer to a 9-to-5 schedule. Ignacio Buqueras, president of the Association for the Rationalization of Spanish Working Hours, told The New York Times that changing the Spanish schedule would be good news for working mothers. It would also allow families more free time together and boost Spain's economic...

Abdurakhmon Uzbeki, who was believed to be from Uzbekistan, is said by the Americans to be a close associate of the IS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The US says he played a key role in an attack on a night club in Istanbul on New Year's Eve which killed 39 people. Turkish police arrested Abdulkadir Masharipov, the main suspect in the attack, on 17 January after a huge manhunt. \\"It was a ground operation. I think that's all we're willing to say about that,\\" US Central Command spokesman John Thomas said in Washington in relation to Friday's attack. For the most part, the US has used unmanned drone strikes with Hellfire missiles to kill what they term \\"high value individuals\\", often targeting them in vehicles to minimise the possibility of collateral civilian deaths. But while using troops on the ground to target IS leaders is unusual, it is not unheard of. In 2015, US special forces troops killed Abu Sayyaf in Syria not far from the site of this recent operation. Abu Sayyaf was described as chief financial officer for IS and his wife was captured and interrogated. Another such raid took place in January of this year in which US forces hoped to capture an individual for interrogation, but he was killed in a shootout. Using ground troops is of course more risky than flying drones. But it can often bring greater rewards as special forces can capture computers and other sources of intelligence which would otherwise be vaporised by a Hellfire missile. At any one time there are around 500 members of US special forces in Syria, mainly advising and assisting Kurdish and Arab groups fighting IS. An \\"expeditionary targeting force\\" has operated inside Iraq and Syria to target senior IS and al-Qaeda leaders since late 2015, ABC reported, but usually details of their operations on the ground are not disclosed. Mr Thomas was quoted by ABC as saying that the US has \\"a pretty good record of finding these folks and killing them\\". Reina at the time of the attack was one of Istanbul's best-known clubs, with a view across the Bosphorus towards Asia and attracting singers, actors, sports stars and tourists. Uzbek national Abdulkadir Masharipov is believed to have mounted the assault on the club, rushing through the entrance with a long-barrelled gun and firing randomly at people celebrating the new year. Citizens of Israel, France, Tunisia, Lebanon, India, Belgium, Jordan and Saudi Arabia were among the victims, and dozens of people were injured. IS said it orchestrated the attack, saying it was revenge for Turkish military involvement in Syria. Police arrested Masharipov more than two weeks after the attack, when he was found along with his four year-old son at the home of a Kyrgyz friend in Istanbul. What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses an attack that took place near the town of Mayadin in eastern Syria, in which the U.S. forces conducted a ground operation to target Abdurakhmon Uzbeki, a close associate of the IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Grape farm had depleted soils and a low crop production, while Fruit farm, having parcels with depleted soils in the past, established an agroforestry system starting a decade ago which helped stabilize soil and increase production. and a hint : Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: Please answer this question : Which farm didn't obtain cleaner water as a result of their farming methods? A:","output":"The farm that didn't obtain cleaner water as a result of their farming methods is Grape farm. Grape farm had depleted soils and low crop production, which suggests a lack of proper soil management practices like the use of groundcover plants or the establishment of an agroforestry system. Such systems, as seen in the case of Fruit farm, help to stabilize the soil, improve soil cover, and reduce soil erosion, which in turn leads to cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff. Agroforestry systems incorporate trees, shrubs, or other perennial vegetation with crops and/or livestock on the same land. This combination promotes biodiversity, enhances nutrient cycling, and improves soil structure, leading to increased productivity and more sustainable farming practices. Fruit farm, which started an agroforestry system a decade ago, has seen the benefits of this approach, including stabilizing the soil, increased crop production, and cleaner water. In contrast, the farming methods employed by Grape farm do not seem to be protecting the soil from erosion or improving nutrient uptake. The lack of groundcover plants in their farming system can lead to increased soil erosion, as groundcover plants help secure the soil surface, preventing it from being easily washed away by water or wind. Further, the use of short-cycle cropping systems may not provide enough soil cover, making the soil more prone to erosion. Additionally, row-cropped fields, as might be found in Grape farm, can have lower nutrient uptake than fields with agroforestry systems, leading to a higher nutrient loss into streams. This not only affects overall crop production and soil fertility but also can contaminate water sources and negatively impact the ecosystem. In conclusion, Grape farm did not obtain cleaner water as a result of their farming methods, unlike Fruit farm, which adopted an agroforestry system and effectively prevented soil erosion while enhancing nutrient uptake and reducing runoff. Such sustainable farming practices improve soil health, increase crop yields, and provide cleaner water for both the agricultural system and the surrounding environment."},{"instruction":"Definition: You are provided with an \\"Event\\" and it's \\"Intent\\" related to PersonX.

Since 1971, MFS has sent trained doctors all over the world to help people who have suffered from disasters, such as wars and illnesses. Chris is a doctor from France who has traveled to many places to organize programs that help people. At the moment, over 27,000 trained doctors have taken part in MSF projects. The organization received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999. All kinds of doctors can volunteer for MSF. They need to be ready to go almost anywhere in the world and, of course, they should face difficulties. Most of MSF's work is in Africa. When MSF chooses a doctor for a task, they have to go for at least six months. When doctors have completed a few tasks, they might be sent on an emergency task following a disaster, such as an earthquake. But why would doctors leave a comfortable life and a good pay to join MSF? According to Chris, the experience they have is a great help in their life. What's more, just like the explorers of the past, they need to keep an open mind and learn to get on well with the people they meet. One thing that they can say at the end of any task is that they have made a real difference to people's lives. Question: What is the main idea of this passage?

Team A studied East Antarctica, while team B studied West Antarctica. They published their findings in a peer reviewed publication. But I can use this background: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Product review: I havent had these earphones 2 days, and already experiencing a shortage in the headphones. Sound quality is all aroung terrible. KEEP YOUR MONEY!!!! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer is:","output":"The review provided clearly depicts the product in an unflattering light. Based on the customer's experience, there are several factors that contribute to this negative perception of the product. Firstly, the reviewer mentioned that they haven't had the earphones for more than two days, and they're already experiencing a shortage in the headphones. This indicates that the product may have some manufacturing or design flaws that lead to a short lifespan, which is a highly undesirable attribute for any electronic device. Customers usually expect their investment in a product to last for a reasonable amount of time, and this issue certainly does not meet that expectation and reflects poorly on the product's reliability and durability. Secondly, the reviewer pointed out that the sound quality of the earphones is \\"all around terrible.\\" Sound quality is one of the most critical factors when it comes to purchasing headphones, and if these earphones fail to deliver in that aspect, it is a significant drawback. The reviewer's dissatisfaction in this area suggests that the product may not meet the needs of audiophiles or even those looking for decent sound quality in their earphones. Finally, the review ends with a strong warning to potential buyers: \\"KEEP YOUR MONEY!!!!\\" This statement suggests that the reviewer considers not only the product's flaws to be deal-breakers but also advises other consumers to avoid purchasing the product entirely. When a reviewer feels so strongly about their negative experience that they actively discourage others from buying the item, it is a prominent indicator that the product is portrayed in an unflattering light. In conclusion, based on the provided product review, the earphones are depicted in a significantly unflattering light. The customer's negative experience with the product's short lifespan, poor sound quality, and overall dissatisfaction with their purchase contribute to this perception. By advising others not to invest their money in this product, the review serves as a warning for potential consumers and reinforces the unflattering portrayal of the earphones."},{"instruction":"In these two sentences (1) The wire has an extension of 50 feet. (2) Extension of the program to all in need., does the word extension mean the same thing?","output":"In the two sentences provided, the word \\"extension\\" is used to convey different meanings based on the context of each sentence. Let's examine the meanings more closely. 1. The wire has an extension of 50 feet. In this sentence, \\"extension\\" refers to the length or the physical measurement of the wire. It signifies that the wire can extend or stretch up to 50 feet, implying its capability to cover a specific distance or connect two points within that range. In this context, \\"extension\\" carries a physical or spatial meaning. 2. Extension of the program to all in need. In this sentence, \\"extension\\" conveys a more abstract concept. It refers to the expansion or broadening of a program in order to be more inclusive, accessible, or beneficial to a larger group of people – specifically, those in need. This could mean the program is made available across a larger geographical area, provided to a wider demographic, or modified to accommodate diverse needs. Essentially, \\"extension\\" encompasses the idea of growth or augmentation in terms of scope and reach of the program, and does not have a physical aspect in this context. In summary, although the word \\"extension\\" is used in both sentences, it conveys different meanings based on the specific context. In the first sentence, it denotes a physical measurement of a wire, while in the second sentence, it represents the expansion or broadening of a program to serve a more significant portion of a target audience.

How to remove oil stains from concrete driveway and garage The tried and true approach. Kitty litter does a great job for both cats and concrete because it's highly absorbent. Go for the cheapest.","output":"The most logical next event after identifying the need to remove oil stains from a concrete driveway and garage and acknowledging the effectiveness of using kitty litter is to explain the step-by-step process of using this method to effectively get rid of the stains. Here is a detailed explanation of the tried and true approach to remove oil stains from concrete with kitty litter: 1. Gather necessary materials: Purchase the cheapest non-clumping cat litter available since it can effectively absorb oil without any added expense. You will also need a stiff-bristled brush or broom, a trash bag or container for the used kitty litter, a dustpan, and an optional power washer or garden hose with a high-pressure nozzle. 2. Assess the stain: Inspect the oil stain to determine its age and severity. Fresh stains are easier to address, while older or larger stains may require additional effort and treatments. 3. Apply the kitty litter: Generously cover the entire oil stain with a layer of kitty litter, making sure it is thick enough to absorb the oil. If the stain is already dry, dampen it slightly with water before applying the kitty litter. 4. Allow time to absorb: Let the kitty litter sit on the stain for a minimum of one hour or, ideally, overnight. This should give it ample time to soak up the oil from the concrete. 5. Crush the kitty litter: Use your feet, a brick, or another heavy object to crush and grind the kitty litter into the stain. Crushing the kitty litter helps release its absorbent properties and assists in breaking down the oil stain. 6. Sweep up the kitty litter: Use the stiff-bristled brush or broom to sweep up the spent kitty litter, making sure to gather any leftover debris. Place the used kitty litter into a trash bag or container, and use a dustpan to help collect any excess. 7. Rinse the area: Depending on the severity of the stain, you may need to proceed with additional cleaning methods. For a more thorough cleaning, use a power washer or a garden hose with a high-pressure nozzle to rinse the area where the stain was. This helps to remove any remaining residue and minimize the presence of the stain. 8. Evaluate and repeat if necessary: Inspect the area to determine if the oil stain has been adequately removed. If the stain is still visible, you may need to repeat the process or try alternative methods, such as using a commercial concrete cleaner or a poultice made from absorbent materials and a cleaning agent, to fully eliminate the stain. In conclusion, using kitty litter to remove oil stains from concrete driveways and garages is a cost-effective and practical approach to addressing this common issue. By following these detailed steps, you can help preserve the appearance and integrity of your concrete surfaces and remove unsightly oil stains effectively."},{"instruction":"Early Word: Final Stretch It’s Christmas week in Washington, and health care reform remains the big game in town. (Besides the Redskins and snow shoveling, of course.) As it stands, Senate Democrats’ quest to pass their legislation overhauling the health care system seems within reach — two votes are scheduled for Tuesday, following Monday’s early morning vote to limit debate. (The final vote could come late on Christmas Eve.) But as The Times’s Robert Pear and David Herszenhorn report, the thorny issue of abortion could prove to be another hurdle for leaders in both the House and the Senate. House members on both sides of the abortion issue have criticized compromise language inserted into the Senate bill, as have other groups of abortion rights supporters (Planned Parenthood) and opponents (Catholic bishops). With Democrats collecting the bare minimum of votes needed to limit debate on Monday, Mr. Pear and Mr. Herszenhorn write that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and the Obama administration “will have to find a way forward on abortion even as they confront other big differences between the House and Senate bills, including how to pay to expand insurance coverage to more than 30 million Americans and whether to include a government-run plan to compete with private insurers.” Speaking of the public option, Politico’s Carrie Budoff Brown and Patrick O’Connor report that progressives who have been pushing for a government-run insurance plan say the proposal will be revisited. For his part, however, President Obama asserted on Monday that the public option was not the most important aspect of Democrats’ reform efforts. The Washington Post’s Philip Rucker, meanwhile, takes a look at the senators and staff members stuck in Washington and jumping through hoops to make holiday plans, including buying presents in congressional gift shops and booking multiple flights home. (According to Mr. Rucker, the last time the Senate held a Christmas Eve session was 1963, barely a month after the assassination of John F. Kennedy.) As for the other games in town, the Redskins were routed by the Giants on Monday Night Football, while streets in the nation’s capital continue to thaw. Cybersecurity Chief: The Times’s John Markoff reports that Mr. Obama will tap Howard A. Schmidt, a veteran of the technology industry, as the administration’s cybersecurity chief. According to Mr. Markoff, the choice is seen as a compromise after “a behind-the-scenes dispute over whether strict new regulations are necessary to protect the network that increasingly weaves together the vast majority of the world’s computers.” First Family Daybook: Michelle Obama is scheduled to stop in at the Children’s National Medical Center in Washington on Tuesday, where she is expected to meet with (and read to) children at the hospital. The president will discuss the economy with the heads of small banks at the White House on Tuesday morning, then he holds an afternoon meeting with the National Economic Council. Defense Earmarks: According to The Wall Street Journal’s John D. McKinnon and Brody Mullins, the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense has crunched the numbers and found 4 billion in earmarks in the recently approved spending measure to finance the Pentagon. That total, which represents a 14 percent drop from last year’s bill, included almost 19 million for the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the Senate and 20 million for a World War II museum in New Orleans. Giuliani’s Out: The Times’s David Halbfinger reports that Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, will not challenge Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand in 2010, despite recent polling showing him ahead of the incumbent. This Democrat’s Back for More: In the wake of a rash of retirements, a veteran House Democrat on Monday gave his party some good news for a change. Representative John Spratt, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said he would seek a 15th term in his South Carolina district, which gave Republican John McCain 53 percent of the vote in the 2008 presidential election. Post-Partisan? A few days ago, The Times’s Carl Hulse and David Herszenhorn examined the partisan standoffs that have become more and more common in the Senate of late. The Times’s Adam Liptak now takes a look at another possible sign of increased polarization in Washington — Supreme Court clerks are now more likely to hold positions in line with the ideology of the justices they worked for, a phenomenon that only seems about two decades or so old. Presidential Report Card: A couple of days into the president’s twelfth month in office, the New America Foundation will hold a discussion on Mr. Obama’s first year in office on Tuesday. Participants include Richard N. Perle, chairman of the Defense Policy Board during former President George W. Bush’s administration, and Walter Russell Mead of the Council on Foreign Relations.

The Taunton Iron Works operated for over 200 years until 1876. It was the first of many iron industries in Taunton. During the 19th century, Taunton became known as the \\"Silver City\\", as it was home to many silversmithing operations, including Reed & Barton, F.B. Rogers, and Poole Silver. In the 19th century, Taunton was also the center of an important iron-making industry, utilizing much bog iron from the numerous swamps in the surrounding area. The iron industry in Taunton produced a variety of goods including stoves , tacks and machinery. One of the more successful companies during this period was the Mason Machine Works, founded by William Mason, which produced machinery for the textile industry, as well as steam locomotives. The Taunton Locomotive Works also operated in the city during this time. Taunton was also home to several textile mills and other industries, such as felt and brick making. During the 19th century, Taunton was a major shipping point for grain from the inland rural farm areas of Massachusetts to the rest of the nation via Weir Village and the Taunton River. With the advent of the railroad, Taunton would also become an important transportation hub due to its central location. The city formed the Taunton Municipal Light Plant in 1897, when it decided to purchase the floundering Taunton Electric Lighting Company, making it a publicly owned electric utility.

Therefore, it cannot be the answer. 2. A military base is a location or facility where military personnel operate, but playing the bugle is not a primary role there. Though bugles could be used in ceremonies or events on a military base, it's not the primary focus. 3. A military band is a group of musicians who play music, typically for official military events and ceremonies. Bugles have a long history with the military and have been used for communication as well as ceremonial purposes. In a military band, the bugle often plays an important role in their performances. 4. The American Army also uses bugles, but since we have an option specifically for a military band, it would be a better choice as the role of bugle is focused more on the musical aspect in a band rather than the entire army. 5. A music store sells musical instruments and related items, but playing the bugle is not a major role in a store setting. Considering the above reasoning, the military band would be the group where playing the bugle has a big role due to the historical context, ceremonial purposes, and it being a group of musicians focused on musical performances."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you are given a sentence in the Hindi language and a corresponding English translation of the Hindi sentence.

He reasoned that taking the stairs would be a quicker option, given that the elevator could have potential stops at other floors, and there might be a delay in waiting for it to arrive at his floor. Step 1: Assess the situation He first assessed the situation, observing the busy state of the establishment. Since the building had several floors and many occupants or visitors, it was likely that the elevator would be in frequent use. Step 2: Evaluate the alternatives Considering the alternatives, the man evaluated the pros and cons of taking the elevator or the stairwell. He realized that while the elevator was convenient, it could potentially be crowded and slow due to the high volume of individuals using it. Step 3: Choose the best option Based on his evaluation, the man concluded that the stairwell provided him with a faster and less-crowded way to reach the third floor. He found the stairwell to be clear, meaning it was free of people and obstacles, enabling him to traverse it swiftly. Step 4: Execute the decision Having made his decision, the man proceeded to take the stairwell to reach the third floor. He moved with determination, as he wanted to save time and avoid possible congestion and delays that could occur in the elevator. Step 5: Reflect on the outcome Once the man reached the third floor, he felt a sense of satisfaction in his choice. By taking the stairwell, he managed to avoid waiting for the elevator and any potential stops it would make on other floors. In addition, he experienced the added benefit of some light physical activity, which contributed to his overall health and well-being.

They occupied the island of Lefkada , which the Venetians had taken in 1684, and the fort of Butrinto opposite the city of Corfu. On 8 July 1716, an Ottoman army of 33,000 men landed on Corfu, the most important of the Ionian islands. Despite an indecisive naval battle on the same day, the Ottoman land army continued its disembarkment and advanced towards the city of Corfu. On 19 July, after capturing the outlying forts of Mantouki, Garitsa, Avrami and of the Saviour, the siege began. The defence was led by Count Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg, who had roughly 8,000 men at his command. The extensive fortifications and the determination of the defenders withstood several assaults. After a great storm on 9 August—which the defenders attributed to the intervention of Corfu's patron saint, Saint Spyridon—caused significant casualties among the besiegers, the siege was broken off on 11 August and the last Ottoman forces withdrew on 20 August.

Given these facts, what allows one to sense and maintain body position among the following options: - kinetic functions - proprioceptive functions - fencing response - magic functions - Riding a bike - that material's properties - by keeping them warm - sensory neurons","output":"Among the given options, it is proprioceptive functions that allow one to sense and maintain body position. Proprioception is the body's ability to sense its position, movement, and action in space. This function plays a vital role in maintaining balance, coordinating movements, and ensuring overall bodily awareness and safety. Let's dive deeper into what proprioceptive functions entail and how the other options may or may not contribute towards sensing and maintaining body position. 1. Kinetic functions: Although kinetic functions refer to the movement of an object or a body, they are not solely responsible for sensing and maintaining body position. These functions are, however, interconnected with proprioceptive functions, as in successfully carrying out movement; the body needs to be aware of its position and surroundings. 2. Fencing response: The fencing response is a reflex seen in a person who experiences a concussion or traumatic brain injury. It involves the extension of one arm and flexion of the other after a head impact. While this reflex does indicate that the body can sense its position even in an unconscious state, it doesn't specifically relate to maintaining body position during typical movements and daily activities. 3. Magic functions: Magic functions are a fictional concept and do not contribute to our ability to sense and maintain body position. 4. Riding a bike: Riding a bike requires a combination of proprioception, balance, and kinetic functions to coordinate body movements effectively. While riding a bike is an activity that can help enhance our proprioceptive abilities, it is not the sole means of sensing and maintaining body position. 5. That material's properties: Material properties refer to the traits or characteristics of materials or objects, and these properties do not directly contribute to our ability to sense and maintain body position. 6. By keeping them warm: Maintaining a comfortable body temperature may promote overall physiological function, but it isn't directly responsible for the ability to sense and maintain body position. 7. Sensory neurons: Sensory neurons play a vital role in proprioception. They collect information from receptors located in the muscles, tendons, and joints. This information is then transmitted to the central nervous system, which interprets the data and furthers the ability to sense body position. So, while sensory neurons are a critical component of proprioceptive functions, they are not the sole contributor to maintaining and sensing body position. In summary, proprioceptive functions are the primary means by which we sense and maintain body position. The other options provided may have indirect or minimal influence on proprioception but are not solely responsible for the ability to maintain balance and body position."},{"instruction":"Because that is HER kitty .

So, the right answer is: (ii) It's impossible to say"},{"instruction":"Process: - Ice forms inside a cloud - Ice inside the cloud bumps around and causes electrostatic charges - The cloud becomes a thundercloud - Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge - Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud - This positive energy gathers on the ground - The positive energy connects with the negative energy and forms lightning. Question: suppose there is more ice that inside the clouds happens, how will it affect LESS or LESS POWERFUL lightning. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: Less To understand this answer in detail, we can break down the entire process and analyze the impact of having more ice inside the clouds on the formation and intensity of lightning. 1. Ice forms inside a cloud: When there is more ice inside the clouds, a higher number of collisions among ice particles and other cloud components can be expected. These collisions generate electrostatic charges necessary for the formation of lightning. 2. Ice inside the cloud bumps around and causes electrostatic charges: As the number of ice particles increases, more collisions will take place, causing more accumulation of electrostatic charges. 3. The cloud becomes a thundercloud: With more ice and more electrostatic charges, the cloud is more likely to transform into a thundercloud. 4. Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge: As more ice leads to more electrostatic charges, there will be a stronger negative charge developed in the cloud. 5. Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud: With a stronger negative charge in the-cloud, the positive energy on the ground will experience a stronger attraction to the negative energy in the cloud. 6. This positive energy gathers on the ground: As the attraction between the positive and negative energy becomes more intense due to the stronger negative charge in the cloud, the positive energy will gather more on the ground. 7. The positive energy connects with the negative energy and forms lightning: The stronger attraction between the positive and negative energies would make it easier for them to connect, leading to the formation of lightning. However, the overall impact of more ice in the clouds on lightning intensity depends on the distribution of the ice and air within the cloud. Lightning occurs when areas of different electrical charges (positive and negative) in the cloud and on the ground interact. The interaction is facilitated by ions created in the atmosphere due to dust, ice, and air molecules. When there is more ice inside the cloud, the medium for interaction becomes denser and more prone to electrostatic discharge. This can obstruct electrons from moving freely, thereby reducing the power of the lightning. With more ice, the available paths for the free movement of electrons are reduced, leading to a lesser chances of intense electromagnetic discharge. In essence, the increased ice in the cloud inhibits the full potential of lightning discharge. So, when there is more ice inside the clouds, it can lead to less powerful lightning."},{"instruction":"Let’s rewind to January 2013 for a moment. It’s a sunny and warm day in Los Angeles—a bit of a weather shock to me after 11 years of Seattle’s cold and rain. I’ve been officially on the job in the web department for all of 12 hours. I’m sitting in a conference room at a big wooden table, surrounded by my new coworkers and team members in the Getty’s web group. A big monitor is displaying the prototype of the newly designed and almost-built Getty Iris. We’re discussing The Iris logo you see at the top of this page, its multiple iterations, and, quite frankly, the pain involved in trying to get it to look right. Wait-wait-wait, let’s pause for a moment. My name is Will Lanni. I’m a Web production specialist at the Getty, which is a complex way of saying I’m a developer and designer, which is a nice way of saying that I’m basically a “web monkey.” Before I started at the Getty, I worked as a partner in a small web design and development firm for several years. I had some experience working for the Getty—I built the Pacific Standard Time at the Getty site, the Pacific Standard Time Festival site, as well as the interactive Getty Impact map. And, at the time of my hiring, I was not only working on the new design and build of The Iris, due to go live in only a month, but also the soon-to-be-launched website for Pacific Standard Time Presents: Modern Architecture in L.A. So I wasn’t exactly new to projects at the Getty, even though I was a brand-spanking-new full-time employee. OK. Now that you know who I am, let’s get back to that moment. The Iris logo, and the hair-pulling it was causing for all of us—which is a pretty good representation of the steps that Web projects go through as we move from idea, to execution, to setback, to solution. Question: What does Lanni think of starting a new job? === The answer to the above question is","output":"not explicitly stated in the text provided, but based on the context, one can infer that Lanni might be feeling excited, challenged, and perhaps a bit overwhelmed due to the various tasks and projects he was undertaking at the time. The fact that he had been on the job for only 12 hours and was already discussing significant design elements like the Iris logo indicates that he was committed to his new role and eager to contribute his expertise as a web production specialist."},{"instruction":"Gladys Lauture, a close Aristide friend and longtime supporter, said she and a team of carpenters, plumbers and decorators spent 18 days making Aristide's Port-au-Prince home livable again.

Step 1: Identify the key information. - Gladys Lauture is a close friend and longtime supporter of Aristide. - She and a team of carpenters, plumbers, and decorators spent 18 days making Aristide's Port-au-Prince home livable again. Step 2: Analyze the key information. - From the description provided, we can deduce that Gladys Lauture is invested in helping her friend Aristide. She is involved in the improvement of his home and has been a supporter of Aristide for a long time. Step 3: Compare the analyzed information to the statement in question. - The statement \\"Gladys Lauture is self-centered and unkind\\" contrasts with the evidence from the paragraph. Her actions seem to be centered around helping her friend Aristide, which implies that she is caring and capable of teamwork.

The premise gives us the information that there's a group of guests in a tent, but it does not specify any activity they are involved in, like eating. Step 4: Evaluate the options. To see if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, let's examine the available options. Option 1: Yes To choose this option, the hypothesis must directly follow from the premise. The premise only tells us that a group of guests is in a tent, and it does not mention any activity such as eating; thus, this option is not valid. Option 2: It is not possible to tell To choose this option, there should be a lack of information in the premise to confirm or deny the hypothesis. Since the premise does not specify any information about the activities of the guests in the tent, this option is a valid one. Option 3: No To choose this option, the hypothesis should be incompatible with the premise. While the premise does not affirm the hypothesis, it also does not contradict it. Thus, this option is not valid. Step 5: Select the most appropriate answer.

Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When suppressed to the south, the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.[20] I am facing a new situation today: 2018 was a very wet year for the Four Corners area, because of the subtropical ridge, 2019, on the other hand was a dry year influenced by the same weather phenomenon that lacked strength in this year. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which year was there a break in the monsoon regime? The answer is:","output":"2019 was the year when there was a break in the monsoon regime. This is because the subtropical ridge, a weather phenomenon linked to the strength and position of monsoons, lacked strength in 2019 compared to 2018. When the subtropical ridge is stronger and positioned farther north, it leads to wetter monsoon conditions, as was the case in 2018 for the Four Corners area. However, when the subtropical ridge is weaker and positioned more towards the south, it results in drier conditions and a break in the monsoon regime, as observed in 2019. In the background article you mentioned, the subtropical ridge plays a significant role in determining the extent of monsoon moisture and thunderstorms across the United States. Typically, the migration of the subtropical ridge northward across North America initiates monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest between July and September. In years like 2018, when the subtropical ridge is stronger than normal and located farther north towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona, generating a wet monsoon season in the region. Conversely, when the subtropical ridge is suppressed or weakened, as it was in 2019, the atmosphere dries out in the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime. This means that the wet monsoon conditions experienced in the Four Corners area in 2018 were not present in 2019. Instead, the weaker subtropical ridge led to a drier year with decreased monsoon activity. In summary, based on the information provided in the background article and the specific characteristics of the subtropical ridge for both years, it is clear that 2019 experienced a break in the monsoon regime in the Four Corners area, while 2018 had a wetter monsoon season due to a stronger and more northward subtropical ridge."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

We'll look at the following steps: Step 1: Find breast cancer survival rates in Japan and Sweden Step 2: Compare the survival rates Step 1: Find breast cancer survival rates in Japan and Sweden: According to the World Health Organization's Globocan project and other sources, the 5-year relative survival rate for breast cancer in Japan is approximately 89.9%. In Sweden, the 5-year relative survival rate is around 87.6%. Step 2: Compare the survival rates: Having compared breast cancer survival rates in both countries, it appears that a person with breast cancer in Japan has a slightly higher likelihood of survival (89.9%) than in Sweden (87.6%). However, it is essential to note that various factors may affect individual survival rates such as healthcare access, stage at diagnosis, and treatment options. These statistics provide an overall and generalized view but do not account for individual cases or regional differences within the countries.

Instead of lunches at Lut��ce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \\"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \\"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas.

The establishment's vibrant atmosphere, attentive service, and carefully crafted dishes make it an unmissable destination for all food lovers. Here, I'll delve into the highlights of my recent visit, providing a comprehensive review that showcases the elements that make The Palm Grove Restaurant stand out from the competition. Upon entering the establishment, I was greeted by the soothing color scheme inspired by the ocean and tropical surroundings, aptly reflecting the restaurant's name. The combination of natural materials and elegant furnishings worked harmoniously together, providing a welcoming ambiance that instantly captured my attention. To further enhance the mood, the lighting was perfectly balanced, inconspicuously highlighting each table and creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The Palm Grove Restaurant adheres to the utmost standards in service, with staff displaying both professionalism and genuine warmth that can be difficult to find elsewhere. From the initial greeting, to the final goodbye, I felt personally attended to without any intrusion on my dining experience. Additionally, our server, Michael, effortlessly guided my dining companion and me through the menu, providing insightful suggestions and aptly describing the restaurant's range of offerings. The menu itself, crafted by the talented Chef Paul, blends fresh, farm-to-table ingredients with innovative culinary techniques, resulting in a wide array of delectable dishes. For starters, we opted for the pan-seared scallops with bacon-wrapped asparagus and the heirloom tomato salad. Both dishes were immaculately presented, with striking colors and intricate plating that showcased the attention to detail the restaurant takes pride in. The scallops were tender and cooked to perfection, while the asparagus provided a satisfying crunch. The heirloom tomato salad was equally impressive, with the perfect balance of sweetness and acidity, complemented by the rich flavor of the house-made balsamic dressing. For our main courses, we chose the saffron-infused risotto with braised short ribs and the grilled salmon with lemon caper sauce. The risotto was creamy and rich, with delightful hints of saffron layered throughout, while the short ribs melted in my mouth, revealing their outstanding tenderness. The grilled salmon, on the other hand, was cooked flawlessly, maintaining its moistness and imparting a mildly smoky flavor. The lemon caper sauce offered the ideal contrasting zest, elevating the dish to new heights. We couldn't resist indulging in dessert, so we selected the chocolate lava cake and the mango mousse cake. Both desserts were divine, showcasing impressive technical skills in their execution. The chocolate lava cake captured the essence of decadence with its warm and gooey center, while the mango mousse cake provided a fruity and refreshing respite from the richness of the other courses. Overall, my experience at The Palm Grove Restaurant was nothing short of exceptional. The dedication to quality ingredients, inventive dishes, and outstanding service makes it a must-visit for food connoisseurs in search of a truly memorable dining experience. I wholeheartedly recommend The Palm Grove Restaurant and eagerly anticipate my next visit."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

They are receiving firearms from Polish citizens in the nearby village and gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory; the female prisoners who work in the UNIO are smuggling the powder to the menâs camp amid the bodies of their dead workers. When the women's activity is eventually discovered by the Germans they are savagely tortured, but they don't reveal the plot.

Here is a hypothesis: It is time the day ended with our empire united once more. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To determine whether the conclusion can be drawn that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true, we have to analyze the given statements and their logical connection. Premise: \\"It is time the sun set upon us as one.\\" This statement suggests that the speaker believes the time has come for a group to unite and face a common circumstance together, such as the end of a day or an era. The phrase \\"the sun set upon us as one\\" indicates a shared experience, conveying the importance of unity or collaboration among the individuals involved. Furthermore, the use of the word \\"sun\\" could represent the passing of time and the natural cycle of change. Hypothesis: \\"It is time the day ended with our empire united once more.\\" This statement also speaks about unity and emphasizes the need for an empire to come together again, potentially after a period of separation or conflict. The phrase \\"the day ended\\" could imply the end of a chapter or an era, pushing the need for reconciliation and a united front. In this statement, the term \\"empire\\" provides additional context—it could be a political entity or a metaphor for a larger collective identity. While both the premise and the hypothesis share similar themes, it is important to highlight the distinctions between them, which play a pivotal role in determining the possible logical correlation. The key differences can be summarized as follows: 1. The premise refers to an unspecified group, while the hypothesis specifically mentions an \\"empire.\\" 2. The premise uses the metaphor of the sun setting, and the hypothesis refers to the end of a day, which conveys a more definite end compared to the former. Analyzing the logical connection between the two statements further, it becomes evident that both emphasize the importance of unity. However, the difference in context (an unspecified group vs. an empire) and the strength of the time indicators (sunset vs. end of the day) make it challenging to draw a direct conclusion that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. In conclusion, while there are common elements between the premise and the hypothesis (such as the significance of unity and the end of an era), the differences in specificity suggest that it is not possible to assert that the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. The statements might hold separate interpretations depending on the context, making it impossible to establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship without additional supporting details."},{"instruction":"Of the following two sentences, which one is against common sense?

A young woman, Luda Mae Hewitt, finds the child while searching for food. She takes him back to the Hewitt residence, names him Thomas, and decides to raise him as her own. Thirty years later, Thomas works in the same factory in which his real mother died, working for the same man who left him in the dumpster. He is informed that the plant has been shut down by the health department, but refuses to leave until the boss forces his assistant to make him leave. Later, Tommy returns and brutally murders his boss. Before leaving, Tommy finds a chainsaw. Luda Mae's son, Charlie Hewitt, learns from the town's Sheriff what Tommy has done and accompanies him to arrest him. When they find Tommy, Charlie kills the Sheriff and assumes his identity. He takes his body back home and butchers him for stew meat. He informs the rest of the family that they'll never go hungry again. Two brothers, Eric and Dean, are driving across the country with their girlfriends, Chrissie and Bailey, to enlist in the Vietnam War. At a diner, they meet a female biker named Alex, who later follows them. Dean reveals he's decided not to enlist and burns his draft card, right before Alex draws a shotgun and orders the group to pull over.

Pick your answer from: [I] pass the ball to a player and have them immediately score a basket as a result of your pass.. [II] pass the ball to a player then have them eventually score a basket after a dribbling around a little bit..","output":"To evaluate which solution is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning, let's consider both options individually and analyze the key aspects involved in each case. [I] Pass the ball to a player and have them immediately score a basket as a result of your pass: In this scenario, the focus is on the effective and efficient transfer of the ball, which requires accurate passing and strategic timing. The passer needs to locate the teammate in a prime scoring position, free from the defender's pressure, and then throw the ball in a way that minimizes the chances of interception. The receiver, on the other hand, must be ready to catch the ball and shoot it towards the basket immediately, which requires coordination, swiftness, and precision. If executed correctly, this scenario is not only the most efficient way to score a basket, but it also represents the spirit of an assist in basketball; after all, the key idea behind an assist is to enhance the teammate's chances of scoring, by providing them with a convenient and favorable opportunity. [II] Pass the ball to a player then have them eventually score a basket after dribbling around a little bit: In this case, the passer must still identify an open teammate and accurately deliver the ball to them; nevertheless, the focus shifts towards the recipient's ability to dribble and maneuver through the defenders before attempting to score. This scenario usually takes longer and involves an increased level of risk, given that the ball handler is exposed to possible turnovers or offensive fouls. Moreover, the recipient's technique and decision-making skills become paramount since they'll face the challenge of creating their own scoring opportunity. While dribbling and navigating around defenders is an essential component of basketball gameplay, the player's actions after receiving the ball do not align as strongly with the conventional definition of an assist, as it might be argued that the player created their own scoring situation rather than leveraging their teammates' support. In conclusion, based on naive physics reasoning, solution [I] is more sound as it generally relies on a more straightforward, efficient, and risk-averse approach to achieve the objective of getting an assist in basketball. It places greater emphasis on the interplay between the passer and the receiver, not only adhering more closely to the traditional concept of an assist but also prioritizing the cooperative nature of the game."},{"instruction":"Please capitalize where necessary: the size of the tumor and how it may be impeding the functionality of the organ will also have a lot of influence on how ill your pet feels, and whether or not it will be fatal.","output":"Step 1: Identify the parts of the sentence that need capitalization.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities.

Measured to its farthest source via its tributary the North Platte River, it flows for over . The Platte River is a tributary of the Missouri River, which itself is a tributary of the Mississippi River which flows to the Gulf of Mexico. The Platte over most of its length is a muddy, broad, shallow, meandering stream with a swampy bottom and many islandsa braided stream. These characteristics made it too difficult for canoe travel, and it was never used as a major navigation route by European-American trappers or explorers. - The Roman Catholic Diocese of Lincoln is a Catholic diocese in Nebraska, United States, and comprises the majority of the eastern and central portions of the state south of the Platte River. It is a suffragan see to the Archdiocese of Omaha. The episcopal see is in Lincoln, Nebraska. Bishop James D. Conley is the current ordinary of the Diocese.

Churches with the function of \\"cathedral\\" are usually specific to those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy, such as the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, and some Lutheran and Methodist churches. Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appear in Italy, Gaul, Spain and North Africa in the 4th century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the 12th century, by which time they had developed architectural forms, institutional structures and legal identities distinct from parish churches, monastic churches and episcopal residences. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population.

His father, Heinrich Ernst Goring (31 October 1839 - 7 December 1913), a former cavalry officer, had been the first Governor-General of the German protectorate of South-West Africa (modern-day Namibia). Heinrich had five children from a previous marriage. Goring was the fourth of five children by Heinrich's second wife, Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859-15 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant. Goring and other senior officers were concerned that Germany was not yet ready for war, but Hitler insisted on pushing ahead as soon as possible. The invasion of Poland, the opening action of World War II, began at dawn on 1 September 1939. Later in the day, speaking to the Reichstag, Hitler designated Goring as his successor as Fuhrer of all Germany, \\"If anything should befall me\\", with Hess as the second alternate. Big German victories followed one after the other in quick succession. With the help of the Luftwaffe, the Polish Air Force was defeated within a week. The Fallschirmjager seized vital airfields in Norway and captured Fort Eben-Emael in Belgium. Goring's Luftwaffe played critical roles in the Battles of the Netherlands, Belgium and France in May 1940. After the Fall of France, Hitler awarded Goring the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross for his successful leadership. During the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony, Hitler promoted Goring to the rank of Reichsmarschall des Grossdeutschen Reiches (Reich Marshal of the Greater German Reich), a special rank which made him senior to all field marshals in the military, including the Luftwaffe. As a result of his promotion, he was then the top ranking soldier of all Germany until the end of the war. Goring had already received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 30 September 1939 as Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe. The UK had declared war on Germany immediately after the invasion of Poland. In July 1940, Hitler began preparations for an invasion of Britain. As part of the plan, the Royal Air Force (RAF) had to be neutralized. Bombing raids commenced on British air installations and on cities and centres of industry. Goring had by then already announced in a radio speech, \\"If as much as a single enemy aircraft flies over German soil, my name is Meier!\\", something that would return to haunt him, when the RAF began bombing German cities on 11 May 1940. Though he was confident the Luftwaffe could defeat the RAF within days, Goring, like Admiral Erich Raeder, commander-in-chief of the Kriegsmarine (navy), was pessimistic about the chance of success of the planned invasion (codenamed Operation Sea Lion). Goring hoped that a victory in the air would be enough to force peace without an invasion. The campaign failed, and Sea Lion was postponed indefinitely on 17 September 1940. After their defeat in the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe attempted to defeat Britain via strategic bombing. On 12 October 1940 Hitler cancelled Sea Lion due to the onset of winter. By the end of the year, it was clear that British morale was not being shaken by the Blitz, though the bombings continued through May 1941.

It is often seen as a complex and ambiguous idea, embodying a multitude of aspects and dimensions – making it an elusive concept to definitively pin down. The intricacies of different opinions, perspectives, and arguments surrounding the state have led many experts and thinkers to delve deeper into the analysis of this seemingly simple yet convoluted notion. At its core, the state is arguably an organizational structure that fulfills a set of functions and governance within a specific territory. This basic definition, however, does not adequately encompass the vast intricacies and variations that exist in the concept and the reality of states. The ever-changing political, social, and cultural landscapes within nation-states and the global community have contributed to the evolving nature of the state, making it difficult for scholars to arrive at a consensus. One argument that has gained traction in recent decades is that the state could be considered both an institution and an idea. While it is composed of tangible elements such as elected officials, government structures, and agencies, it is also an abstract concept in the minds of citizens and political actors. The state is imagined by the population it serves – a constantly evolving idea that transcends sociopolitical barriers and experiences growth or contraction depending on a range of factors, including the implementation of policies, economic shifts, and ideological changes within the society. In a globalized world where cross-border interactions are increasingly the norm, the notion of sovereignty is facing tremendous challenges. The existence of international organizations, the ever-growing importance of transnational actors, and the rise of non-state actors, such as global civil society and multinational corporations, have added layers of complexity to the traditional notion of the state. These developments have raised questions about the power and authority of states and the relevance of national borders in the contemporary era. Additionally, diverse historical, cultural, and social factors have led to significant variations in how states operate and function. While the role of the state in Western liberal democracies may center on the protection of individual liberties and the maintenance of a market economy, other states may prioritize community values, collective welfare, or even ideologies of nationalism or socialism. Although states may share similar characteristics, their agendas, goals, and methods may vary drastically from one another. A further dimension to the elusiveness of the concept of the state is its behavior and relationship towards its citizens. Different states exhibit different degrees of responsiveness to the needs and demands of their populations – in some cases, providing social welfare, security, and opportunity for socioeconomic development – while others may neglect or even repress the very citizens they claim to serve. The legitimacy or acceptance of the rule of the state by its citizens is often an important factor that shapes how the state operates, offering another layer of complexity to the conceptualization of the state. Overall, the state is an elusive concept, not only due to its multifaceted nature but also because it constantly evolves and shapes itself according to the unique circumstances of particular territories. As an object of academic inquiry, political debate, and ideological contention, the state will inevitably continue to provoke reflection, critical analysis, and debate. Perhaps, amidst such discourses, we can develop an ever-evolving understanding and appreciation of this indispensable yet enigmatic cornerstone of modern human civilization."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise \\"The big wardrobe loomed up in a sinister fashion before her eyes.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"She is taller than the wardrobe.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the given premise, \\"The big wardrobe loomed up in a sinister fashion before her eyes,\\" we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis \\"She is taller than the wardrobe\\" is true. The premise establishes certain aspects of the scenario involving the girl and the wardrobe, but does not provide explicit information about their relative heights, nor can the information be deduced implicitly. Let's examine the premise in detail to understand the context and establish what we can infer from it: 1. The wardrobe is described as \\"big,\\" which indicates that it is larger than an average wardrobe, but the exact dimensions are not provided. Without clear numerical values, we cannot determine its height nor compare it to that of the girl. 2. The wardrobe is said to \\"loom up\\" before the girl's eyes, which suggests that it might be comparatively taller than her since they often use the word \\"loom\\" to describe an object that appears imposing or threatening in its size, specifically because it towers over other objects or people. However, this is not necessarily conclusive evidence, as the wardrobe's perceived height could be emphasized by factors such as shadows, lighting, or position. 3. The adjective \\"sinister\\" has been used to depict the wardrobe's appearance. This can evoke a feeling of uneasiness, dread, or intimidation in the viewer - in this case, the girl. The wardrobe's sinister presentation certainly indicates its imposing stature relative to her, but it does not offer any solid evidence to prove that she is taller. To conclude, the information provided in the premise is insufficient to corroborate the hypothesis that \\"She is taller than the wardrobe.\\" To make such a determination, more specific data concerning the girl's height and the wardrobe's dimensions are required. While the premise suggests that the wardrobe appears imposing and sinister in the context, it offers no quantifiable evidence to validate the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Data: Ajoblanco, ingredient, Almond; Spain, leader, Felipe VI of Spain; Ajoblanco, region, Andalusia; Andalusia, leader, Susana Díaz; Ajoblanco, country, Spain Sentence about the following data:","output":"Step 1: Understand the data given The data given pertains to a dish (Ajoblanco), two leaders (Felipe VI of Spain and Susana Díaz), a region (Andalusia), and a country (Spain).

Answer: Visible wavelengths pass through the \\" optical window \\", the region of the electromagnetic spectrum which allows wavelengths to pass largely unattenuated through the Earth's atmosphere . Question: how big or small a visible light can get","output":"The question about how big or small visible light can get refers to the range of wavelengths within the visible spectrum. Visible light, which is a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum, is the portion of light that can be detected by the human eye. Visible wavelengths pass through the \\"optical window,\\" the region of the electromagnetic spectrum that allows wavelengths to largely pass unattenuated through the Earth's atmosphere. The human eye can perceive light within the wavelength range of approximately 380 to 750 nanometers (nm). This range encompasses the colors that we perceive as the rainbow, from violet (shorter wavelengths) to red (longer wavelengths). The size of a visible light refers to its wavelength, and the unit for measuring this is nanometers (nm). So, in this context, the smallest visible light can get when discussing the electromagnetic spectrum is about 380 nm (violet), and the largest visible light can get is around 750 nm (red). It's essential to note that these values are approximate since the visible light wavelength range is subject to individual variations in human color perception and depends on light intensity. For instance, under low light conditions, human eyes may struggle to perceive colors accurately or at the same range as in brighter conditions. In summary, visible light wavelengths can vary between approximately 380 nm (violet) and 750 nm (red). This range encompasses what our eyes are capable of perceiving as colors and constitutes the visible spectrum that passes through the optical window of the Earth's atmosphere."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog with this premise \\"Rose bought a beautiful nail polish on Ali.\\".","output":"Title: A Nail Polish Splurge on Ali Characters: Rose: A young woman in her 30s who loves to shop for beauty products online.

On the contrary, these essays are generally very clear and focused, and betray the author's wealth of knowledge and experience. For example, it is very fashionable to speak about zen in martial arts texts, and throw around terms like \\"mushin\\". But unlike most of those texts, this book is actually written by someone who is expert in both zen and budo. As a result, the comparisons he makes are far more lucid, interesting, and (in my experience) applicable.I encourage you to read this book. You will not regret it. Answer: Pick your answer from: + No + Yes","output":"Yes, this product review is positive. The reviewer states that it is among the very finest books they have read on martial ways, praises the clarity and focus of the essays, and highlights the author's expertise in both zen and budo. They also encourage others to read the book, expressing confidence that readers will not regret their decision.

We see a POV shoot of a performer walking out on a stage at his concert to perform, then it cuts to him riding his motorcycle just before he crashes, just as Dylan did in 1966. We see the crash victim is Jude Quinn (Cate Blanchett), who has an autopsy performed on him.In 1959, a 12-year-old African-American boy (Marcus Carl Franklin) is riding the rails as a hobo. He meets two older hobos and introduces himself as Woody Guthrie. Woody carries around a guitar labeled \\"This Machine Kills Fascists\\" as did the real Woody Guthrie. Woody is traveling across country to fulfill his dream to be a singer. Woody tells the other hobos his life story. He is once tried to perform with a circus but is made fun of and kicked out for unknown reasons (although wrestler Gorgeous George gives him a hand). Woody later meets and befriends an African American family where he stays at their home to be cared for, he also sings \\"Tombstone Blues\\" with two of the men. Woody later has dinner with the family where he is lectured by the family matriarch. She reminds him of the goings on of the world and tells Woody to, \\"Live your own time child, sing about your own time\\". Later that night Woody leaves the home and a note thanking the family for their hospitality and hops aboard a freight train. Later that night he falls asleep and is awakened by thieves who are looking for money and attempt to rob Woody, but he gets away by jumping off the train and into a river. He seems to imagine an unknown woman underwater and then seems to see himself getting eaten by a Moby Dick-like sperm whale. A white couple later finds him unconscious and take him to a hospital, with a little water in his lungs but he survives. The couple take him into their home to temporarily care for him and he performs \\"When the Ship Comes In\\" for them.

Roberto can skip 4,200 times an hour. Valerie can skip 80 times a minute. If they jump rope for fifteen minutes straight, how many skips will they total? Let's be accurate as possible.","output":"To calculate the total number of skips for both Roberto and Valerie during the 15-minute recess, we need to determine the number of skips per 15 minutes for each person and then add them together. Step 1: Calculate the number of skips for Roberto in 15 minutes. Roberto can skip 4,200 times an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can find out how many times he skips in a minute. 4,200 skips per hour / 60 minutes per hour = 70 skips per minute Now that we know he can skip 70 times a minute, we can find out how many times he skips in 15 minutes. 70 skips per minute * 15 minutes = 1,050 skips Step 2: Calculate the number of skips for Valerie in 15 minutes. Valerie can skip 80 times a minute. To find out how many times she skips in 15 minutes, we can multiply her skips per minute by the number of minutes. 80 skips per minute * 15 minutes = 1,200 skips Step 3: Add the number of skips for Roberto and Valerie together. 1,050 skips (Roberto) + 1,200 skips (Valerie) = 2,250 skips So, if they jump rope for fifteen minutes straight, they will have a total of 2,250 skips combined."},{"instruction":"sen. john mccain said sunday that he and president bush share a \`\` common philosophy '' but insisted that he is his own man in his first appearance on nbc 's \`\` meet the press '' in more than nine months .

The quote compares life to a box of chocolates, suggesting that both are full of unexpected surprises and a variety of experiences. With each chocolate, you encounter different flavors, textures, and combinations. Just as in life, where each experience, whether positive or negative, shapes your character and teaches you valuable lessons. The element of surprise in both cases implies that it's impossible to predict the path your life will take or the experiences you'll have along the way. The quote also serves as a reminder to enjoy the present moment and appreciate each experience for what it is, just as you would savor a chocolate from a box without knowing what the next one will be like. This message is universal and resonates with people across cultures, as it relates to the fundamental human condition and the unpredictable nature of life. In terms of language, the sentence demonstrates the use of the Spanish language's core grammatical structure and specific vocabulary. The sentence begins with the subject \\"La vida,\\" followed by the verb \\"es.\\" The object, \\"una caja de bombones,\\" is then introduced, and the sentence concludes with the simile, \\"you never know what you're going to get.\\" The structure adheres to the typical subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern, which is common in Spanish as well as in English.

Construction sites are generally outdoor settings, as construction primarily involves the development of infrastructure or buildings, which are built outdoors. 3. \\"An excavator vehicle forms the foreground\\": An excavator is a large, heavy piece of construction equipment primarily used for digging, grading, or moving large amounts of material, such as dirt or rubble, during construction projects. The fact that an excavator is present suggests that the work being done likely involves some form of outdoor excavation or land development, further reinforcing the notion that the construction workers are working outside. In summary, considering the presence of a group of construction workers, the reference to a construction site, and the involvement of an excavator vehicle, it is logical to conclude that \\"A group of construction workers are working outside.\\""},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Title: Dead in 17 months in smoke alarm Review: Dead in 17 months.

Visually, it was great. I was pleased with the pacing, the camera angles, etc. However, the characters? eh, kinda bland. Plot? It sucked. This movie seemed more new age crap than anything else. Organized religion is presented as cowardly and fearful. Science isn't portrayed any better. It creates a monster weapon that kills everything... but \\"souls\\" have the power to destroy monsters and bring life? Really? That's something that bites my ass a bit too. Here we have a CGI movie... created with science... and they're using it to give us the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they had the decency to have one of the characters ask, \\"Okay, so now what?\\" (or something similar). I couldn't hear it too well because of the crowd immediately getting up and making a break for the exit. It was a \\"okay... it was just barely entertaining enough to sit here for the entire movie but now let's get out of here as fast as possible!\\" type of exit. This is one of those movies where you can't think if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the visuals and nod your head prettily. Any thought as to, \\"what's the point of that?\\" will suck you out of disbelief and make you eye the exit sign with longing. Okay... SPOILERS follow. So, basically, a scientist creates \\"the Machine\\" that is capable of creating other, intelligent, robotic life. Evil humans use it as a weapon. However, the scientist realizes that he is also at fault. He gave the Machine his intellect, but didn't give it his heart. The Machine goes Skynet on humanity's collective ass and wipes out all life on earth, finally slowly powering down. However, the scientist manages to survive and create walking sock-puppets. Each one, containing a piece of the scientist's soul. The last one, #9 wakes up not knowing anything about the world. He sees a strange device nearby and picks it up. He meets up with another like himself, #2. Well, #2 gets captured by a last surviving robot of the Machine. #9 finds more like himself ands sets off to rescue #2. They succeed. #9 notices that there is a matching hole that fits the device perfectly. He inserts it and the Machine comes back to life... pulling out #2's soul in the process. The movie then continues with action scenes with #9 trying to rescue his soul-yanked compatriots. They eventually succeed and destroy the Machine. They release the souls of their fallen friends, who go up into the clouds. It then rains and we see life returning back to the planet. Hunh?!? That makes no sense. None at all. Why the heck did the scientist want to split his soul into 9 homunculi? What did it accomplish? Were they created to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why bother?!? Why did he expect nine little critters to succeed when nothing else had? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but with a \\"soul\\" to fight the first.. at least that would have seemed like it would have had a reasonable chance at success. Why did they have to have their souls sucked into the device by the Machine and then destroy the Machine and then release the souls in order to bring life back to earth? Why not just wait for the machine to power down and bring life back without all the rest of the insane steps? Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"This review thought negatively of the movie.

Yes or no? Answer: They have featured prominently in ancient mythology and folklore , and continue to be depicted in modern films and literature. Question: what are some animals in a tigers environment The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the given answer does not directly address the question about the animals in a tiger's environment. Instead, it discusses the cultural significance of tigers in ancient mythology, folklore, films, and literature. To answer the question about the animals in a tiger's environment, we can explore the various ecosystems that tigers inhabit and the different species that they share these environments with. Tigers are found in a variety of habitats, including tropical rainforests, grasslands, savannas, and temperate forests throughout Asia. They primarily reside in countries like India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Indonesia, and Russia. Depending on the specific location, the animals in a tiger's environment may vary. In a tropical rainforest habitat, tigers may share their environment with animals such as elephants, rhinoceroses, various species of deer (like sambar and chital), wild boar, guar (Indian bison), langurs, macaques, and various species of birds, reptiles, and insects. Tigers are apex predators in this environment and play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystem by controlling the population of herbivores. In this habitat, they may also encounter other predators like leopards, dholes (Indian wild dogs), and crocodiles. In the grasslands and savannas of Asia, tigers can come across animals such as antelopes, barking deer, wild water buffaloes, and various bird species. They also share this environment with other predators, such as jackals, wolves, and smaller species of wild cats, like the fishing cat and jungle cat. In the temperate forests of Russia, particularly in the Russian Far East where Siberian tigers are found, the animals that they share their environment with include sika deer, roe deer, Manchurian wapiti, musk deer, goral, Siberian roe deer, Asiatic black bears, and Amur leopard. The Siberian tiger is the largest of all the tiger subspecies and, in this ecosystem, they are the dominant predators. Other smaller species, including rodents, amphibians, and various types of invertebrates, are also present in these environments, though they may not make up a significant part of the tiger's diet. In conclusion, the animals in a tiger's environment depend on the specific habitat they inhabit. Tigers coexist with diverse species in these ecosystems, ranging from large mammals such as elephants and rhinoceroses to smaller creatures like langurs and wild boar. As apex predators, tigers play a critical role in maintaining the balance within their respective ecosystems."},{"instruction":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what is go daddy.com?

She then tries to go to the floor above her apartment to find out the root of the leak, and discovers that the apartment is locked.

With lessons learned from the Sanderson series, Longacre proposed to issue his own set of biographies illustrated with plates of the subjects. He was on the point of launching this project, having invested 1,000 of his own money (equal to 25,097 today) in preparation, when he learned that James Herring of New York City was planning a similar series. In October 1831, he wrote to Herring, and the two men agreed to work together on The American Portrait Gallery (later called the National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans), published in four volumes between 1834 and 1839. Herring was an artist, but much of the work of illustrating fell to Longacre, who traveled widely in the United States to sketch subjects from life. He again sketched Jackson, who was by now president, as well as former president James Madison, both in July 1833. He met many of the political leaders of the day, who were impressed by his portraits. Among these advocates was the former vice president, South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun. In July 1832, Niles' Register described a Longacre engraving, \\"one of the finest specimens of American advancement in the art\\".Longacre had married Eliza Stiles in 1827; between 1828, when their daughter Sarah was born, and 1840, they had three boys and two girls. Sales of the Gallery lagged due to the Panic of 1837; Longacre was forced to declare bankruptcy and travel through the southern and midwestern states, peddling his books from town to town, with his wife and elder daughter managing shipping and finances at home. Later in 1837, he was able to return to Philadelphia and open a banknote engraving firm with partners, Toppan, Draper, Longacre & Co. With great demand for engraving for notes being issued by state banks, the firm prospered, and had offices at 60 Walnut Street in Philadelphia and a branch at 1 Wall Street in New York. According to Snow, Longacre was known as the best engraver in the country.

He personally thanked Mr Gassama, gave him a medal for courage and said he would also be offered a role in the fire service. Mr Gassama is said to have arrived in France last year, taking the long and dangerous journey to Europe via a boat over the Mediterranean to Italy. The drama that thrust him to fame unfolded on Saturday evening on a street in the north of the city. Mr Gassama said he had been walking past when he saw a crowd gathered in front of the building. He told Mr Macron: \\"I just didn't have time to think, I ran across the road to go and save him. You may also like: \\"I just climbed up and thank God, God helped me. The more I climbed the more I had the courage to climb up higher, that's it,\\" he added. He said that the boy was crying when he hauled him to safety and had also suffered an injured foot. Firefighters arrived to find the child had already been rescued. \\"Luckily, there was someone who was physically fit and who had the courage to go and get the child,\\" a spokesperson said. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Gassama met French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday Image copyright AFP Image caption Outside the presidential palace he showed off a certificate he was given Local authorities quoted by French media said the boy's parents were not at home at the time. The father has been questioned by police on suspicion of leaving his child unattended, judicial sources say. The mother was not in Paris at the time, it is believed. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo was among those to praise the 22-year-old's heroism and said she had called him to thank him. She referred to him as the \\"Spiderman of the 18th\\", referring to the Paris district where the rescue took place, calling him an \\"example for all citizens\\". France's new Malian hero Alex Duval Smith, West Africa correspondent, BBC News Mr Gassama's four-storey dash is a reminder of another Malian hero who gained national prominence in January 2015 during an extremist attack on a Jewish supermarket in Paris. A young Malian employee, Lassana Bathily, was credited with saving the lives of six hostages including a baby when he led them to a safe hiding place, escaped, then directed gendarmes to their rescue. Two weeks later - after six years of struggling to secure legal residency in France - Mr Bathily was given a medal and a French passport by then President François Hollande. In 2016, he wrote a book ''Je ne suis pas un heros'' (I am no hero) and created a charity whose first project was to provide irrigation for his home village in western Mali. Like Mr Bathily's selfless leadership to save the hostages, Mr Gassama's heroic climb to save the boy cements the image of Mali as a country with a culture of old-fashioned public spiritedness. ||||| Footage shows Mamoudou Gassama, a Malian immigrant, climbing up to a fourth-floor balcony to bring the child to safety A young man has been hailed a hero after he scaled the facade of a building to save a four-year-old child hanging from a fourth-floor balcony. Mamoudou Gassama took just seconds to reach the child in a rescue captured on film and viewed millions of times on social networks. NubiΔΠ (@Adil__Brown) Les héros ne portent pas de cap. 👏👏 #Paris pic.twitter.com/QrOn3YB4Q7 The incident took place at about 8pm on Saturday in northern Paris. Footage of the rescue shows Gassama, 22, pulling himself up the building’s storeys from balcony to balcony as a man on the fourth floor tries to hold on to the child by leaning across from a neighbouring balcony. On reaching the fourth floor, Gassama puts one leg over the balcony before reaching out with his right arm and grabbing the child. Firefighters arrived at the scene to find the child had already been rescued. “Luckily, there was someone who was physically fit and who had the courage to go and get the child,” a fire service spokesman said. Tracked down by reporters 24 hours after the rescue, Gassama said he had acted without thinking. “I saw all these people shouting, and cars sounding their horns. I climbed up like that and, thank God, I saved the child,” he said. “I felt afraid when I saved the child ... [when] we went into the living room, I started to shake, I could hardly stand up, I had to sit down,” he added. Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, praised him on Twitter for his “act of bravery” as well as phoning him personally to “thank him warmly”. She referred to him as the “Spider-Man of the 18th”, referring to the Paris district where the rescue happened. “He explained to me that he had arrived from Mali a few months ago dreaming of building his life here,” she said. “I told him that his heroic act is an example to all citizens and that the city of Paris will obviously be very keen to support him in his efforts to settle in France,” she added.

The serene landscape around them is bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun, casting long shadows and painting the sky with vibrant shades of orange and pink. It is evident that they share a special bond, as the horse intuitively responds to her subtle cues and body language. The woman gently strokes the horse's neck, and a contented sigh escapes her as she takes in the beauty of their surroundings. Her dark brown hair whips around her face as a gentle breeze picks up, carrying with it the sweet scent of wildflowers and fresh grass. It creates a picturesque atmosphere, accompanied by the melodic chirping of birds settling into their nests for the evening. Feeling inspired, the woman guides her horse towards a nearby hill, where she plans to watch the sun dip below the horizon. As they slowly ascend, the panoramic vista of the tranquil landscape opens up before them, with lush grasslands stretching out as far as the eye can see, punctuated by the occasional cluster of trees. Reaching the top of the hill, the young woman dismounts her grey steed, and the two companions stand side by side, basking in the last rays of sunlight. She gazes at the scene before her, feeling a profound sense of peace. The air is thick with an almost palpable sense of serenity, and the bond between the young woman and her horse is stronger than ever. As the sun finally sinks behind the hills, a fiery orange and purple sky remains, serving as a stunning backdrop to the silhouette of the woman and her horse. The sky gradually darkens, like a canvas being painted by the masterful strokes of nature's brush. The woman remounts her horse, and they decide to head back towards the stables, guided only by the soft light of the emerging stars. With every step the horse takes, the sounds of hooves against the ground send rhythmic echoes throughout the landscape, harmonizing with the symphony of nocturnal creatures beginning to stir. As they ride through the field, fireflies emerge, illuminating their path with their soft, otherworldly glow. The woman smiles, infused with a feeling of pure happiness and gratitude for the special connection she shares with her horse and the beauty of the world around them. Making their way back to the stable, both the woman and her grey companion, tired but contented, are now enveloped in the velvety darkness of the night. The stable's warm lights are a welcoming sight as they approach it, signifying the end of their journey. Once inside and after bidding her loyal friend goodnight with an affectionate stroke, the woman slips a comfortable blanket over the horse, ensuring it will have a well-deserved rest. As she walks away from the stable, the young woman can't help but reflect on the beautiful moments they shared, and she knows that countless more adventures in the breathtaking landscape await them both in the days to come."},{"instruction":"Two or three at a time, the demon bandits dragged the women into one of the few huts spared of the red flame.

Her performance received positive reviews: one written for the San Francisco Chronicle noted, \\"[the film] grows on you, largely because of the charm of ... Scarlett Johansson,\\" while critic Mick LaSalle, writing for the same paper, commented on her \\"peaceful aura\\", and believed, \\"If she can get through puberty with that aura undisturbed, she could become an important actress.\\" Johansson earned a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Female for the role. After appearing in minor roles in Fall and Home Alone 3 (both 1997), Johansson attracted wider attention for her performance in the film The Horse Whisperer (1998), directed by Robert Redford. The drama film, based on the 1995 novel of the same name by Nicholas Evans, tells the story of a talented trainer with a gift for understanding horses, who is hired to help an injured teenager played by Johansson. The actress received an \\"introducing\\" credit on this film, although it was her seventh role. On Johansson's maturity, Redford described her as \\"13 going on 30\\". Todd McCarthy of Variety commented that Johansson \\"convincingly conveys the awkwardness of her age and the inner pain of a carefree girl suddenly laid low by horrible happenstance\\". For the film, she was nominated for the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actress. She believed that the film changed many things in her life, realizing that acting is the ability to manipulate one's emotions. On finding good roles as a teenager, Johansson said it was hard for her as adults wrote the scripts and they \\"portray kids like mall rats and not seriously ... Kids and teenagers just aren't being portrayed with any real depth\\". Johansson later appeared in My Brother the Pig (1999) and in the neo-noir, Coen brothers film The Man Who Wasn't There (2001). Her breakthrough came playing a cynical outcast in Terry Zwigoff's black comedy Ghost World (2001), an adaptation of Daniel Clowes' graphic novel of same name. Johansson auditioned for the film via a tape from New York, and Zwigoff believed her to be \\"a unique, eccentric person, and right for that part\\". The film premiered at the 2001 Seattle International Film Festival; it was a box office failure, but has since developed a cult status. Johansson was credited with \\"sensitivity and talent [that] belie her age\\" by an Austin Chronicle critic, and won a Toronto Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. With David Arquette, Johansson appeared in the horror comedy Eight Legged Freaks (2002), about a collection of spiders that are exposed to toxic waste, causing them to grow to gigantic proportions and begin killing and harvesting.

Article: There are two basic ways to see growth: one as a product, the other as a process. People have generally viewed personal growth as a result or product that can easily be identified and measured. The worker who gets a rise, the student whose grades improve, the foreigner who learns a new language--all these are examples of people who have measurable results to show for their efforts. By contrast, the process of personal growth is much more difficult to determine, since it is a journey and not the specific signposts or landmarks along the way. The process is not the road itself, but rather the attitudes and feelings people have, their caution or courage, as they meet with new experiences and unexpected obstacles . In this process, the journey never really ends; there are always new ways to experience the world, new ideas to try, new challenges to accept. In order to grow, to travel new roads, people need to have a willingness to take risks, to face the unknown, and to accept the possibility that they may \\"fail\\" at first. How we see ourselves as we try a new way of being is extremely important to our ability to grow. Do we notice ourselves as quick and curious? If so, then we tend to take more chances and to be more open to unfamiliar experiences. Do we think we're shy and indecisive? Then our sense of fear can cause us to hesitate, to move slowly, and we think we're slow to adapt to change or that we're not smart enough to deal with a new challenge. Then we are likely to take a more passive role or not try at all. These feelings of insecurity and self-doubt are both unavoidable and necessary if we are to change and grow. If we protect ourselves too much, then we stop growing. We become trapped inside a shell of our own making.

Teams in both leagues play against each other throughout the regular season, and the best-performing teams advance to the postseason, culminating in the World Series, which is a championship series between the AL and NL pennant winners.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the provided answer is not correct. While it correctly explains that blood pressure varies between systolic and diastolic pressures during a heartbeat, it does not address the factors that contribute to high blood pressure. High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is influenced by several factors including: 1. Genetics: A person's genetic makeup can predispose them to have elevated blood pressure. 2. Age: As people age, the risk of developing high blood pressure increases, primarily due to the loss of elasticity in blood vessels. 3. Lifestyle: Unhealthy habits such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, high salt intake, and lack of physical activity can contribute to high blood pressure. 4. Obesity: Carrying excess weight can increase the pressure on the artery walls, causing the blood pressure to rise. 5. Stress: Chronic stress can lead to an increase in blood pressure by causing the release of stress hormones, which can constrict blood vessels and raise blood pressure. 6. Medical conditions: Kidney disease, sleep apnea, and diabetes can contribute to the development of high blood pressure. 7. Medications: Certain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and oral contraceptives, can cause blood pressure to rise. In summary, the provided answer does not adequately address the factors that contribute to high blood pressure. Instead, high blood pressure is influenced by a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and physiological factors."},{"instruction":"Therefore, water nearer shore usually contains more dissolved nutrients than water farther from shore. Water furthest away from shore will have more or less dissolved nutrients than water near shore?","output":"To determine whether water farthest away from shore will have more or less dissolved nutrients than water near shore, let's analyze the information given and compare the nutrient levels in both locations. Step 1: Analyze the information given The statement says, \\"water nearer shore usually contains more dissolved nutrients than water farther from shore.\\" This indicates that the level of dissolved nutrients is higher near the shore than it is farther out. Step 2: Compare nutrient levels in water near shore and water farthest away from shore Since the dissolved nutrient levels are higher near the shore, it can be inferred that the water farthest away from shore would have less dissolved nutrients in comparison.

He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him.

Knowing the slivers resulted from the refrigerator being moved, Somerset looks behind it.

Available options: + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5","output":"I would rate the meaning overlap between the two sentences as a 4. The reason for this assessment is that both sentences describe a man looking through a window, which is the primary action and focus of the expressions. The difference lies in the intensity or focus of the action: \\"stares\\" and \\"looks.\\" Staring often conveys a more intense, prolonged, or focused gaze, while looking can be more casual or brief. These two verbs, \\"stares\\" and \\"looks,\\" are not entirely synonymous, but their differences don't significantly alter the overall meaning of the sentences. Both sentences describe a situation in which a man is looking out a window, but the amount of attention or focus may vary between the two. Consequently, the meaning overlap between the two sentences is rated 4 or \\"very close,\\" but not entirely equivalent, in meaning. It is important to consider that small nuances in language choice can affect the imagery or emotional impact of the sentences. In a literary or storytelling context, the choice of word may be intentional to convey a specific mood or implication. For example, a character who \\"stares\\" out a window could be deeply lost in thought or experiencing strong emotions, while a character who \\"looks\\" out a window may only be casually observing or momentarily glancing outside. In such contexts, the difference between the two verbs becomes more important, but for the purposes of assessing the general meaning of the sentences, I maintain that a rating of 4 is appropriate."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In 1989, seven years after the events of the first film, Kevin Flynn, who has been recently promoted CEO of ENCOM International, disappears.

The Eucharist (also called Holy Communion or the Lord's Supper, among other names) is a Christian rite that is considered a sacrament in most churches and an ordinance in others. According to the New Testament, the rite was instituted by Jesus Christ during his Last Supper; giving his disciples bread and wine during the Passover meal, Jesus commanded his followers to \\"do this in memory of me\\" while referring to the bread as \\"my body\\" and the wine as \\"my blood\\". Through the Eucharistic celebration Christians remember Christ's sacrifice of himself on the cross. The elements of the Eucharist, bread (leavened or unleavened) and wine are consecrated on an altar (or table) and consumed thereafter. Communicants (that is, those who consume the elements) may speak of \\"receiving the Eucharist\\", as well as \\"celebrating the Eucharist\\". Christians generally recognize a special presence of Christ in this rite, though they differ about exactly how, where, and when Christ is present. While all agree that there is no perceptible change in the elements, Catholics believe that they actually become the body and blood of Christ (transubstantiation). Lutherans believe the true body and blood of Christ are really present \\"in, with, and under\\" the forms of the bread and wine (sacramental union). Reformed Christians believe in a real spiritual presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Others, such as the Plymouth Brethren, take the act to be only a symbolic reenactment of the Last Supper. 1.

While there remains no firm timetable for his return, Kerr -- who is recovering from a pair of offseason back surgeries -- traveled with the team this week for the road trip to Dallas and Houston, the first time Kerr went on a multi-city trip this season. Interim coach Walton still coached both games. “It’s obviously a possibility,” Walton said, via ESPN’s Tim MacMahon. “He hasn’t said he’s going to. To be honest, I don’t think he knows yet. I think that’s part of why he’s on this road trip, to see how his body handles the travel and getting into Houston at 1 a.m. tonight to turn around and play again then get on another plane and fly home and get in late again. So that’s part of why he’s here on this trip, whether or not this weekend is a realistic return or not.” Even if he doesn’t return this weekend, it sounds like Kerr is pretty close to getting back on the sideline. Of course, he’s been plenty involved from a distance, but his presence will certainly be welcomed on the Golden State bench.

Dean was a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2004 presidential election. His implementation of the fifty-state strategy as head of the DNC is credited with the Democratic victories in the 2006 and 2008 elections. Afterward, he became a political commentator and consultant to McKenna Long & Aldridge, a law and lobbying firm. Dean graduated from Yale University with a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1971. As a freshman, he requested specifically to room with an African-American. The university housing office complied and Dean roomed with two Southern black students and one white student from Pennsylvania. One of Dean's roommates was Ralph Dawson, the son of a sheet metal worker in Charleston, South Carolina and today a New York City labor lawyer. Dawson said of Dean: Unless you operated from a stereotypic understanding of the Yale white boy as rich, you wouldn't know that about Howard.... When it came to race- and I don't know whether this was a function of intent or just came naturally- Howard was not patronizing in any way. He was willing to confront in discussion what a lot of white students weren't. He would hold his ground. He would respect that I knew forty-two million times more about being black than he did. But that didn't mean he couldn't hold a view on something relating to civil rights that would be as valid as mine. There were lots of well-meaning people at Yale who wanted you to understand that they understood your plight; you'd get into a conversation and they would yield too soon, so we didn't get the full benefit of the exchange. Howard very much thought he was capable of working an issue through. He was inquisitive. And when he came to a conclusion he would be as strong as anybody else. I don't think he's stubborn. He's a guy who's always been comfortable in his own skin. That's something you still see in him today, and it gets him into some degree of controversy. Though eventually eligible to be drafted into the military, he received a deferment for an unfused vertebra. He explained to Tim Russert on Meet the Press, \\"I was really in no hurry to join the military.\\" He briefly tried a career as a stockbroker before deciding on a career in medicine, completing pre-medicine classes at Columbia University. In 1974, Dean's younger brother Charlie, who had been traveling through southeast Asia at the time, was captured and killed by Laotian guerrillas, a tragedy widely reported to have an enormous influence in Dean's life; he wore his brother's belt every day of his presidential campaign.
