Yeo-sol, the former slave of an ambassador, defeats the injured Mongolian general Rambulwha in single combat, but allows him to live and escape.The Koreans flee with the Princess, determined to return her safely to the Ming Emperor to atone for their diplomatic failure. The Mongols pursue, hoping to recover the Princess and marry her to the Yuan Emperor so that he may legitimize his claim over all China. Koreans head for a seaside fortress that the Princess tells them about, where they expect to find safe haven. Along the way, the Koreans pick up a group of Chinese peasants who are also fleeing from the Mongols.Fighting their way through Mongol search parties, the group experiences many internal conflicts stemming from social class, love, and honor.

Charlotte's father, Elbourne, hires D, a dhampir, to find her and rescue her, and alternatively, kill her humanely if she's been turned into a vampire. He offers D 500,000 as a down payment, and offers him 10mil if he carries out the job. D has Elbourne double the payment, and agrees to search for Charlotte. At the same time, Charlotte's older brother hires another group of vampire hunters, the notorious Marcus brothers, composed of the leader Borgoff, a hulking man named Nolt, a blade master named Kyle, a physically disabled psychic named Grove and a woman named Leila who hunts vampires because of a personal grudge rather than for monetary gain. The two parties (D and the Marcus brothers) race inexorably after Meier Link. However, Meier Link hires the mutant Barbarois; a group of lethal mercenary body guards. They consist of Caroline, a shape shifter; Benge, a shadow manipulator; and Machira, a werewolf.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: “Une Femme Mariée” has long been the missing link in Jean-luc Godard’s early filmography. Released late in 1964, rarely screened in this country, and hard to find on video, the French New Wave director’s eighth feature (in four years!) has represented an unseen gap between the playful “Bande a Part” (1964) and the future-is-now dystopia of “Alphaville” (1965). Its title anglicized as “A Married Woman,” the film is touring the nation’s art houses in a digitally restored print ahead of a May Blu-ray release, and it arrives at the Kendall Square Cinema looking like a seductive, inscrutable masterpiece. Why should you see it? Not only is “Woman” the most sensual entry in Godard’s first decade — maybe in his career — but it serves as a pivot-point between the genre games of his immediate past and the cultural critiques to come. And, like all of those movies, it’s hung up on women, their mercurial mystery, their shallowness and depths. Macha Méril plays Charlotte, the femme mariée of the title, a pretty, airheaded Parisienne zigzagging between a husband, Pierre (Philippe Leroy), and a lover, Robert (Bernard Noël). She’s an enigma to both and an insecure void to herself, and Godard films their various entanglements in and out of bed as a series of beautiful, isolated body parts. The cinematographer was Raoul Coutard, Godard’s right hand in the early days (Truffaut’s, too), and the restored black-and-white photography in “A Married Woman” is stunning in the way it captures the silvery opacity of a woman’s skin. The images are erotic yet empty, alluring and withholding; it’s a world of surfaces because that’s what Charlotte thinks matters. For the first time in a Godard movie, though, we feel the vapid consumer culture crowding in, as the heroine obsesses over women’s magazines and the proper bust size. Bra ads and heavy-breathing headlines increasingly dominate the screen; sex is on everyone’s minds and lips and album covers. Charlotte lives strictly in the present but there’s no place to hide there; the soundtrack is filled with her whispered uncertainties and Beethoven string quartets. Beauty in this movie is squeezed out of modern life until it fills the cracks between the characters’ feelings. Plenty of filmmakers after Godard have mimicked his abstract/intellectual approach to cinema, and they’ve generally failed — Terrence Malick is just the latest to crash on the rocks. To see “A Married Woman,” then, is to revisit an improvisational energy unlike any other, the way there have been millions of Dylan imitators but only one Dylan. What sounds like pretentiousness seemed in the young Godard’s hands the only possible way to make movies. At times, it still does. Aspects of this film look ahead to the work to come — the grand romantic disenchantment of 1965’s “Pierrot le Fou,” the pop Marxism of “Masculin Feminin” (1966), even the sociopolitical apocalypse of “Weekend” (1967). But “A Married Woman” exists in a valedictory half-light all its own. In the final shots, the lovers’ disconnected hands part once and for all, and it’s as though Godard were bidding farewell to love itself. Written and directed by Jean-luc Godard. Starring Macha Méril, Bernard Noël, Philippe Leroy. At Kendall Square Cinema. 95 minutes. Unrated (as PG-13: near nudity, frank Francophone frolicking). In French, with subtitles.

Given the following context:  The Ballroom, also known as the Upper Banqueting Hall, has an arched roof and according to Dean likely dates from the 16th century. It contains rare 16th-century wall murals, including one which according to Dean may depict the nursery rhyme \\"Ride a cock horse\\", and another along the east wall depicting a man playing a mandolin. Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room, also known as the Queen Anne Room, the Priest's Room, and Nevill's Room. It had been two rooms, a state bedroom and ante-room, but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room. A blocked-up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole, but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century.North of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room, whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of Adam and Eve and their fall from paradise, as well as the use in Tudor times of the name \\"paradise\\" for a favourite room, often a bedchamber. This room has panelled walls, and a fireplace with a cupboard on the right hand side.

Please answer the following question: When the seasons change from the summer to the fall , the amount of daylight will decrease, and when it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted towards the Sun. Given these facts, how does the amount of daylight change in a location as the  season there changes to fall among the following options: - uncontrolled  - colors  - reduce  - increases  - depends on the hemisphere  - temperature  - stays the same  - decreases A:","output":"As the seasons change from summer to fall, the amount of daylight in a location will generally decrease. This is due to the Earth's axial tilt and its orbit around the Sun, which affects the distribution of sunlight across the planet's surface throughout the year. During summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted towards the Sun. This results in more direct sunlight and longer daylight hours for places in the Northern Hemisphere. Conversely, the South Pole is tilted away from the Sun during this time, meaning less direct sunlight and shorter daylight hours for locations in the Southern Hemisphere. As the Earth continues its orbit and transitions from summer to fall, the axial tilt changes, and the angle of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface becomes less direct. This causes the amount of daylight to gradually decrease in a location as the season progresses. This is most noticeable around the time of the autumn equinox, which typically occurs around September 22nd in the Northern Hemisphere and March 20th in the Southern Hemisphere. On the equinox, day and night are approximately equal in length all around the planet. By the time the seasons fully transition from summer to fall, the amount of daylight in a location is significantly less than it was at the peak of summer. This is true for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, though the specific change in daylight hours will depend on the latitude of the location. Areas closer to the poles will experience more significant differences in daylight hours between seasons, while areas near the equator will see smaller fluctuations in the amount of daylight. In summary, as the seasons change from summer to fall, the amount of daylight in a location generally decreases due to the Earth's changing axial tilt and its orbit around the Sun."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The film opens in the year 1958, where steel heiress Edna Buxton enters a talent contest. Her overbearing mother is at odds with her, arguing that Edna should choose a specific song and wardrobe for the contest. At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition. An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner who takes her under his wing, renames her \\"Denise Waverly\\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male solo artists are groups are far more marketable. The song becomes a hit. Denise (formerly Edna) moves to New York City and becomes a songwriter in the Brill Building. At a party, she meets the arrogant songwriter Howard Caszatt, and despite an awkward initial meeting they become romantically involved. She also reunites with Doris. Denise offers to and writes a song specifically for Doris and her two girlfriends, persuading Milner to audition and hire the group.  In 1965, Howard and Denise begin writing together; they pen a song called \\"Unwanted Number,\\" based on a young girl's unwanted pregnancy.  Although it is banned, it attracts the attention of prominent and influential disc jockey John Murray who, despite the negative attention of the song, credits Denise with sparking the craze for girl groups.","output":"Based on the context provided, the full name of the person who changes their song last minute in the talent contest is Edna Buxton. Born as an heiress to a steel fortune, Edna enters the talent contest and ultimately follows her passion for music, changing not only her song but also her wardrobe for the competition. Despite her mother's disapproval, this decision propels Edna into a career as a successful singer and songwriter. As her career takes off, Edna begins working with Joel Milner, who rebrands her under a new stage name, Denise Waverly, and creates a blue-collar persona for her. This change proves to be crucial, as it opens up doors for Denise in the music industry, allowing her to create a hit song for the Stylettes and eventually become a songwriter at the Brill Building in New York City. In addition to collaborating with multiple artists, Edna Buxton, now known as Denise Waverly, fosters a fruitful partnership with the talented but arrogant Howard Caszatt, culminating in the creation of a song titled \\"Unwanted Number\\". Even though this song deals with a controversial topic—in this case, a young girl's unwanted pregnancy—it garners attention from influential disc jockey John Murray, who applauds Denise for her creativity and originality, subsequently sparking the craze for girl groups in the music scene during that time period. Thus, Edna Buxton, who later adopts the stage name Denise Waverly, is the individual who changes her song at the last moment in the talent contest, setting her on a trajectory for success as an influential singer, songwriter, and catalyst for the girl group phenomenon in the mid-1960s."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The answer is:","output":"Alex behaved this way primarily due to his upbringing and lack of discipline. His parents spoiled him, making him accustomed to getting what he wanted without facing any consequences. As a result, he may have developed a sense of entitlement and a belief that his desires should always be accommodated. This could have led Alex to exhibit domineering behavior in preschool. In preschool, where children interact with peers, teachers, and aides, Alex likely attempted to replicate the power dynamics he experienced at home. He tried to govern every person because he was used to having control and receiving preferential treatment. The unfamiliar environment and expectations of the preschool may have prompted him to assert his dominance more forcefully, in an attempt to recreate the control he had with his parents. Furthermore, his lack of discipline may have hindered his ability to understand and adhere to social norms and boundaries. Without proper guidance from his parents or prior experience in adhering to rules, Alex might not have been aware of the appropriate ways to interact with others, leading to his attempts to govern his classmates, aides, and teachers.

The answer is:","output":"It is possible to describe Cameron as \\"happy\\" in the context of their interaction with Casey this morning, during which they expressed their appreciation for their friendship. However, labeling someone as \\"happy\\" based on a single instance or event can be an oversimplification and not necessarily an accurate representation of their overall character. Cameron's expression of care for their friendship with Casey could indicate that they value personal connections and emotional bonds, which might contribute to their happiness. Being open about their feelings and thoughts may also suggest that Cameron is a communicative and emotionally expressive person. Such qualities could make them appear happy or content, especially when interacting with people they care about. However, it's essential to consider other aspects of Cameron's personality, emotions, and characteristics to provide a more accurate and comprehensive description. People can exhibit a range of emotions and traits, with happiness being just one among many. To give a well-rounded description of Cameron, it would be helpful to gather more information about their interests, values, habits, and experiences in various life situations. This could include observing their behavior in different social settings, discussing their goals and aspirations, and understanding how they cope with challenges and stress. By doing so, we will be able to paint a more accurate picture of Cameron that extends beyond merely labeling them as \\"happy.\\" It can encompass a range of descriptors, such as compassionate, empathetic, resilient, or ambitious, depending on the context and situation.

Lépine first sat in the office of the registrar on the second floor for a while. While there, he was seen rummaging through a plastic bag. He did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. Lépine left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second-floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10 p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.Lépine then separated the nine women from the approximately fifty men and ordered the men to leave. He asked the remaining women whether they knew why they were there, and when one student replied \\"no,\\" he answered: \\"I am fighting feminism.\\" One of the students, Nathalie Provost, said, \\"Look, we are just women studying engineering, not necessarily feminists ready to march on the streets to shout we are against men, just students intent on leading a normal life.\\" Lépine responded, \\"You're women, you're going to be engineers. You're all a bunch of feminists. I hate feminists.\\" He then opened fire on the students from left to right, killing six, and wounding three others, including Provost.  Before leaving the room, he wrote the word shit twice on a student project.Lépine continued into the second-floor corridor and wounded three students before entering another room where...

High, cold ice clouds such as Cirrus or Cumulonimbus show up bright white, lower warmer clouds such as Stratus or Stratocumulus show up as grey with intermediate clouds shaded accordingly. Hot land surfaces will show up as dark-grey or black. One disadvantage of infrared imagery is that low cloud such as stratus or fog can be a similar temperature to the surrounding land or sea surface and does not show up. However, using the difference in brightness of the IR4 channel (10.3–11.5 µm) and the near-infrared channel (1.58–1.64 µm), low cloud can be distinguished, producing a fog satellite picture. The main advantage of infrared is that images can be produced at night, allowing a continuous sequence of weather to be studied.

Information:  - An ascus (plural asci; from Greek  \\"skós\\" 'skin bag') is the sexual spore-bearing cell produced in ascomycete fungi. Asci usually contain eight ascospores, produced by meiosis followed, in most species, by a mitotic cell division. However, asci in some genera or species can occur in numbers of one (e.g. \\"Monosporascus cannonballus\\"), two, four, or multiples of four. In a few cases, the ascospores can bud off conidia that may fill the asci (e.g. \\"Tympanis\\") with hundreds of conidia, or the ascospores may fragment, e.g. some \\"Cordyceps\\", also filling the asci with smaller cells. Ascospores are nonmotile, usually single celled, but not infrequently may be coenocytic (lacking a septum), and in some cases coenocytic in multiple planes. Mitotic divisions within the developing spores populate each resulting cell in septate ascospores with nuclei. The term ocular chamber, or oculus, refers to the epiplasm (the portion of cytoplasm not used in ascospore formation) that is surrounded by the \\"bourrelet\\" (the thickened tissue near the top of the ascus).  - The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal botanical names that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those \\"traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants\\". It was formerly called the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN); the name was changed at the International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 as part of the \\"Melbourne Code\\" which replaces the \\"Vienna Code\\" of 2005. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on Saturday 23 July 2011), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not finished until some time after the congressional meeting. Preliminary wording of some of the articles with the most significant changes has been published in September 2011.  -  In formal nomenclature. When formally naming a taxon, uncertainty about its taxonomic classification can be problematic. The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, stipulates that \\"species and subdivisions of genera must be assigned to genera, and infraspecific taxa must be assigned to species, because their names are combinations\\", but ranks higher than the genus may be assigned \\"incertae sedis\\".  - Dikarya is a subkingdom of Fungi that includes the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, both of which in general produce dikaryons, may be filamentous or unicellular, but are always without flagella. The Dikarya are most of the so-called \\"higher fungi\\", but also include many anamorphic species that would have been classified as molds in historical literature. Phylogenetically the two phyla regularly group together. In a 1998 publication, Thomas Cavalier-Smith referred to this group as the Neomycota.  - Ascomycota is a division or phylum of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, form the subkingdom Dikarya. Its members are commonly known as the sac fungi or ascomycetes. They are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species. The defining feature of this fungal group is the \\"ascus\\" (from Greek: (\\"askos\\"), meaning \\"sac\\" or \\"wineskin\\"), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some species of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. Previously placed in the Deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on morphological or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - Basidiomycota is one of two large divisions that, together with the Ascomycota, constitute the subkingdom Dikarya (often referred to as the \\"higher fungi\\") within the kingdom Fungi.  - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.  - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Coryneliella is a genus of fungi in the Ascomycota phylum . The relationship of this taxon to other taxa within the class is unknown ( incertae sedis ) , and it has not yet been placed with certainty into any class , order , or family . This is a monotypic genus , containing the single species Coryneliella consimilis .  - An ascospore is a spore contained in an ascus or that was produced inside an ascus. This kind of spore is specific to fungi classified as ascomycetes (Ascomycota).    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'parent taxon'.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Povenmire was born in San Diego, California on September 18, 1963, and grew up in the city of Mobile, Alabama. A child prodigy, he began drawing at age two; by the time he was ten, his work was displayed in local art shows. His first efforts in animation included a series of flip books that he produced in his school text books. As a child, Povenmire considered animator Chuck Jones his hero; in a 2009 interview, he stated that \\"every drawing he [Jones] did was beautiful to look at and had so much energy in it\\". Povenmire later became a director on Family Guy, starting with the season two episode, \\"Road to Rhode Island\\". Creator Seth MacFarlane granted Povenmire substantial creative freedom. Povenmire recalled that MacFarlane would tell him \\"We've got two minutes to fill. Give me some visual gags. Do whatever you want. I trust you.\\" Povenmire praised MacFarlane's management style for letting him \\"have [...] fun.\\"  Povenmire brought realism and material from his own experiences to the visual direction of Family Guy. For \\"One if By Clam, Two if By Sea\\" (August 1, 2001), several characters demonstrate Fosse-like moves in prison. To correctly depict the moves, Povenmire asked color artist Cynthia MacIntosh, who had been a professional dancer, to strike poses so he could properly illustrate the sequence. In the episode \\"To Love and Die in Dixie\\" (November 15, 2001), Povenmire drew on his childhood in the Deep South to create and sequence a background scene in which the redneck character nonchalantly kicks a corpse into the nearby river.  \\"Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows\\" (January 17, 2002), a Family Guy episode which Povenmire directed, won the Emmy Award for Best Song. Creator MacFarlane, the recipient of the award, noted that Povenmire deserved to have received the award for the contribution the visuals made to the episode's win. Povenmire jokingly responded \\"That's a nice sentiment and all, but did he offer to give me his? No! And it's not like he doesn't already have two of his own just sitting in his house!\\" Povenmire was nominated for an Annie Award for Directing in an Animated Television Production for the episode \\"PTV\\" (November 6, 2005) but lost out to a fellow Family Guy director Peter Shin, who had directed the episode \\"North by North Quahog\\". Povenmire and several others were also nominated for their work on \\"PTV\\" in the Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour) category at the Primetime Emmy Awards. Povenmire also received the same nomination for \\"Road to Rhode Island.\\"  During Family Guy's brief cancellation, Povenmire was offered a job as storyboard director of the series SpongeBob SquarePants.

Davey Gillen, a new IRA prisoner, arrives; he is categorised as a \\"non-conforming prisoner\\" for his refusal to wear the prison uniform. He is sent to his cell naked with only a blanket. His cellmate, Gerry, has smeared the walls with faeces from floor to ceiling as part of the no wash protest. The two men get to know each other and we see them living within the cell. Gerry's girlfriend sneaks a radio in by wrapping it and keeping it in her vagina. Prison officers forcibly and violently remove the prisoners from their cells and beat them before pinning them down to cut their long hair and beards, grown as part of the no-wash protest. The prisoners resist, Sands spitting into Lohan's face, who responds by punching him in the face and then swings again, only to miss and punch the wall, causing his knuckles to bleed. He cuts Sands' hair and beard; the men throw Sands in the bathtub and scrub him clean before hauling him away again. Lohan is then seen smoking a cigarette, as in the opening scenes, his hand bloodied. Later, the prisoners are taken out of their cells and given second-hand civilian clothing. The guards are seen snickering as they are handed to the prisoners who respond, after Sands' initial action, by tearing up the clothes and wrecking their cells. For the next interaction with the prisoners, a large number of riot police are seen coming into the prison on a truck. They line up and beat their batons against their shields and scream to scare the prisoners, who are hauled from their cells, then forced to run the gauntlet between the lines of riot police where they are beaten with the batons by at least 10 men at one time.

Process:  - You find an empty ice cube tray - You fill the tray with warm water - You carefully place the tray on an even surface in a freezer that is at least 32 degree Farhenheit, the freezing point of water - The water begins to get colder until it starts to freeze solid - The water expands as it freezes, one of the few liquids that has greater volume as a solid - Because you used warm water, the gasses in the water had evaporated out, so you will have nice clear ice cubes without cracks from the trapped gasses -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more water available happens, how will it affect there will be more water cubes being frozen.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the perturbation of having more water available will directly affect the process of freezing ice cubes. If more water is available, you can fill up more ice cube trays and produce more frozen ice cubes, given that there is enough space in the freezer to accommodate the additional trays. The perturbation will not have an indirect effect on the freezing process itself, as the factors affecting the water freezing, such as temperature and time, will remain the same. However, adding more trays with water to the freezer might slightly increase the time required for all the trays to freeze completely, because the freezer will need to distribute the cold air and chill the additional trays. This effect, though, should not significantly impact each tray's freezing process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The expression of an organism's genotype is called its phenotype . The phenotype refers to the organism's traits, such as purple or white flowers. Different genotypes may produce the same phenotype. This will be the case if one allele is dominant to the other. Both BB and Bb genotypes in Table 6.1 have purple flowers. That's because the B allele is dominant to the b allele, which is recessive. The terms dominant and recessive are the terms Mendel used to describe his \\"factors. \\" Today we use them to describe alleles. In a Bb heterozygote, only the dominant B allele is expressed. The recessive b allele is expressed only in the bb genotype.   Q: In a heterozygote with one dominant and one recessive allele, which is expressed?

(May 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 2001, William Hundert, a retired Classics teacher, is flown out to a luxurious resort in the Hamptons owned by one of his former students in order to be the guest of honor in an impromptu reunion. As he gets settled in he reflects on the turn of events in a flashback of his time working at Saint Benedict's Academy, a prestigious preparatory school. Twenty-eight years earlier, a younger Mr. Hundert is enthusiastic about the start of the school year. His class turns out to be a strict yet inspiring lesson for the freshmen. They include laid-back Louis Masoudi, introverted Martin Blythe, and studious Deepak Mehta. Hundert inspires his students to study hard in order to become one of the three contestants for The Emperor's Club and be crowned \\"Mr. Julius Caesar\\", an academic competition between top three students of his class regarding the Classics. When the headmaster explains the contest to the students, he mentions that Blythe's father was once a \\"Mr. Julius Caesar\\". Hundert's orderly world is shaken when a new student, Sedgewick Bell, walks into his classroom late. Bell is the cocky son of a senior U.S. senator who possesses none of Hundert's principles. After Sedgewick plays the class clown, Hundert asks him to name a single Roman Emperor. When Bell cannot, Hundert has the other students perfectly recite the line of succession of the Roman Empire. Hundert also makes a trip to Washington, D.C. to meet with Senator Bell. Bell's father is uninterested in his son's character development, telling Hundert just to teach Bell so he can graduate. In a phone call, Senator Bell chastises Sedgewick for wasting his fatherâs time and money. After seeing him chastened, Hundert tries to become a mentor to Bell in order to make him a better man.

Problem:Question: What year was the company that imported calico prints to England founded? Passage 1:In the 18th century, England was famous for its woollen and worsted cloth. That industry, centred in the east and south in towns such as Norwich, jealously protected their product. Cotton processing was tiny: in 1701 only of cottonwool was imported into England, and by 1730 this had fallen to . This was due to commercial legislation to protect the woollen industry. Cheap calico prints, imported by the East India Company from Hindustān (India), had become popular. In 1700 an Act of Parliament passed to prevent the importation of dyed or printed calicoes from India, China or Persia. This caused demand to switch to imported grey cloth instead—calico that had not been finished—dyed or printed. These were printed with popular patterns in southern England. Also, Lancashire businessmen produced grey cloth with linen warp and cotton weft, known as fustian, which they sent to London for finishing. Cottonwool imports recovered though, and by 1720 were almost back to their 1701 levels. Again the woollen manufacturers, in true protectionist fashion, claimed that the imports were taking jobs away from workers in Coventry. The Woollen, etc., Manufactures Act 1720 was passed, enacting fines against anyone caught wearing printed or stained calico muslins. Neckcloths and fustians were exempted. The Lancashire manufacturers exploited this exemption; coloured cotton weft with linen warp were specifically permitted by the 1736 Manchester Act. There now was an artificial demand for woven cloth.  Passage 2:After education at Canterbury Boys' High School (where he was a contemporary of former Liberal Australian prime minister John Howard), Windschuttle was a journalist on newspapers and magazines in Sydney. He completed a BA (first class honours in history) at the University of Sydney in 1969, and an MA (honours in politics) at Macquarie University in 1978. He enrolled in a PhD but did not submit it; instead he published it under the title The Media with Penguin Books. In 1973, he became a tutor in Australian history at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). Between 1977 and 1981, Windschuttle was lecturer in Australian history and in journalism at the New South Wales Institute of Technology (now the University of Technology, Sydney) before returning to UNSW in 1983 as lecturer/senior lecturer in social policy. He resigned from UNSW in 1993 and since then he has been publisher of Macleay Press and a regular visiting and guest lecturer on history and historiography at American universities. In June 2006, he was appointed to the Board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), Australia's non-commercial public broadcaster.  Passage 3:Quinn emigrated from Canada with a falsified passport and entered the adult entertainment industry in the late 1980s, while she was underage by using a fake ID. She began stripping in Canada when she was 14. Two years later she met pornographic actress Erica Boyer and moved to Los Angeles with her. Quinn began performing in adult films at the age of 16 after Boyer introduced her to agent Jim South. Quinn misrepresented her birth year as 1968, which would have made her 22 at the time of her adult film debut. Her first scene was in the film Space Virgins, and it was a five-person group sex scene with two men and two other women, besides Quinn.

Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Cross-country skiing. Yes or no? Answer: The activity is popular in many places with large snowfields, primarily Northern Europe , Canada , and Alaska . Question: what are the different types of cross country skiing Answer:","output":"Cross-country skiing, also known as Nordic skiing, is a popular winter sport that involves traversing diverse snow-covered landscapes using skis and poles. It has deep roots in the snowy regions of Northern Europe, Canada, and Alaska, and has since expanded to snowy locales across the globe. Cross-country skiing is not only an enjoyable recreational activity but also serves as a low-impact and effective form of exercise with numerous health benefits. There are several different types of cross-country skiing, each with its unique techniques, equipment, and styles. Some of the most common types include: 1. Classic Cross-Country Skiing: This is the most traditional and well-known form of cross-country skiing. Classic skiing involves a forward and backward gliding motion in a set track with parallel grooves, allowing the skier to move efficiently over the snow. The technique relies on diagonal strides, double poling, and herringbone movements for uphill climbs. Classic skis are typically longer and narrower than other types of cross-country skis, with a grip zone for traction during diagonal strides. 2. Skate Skiing: Also known as freestyle skiing, skate skiing is a more recent development in cross-country skiing and involves a lateral V-shaped push-off with each ski, similar to ice skating. The technique requires more energy and power than classic skiing but can achieve higher speeds and is often used in races. Skate skis are generally shorter, lighter, and have a stiffer flex than classic skis, with no grip zone as the entire ski relies on the edges for propulsion. 3. Ski Touring: Ski touring is a form of cross-country skiing that focuses on exploring backcountry trails and off-track terrain rather than groomed trails. This type of skiing often requires wider skis with metal or synthetic grip zones for better grip on untracked snow, as well as climbing skins for steep ascents. Ski touring often places greater emphasis on survival skills, navigation, and proficiency in various snow conditions. 4. Telemark Skiing: Telemark skiing is a hybrid of cross-country and alpine skiing that employs a free-heel binding system, allowing the skier to perform deep knee bends and lunges during downhill turns while maintaining the ability to glide in cross-country terrain. The technique is named after its origin in the Telemark region of Norway and is known for its fluid and graceful movements. Telemark skis are usually wider than traditional cross-country skis, providing added stability and control for downhill turning. 5. Skijoring: Skijoring is a form of cross-country skiing in which a skier is pulled by an animal, typically a dog or a horse. This type of skiing emphasizes the partnership between the skier and the animal, coordinating their movements and speed. Skijoring skis can be either classic or skate ski equipment, depending on the specific preferences of the skier and the requirements of the terrain. Each of these cross-country skiing styles offers different challenges and appeals to a broad array of enthusiasts. Whether one is seeking an intense workout, a serene wintertime nature experience, or an adrenaline-fueled adventure, the diverse world of cross-country skiing has something to offer for everyone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Use a cleanser with some warm water and a soft washcloth to cleanse your face. Gently massage the cleanser into your skin to remove makeup, dirt, and impurities.  Rinse well with warm water, then splash some cold water on your face when you finish. Then, blot your face dry with a clean towel. Pour some toner on the pad until it feels damp but not overly soaked. You could also use a cotton ball for this step if it’s all you have on hand. However, cotton pads will soak up less product than cotton balls, which will help conserve your toner. Use the cotton pad to gently wipe the product over your face, neck, and décolletage. Avoid the eye area and be careful not to get product on your lips. Pay particular attention to crevasses and difficult-to-reach areas including the brows, sides of the nose, near the ears, and hairline. The toner will help remove the impurities that the cleanser couldn’t reach, as well as any cleanser residue or salt, chlorine, or chemicals found in tap water. Because a spray application can only dilute impurities, not remove them, you should always use a wiping toner first. However, if you like the refreshing feeling of a misted toner, you can make it an additional toning step after using a wipe toner. Since most toners are water-based, they absorb into the skin fairly quickly. Make sure to let the toner sink in completely before applying other products--this will help your skin retain moisture and protect against impurities. If you use any acne treatments, such as benzoyl peroxide, or additional moisturizers, make sure to apply those to your face after toning. Using the toner beforehand will cleanse the skin fully and allow the acne and moisturizer products to sink more deeply into the skin. Generally, you should apply toner once in the morning and once at night. In the morning, the toner will help remove any sebum produced during the night and balance your skin’s pH. At night, the toner will help complete your cleansing routine by removing any dust, makeup, or impurities that the cleanser missed, as well as any oily residue left over from your cleanser. If your skin is especially dry, you may want to start by using toner only once a day at night. Excessive use of toner may dry your skin out more. If you find your skin getting particularly dry, consider investing in a formula for dry skin to minimize dehydration.

While visiting Arlington National Cemetery last month, Lindsey Stone thought it would be amusing to snap a photo of herself \\"disrespecting\\" the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier by flipping it off and pretending to make noise.      She later uploaded the photo to her Facebook page, thinking her friends would get a kick out of it as well.      To her chagrin, many of the comments she received were decidedly unsupportive of her shenanigans, so she decided to try and nip the outrage in the bud by posting a mea culpa of sorts.      \\"Whoa whoa whoa... wait,\\" Stone wrote on October 20th. \\"This is just us, being the douchebags that we are, challenging authority in general. Much like the pic posted the night before, of me smoking right next to a no smoking sign. OBVIOUSLY we meant NO disrespect to people that serve or have served our country.\\"      The uproar seemed to die down for a minute, but soon enough the photo found its way to someone with enough time to take the indignation to the next level.      A Facebook page called \\"Fire Lindsey Stone\\" was created less than a day ago and has already amassed over 4,000 likes. Started by a former servicemember, the page calls for Stone to be terminated from her job at LIFE, a Cape Cod-based nonprofit that houses adults with learning disabilities.      \\"Let her employer know how much of a waste of oxygen this disrespectful person is,\\" wrote the page's creator, who notes that Stone's trip to Arlington National Cemetery was paid for by the organization.      Unable to ignore the flood of comments from irate anti-Lindsey Stone activists, LIFE released the following statement a few minutes ago:      On Nov. 19 at approximately 6 p.m., we became aware that one of our employees had posted an offensive, inappropriate photograph on her personal Facebook page. The photo was taken at a national historic site in October by a fellow employee during a trip to Washington, D.C. attended by 40 residents and eight staff. The photo has since been removed from Facebook, and both employees have been placed on unpaid leave pending the results of an internal investigation. This photograph in no way reflects the opinions or values of the LIFE organization, which holds our nation's veterans in the highest regard. We are proud to have veterans serving on our staff and board of trustees, and we value their service. The men and women who have selflessly fought and sacrificed their lives to protect the rights and lives of Americans deserve our utmost respect and gratitude. We are acutely aware that this photo has done a disservice to veterans and we are deeply saddened that it was taken and shared in a public medium.      The most important question that must now be asked is \\"does Lindsey Stone deserve to have her future employment imperiled — at LIFE or elsewhere — because of an admittedly dumb photo posted in jest on her personal Facebook page?\\"      On Fark, where the topic has incited heated debate, one user decried America's \\"out of control military worship.\\" Another user retorted that it wasn't military worship \\"to show a little goddamn respect once in a while.\\"      Meanwhile, Stone has deleted all of her Facebook posts save for a few friend requests. It seems unlikely that she will issue another statement, but, at this point, would the Internet even care what she had to say?      [images via wizbang] ||||| BOSTON (CBS) – Two women have been placed on unpaid leave from their jobs after their photo at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia angered thousands of people on Facebook.      UPDATE: Women fired after photo outrage      Lindsey Stone was visiting the Tomb of the Unknowns last month on a business trip when she posed for a picture next to a sign that reads “silence and respect.”      In the photo, Stone is pretending to yell and she’s showing her middle finger.      The photo, taken by co-worker Jamie Schuh, went viral and sparked anger among veterans.      “I can understand why veterans would be all upset over this,” says Edward LeBlanc who was in the Air Force for 20 years and served two tours in Vietnam. “It’s disrespectful, she’s telling us to go “F” ourselves and I don’t think that’s real bright and good for anybody.”      Some angry comments were posted on the Facebook page of their employer, Living Independently Forever, Inc.,(LIFE) a non-profit organization in Hyannis that helps adults with disabilities on Cape Cod.      The uproar forced the organization to post this statement Tuesday afternoon:      “On Nov. 19 at approximately 6 p.m., we became aware that one of our employees had posted an offensive, inappropriate photograph on her personal Facebook page. The photo was taken at a national historic site in October by a fellow employee during a trip to Washington, D.C. attended by 40 residents and eight staff.

We are acutely aware that this photo has done a disservice to veterans and we are deeply saddened that it was taken and shared in a public medium.”      Stone and Schuh would not comment on camera, but released a statement late Tuesday night:      “We sincerely apologize for all the pain we have caused by posting the picture we took in Washington DC on Facebook. While posted on a public forum, the picture was intended only for our own amusement. We never meant any disrespect to any of the people nationwide who have served this country and defended our freedom so valiantly. It was meant merely as a visual pun, intending to depict the exact opposite of what the sign said, and had absolutely nothing to do with the location it was taken or the people represented there. We never meant to cause any harm or disrespect to anyone, particularly our men and women in uniform. We realize it was in incredibly poor taste, and are deeply sorry for the offense we have caused.      We would also like to apologize to LIFE, Inc. It is an amazing organization that provides invaluable services to adults with learning and developmental disabilities. We are beyond remorseful that our actions have caused them such undue public scrutiny. The disrespect implied by our picture has nothing at all to do with LIFE’s mission statement or values. We regret having caused any suffering to the staff members, residents, families and friends.      Again, we very sincerely apologize to everyone who took offense to the photo. We realize that it was an ignorant and distasteful thing for us to do, but we truly meant no harm. We are deeply sorry. – Lindsey Stone and Jamie Schuh”      Lindsey’s father Peter spoke with WBZ-TV about the incident.      “She had no intention of upsetting or offending anyone,” says Peter Stone. “It was poor judgment and she regrets every part of it.”      Peter says Lindsey loved her job, but there are consequences for every action.      “That was a private page,” he says. “She was goofing around and it got taken off the page.”      “She is very, very sorry for what she did,” says her mother Jeanne, “and she never meant it to be disrespectful to anybody.”      Sarah Wunsch, a Staff Attorney with the ACLU of Massachusetts does not think the women should not lose their jobs over the photo.      “Other people have the right to say, ‘I think she’s a jerk or she’s disrespectful.’ I suppose they have the right to call for her to be fired,” says Wunsch. “But it doesn’t mean the employer should give into that.”      “Offensiveness shouldn’t be the standard for what gets to be able to be said, because what’s offensive to you may not be offensive to me and vice versa,” says Wunsch.      Lindsey’s father says he understands why people are offended.      “I don’t think she was reacting to the site (Arlington Cemetery), she was reacting to the sign,” he says. “I’m appalled myself.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Lindsey Stone, who thought it would be amusing to take a disrespectful photo at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery and post it on her Facebook page, faced significant backlash from the public.

An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” What is Meade promoting to change the situation. Pick the correct answer from the following options: - an initiative on the ballot to amend the state's constitution. - not enough information - a proposal on prison reform. - a national debate.

Movie title: Counter-Attack Movie plot: In 1942, both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union are gathering forces and supplies in one particular sector of the Eastern Front for a major attack. The Soviets are secretly constructing a bridge at night over a river. To avoid detection, it is being built underwater, just below the surface. In an attempt to find out where the Germans plan to strike, Colonel Semenov (George Macready) has a small paratrooper unit dropped behind enemy lines to attack a divisional headquarters and hopefully take an officer prisoner for interrogation. The local partisans, led by the wily Kostyuk (Roman Bohnen), provide a guide, Lisa Elenko (Marguerite Chapman). The attack succeeds at first. Alexei Kulkov (Paul Muni), one of the paratroopers, takes seven Germans prisoner in the basement. Then, just as Elenko brings him a message, German artillery hits the building, causing it to collapse and trap them in the spacious cellar. Afterward, Kulkov's dog sniffs out where his master is buried and starts digging. This alerts one of Kulkov's comrades, who communicates with him by tapping on a metal pipe in code. Learning that Kulkov has caught an officer, he leaves to get help. Kulkov is in no hurry to dig out. Though the prisoners rank no higher than a sergeant, he is convinced one of them is an officer in disguise, based on a pistol and a monocle he has found. He begins questioning the men one by one, but while he rules out ex-miner Stillman (Rudolph Anders) and a former magician (Philip Van Zandt), he cannot pinpoint his man. An eighth German soldier, thought to be dead, wakes up and attacks. In the struggle, the lone lantern is extinguished and Elenko is stabbed in the shoulder. However, Kulkov kills him and regains control of the situation. Oddly, Elenko is certain that one of the Germans tried to help her in the darkness. Kulkov decides to try a ploy. He orders the magician to go around the corner of the main room out of sight of the others. He knocks the German out and then fires one round, making the rest think he has exacted... A:","output":"In the movie Counter-Attack, it is the Soviets who launch the offensive by sending a small paratrooper unit led by Colonel Semenov behind enemy lines. Their main objective is to attack a German divisional headquarters, capture an officer for interrogation, and gather intelligence on the Germans' plan for their major attack on the Eastern Front. This offensive is essential to the overall plot, as it fuels the tension and conflict between the characters throughout the film. Contributing to the intrigue and suspense in the story is the construction of an underwater bridge by the Soviets, intended to conceal their movement and preparations from the Germans. Meanwhile, the Germans are amassing forces in the same sector, suggesting an imminent face-off between the two sides. The film's title, \\"Counter-Attack,\\" implies that the plot revolves around the theme of strategic maneuvers and actions undertaken by both parties in response to the actions and advances of their adversaries. The movie features an interesting blend of characters, including a resourceful paratrooper named Alexei Kulkov and Lisa Elenko, a local partisan guide. Their efforts, combined with the help of other characters like the partisans led by Kostyuk, make for an engaging and thrilling story. As Kulkov's mission progresses and he gets trapped with the captured German soldiers, the plot thickens, and the audience is left to wonder who among them is the elusive disguised officer. To better determine whether investing in this film proposal is worthwhile, consider the following factors: 1) Genre and audience appeal: Counter-Attack is a war film set during World War II, with a focus on the Eastern Front. The movie offers suspense, action, and drama - elements which have proven to appeal to a broad range of audiences. Moreover, the World War II setting has historically been popular in the film industry.    2) Cast and crew: A strong cast is essential to bring the movie to life, from actors such as George Macready, Marguerite Chapman, and Paul Muni to others who can successfully portray the diverse characters in the script. The crew, including the director and cinematographer, should have experience in creating war films to ensure a high-quality final product. 3) Budget and expected revenue: You should assess the financial aspects of the film proposal to ensure it aligns with your investment goals. This would include expenses like production, marketing, and distribution, as well as potential box office revenues and profit margins. If the project offers a good return on investment, it could be a viable option. 4) Current market trends: Consider the current state of the film industry and audience preferences to determine if this movie proposal is likely to succeed. War films are typically well-received, but it's essential to analyze contemporaneous market trends, competing titles, and international appeal when making your decision. Ultimately, Counter-Attack boasts a gripping plot, compelling characters, and an intriguing historical backdrop, which are key ingredients in creating a successful and engaging film. Assessing the factors mentioned above can help you make an informed decision as you contemplate whether to invest in this film proposal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Justification: Ensuring the lid is secure prevents any ingredients from spilling out during the pulsing process and keeps the countertop clean. Step 2: Pulse the ingredients together until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Justification: Pulsing is a gentle way to incorporate the butter into the flour mixture, preventing over-mixing and ensuring the right texture for the pastry dough. Step 3: Slowly add ice-cold water. Justification: Gradually incorporating ice-cold water into the mixture helps in achieving a flaky pie crust and also helps the dough to come together without becoming too wet. Step 4: Observe the dough for optimal consistency. Justification: Monitoring the dough while adding water ensures it reaches the desired consistency (when it begins to clump together) and doesn't end up too wet or dry.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers.  - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law.  - Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the south of the province, in an area of foothills and prairie, about east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies. In the 2011 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,096,833 and a metropolitan population of 1,214,839, making it the largest city in Alberta, and the third-largest municipality and fifth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada.  - Vancouver, officially the City of Vancouver, is a coastal seaport city on the mainland of British Columbia, Canada, and the most populous city in the province.  - An official language is a language that is given a special legal status in a particular country, state, or other jurisdiction. Typically a country's official language refers to the language used within government (e.g., courts, parliament, administration). Since \\"the means of expression of a people cannot be changed by any law\\", the term \\"official language\\" does not typically refer to the language used by a people or country, but by its government.  - Quebec (pronounced or ) is the second-most populous province of Canada and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west.  - La Sarre is a town in northwestern Quebec, Canada, and is the most populous town and seat of the Abitibi-Ouest Regional County Municipality. It is located at the intersection of Routes 111 and 393, on the La Sarre River, a tributary of Lake Abitibi.  - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.  - Quebec City (pronounced or ) officially Québec) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. In 2015 the city had a population estimate of 545,485, and the metropolitan area had a population of 806,400, making it Canada's seventh-largest metropolitan area and Quebec's second-largest city after Montreal, which is about to the southwest.   - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity.  - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement.  - Montreal officially Montréal in both Canadian English and French, is the most populous municipality in Quebec and the 2nd-most populous in Canada. Originally called \\"Ville-Marie\\", or \\"City of Mary,\\" it is named after Mount Royal, the triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city. The city is on the Island of Montreal, which took its name from the same source as the city, and a few much smaller peripheral islands, the largest of which is Île Bizard. It has a distinct four-season continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold snowy winters.  - Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; the two form the core of the OttawaGatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR). The 2011 census reported a population of 883,391, making it the fourth-largest city in Canada; and 1,236,324 within the CMA, making it the fourth-largest CMA in Canada. The City of Ottawa reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 2015.  - Abitibi-Témiscamingue is an administrative region located in southwestern Québec, Canada, along the border with Ontario. It became part of the province in 1898. It has a land area of 57,674.26 km (22,268.16 sq mi). The region is divided into five regional county municipalities (\\"French\\": municipalité régionale de comté, or MRC) and 79 municipalities. Its economy continues to be dominated by resource extraction industries. These include logging, mining all along the rich geologic Cadillac Fault between Val d'Or and Rouyn-Noranda, as well as agriculture.  - Villa rustica (countryside villa) was the term used by the ancient Romans to denote a villa set in the open countryside, often as the hub of a large agricultural estate (\\"latifundium\\"). The adjective \\"rusticum\\" was used to distinguish it from an urban or resort villa. The \\"villa rustica\\" would thus serve both as a residence of the landowner and his family (and retainers) and also as a farm management centre. It would often comprise separate buildings to accommodate farm labourers and sheds and barns for animals and crops. In modern British archaeology, a \\"villa rustica\\" is commonly (and misleadingly) referred to simply as a \\"Roman villa\\".  - In physical geography, tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term \\"tundra\\" comes through Russian  (\\"tûndra\\") from the Kildin Sami word \\"tndâr\\" \\"uplands\\", \\"treeless mountain tract\\". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline.  - The Canada 2011 Census is a detailed enumeration of the Canadian population on May 10, 2011. Statistics Canada, an agency of the Canadian government, conducts a nationwide census every five years. In 2011, it consisted of a mandatory short form census questionnaire and an inaugural National Household Survey (NHS), a voluntary survey which replaced the mandatory long form census questionnaire; this substitution was the focus of much controversy. Completion of the (short form) census is mandatory for all Canadians, and those who do not complete it may face penalties ranging from fines to jail time.  - Statistics Canada, which was formed in 1971, is the Government of Canada government agency commissioned with producing statistics to help better understand Canada, its population, resources, economy, society, and culture. Its headquarters is in Ottawa.  - Edmonton is the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta. Edmonton is on the North Saskatchewan River and is the centre of the Edmonton Capital Region, which is surrounded by Alberta's central region.  - Ville is the modern French word of Latin origin now meaning \\"city\\" or \\"town\\", but the first meaning in the Middle Ages was \\"farm\\" (from Gallo-Romance < Latin \\"villa rustica\\") and then \\"village\\". The derivative suffix \\"-ville\\" is commonly used in English in names of cities, towns and villages.  - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.  - Abitibi-Ouest Regional County Municipality (Abitibi West) is a regional county municipality located in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region of Quebec. Its seat is La Sarre.  - The term regional county municipality or RCM (\\"municipalité régionale de comté, MRC\\") is used in Quebec to refer to one of 87 county-like political entities. In some older English translations they were called county regional municipality.  - Macamic is a ville in northwestern Quebec , Canada , in the Abitibi - Ouest Regional County Municipality .

In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama  Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting  Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of  Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about  Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on  Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about  Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing  Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of  Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.  After reading the above, is \\"1999\\" the correct answer to the question \\"On what date did Abu Zubaydah say, \\"The time for training is over.\\"?\\"?","output":"Yes, \\"1999\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"On what date did Abu Zubaydah say, \\"The time for training is over.\\"?\\" because it happened on November 30, 1999, as mentioned in the text."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: \\"Which English-born conductor worked with orchestras in Cincinatti, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Hollywood, New York and Houston, and collaborated with Walt Disney to produce the film \\"\\"Fantasia\\"\\"?\\"","output":"The English-born conductor who worked with orchestras in Cincinnati, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Hollywood, New York, and Houston, and collaborated with Walt Disney to produce the film \\"Fantasia,\\" was Leopold Stokowski. Born in London on April 18, 1882, Stokowski grew up to become one of the most renowned and influential conductors of the 20th century, working with some of the most prestigious orchestras in the world. Leopold Stokowski began his musical studies at a young age, starting with the piano and violin. He attended the Royal College of Music in London and later studied at the Paris Conservatoire. In 1909, he moved to the United States, where he began working as an organist and choir director in New York City. His career as a conductor began in earnest when he was appointed the conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in 1909. In 1912, Stokowski moved on to become the conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, a position he held until 1938. Under his leadership, the Philadelphia Orchestra became one of the most highly respected orchestras in the world. Stokowski introduced many innovations and changes to the traditional orchestral setup, including changes to seating positions, emphasizing the importance of the lower string sections, and encouraging the use of \\"free bowing,\\" which allowed musicians more freedom of expression. Stokowski also had a notable career with the San Francisco Symphony, where he served as the principal guest conductor from 1950-1963. He founded the Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra in 1945, which was specially created for the prestigious outdoor music venue in Los Angeles. Additionally, Stokowski conducted the New York City Symphony from 1944-1945 and held the title of Music Director for the Houston Symphony from 1955-1961, further adding to his illustrious career as a conductor throughout the United States. Leopold Stokowski's collaboration with Walt Disney on the animated movie \\"Fantasia\\" is perhaps one of his most famous and enduring accomplishments. Released in 1940, \\"Fantasia\\" features eight animated segments set to classical music, which were performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra under Stokowski's direction. Stokowski not only conducted the music for the film but also served as a musical consultant and helped to shape the overall creative vision for the project. He even appeared in the film as a live-action sequence, sharing an on-screen handshake with Mickey Mouse during the iconic \\"Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" segment. Throughout his career, Stokowski was a champion of new music and was known for presenting world premieres of several important 20th-century compositions. He was also an advocate for bringing classical music to wider audiences, and his work on \\"Fantasia\\" is a prime example of this mission. Leopold Stokowski passed away on September 13, 1977, in Nether Wallop, Hampshire, England, but his legacy as a distinguished conductor and orchestrator continues to influence the world of classical music to this day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Did you know that although peanuts look like nuts and taste like nuts, they aren't nuts at all? They belong to the pea family, so they are called peanuts. The peanut grows flowers above ground, but its \\"fruit\\" grows underground. It grows in more countries than most other \\"nuts\\". The peanut is a native South American plant. Scientists believe that it grew wild in Brazil long ago. They think that for several thousand years the early peoples of South America made it a part of their diet. These peoples were nomads who moved on when a natural food could no longer be found in one area. Along the way they probably let fall some peanuts, which got into the ground and grew. This is believed to be the way the plant reached the place where the Incas lived. The Incas, from about 1100 to 1532, thought highly of peanuts. The peanuts were eaten in several forms and used as sacrificial offerings to the Incan Sun God. Later in the 16thcentury, European soldiers had brought peanuts to other parts of the world, including North America, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Pacific Islands. Although peanuts were found native in South America, they are now grown in almost every country that has warm weather. India produces the most peanuts. China's production is next, followed by the United States. The peanut is special in more ways than one. It can be eaten raw, boiled, roasted, or fried. Hundreds of widely different products have been made from it. Carver, an American scientist, set himself the task of discovering new uses for eating and for many other products. Peanuts are very highly _ and are also high in protein  . Americans use about seven-tenths of their protein in the form of meat. In India, where the poor can't pay for meat or milk, peanut meal and peanut milk have been produced. These have been a great help to the poor.

Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease. It is noteworthy that these Haredi Jews often have extremely large families.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A Lightning Rod on U.T. Board, Regent Is Not Deterred On Feb. 12, Gene Powell, the chairman of the University of Texas System Board of Regents, sent a note to Francisco G. Cigarroa, chancellor of the U.T. System, about the newest regents appointed by Gov. Rick Perry. The new members “all have extensive experience in higher education and all of them are hard core conservatives. And none of them are shy. We will see no ‘break in’ period from these individuals,” he wrote. \\"If I read some of the stuff about me that I read in the paper, I'd be against me,\\" said Alex Cranberg, regent of the University of Texas System. Expanded coverage of Texas is produced by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit news organization. To join the conversation about this article, go to texastribune.org. It was an early hint of the changes afoot at the U.T. board and the tense months — some of the most tumultuous in institutional memory, with the regents seemingly pitted against the flagship university in a highly public spat — that lay ahead. Of that new crop of board members, none have received more scrutiny than Alex Cranberg. Sitting in the student center at the University of Texas campus in Austin in early June, Mr. Cranberg, the 56-year-old chairman of Aspect Holdings, a lucrative energy company based in Denver, said the time had come to “push a reset button” on the relationship between the regents and the leadership of the university. Individuals who encountered Mr. Cranberg as an undergraduate student at U.T. — he received a degree in petroleum engineering in 1977 — remember him as a spirited debater who enjoyed challenging others and being challenged in return. And it may not be what he expected, but he has certainly been challenged lately. Suspicion has surrounded Mr. Cranberg from Day 1. First, there was the speed with which he became a regent — one of the most prestigious appointments a governor can bestow upon a Texan. Mr. Cranberg received the nod just two weeks after registering to vote in the state following a move from Colorado for personal reasons. “Frankly, I’ve got a lot going on and would not have moved specifically for this job,” he said. Then there were his associations. Mr. Cranberg is a longtime friend of Jeff Sandefer, the Austin energy investor who wrote a controversial set of seven proposals for changing higher education and has promoted them with Mr. Perry’s aid. “I don’t expect anybody to tell me what to do and have me do it,” Mr. Cranberg said. Of all the regents, Mr. Cranberg was the one closest to Rick O’Donnell, a fellow former Coloradoan and an associate of Mr. Sandefer who had publicly questioned the value of academic research. The U.T. System’s hiring of Mr. O’Donnell as a special adviser to the board was one of the sparks that lit the statewide controversy. (Mr. O’Donnell’s employment was terminated after 49 days, during which he was “unfairly attacked,” Mr. Cranberg said.) At the height of the debate, Mr. Cranberg was widely considered by critics in the Legislature and the academic community to be the ringleader of a bloc of regents who were influenced by Mr. Sandefer and others aiming to, among other things, stage an attack on academic research and coordinate an ouster of U.T.’s president, William Powers Jr. Most recently, after a request for extensive data on all the faculty members in the system, Mr. Cranberg was accused by the same groups of trying to micromanage the universities. “If I read some of the stuff about me that I read in the paper, I’d be against me,” said Mr. Cranberg, who denied all the details of what he called a “caricature.” When Mr. Cranberg heard that his data request was overwhelming the small staff at the University of Texas-Pan American, he asked the university’s president, Robert S. Nelsen, to write a grant proposal for him to personally finance. “It surprised me very much,” Mr. Nelsen said. “It was a very generous offer on his part.” When asked if other universities shared concerns publicly expressed by many in Austin about the data, Mr. Nelsen said: “I know my faculty are concerned and my staff are concerned. We’re not worried, but we would like a better idea of what the data will be used for.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. The University of Texas System Board of Regents is experiencing significant changes as new members with extensive experience in higher education and conservative perspectives have been appointed by Governor Rick Perry. 2.

Article:","output":"Article: Title: Matching Culinary Delights with Liquor: A Comprehensive Approach In the realm of gastronomy, the mastery of combining flavors goes beyond merely pairing food with an appropriate wine. Integrating spirits and liquors into the cooking process effectively open up a whole new world of culinary possibilities. That is why we are diving into the art of matching your favorite foods with choice liquors – a process offering an explosive burst of flavor.  To start, the key to any successful culinary adventure is considered measurement and selection of ingredients. Whether it is baking or cooking savory dishes, every ingredient needs to be measured out to create a harmonious interplay of flavors. The same meticulous approach applies when incorporating liquors into your cooking, considering the potent flavors they bring. The involvement of alcoholic beverages in cooking isn't a new concept; chefs worldwide have been using wine, beer, and spirits to enhance their dishes' flavor profiles for centuries. However, when it comes to integrating liquors, not any alcohol will do, and here's why: the 'proof' of a liquor matters significantly. Unlike wines or beers, liquors are intensely flavored, providing a concentrated burst of flavor that can easily overpower a dish if not checked. Opt to choose an 80-proof liquor, or a liquor that is 40% alcohol by volume. This provides just enough alcohol to bring out the flavors without making the dish taste too strong or boozy. Matching the alcohol percentage properly allows the cook to control the flavor and balance of the dish. Now, when it comes to pairing your liquor with the type of food you are cooking, this is where personal preference and a little bit of culinary creativity come into play. For instance, darker liquors such as bourbon, rum, or cognac pair perfectly with rich, hearty dishes like stews, roasts, or even decadent chocolate desserts. On the other hand, clear liquors like vodka, gin, or silver tequila are brilliant at providing a crisp contrast to seafood dishes, or in invigorating a simple serving of fresh fruits. Remember, the essence of pairing food and liquor isn't about overpowering or masking the food's taste. The liquor should complement and accentuate the flavors within your dish. Consider the ingredients you use, the methods of your cooking, and then choose a liquor that enhances these elements instead of fighting against them. It is this synergy between food and liquor that allows for an unforgettable culinary experience. In conclusion, measuring out your ingredients carefully, choosing the right proof of liquor, and pairing it thoughtfully with your food is the secret to an exquisite taste experience. It's a subtle art that when done right, lets you navigate through undefined culinary territories, and explore a world of flavors you never thought possible.  From lending a rich depth to your sauces or adding a hint of surprise to your desserts, the proper use and pairing of liquors in cooking can elevate your food to a novel and extraordinary culinary level. By blending traditional cooking techniques with the exciting worlds of spirits, you open the door to bolder, more flavorful gastronomic adventures. So why wait? Unleash your culinary creativity today with the exquisite combination of food and liquor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Which old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house? ?  The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598. In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons. The answer to this question is:","output":"The old house that was situated near the church in the garden of the present house was the manor of Belton, which belonged to the Pakenham family before it was sold to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. This house remained largely unoccupied as the Brownlow family preferred their other residences elsewhere."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In my young life, I’d never seen that look before, but it chilled me to the core and I just knew something bad was coming. Mom knew it too; the smirk quickly left her face as Dad came over and said.. “Mom.. I hope I heard this wrong.. but on the radio they said a woman drowned at the lake.. I hope I’m wrong, I barely caught the name, but I think they said it was your sister..” The cookout was forgotten; we went inside & started making phone calls, and unfortunately it was indeed my aunt.

New Order are an English rock band formed in 1980 by vocalist and guitarist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. New Order were formed in the demise of their previous post-punk band Joy Division, following the suicide of vocalist Ian Curtis. They were joined by Gillian Gilbert on keyboards later that year. Their integration of post-punk with electronic and dance music made them one of the most critically acclaimed and influential bands of the 1980s. The initial release as New Order was the single \\"Ceremony\\", backed with \\"In a Lonely Place\\". These two songs were written in the weeks before Curtis took his own life. With the release of Movement in November 1981, New Order initially started on a similar route as their previous incarnation, performing dark, melodic songs, albeit with an increased use of synthesisers. The band viewed the period as a low point, as they were still reeling from Curtis' death. Hook commented that the only positive thing to come out of the Movement sessions was that producer Martin Hannett had showed the band how to use a mixing board, which allowed them to produce records by themselves from then on. More recently, Hook indicated a change of heart: \\"I think Movement gets a raw deal in general really - for me, when you consider the circumstances in which it was written, it is a fantastic record.\\"  New Order visited New York City again in 1981, where the band were introduced to post-disco, freestyle and electro. The band had taken to listening to Italian disco to cheer themselves up, while Morris taught himself drum programming. The singles that followed, \\"Everything's Gone Green\\" and \\"Temptation\\", saw a change in direction toward dance music.  The Hacienda, Factory Records' own nightclub (largely funded by New Order) opened in May 1982 in Manchester and was even issued a Factory catalogue number: FAC51. The opening of UK's first ever superclub was marked by a nearly 23-minute instrumental piece originally entitled \\"Prime 5 8 6\\", but released 15 years later as \\"Video 5 8 6\\". Composed primarily by Sumner and Morris, \\"Prime 5 8 6\\"/\\"Video 5 8 6\\" was an early version of \\"5 8 6\\" that contained rhythm elements that would later surface on \\"Blue Monday\\" and \\"Ultraviolence\\".

The girl was attending the wrong game and realized her mistake ..","output":"The most probable reason that can be inferred from the given scenario is option (a). The girl had gotten intoxicated and had used profanity while at the game. The details present in the statement point to this explanation. The narrator mentions that their surprise was majorly due to the group of college-aged individuals situated in the second row of the locale, specifically drawing attention to their drinking habits. It is reported that not only had they evidently consumed alcohol, but their conversation was also dotted with profanities, indicating unruly behavior.  Out of this group of individuals, a particular girl was escorted out eventually. Though no specific reason is explicitly stated, a logical deduction from the given details would indicate that her removal from the premises was likely due to the inappropriate actions described, which commonly refer to public intoxication and usage of obscene language in a public setting such as a game arena, where such behavior is generally not tolerated in the interest of maintaining a pleasant environment for all attendees.  The other options do not find direct or indirect correspondence in the statement. The dissatisfaction with the announced attendance of the game (option b) or attending the wrong game (option d) are not referred to at all. The option c, \\"None of the above choices,\\" is also inappropriate since the behavior of intoxication and use of profanity is indicated in the story. Therefore, by analyzing the given information, we can conclude that option (a) is the most plausible reason for the girl's removal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Brett tends to get sick more than his brother Brian as","output":"his immune system is relatively weaker, which can be attributed to several factors that play a significant role in determining one's susceptibility and response to infections and illnesses. This disparity between the two siblings has been observed and documented by the family from early childhood, and despite numerous efforts to boost Brett's immunity, the phenomenon remains consistent even as they grow into adulthood. The genetic constitution of an individual is a factor that greatly contributes to their immune strength and their ability to ward off infections. In Brett's case, it is possible that certain gene variations or genetic traits he inherited from his parents could have potentially led to a less robust immune function as compared to Brian, who might have inherited a more favorable set of genetic markers. Unfortunately, there is often little that can be done to alter one's genetic predispositions, since they are essentially hardwired into our DNA. Furthermore, environmental factors such as exposure to various pathogens and allergens during early childhood might have played a part in shaping Brett's immune response as he grew older. Lack of exposure to microbes at a tender age or an overly hygienic environment may lead to a less mature immune system. On the other hand, Brian might have experienced just the right amount of exposure, allowing his immune system to develop optimally and reliably. Lifestyle choices also have a significant impact on immune function. Brett's diet, exercise habits, and stress management could also contribute to his heightened susceptibility to illnesses. A diet lacking in essential nutrients, vitamins and antioxidants is generally associated with weaker immunity. Regular exercise helps maintain robust immune homeostasis, while chronic stress has been shown to negatively impact immune function. If Brett's lifestyle habits are less than ideal, this could place him at a further disadvantage in comparison to his brother who may be more conscientious about his health and overall well-being. Moreover, gut health has increasingly been recognized as a key factor in determining the overall immune response of an individual. If the balance of Brett's gut microbiome is less than ideal, this could be another contributing factor to his weaker immune system. The presence of an unbalanced gut flora can lead to increased permeability of the gastrointestinal tract, creating increased vulnerability to infections. It's essential to note that the strength of one's immune function is not solely dictated by any single factor; rather, it is the complex interplay between genetics, environment, and lifestyle that ultimately determines the overall immune capacity. In conclusion, the reason why Brett tends to get sick more often than his brother can be attributed to a variety of factors including genetic predisposition, differences in early life exposure and environmental influences, as well as contrasting lifestyle choices and their implications on gut health and immune homeostasis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But many years ago, there were millions of rats in Newtown. They attacked  the cats and dogs. Sometimes a lot of them knocked down a man or woman walking home at night. The rats were very big in size and they hurt many people. The government   ordered   everybody to kill rats. Most people were lazy, so they did not kill many. Then the government decided to pay some money for each dead rat. That made the people very happy. They killed thousands of rats every day. A government officer put all the dead rats in a big pile . Sometimes a man brought hundreds in one day. After two weeks there were not many rats in the city, but people still brought many rats to the government office. The government officer thought that people were stealing   dead rats from the pile. He ordered his men to dig a deep hole and put the rats in it. Soon there were no more rats, and the government did not pay any more money. From the passage we can see that the government officer   _  . A) was a very rich man B) was clever C) was afraid of rats D) liked to live in a clean house","output":"To answer this question, let's analyze the passage step by step: 1. Newtown had a rat problem, and the government initially asked people to kill the rats. The response was not sufficient. 2. The government decided to pay people for each dead rat, which resulted in increased activity and thousands of rats being killed daily. 3. A government officer was responsible for collecting and disposing of the dead rats. 4. Eventually, the officer thought people were stealing dead rats from the pile to earn more money. 5. The government officer ordered his men to dig a deep hole to bury the rats, preventing theft. 6. After some time, there were no more rats and the government stopped paying. From these steps, we can conclude that the government officer: A) was a very rich man - There is no information about the officer's personal wealth. B) was clever - The officer identified a potential problem (rat theft) and found a solution (burying them), ending the rat issue. C) was afraid of rats - There is no mention of the officer's fear of rats. D) liked to live in a clean house - There's no information about the officer's personal preferences.

If you are having trouble getting enough fiber from your diet alone, then taking a fiber supplement may help to improve your IBS symptoms. Choose bulk forming laxatives because they are the least likely to irritate your bowels.  The recommended daily amount of fiber is between 25 to 35 grams.  If you are not getting this amount of fiber from food sources, then you can supplement with fiber. Fiber supplements are available as powders, capsules, and biscuits. Make sure that you read and follow the manufacturer's instructions for use. Always take fiber supplements with a full glass (8 ounces) of water. Probiotics may also be helpful for treating your IBS symptoms. Probiotic supplements contain good bacteria that can help to regulate your digestion. Try taking a probiotic for about a month to see if it helps you.  A typical dose is between one to two billion colony forming units (also known as CFUs) per day. Make sure that you follow the manufacturer's dosing instructions. Some doctors will recommend a higher dosage for their patients. Check with your doctor for a specific dose recommendation. When choosing a probiotic, make sure that the package provides the name and contact information of the manufacturer, the scientific names of the bacteria strains included in the probiotic, a \\"best by\\" date that states how many of the bacteria will be alive when the product expires, information about how to store the product, and dosage instructions. Avoid any products that make claims that the product will cure or treat a disease or condition. Peppermint oil capsules have been found to be effective for children with IBS. Peppermint capsules seem to reduce the abdominal pain that is common with IBS sufferers. Try taking peppermint oil capsules for a couple of weeks to see if it helps to soothe pain associated with your IBS.  A suggested dosage is to take one to two coated 0.2 mL peppermint oil capsules. You can take up to three doses per day. Keep in mind that some people experience heartburn from taking peppermint capsules. Summary:","output":"Fiber is kind of like a super cleaner for our bodies. It helps to make sure everything runs smoothly in our tummy and can help us if we sometimes have a tummy upset, that's what IBS is. Fiber is found mostly in fruits, veggies, grains and nuts, but sometimes we might not get enough from these, so we might need a bit of extra help from fiber we get in a bottle or a packet - these are called supplements.  Just like we need to drink lots of water when we eat lots of fiber foods, we need to do the same if we take fiber supplements. So, always drink a big glass of water when you take them.  There are also little good guys, called probiotics, that live in our tummies. They help us digest our food and keep our tummy happy. We can get more of these good guys by taking something called a probiotic supplement.  Peppermint oil capsules are kind of like little bodyguards in your tummy. They help guard your tummy against the nasty feelings you can get with IBS and are especially good if our tummy really hurts.

Bob Dylan, Denzel Washington cited in social media tributes to Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter Updated APR 21, 2014 5:37a ET The news that Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter had died triggered swift reaction Sunday, largely from those recalling the boxer's wrongful murder conviction as immortalized in music by Bob Dylan in 1975 and on the screen in a 1999 movie starring Denzel Washington. Carter spent 19 years in prison for three murders in Paterson, N.J., following convictions in 1966 and 1976. Carter was freed in November 1985 when the convictions were set aside. Although never a world champion, Carter went 27-12-1 with 19 knockouts -- including stopping Emile Griffith in the first round in 1963. The murder convictions derailed his middleweight career and eventually triggered activism by numerous legal experts and celebrities on his behalf. Here's a sampling of reactions Sunday, including a link to Dylan's song (Advisory: The lyrics include language that some may find objectionable): We a lost a great man today, Rubin \\"hurricane\\" Carter, the boxer who was wrongfully accused and became a symbol for racial injustice.

If you live in a cold weather area and you are leaving during a time when inclement weather is a possibility, you want to make sure your pipes are well insulated. Frozen pipes can cause significant damage to your home, and if no one is there to check them after cold weather it may go unnoticed until you return.  Go into areas where pipes are at a greater risk of freezing, like the attic and the basement, and check their insulation. Consider hiring a plumber to inspect your pipes if you are worried about their insulation.  A neighbor that is checking up on your house should test the faucets while you’re away. If there is no water coming from the faucets, your pipes may be frozen. Ask them to contact you immediately if this happens while you’re away. Before you leave, unplug the appliances in your home that are non-essential, like your microwave, a stereo, a coffeemaker, and lamps you won’t leave on.  This protects your home in the event of a power surge or an electrical fire. This is also an energy efficient way to reduce your electrical consumption while you’re away. Before you leave, check that each door and window are securely locked. Having locks installed will do you no good if they are not locked while you are gone! Go through every room of your home and apartment and check that each window and entry door is secure. It is also helpful do a perimeter of your house from the outside. Look for any window screens that look loose or unsecured. This is a good way to keep your electricity and natural gas costs low while you’re away. Adjust the temperature on the thermostat and turn down the temperature on your water heater.  You don’t want to turn your thermostat completely off. Depending on your area’s climate, 55 degrees is a good limit for the winter and 80 degrees for the summer. You can also consider monitoring your heat from afar. The most cost-effective way to monitor your heat while you are away is to install a wireless thermostat that you can monitor and program from your mobile phone or device while you are on vacation. Garage doors are an easy way for intruders to enter your home. Manual garage doors can be secured with a clamp or padlock to prevent them from being opened. Turn off your automatic garage door opener if you have one. This will prevent someone with a universal remote from opening the door while you’re away. Summary:","output":"1.

Let me break it down for you. The term \\"flying\\" is usually associated with traveling, excitement, adventure, or even efficiency for businesspeople. It may instill some level of happiness in those who enjoy flying or find it to be a thrilling experience. However, the term itself is pretty neutral since many people may have different personal opinions on flying, leading to varied reactions to the term. The following part, \\"status updating on air,\\" adds a bit more context to the tweet. Updating one's status while in the air indicates that the person is connected to the internet and is sharing their current situation with others, implying an overall positive or enjoyable experience. This may lead some people to perceive the tweet as slightly leaning toward the positive sentiment. Status updating can also suggest that the person is satisfied with the flight's connectivity and services, which might evoke a notion of satisfaction and contentedness. That being said, since the tweet is pretty short and doesn't directly express emotions or opinions, it is relatively neutral.

During the 15th century the Ayutthaya Kingdom fought frequent wars against the Lan Na Kingdom in the north, the Khmer Empire of Angkor Wat to the east and the Malay States to the south. King Intharacha of Ayutthaya forced the former Kingdom of Sukhothai to recognize his authority in 1410. The king then invaded Lan Na in 1411, seizing Chiang Rai but failing to capture Chiang Mai and Phayao. In the latter battle the two sides may have used early cannons. In 1424 King Borommarachathirat II ascended the throne of Ayutthaya. After a seven-month siege, he captured Angkor by treachery in 1431. The Khmer retook the city in 1432 and subsequently transferred their capital to Phnom Penh. The sixth son of the Lan Na king Sam Fang Kaen, Thao Lok, ascended the throne in the aftermath of coup against his father in 1441. Thao Lok was crowned as king Tilokaraj of Lan na, later banishing his father Sam Fang Kaen to Muong Shan in the Shan States. General Phya Samdekyoki, who had previously played an important role in bringing Tilokaraj to power created a plot in order to assume power himself, the plot was however discovered and Samdekyoki was exiled to Chiang Saen. Answer this question based on the article: What event happened first, Thao Lok ascending the throne, or The king invading Lan Na?","output":"Imagine there was a big kingdom called Ayutthaya a long, long time ago. Their king wanted to be the boss of many places. So, the king decided to go to different places, like Lan Na in the north. This happened in 1411. Later on, there was a prince named Thao Lok. He became the ruler, or king, of a place called Lan Na in 1441.

It was probably William the Conqueror who gave the city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were...

Paragraph :  The full box is harder to move because it has greater mass and therefore greater inertia.  Question:   Sally is pulling two wagons. The red wagon is full of sand, and the blue wagon is empty. The wagon that will be easier to pull is the red wagon or blue wagon? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the blue wagon will be easier to pull as compared to the red wagon. This is due to the concept of inertia, which is the resistance of an object to a change in its state of motion.  The red wagon is full of sand, making it heavier and giving it a greater mass than the empty blue wagon. As a result, the red wagon has a higher inertia, meaning it will be more resistant to changes in its motion. In other words, it will be more difficult to start moving, stop moving, or change its direction.  On the other hand, the blue wagon is empty and therefore has a smaller mass. This means that its inertia is lower, so it will be more responsive to changes in its motion, and pulling it would require less effort.

They settled in different parts of Armenia, sometimes in the homes of fellow displaced Armenians from Azerbaijan or in temporary accommodations provided by the Armenian government and relief organizations. The events of the Baku pogrom marked a tragic milestone in the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which was fueled by ethnic tensions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: An enchantress, disguised as an old beggar, offers a rose to a young prince, Adam, in exchange for shelter in his castle from the cold, but Adam refuses. For his arrogance, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and places a spell on the castle. She gives him a magic mirror that enables him to view faraway events, along with the enchanted rose that she had offered. To break the spell, the prince must learn to love another and earn her love in return before the rose's last petal falls on his 21st birthday. If he fails, he will remain a beast forever.Ten years later, a young bookworm girl named Belle is bored of her village life and seeks excitement. Because of her nonconformist ideals, she is ridiculed by everyone except her father Maurice (an odd inventor), the town bookseller, and a vain muscular hunter named Gaston. Despite being popular with the townsfolk, Gaston is determined to marry Belle. She repeatedly rejects his advances.Maurice and his horse Phillipe get lost in the forest while traveling to a fair to present his newest invention, a wood-chopping machine. After being chased by a pack of wolves, he comes across the Beast's castle. Inside, he meets LumiÃ¨re the candlestick, Cogsworth the clock, Mrs. Potts the teapot, and her son Chip the teacup. However, the Beast quickly discovers and detains Maurice. After Phillipe leads Belle to the Beast's castle, she offers to take her father's place. Over her father's objections, the Beast accepts Belle's offer. While Gaston sulks over Belle's rejection, Maurice returns to town but is unable to convince the others to save Belle from the Beast.The Beast sulks in his room when Belle refuses to have dinner with him that night. Despite this, LumiÃ¨re offers her a meal. While he and Cogsworth also give her a tour of the castle, she wanders into the forbidden West Wing. When the Beast inadvertently chases her into the forest by frightening her in frustration, Belle encounters the pack of wolves. After the Beast is injured while fending them off, Belle thanks him for saving her life. He begins to develop feelings for her while she nurses his wounds and he delights her by showing his extensive library. While the two begin to bond in the Beast's castle, in the village Gaston pays Monsieur D'Arque to send Maurice to the town's insane asylum if Belle refuses Gaston's proposal again.Sharing a romantic evening together, Belle tells the Beast she misses her father. He lets her use his magic mirror to see him. She sees Maurice dying in the woods trying to reach the castle. The Beast lets her go out to save him and he gives her the mirror to remember him by. She finds Maurice and brings him home. As Gaston is about to bring Maurice to the insane asylum, Belle proves Maurice's sanity by showing the Beast with the mirror. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, Gaston convinces the villagers that the Beast is a man-eating monster and leads them to the castle to kill him.Having stowed away into Belle's baggage, Chip helps Maurice and Belle escape from confinement. Gaston fights the Beast while the servants fend off the villagers. The Beast initially is too depressed to fight back, but perks up after seeing Belle return to the castle. He defeats Gaston on the rooftops, and spares Gaston's life by ordering him to leave. However, when Gaston mortally wounds the Beast, he loses his footing and falls to his death.[a] Belle professes her love for the Beast, who dies before the last rose petal falls.

Here is an article: In the 450 days between his inauguration and his accident, Mr. Corzine notified Mr. Codey that he would be away for all or part of 111 days, and would sleep out of state on 77 nights, according to letters from Mr. Corzine’s chief of staff, Tom Shea, recording the transfer of power. And many of Mr. Corzine’s overnight visits to Manhattan, where his companion, Sharon Elghanayan, lives, are not included in the tally, because of a memo in April 2006 from Zulima V. Farber, who was then the attorney general. “We do not believe that, in the circumstances you describe, an occasional, overnight stay in New York City following a workday in New Jersey and a return to this state in the morning constitutes an absence of the governor that would trigger the devolution of gubernatorial power,” Ms. Farber wrote in response to an inquiry from Mr. Corzine’s legal counsel. “The enlightened view was, use a commonsensical approach,” Ms. Farber, herself one of four people who have served as acting governor during Mr. Corzine’s absences, said in a recent interview. “My memory is that it was a combination of distance and time,” she continued, “so even going out to Long Island by plane, or if the governor goes to Manhattan for dinner, might be O.K.” In contrast to Mr. Corzine, his recent predecessors typically left the state during their first year in office for only a dozen or two dozen days, according to interviews with former governors, their chiefs of staff, and political scientists. Many said new governors typically had little time to travel, as they scrambled to establish a government, pass a budget and strengthen relationships with legislators and other state officials. Mr. Corzine, a former co-chairman of the investment bank Goldman Sachs who lives in Hoboken, has been away so much that several friends and fellow Democrats said they had urged him to spend more time in New Jersey. Last summer, Page Six, a gossip column in The New York Post, began, “The Garden State whispers are getting louder that New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine needs to learn how to stay at home.” In a recent interview, Anthony Coley, Mr. Corzine’s communications director, made no apologies for the boss’s absences. “Wherever Jon Corzine goes, his work goes with him,” Mr. Coley said. “Jon Corzine burns the candle at both ends,” he said. “He’s a seven-day-a-week type of governor.” Mr. Coley added: “He brings a level of gravitas and business expertise that a lot of people don’t have in his position. So one of his roles as governor, as marketer-in-chief, is to promote his state abroad.” But with Mr. Corzine now facing an extended rehabilitation, his mobility and his approach to his job are likely to change. It will be harder for Mr. Corzine to go on trade missions — like the one to Israel that had been planned for April 14 — or to travel great distances for vacation. “The accident will certainly have an impact on planned trade missions and other officially connected events that occur out of state,” Mr. Coley said. Mr. Corzine, with a net worth valued at hundreds of millions of dollars, has long been accustomed to ducking out of town or out of the country — often on private jets. In his globe-trotting he resembles other wealthy politicians like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who sometimes escapes to a home he owns in Bermuda, and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, who has been criticized for being out of the state frequently — about one day in five — and not disclosing his whereabouts. Speaking of Mr. Corzine, Bruce Afran, a Princeton lawyer and a government watchdog, said: “He’s the kind of politician who invests his money in the office, and not the kind of politician who rose up through work in the state. I’m sure his travel reflects that. He’s still thinking in terms of being a corporate executive.” Mr. Afran, who said he generally agrees with Mr. Corzine on issues but who has filed ethics complaints against the governor and others, added: “I think a governor in the end has to commit himself to being here, and hopefully when he recovers, we’ll see more of that, because that’s the only way to solve policy problems.” But several politicians and political scientists said that while Mr. Corzine’s trips were surprisingly numerous, they were not cause for concern given the modern-day communications conveniences of cellphones and BlackBerrys. Others said it was good for the state’s leader to venture far to promote its interests and image. “You’ve got to find a balance,” said former Gov. Christie Whitman, who was out of town perhaps a dozen days in her first year but increased her travel as her national political profile rose, both to give speeches and to participate in trade missions. “You don’t want to miss anything, but you also need to get away once in a while and get some perspective.” In most states, succession is an afterthought, because power is transferred to a lieutenant governor, who, in many cases, was elected on the same ticket with the governor. But when Gov. Jerry Brown of California was spending a lot of time out of state in seeking the 1980 Democratic nomination for president, his lieutenant governor, Mike Curb, a Republican, nominated judges and eased air pollution regulations, leading Governor Brown to sue. The California Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Curb’s actions were constitutional. Under the New Jersey Constitution, the line of succession begins with the Senate president and proceeds to the Assembly speaker, the attorney general and then the transportation commissioner. The general guideline has been that an overnight stay or a day trip beyond the New York metropolitan area triggers succession, according to Michael P. Torpey, who was chief of staff to Mrs. Whitman. During March 2006 and again last August, Mr. Corzine left the state four times. He also spent half of last December out of town, and about a third of this February. The letters from Mr. Shea to Mr. Codey, standard in form, do not mention Mr. Corzine’s destination. But according to news reports, Mr. Corzine traveled to Telluride for five days last July after surviving a crisis over the budget that resulted in a government shutdown. A few weeks later, he was in Italy when the authorities revealed that they had thwarted a terrorist plot in Britain to blow up flights to the United States. Mr. Corzine cut short his vacation and returned home. Mr. Codey said that in 2004-5 while he was acting governor for 14 months after the resignation of Gov. James. E. McGreevey, he left the state for about a dozen days. Similarly, Mr. McGreevey seldom left during his first year, Mr. Codey said, other than to go to Canada to see his daughter from his first marriage. Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean occasionally visited his family’s home on Fishers Island, off the North Fork of Long Island. But in his first year, 1982, he suffered a herniated disk and at one point ended up governing from a bed at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston. W. Cary Edwards, who served as Mr. Kean’s chief counsel and attorney general, said that Mr. Kean sometimes worked too much before his hospitalization. “We kept saying, ‘Tom, get out of here!’ ” Mr. Edwards recalled. “There’s a need to pull the plug once in a while to just relax and take care of yourself.” An article on Sunday about the frequency of Jon S. Corzine’s out-of-state travel during his tenure as governor of New Jersey referred erroneously in some copies to the time he has spent outside the state. In the 450 days from his inauguration to his traffic accident on April 12, he was away for all or part of 111 days, not 115, and he spent about a third of February — not half of March — out of state. The article also rendered incorrectly comments on the matter from Zulima V. Farber, then the New Jersey attorney general, in an April 2006 memo. She wrote, “We do not believe that, in the circumstances you describe, an occasional, overnight stay in New York City following a workday in New Jersey and a return to this state in the morning constitutes an absence of the governor that would trigger the devolution of gubernatorial power.” The erroneous version said “circumstance” instead of “circumstances” and omitted the words “and a return.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A29 of the New York edition with the headline: The Governor Of New Jersey Often Wasn’t In New Jersey.

But he had been so full of passion, so beside himself with excitement, so disturbed by all that he had heard, that he had hardly waited with Marie long enough to obtain such pledge, or to learn from her that she refused to give it. He had only been able to tell her that if she hesitated about marrying Adrian she should never look upon his face again; and then without staying for a reply he had left her. He had been in such a tremor of passion that he had been unable to demand an answer. After that, when George was gone, he kept away from her during the remainder of the morning.

If you’re upset about a situation that recently occurred, take some time to blow off steam before talking to your spouse about it. Initiating this conversation when you’re emotional may not get you the results you desire. Wait until you’re calm. To manage anger or frustration, go for a walk around the block. Do some light stretches. Or take several  deep breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Pull your spouse aside once you’re calm and explain the situation. This can be a tough predicament since your spouse may feel torn between you and their parents. Avoid coming off as accusatory by using “I” statements. You might say something like, “I feel helpless when your mother comes over and brings the kids candy. I have asked her not to, but she keeps doing it.” Discussing difficult matters regarding family can create tension. However, if you and your spouse can’t get on the same page, you’ll have a hard time getting your in-law to change their behavior. Remember that you both want the same things—to live your life without being controlled by your in-law.  Stay focused on the common ground between you to avoid a rift. You should approach your in-law about the issue as a unified front. Keep the issues happening with your in-law separate from your relationship with your spouse. Don’t blame your spouse for their parent’s behavior. After you’ve shared your feelings about your overbearing in-law, take an objective approach. Take a step back and get a clearer view of the situation. What's happening that you don't want to happen? What needs to happen to make the situation better? For instance, you both agree that your mother-in-law needs to respect your parenting decisions whenever she’s in your home.

She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting \\"carried away\\" in the studio, appreciating the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they were able to create. Rusko said \\"She's got a kid, a little one year old baby, and we recorded his heart beat. We'd just think of...","output":"According to Rusko, the person whose heartbeat was recorded in the studio is M.I.A.'s son, Ikyhd."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Set the stage The game started off with both teams battling for dominance, as Salford Red Devils looked to make an early statement against the Wigan Warriors. The Red Devils came into the game eager to prove themselves against the powerhouse Warriors, but Wigan was just as determined to reclaim their winning form. Step 2: Detail Charnley's first try Josh Charnley opened the scoring in the first half with a stunning display of skill and tenacity. The Warriors were pressing hard on Salford's defensive line when Charnley found a gap in their armor, capitalizing on it with swift footwork and pin-point accuracy to touch down for the first try of the match. Step 3: The opposition strikes back The Red Devils were quick to retaliate, as they continued to showcase their fighting spirit. They refused to be cowed by the early setback and managed to level the score with a well-orchestrated play, putting pressure on the Warriors' defense.

Pollution comes in many ways. We see it, smell it, drink it and even eat it. Man has been polluting the earth. The more people, the more pollution. Many years ago, the problems was not so serious because there were not so many people. When the land was used up or the river was dirty in one place, man moved to another place. But this is no longer true. Man is now slowly polluting the whole world. Air pollution is still the most serious. It's bad for all living things in the world, but it is not the only one kind of pollution. Water pollution kills our fish and pollutes our drinking water. Noise pollution makes us angry more easily. Many countries are making rules to fight pollution. They stop people from burning coal in houses and factories in the city, and from putting dirty smoke into the air. Pollution by SO2 is now the most dangerous kind of air pollutions. It is caused by heavy traffic. We are sure that if there are fewer people driving there will be less air pollution.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: John is trying to buy a house. Today, he saw two houses, house A and house B. House A was build in the 1920s. It has lead plumbing pipes and lead based paint. House B was build recently. It does not have lead plumbing pipes or lead based paint.  But I can use this background: Many chemicals that were once commonly used were later found out to be harmful to the environment , to human health, or both. The element lead was once a common additive to gasoline and to paint. Plumbing pipes were once typically made of lead. Only since the 1970s has the danger of lead become apparent. It causes brain damage and small children (who often chewed on objects painted with lead-based paint) are particularly susceptible. The use of lead in gasoline, paint, and plumbing pipes is now banned and new materials are being developed to replace the hazardous lead components.  What is an answer for this question: Would house A less likely or more likely cause brain damage than house B? A:","output":"To answer the question, we need to consider the risks associated with living in each of the houses and the presence of lead in their construction. Step 1: Identify risks associated with each house - House A: Built in the 1920s, lead plumbing pipes and lead-based paint. - House B: Built recently, no lead plumbing pipes or lead-based paint. Step 2: Analyze the risks relative to the background information - The background explains that lead causes brain damage, particularly in small children who may chew on objects painted with lead-based paint. - Lead was commonly used in gasoline, paint, and plumbing pipes until its dangers became apparent in the 1970s. Step 3: Assess the likelihood of brain damage in each house - House A has both lead plumbing pipes and lead-based paint, presenting clear risks to the occupants. - House B, being built recently, adheres to modern regulations and does not utilize lead in its construction, which makes it safer concerning lead-related health issues. In conclusion, House A would be more likely to cause brain damage than House B due to the presence of lead plumbing pipes and lead-based paint."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kuzey Bulgaristan'daki Elena'da yabanıl bir arazide lavanta yetiştirmeye karar veren eski subay, eter ve diğer tıbbi bitkiler yetiştiricilerince kurulan bir kuruluşun da başkanlığına getirildi. Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The former officer, who decided to cultivate lavender in the wild terrain of Elena in Northern Bulgaria, was also appointed as the president of an organization established by growers of ether and other medicinal plants. Let me elaborate further on what this might entail for clarity.  The statement seems to come from a news source or an article discussing the ventures of a former officer in Bulgaria. This individual has decided to start cultivating lavender in a wild or undeveloped terrain situated in a place called Elena, located in Northern Bulgaria. Lavender is known for its soothing fragrance and robust nature, making it a popular choice for cultivation. It would indeed be an intriguing task to grow lavender in a potentially challenging environment, given that wild terrains typically require significant work to develop into productive areas of cultivation.  In addition to embarking on this project, the second part of the statement informs us that the former officer was appointed the president of an organization. This organization has been established by other growers who specialize in growing ether and various medicinal plants. Ether is a volatile compound often used in medicine and other industries. In the medicinal arena, plants have been used for centuries due to their healing properties.  Assuming this officer is involved in both cultivating lavender and leading an organization dealing with ether and medicinal plants production indicates that they are significantly involved in agriculture, particularly in the area of medicinal and aromatic plants. He is likely to use his leadership skills to manage and coordinate the activities of the organization, create avenues for sharing knowledge, blend different experiences, and champion the interests of the growers.  From this, it seems that the former officer has successfully transitioned into a significant role within the agricultural sector, specifically dealing with essential and medicinal crops. His position as the president of an organization also elicits a sense of respect and trust from other growers, seeing that he has been bestowed with the responsibility to oversee not just his own venture, but the ventures of other growers dealing with ether and medicinal plants as well. His pursuits will possibly contribute enormously to the progression of medicinal agriculture in Northern Bulgaria."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He attended Brookline High School (a 1991 graduate), and played baseball for the Brookline High School Warriors, but dreamed of working for the Red Sox. Epstein attended Yale University where he lived at Jonathan Edwards College. He served as sports editor of the Yale Daily News. On October 12, 2011, Epstein agreed to a five-year contract worth 18.5 million with the Chicago Cubs. On October 19, 2011, it was reported that Epstein's official title with the Cubs would be President and that San Diego Padres general manager Jed Hoyer would take the GM position with the Cubs.  On October 23, 2011, he took out a full-page ad in The Boston Globe, thanking Red Sox fans and the team's owners for their support. Two days later, the Cubs officially introduced Epstein as president of baseball operations. While the Red Sox were already a winning team when Epstein was hired in Boston, the Cubs were coming off a fifth-place finish in the National League Central and had a depleted farm system.

After a three-year, top-to-bottom rebuild, the Cubs clinched a playoff berth in 2015; their first since 2008. They advanced to the National League Championship Series, where they were swept by the New York Mets.  Epstein re-signed with the club on September 28, 2016, with a five-year contract estimated to be worth up to 25million. The Cubs finished the 2016 season with a 103-58 record, the best in the MLB and their best since the 1910 season. In the playoffs, they defeated the San Francisco Giants in the NLDS. The Cubs proceeded to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS, winning their first pennant since the 1945 season and sending them to the World Series.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the name of the person that Pink Floyd hoped that their erratic behavior would be a passing phase?  Morrison and EMI producer Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, and as part of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: \\"I found [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so ... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [and] we got him out to the stage ... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down\\".Forced to cancel Pink Floyd's appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, as well as several other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist R. D. Laing, and though Waters personally drove Barrett to the appointment, Barrett refused to come out of the car. A stay in Formentera with Sam Hutt, a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement. The band followed a few concert dates in Europe during September with their first tour of the US in October. As the US tour went on, Barrett's condition grew steadily worse. During appearances on the Dick Clark and Pat Boone shows in November, Barrett confounded his hosts by not responding to questions and staring off into space. He refused to move his lips when it came time to mime \\"See Emily Play\\" on Boone's show. After these embarrassing...

No. The given sentence does provide some valuable information about Thales, a pre-Socratic philosopher, and his non-supernatural explanations for natural phenomena. However, it does not directly answer the question, \\"What question were Greek philosophers trying to answer?\\" To address that question, let us delve deeper into the thoughts and concerns of ancient Greek philosophers: Greek philosophers aimed to answer several fundamental questions about the nature of existence, knowledge, and morality. Broadly, their inquiries fell into several categories: 1. Metaphysics - Philosophers sought to understand the nature of reality and being. They explored questions such as, 'What is the basic substance of the universe?' and 'How do objects come into existence and change?' Thales believed that the primary substance of the universe was water, while others like Anaximenes posited air and Anaximander suggested the boundless or infinite (Apeiron). Democritus, on the other hand, claimed that everything was made of minute, indivisible particles called atoms. 2. Epistemology - Philosophers questioned the nature and scope of human knowledge, trying to answer questions like, 'What can we truly know?' and 'How do we acquire knowledge?' Empiricism, which suggests that all knowledge comes from sensory experience, was popular among philosophers like Aristotle. In contrast, Rationalism, as proposed by Plato, posits that certain knowledge can be acquired through reason alone, independent of sense experience. 3. Ethics - Philosophers attempted to define the principles of right and wrong behavior. They asked questions such as, 'What is the good life?' and 'How should one act to achieve happiness and virtue?' For instance, Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics emphasizes the role of virtue and moral character in achieving happiness. Meanwhile, Epicurus championed the pursuit of simple pleasures to achieve a state of tranquility (ataraxia) and freedom from fear and pain. 4. Political philosophy - Theorizing about the nature of government and the appropriate relationship between individuals and their governments also concerned many Greek philosophers. Plato's Republic envisions an ideal society ruled by philosopher-kings, while Aristotle's Politics examines the strengths and weaknesses of different types of governments (monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy) and highlights the importance of a stable, moderate regime. In conclusion, ancient Greek philosophers sought to answer a wide range of questions, spanning metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and political philosophy. The sentence about Thales does not explicitly address such broader concerns, so it does not provide a valid answer to the question, \\"What question were Greek philosophers trying to answer?\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Complete the following sentence. The spoon was too hot to touch after sitting in the soup, as the","output":"The spoon was too hot to touch after sitting in the soup, as the soup had transferred all its heat to the metal of the spoon, causing it to reach an elevated temperature. When we immerse a spoon in a hot liquid like soup, heat transfer occurs between the spoon and the soup. This heat transfer is caused by the difference in temperature between the spoon and the soup. The heat energy from the hot soup is transferred to the colder spoon until they achieve thermal equilibrium, which means they end up with the same temperature. The primary heat transfer method in this process is conduction. Conduction is the transfer of heat through a solid material, such as metal or ceramic. It occurs when heat energy is passed from one molecule to another, causing the material to become hotter as the molecules vibrate more. In the case of a spoon in a hot soup, the metal spoon is an excellent conductor of heat, as the metal's molecules are closely packed together. When the soup heats the metal, the energy moves through the metal rapidly, heating the spoon uniformly. As a result, the heat transfer from the soup to the spoon is relatively quick and efficient.  However, this makes it difficult to touch the spoon after it has been sitting in the hot soup for a while. Given that the soup has transferred all its heat to the spoon, the temperature of the spoon can become too high for the human skin to tolerate, leading to a sensation of burning or pain when trying to touch it.  One solution to avoid burns or discomfort when using a spoon in hot liquids is to use a spoon made from a different material with lower thermal conductivity. For example, utilizing a wooden or plastic spoon could slow down the heat transfer process, making it safe to handle even after being immersed in hot soup. While they might not be as efficient at conducting heat, these alternative materials provide a greater level of safety and comfort for the user."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? A FSBO contract should contain a clear description of any homeowner’s association restrictions on the property. Such restrictions might affect, for example, lawn maintenance or a fence that the buyer wishes to build on the property. Easements refer to another person or landowner’s interest in the property or a portion of the property. One example of an easement is a driveway that two adjoining properties historically have shared.  FSBO contracts regularly contain a provision stating that the Buyer is taking title to the property \\"subject to any zoning restrictions.\\" A zoning law that affects a particular parcel of property typically restricts how the owner can use the property. In other words, if a property is zoned residential, the Buyer cannot expect to buy the property and turn it into a store. Another common easement provision includes utility easements. It is common for contracts to include a clause that, for example, \\"permits utility companies to continue using those portions of the property that are necessary for the existing utility services to remain operable.\\" A contract provision relating to another type of easement might state as follows: \\"The property has a 'right of way' running through the southeast section of its grounds, which is clearly marked and allows the adjoining landowner to enter and exit his property as needed.\\" Some disclosures about real estate are required by federal law, and some are required by state law. These disclosure requirements vary greatly from one state to the next. Some states require that you disclose only those defects of which you already have personal knowledge. Other states require a seller to actively search the property for any hidden defects so that they can be disclosed to the buyer. Common examples of defects that may be subject to disclosure are zoning issues, flooding, leaky pipes, and leaky roofs.  Some sellers have an inspection done to make sure there are no problems or disclosures to make before putting the house up for sale. Probably the most common disclosure comes from the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992. This federal law applies only to houses being sold that were built prior to 1978. The seller must disclose to a buyer about the possibility of lead-based paint being used in the home. Most state laws provide for a specific standardized disclosure form to be filled out by the seller and given to the buyer. Both parties typically must sign and date the disclosure form. It is usually presented by the seller at the closing of the sale. The contract should contain detailed information about any contingency, or an event that can make the contract invalid if it occurs. The buyer would be free to walk away from the contract without penalty if the contingent event occurs. There are some common contingencies that many contracts contain.  HSBO contracts are often contingent on the outcome of an inspection of the property. This type of contingency should outline the timeframe in which the inspection should occur. It also should set out which party is responsible for the costs of the inspection. This type of provision can refer to a general home inspection, or a specialized inspection, such as one that tests radon levels. An example of a contingency provision clause in a FSBO contract is as follows: \\"Buyer shall pay for a house inspection, to be conducted before closing. Renegotiation of the agreement will occur only if a major defect, which will cost more than 500.00 to remedy. If the defect would cost less than 500.00 to remedy, then the Buyer shall be responsible for the costs of remedying that defect.\\" Another common contingency involves the ability of the buyer to get financing. Again, this type of contingency should describe the timeframe that the buyer has to find adequate financing. It may even give details such as the amount of financing that is needed and the name of the mortgage company or financial institution providing the financing. The contract also may contain a contingency based on the ability of the seller to obtain suitable housing. Sometimes, the seller wants to make sure that he or she has another place to live before the property is sold and possession given to the buyer. As a result, FSBO contracts may contain a contingency provision like this. The contract should contain information about what happens if either party terminates the contract, which might happen for a variety of reasons. For instance, the contract might provide that if the buyer terminates the contract, the seller will be entitled to receive the earnest money paid by the buyer. This provision might also detail the potential remedies for a party when the other party has defaulted on the contract, such as seeking relief through the court system.  For instance, the contract might contain the following provision: \\"If Buyer breaches this Agreement or otherwise fails to purchase the property as agreed, Seller shall retain the earnest money paid by Buyer as liquidated damages or seek specific performance of the Agreement, at his discretion.\\" This provision allows the Seller to either keep the earnest money paid and terminate the contract, or proceed to file a lawsuit against Buyer claiming a larger amount of damages than the earnest money that was paid. Likewise, a FSBO contract might contain the following clause in favor of the Buyer: \\"If Seller fails to deliver title to the property to Buyer at closing as contemplated by the Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate and the Buyer shall be entitled to a refund of any earnest money paid.\\" This provision gives the Buyer a specific remedy if the Seller fails to perform the terms of the contract.

Since the policeman and the thief both begin running at the same time, we can assume that they are running in a straight line. We will use the relative speed concept to solve this problem. The relative speed is the difference between the speed of the policeman and the speed of the thief, since they are running in the same direction. Relative Speed = Speed of Policeman - Speed of Thief Relative Speed = 10 km/hr - 8 km/hr Relative Speed = 2 km/hr Now, let's convert the given distance (150 meters) into kilometers to match the units of the speeds. 150 meters = 0.15 km Time taken to cover the distance can be calculated by dividing the distance by the relative speed. Time = Distance / Relative Speed Time = 0.15 km / 2 km/hr Time = 0.075 hours Now, let's calculate the distance covered by the thief during this time. Distance covered by the thief = Speed of thief * Time Distance covered by the thief = 8 km/hr * 0.075 hr Distance covered by the thief = 0.6 km Now, let's convert the distance back to meters. 0.6 km = 600 meters So, the thief will have run 600 meters before he is overtaken by the policeman.

This prevents Yarrow from springing a carefully devised trap that would have wiped out the invaders in a murderous machinegun crossfire, with minimal American losses. Instead, many of Donovan's men are killed unnecessarily. As a result of this tragedy, Yarrow finally convinces the US Navy to form Construction Battalions (CBs, or the more familiar \\"Seabees\\") with Donovan's assistance, despite their mutual romantic interest in war correspondent Constance Chesley. Donovan and many of his men enlist and receive formal military training. The two men are teamed together on yet another island. The Japanese launch a major attack, which the Seabees barely manage to hold off, sometimes using heavy construction machinery such as bulldozers and a clamshell bucket. When word reaches Donovan of another approaching enemy column, there are no sailors left to oppose this new threat. In desperation, he rigs a bulldozer with explosives on its blade, intending to ram it into a petroleum storage tank. The plan works, sending a cascade of burning liquid into the path of the Japanese, who retreat in panic, right into the sights of waiting machine guns.  However, Wedge is shot in the process and dies in the explosion. Answer:","output":"The first name of the man who clashes with Robert is Wedge. In the article, it is stated that Wedge Donovan, a tough construction boss, clashes with his liaison officer, Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow, during the construction of airstrips in the Pacific for the U.S. Navy in World War II."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Financial crisis of 2007%E2%80%9308: The financial crisis was not widely predicted by mainstream economists except Raghuram Rajan, who instead spoke of the Great Moderation. A number of heterodox economists predicted the crisis, with varying arguments. Dirk Bezemer in his research credits (with supporting argument and estimates of timing) 12 economists with predicting the crisis: Dean Baker (US), Wynne Godley (UK), Fred Harrison (UK), Michael Hudson (US), Eric Janszen (US), Steve Keen (Australia), Jakob Brøchner Madsen & Jens Kjaer Sørensen (Denmark), Kurt Richebächer (US), Nouriel Roubini (US), Peter Schiff (US), and Robert Shiller (US). Examples of other experts who gave indications of a financial crisis have also been given. Not surprisingly, the Austrian economic school regarded the crisis as a vindication and classic example of a predictable credit-fueled bubble that could not forestall the disregarded but inevitable effect of an artificial, manufactured laxity in monetary supply, a perspective that even former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan in Congressional testimony confessed himself forced to return to. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". What did Raghuram Rajan speak of?","output":"Raghuram Rajan spoke of the \\"Great Moderation\\" during the period leading up to the financial crisis of 2007-08. The Great Moderation refers to a period of economic stability with low inflation and steady growth, which was believed to be a result of improved macroeconomic policies.

BARCELONA, Spain -- Barcelona's Argentina striker Lionel Messi will be out of action for six weeks after tearing a muscle in his left leg during Tuesday night's 1-0 Champions League victory over Celtic. Messi is helped off the pitch after injuring his left thigh during Tuesday's 1-0 victory over Celtic. The Catalan club confirmed on Wednesday that Messi will miss both legs of Barcelona's Champions League quarterfinal encounter. It will also be a race against time for the 2007 World Player of the Year runner-up to be fit for the semifinals if Barcelona get past an opponent who will be named after the draw on March 14. Messi picked up the injury after 34 minutes during Barcelona's victory over the Scottish side, which booked their spot in the last eight by easing through 4-2 on aggregate. It is third time in the last three years that Messi has had the same injury, the last occasion being on December 15 against Valencia, which ruled him out of the 'El Clasico' derby the following week against Real Madrid. In addition to his chronic problems with his left thigh, Messi has had four other significant injuries in the last two years which have caused him to miss a month or more. Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard has been forced to defend the club's medical services in the wake of Messi's latest injury. \\"To doubt that they are doing their best is an insult. The medical staff and the club in general are working to prevent these sort of problems. They are working hard but there is always a player that can be injured,\\" said Dutchman Rijkaard. Messi's injury reopens the door for Thierry Henry to claim his place in the starting lineup. The Frenchman has rarely impressed since his big-money move from Arsenal to the Spanish giants last summer. Rijkaard also has other options to replace Messi on the right flank in the shape of Portuguese international Deco or teenage Mexican winger Giovanni Dos Santos. E-mail to a friend.

In 1997, Rachel is honoured by her daughter Sarah during a release party in Tel Aviv for Sarah's book based on the account Rachel, Stefan and David gave of the events in 1965. Concurrently, David is escorted from his apartment by an Israeli government agent for a debriefing. David recognises Stefan waiting in another vehicle and unable to face their lie, he commits suicide by stepping in front of an oncoming truck. In 1965, a young Mossad agent Rachel Singer on her first field assignment arrives in East Berlin to meet with more experienced agents David Peretz and Stefan Gold. Their mission is to capture Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel—infamously known as \\"The Surgeon of Birkenau\\" for his medical experiments on Jews during World War II—and bring him to Israel to face justice. Rachel and David present themselves as a married couple from Argentina and Rachel becomes a patient at Vogel's obstetrics and gynaecology clinic. At a doctor appointment, Rachel injects Vogel with a sedative during an examination and induces the nurse to believe that he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as paramedics and make off with the unconscious Vogel in an ambulance. They attempt to leave by train, but Vogel awakens and sounds the horn of the van where he is being held, alerting guards to their presence.

By changing all capital letters to lower case letters, the text conversion results in the following: \\"barbell bar with star collars 165 cm by emiliano a cruz on 05.09.2012\\" This text conversion has taken place by following a specific process, which can be explained more thoroughly.  In the given text, there are a few capital letters that need to be transformed into lower case letters, primarily located at the start of each word or letter accompanied by a period. English language rules dictate that the first letter of each distinct word (excluding conjunctions and some prepositions) should typically be capitalized. However, the request you made was to convert all text into lower case. To do this, each capital letter has been substituted with its corresponding lower case counterpart. For instance, the first letter of the text, 'B,' has been replaced with 'b'; the second word, 'Bar,' has been transformed into 'bar'; and so on. The capital letters in the name of the individual, \\"Emiliano A Cruz,\\" have also been converted to lower case characters, resulting in \\"emiliano a cruz.\\" The numbers and symbols within the text, including \\"165 cm\\" and \\"05.09.2012,\\" do not have different cases and do not require any conversion. Therefore, they remain the same during the lower case transformation.

Help as much as you can. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: (B) What are you going to do if you are in a burning house? Escaping  a fire is a serious matter. Knowing what to do during a fire can save yourself. It is important to know the ways you can use and to show them to everyone in the family, such as stairways   and fire escapes, but not lifts . From the lower floors of the building, escaping through windows is possible, learn the best way of leaving through windows with the least chance of serious injury  . The second floor windows are usually not very high from the ground. An average   person, hanging by the finger-tips will have a drop of about six feet to the ground. It is about the height of an average man. Of course, it is safer to jump a short way than to stay in a burning building. Windows are also useful when you are waiting for help. Be sure to keep the door closed, or smoke and fire may be drawn into the room. Keep your head low at the window to be sure you get fresh air rather than smoke that may have leaked   into the room. On a second or third floor, the best windows for escaping are those which open onto a roof . From the roof a person can drop to the ground more safely, dropping onto stones might end in injury.

The place of the date definitely sets the tone for the date. If you are trying to be more romantic and lavish, reserve a table at a fancy restaurant.","output":"If you prefer to keep things more casual and relaxed, choose a location such as a coffee shop, park, or a local event. One important element is to consider the girl's preferences – you may want to ask her if there are any places that she particularly likes or has wanted to visit. Keep in mind that the date location should make both of you feel comfortable and excited. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to impress a girl on a first date: 1. Plan ahead: Once the location has been chosen, plan the finer details of the date. This includes the mode of transportation, the time you'll be meeting, and any additional activities that might take place. Planning will not only help you to be more organized but will also show the girl that you put thought into making the date special for her. 2. Dress to impress: Pay attention to your appearance and dress appropriately for the chosen venue and activities. Dressing well demonstrates that you respect your date and the occasion. Also, make sure to practice good hygiene by showering, shaving (if needed), and using pleasant scents moderately. 3. Show up on time: Punctuality is a sign of respect. Arriving on time shows her that you value her time and are excited to see her. If something unexpected happens and you're running late, make sure to communicate this to her as soon as possible. 4. Be confident and engage in meaningful conversations: Confidence is attractive, so believe in yourself and try to be your genuine self during the date. Ask open-ended questions to get to know her better and share interesting stories about your life. Focus on common interests and be an active listener. This will help to create a connection between the two of you. 5. Be polite and considerate: Open doors for her, pull out her chair, and offer to pay the bill. These small acts of chivalry show that you respect her, and she may appreciate your courteous manners. 6. Pay compliments and show genuine interest: Compliment her genuinely on her appearance, laugh, or something she has mentioned. This shows that you are paying attention to her and appreciate the qualities that make her unique. 7. Be attentive to her body language and cues: Reading her body language can help you determine if she is comfortable or whether you need to change the topic of conversation or pace of the date. 8. Avoid oversharing or talking about yourself too much: While it's essential to share your interests, make sure you are also giving her a chance to do the same. Balanced conversation will allow both of you to get to know each other and develop a connection. 9. End the date gracefully: As the date comes to a close, let her know that you enjoyed your time together, and if you genuinely want to see her again, express your interest in scheduling a second date. Remember, always be respectful and ensure she gets home safely. 10. Follow up: If you had a great time and would like to see her again, follow up with her within a day or two. This shows her that you are still thinking about her and would like to maintain contact. Impressing a girl on a first date comes down to being genuine, showing interest in her, and creating an enjoyable atmosphere. By following these recommendations, you should have a greater chance of making a positive impression and building a potential connection for a long-term relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does \\"The Menzies Government entered Australia's first formal military alliance outside of the British Commonwealth with the signing of the ANZUS Treaty between Australia, New Zealand and the United States in San Francisco in 1951.\\" correctly answer the question of Which areas were involved in the ANZUS Treaty?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"The Menzies Government entered Australia's first formal military alliance outside of the British Commonwealth with the signing of the ANZUS Treaty between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States in San Francisco in 1951.\\" correctly answers the question of which areas were involved in the ANZUS Treaty. The main countries involved are Australia, New Zealand, and the United States (hence the name ANZUS, which stands for Australia, New Zealand, United States). The ANZUS Treaty, signed on September 1, 1951, represents a response to the escalating global tensions during the Cold War and was intended to establish a collective defense system between the three participating countries. The Treaty was signed in San Francisco, where the founding conference for the United Nations took place several years earlier. The main reasons behind the establishment of the ANZUS Treaty were to ensure regional stability and shared commitment to defense in the Pacific Ocean. The Treaty was particularly significant for Australia and New Zealand because it marked a shift from their traditional reliance on the British Commonwealth for defense and security towards a new partnership with the United States. The ANZUS Treaty contains 11 articles, with Article IV at its core. This article states that in case of an armed attack on any of the Treaty's members, the other parties of the Treaty shall consult together and determine the necessary actions to maintain the collective defense and security in the Pacific region. However, the Treaty itself does not guarantee any automatic military responses, thus leaving room for flexibility and independent decision-making by the member states. The Treaty has been invoked only once in its history, following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. In this case, Australia and New Zealand offered their support to the United States in the subsequent military intervention in Afghanistan and the broader war against terrorism. Despite the overall successful cooperation between the three countries, there have been some changes and challenges to the Treaty. The most significant one was the partial termination of the Treaty's application to New Zealand in 1986 because of New Zealand's anti-nuclear policy. Although the Treaty has not been formally abrogated, cooperation between New Zealand and the United States took a more informal and separate route, while the Australia-US alliance has continued to prosper within the framework of the ANZUS Treaty. In conclusion, the ANZUS Treaty is a significant tripartite agreement between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, formed in 1951 to establish a collective defense system in the Pacific region. The Treaty marks an important shift in the security partnerships of Australia and New Zealand from their traditional reliance on the British Commonwealth to a new alliance with the United States. It remains a vital part of defense policy for the Pacific region and the participating countries."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Seed germination and establishment: Before the plant roots can begin to grow, the seed must germinate and establish itself in a suitable location. This is the initial step that leads to plant growth and ultimately to the processes mentioned in the given sequence. 2. The plant roots begin to grow: Once the seed has germinated and established, the roots start to grow and penetrate the rock. 3. Break apart the rock: As the plant roots grow and expand, they exert pressure on the rock and cause it to crack and break apart. 4. The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock: Plant roots release acids and other substances that help dissolve parts of the rock, further loosening and breaking it down. 5. The rocks are broken into more and more pieces: As roots continue to grow and acids keep dissolving rock, the rock is broken into smaller and smaller pieces. 6.

Policy . It is the policy of this Administration to rigorously enforce our immigration laws. Under our laws, the only legal way for an alien to enter this country is at a designated port of entry at an appropriate time. When an alien enters or attempts to enter the country anywhere else, that alien has committed at least the crime of improper entry and is subject to a fine or imprisonment under section 1325(a) of title 8, United States Code. This Administration will initiate proceedings to enforce this and other criminal provisions of the INA until and unless Congress directs otherwise. It is also the policy of this Administration to maintain family unity, including by detaining alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources. It is unfortunate that Congress’s failure to act and court orders have put the Administration in the position of separating alien families to effectively enforce the law.      Sec . 2 . Definitions . For purposes of this order, the following definitions apply:      (a) “Alien family” means      (i) any person not a citizen or national of the United States who has not been admitted into, or is not authorized to enter or remain in, the United States, who entered this country with an alien child or alien children at or between designated ports of entry and who was detained; and      (ii) that person’s alien child or alien children.

DONALD J. TRUMP      THE WHITE HOUSE,      June 20, 2018. ||||| poster=\\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201806/2747/1155968404_5799880576001_5799877076001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\\" true immigration Trump signs executive order halting family separations The furor over forcibly removing children from their parents prompted the administration to move without waiting for Congress.      President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday that ends the administration’s policy of separating migrant families crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, abandoning the president’s previous stance that only Congress can fix the problem.      “I didn’t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated,” the president told reporters in the Oval Office, flanked by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Vice President Mike Pence. “I think anybody with a heart would feel strongly about it. We don’t like to see families separated.”      Story Continued Below      Yet Trump said that he wanted to continue enforcing a strong policy at the border, an issue he campaigned on: “We are keeping a very powerful border and it continues to be a zero tolerance. We have zero tolerance for people that enter our country illegally.”      And the president continued to say that the underlying issue remains one for Congress to fix, titling the document an “executive order affording Congress an opportunity to address family separation.”      Administration officials also said that children who have already been separated from their parents won’t immediately be reunited, even if the parents remain in federal custody.

Another spokesman later said Wolfe had misspoken.      “It is still very early and we are awaiting guidance,” Brian Marriott, the HHS division’s senior director of communications, said in a statement. “Our focus is on continuing to provide quality services and care to the minors ... and reunifying minors with a relative or appropriate sponsor as we have done since HHS inherited the program.      “Reunification is always the ultimate goal of those entrusted with the care of UACs“ — unaccompanied alien children — “and the administration is working towards that for those UACs currently in HHS custody.\\"      The executive order came after Trump and his team faced harsh criticism from lawmakers, activists, religious leaders and former first ladies over the separation of children from their parents in custody, which was panned almost universally as cruel and damaging to the kids’ well-being.      It was a remarkable shift from a president who is typically reluctant to bow to outside pressure. He often doubles down on his existing stance when confronted with criticism.      With cable news flashing images of migrant children held in cages and lawmakers’ offices facing a flood of angry phone calls, the president was under increased pressure to come up with a speedy solution. White House aides came to the conclusion on Wednesday that Congress was unlikely to act quickly to resolve the crisis, even though they sent signals that Trump would be willing to sign a narrow, stand-alone fix without other immigration-related provisions.      The decision to end the separation policy via executive action appeared to have happened quickly, and some in the White House were left in the dark. Key members of the White House legislative affairs team, which had been working with Hill lawmakers in a bid to find a legislative fix, were left out of the loop and hadn't seen text of the executive action as of early Wednesday afternoon, according to two people familiar with the issue.      Nielsen and Justice Department officials went to the White House Wednesday morning to work with administration lawyers to draft the order. The action will direct the Department of Homeland Security to keep families together and will instruct the Department of Defense to help house the families because many of the detention centers are at capacity, according to a person familiar with the matter.      Attorney General Jeff Sessions was slated to go to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to brief lawmakers on the administration’s plans.      Trump and his top aides, led by Nielsen, have been saying that the law requires them to separate children from parents who were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally.      Nielsen and Trump repeatedly tried to blame Democrats for the situation at the border, saying that nothing could be done without a legislative resolution. But the separations were the direct result of a DOJ decision in April to prosecute border-crossers as criminals — a change Sessions described as “zero-tolerance.” The separation policy has been applied to most families detained at the border, with children handed over to federal welfare agencies after their parents are taken into custody by U.S. marshals.      Nielsen, who had expressed skepticism about moving forward with a zero-tolerance policy without action from Congress, has nonetheless become the public face of the crisis after defending the administration’s position during a tense briefing at the White House on Monday. On Tuesday night, protesters confronted her at a high-end Mexican restaurant in Washington.      Nielsen won’t abandon her demands for a legislative solution that would deal with family separations and accomplish Trump’s broader immigration agenda, according to a senior administration official.      “We’re still going to be pushing Congress to address this,” the official said. “That’s obvious and that’s not changing.”      The official said Nielsen was “a key player” in the talks at the White House on Wednesday morning, and had spent hours there. But the move appeared to take some Homeland Security Department officials by surprise.      The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement legal team wasn’t clued into the decision, according to a former DHS official with knowledge of the situation. “It sounds like they blindsided everybody,” this person said. “What changed in the last 12, 24 hours? … Either you believe that, operationally, this is what you need to be doing, or you don’t.”      ICE declined to comment, and several DHS component agencies did not immediately respond to related requests.      The executive action may not put an end to the question of how migrant children are handled at the border. The American Civil Liberties Union, which is already suing the administration on behalf of separated families, said prolonged detention of asylum seekers even as a unit would be unacceptable. “What we don’t want to see happen is we’ll keep the child and parent together but we’re going to detain them for a long time,” said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the nonprofit’s Immigrant Rights Project. “We don’t want to see a situation where they’re building more and more detention facilities.      Public outcry over the family separations reached new heights on Wednesday after The Associated Press reported that the administration is placing babies and toddlers in “tender age” shelters. The story capped a grim 24 hours that stood out as a low point even for a White House that long ago grew accustomed to operating in a perpetual state of crisis.      On Tuesday night, shortly before the AP story broke, Trump attended a 100,000-plus-per-person fundraiser at his hotel in Washington. Before that, he met with House Republicans at the Capitol, where he sounded off on everything from trade to fighter jets, while only briefly acknowledging the outcry over the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border.      Yet on Wednesday, Trump announced he’d delay the annual congressional picnic at the White House, planned for Thursday. “I said, you know, it doesn't feel right to have a picnic for Congress when we're working on doing something very important,” he said in a meeting with lawmakers at the White House. “It didn’t feel exactly right to me.”      During the meeting, Trump said he hoped his action would be “matched by legislation.”      Behind the scenes, White House officials have grown increasingly concerned about the fallout from the policy. Trump, for his part, seemed to vacillate between doubling down on the policy and complaining that Democrats are using the issue to sabotage him politically, and signaling to aides that he wants the issue resolved.      “It’s the Democrats fault, they won’t give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation,” Trump tweeted Wednesday. “They want open borders, which breeds horrible crime. Republicans want security. But I am working on something — it never ends!” The president also retweeted a tweet by Darrell Scott, a pastor and Trump supporter, that declared, “Once the mid terms are over, liberals won’t talk about detained or separated illegal immigrant children until 2020. #itsallpolitics.”      poster=\\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201806/3051/1155968404_5799817983001_5799805714001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\\"      Earlier Wednesday morning, Trump again defended his border security policies, while bashing the news media. The tweet came one day after the president revived the divisive anti-immigration rhetoric that defined his presidential campaign, warning Tuesday on Twitter that immigrants would “infest“ the United States.      “The Fake News is not mentioning the safety and security of our Country when talking about illegal immigration,” he wrote on Twitter. “Our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world, and the Dems will do anything not to change them & to obstruct-want open borders which means crime!”      The swirling controversy has sparked tensions inside the White House and among Trump’s allies, again laying bare the divide between the president’s hard-line advisers, including policy aide Stephen Miller, and more moderate influences.      Trump told lawmakers on Tuesday that his daughter and adviser Ivanka — who was widely criticized after posting a photograph of herself cuddling with her infant son amid the crisis — had about the separations. Ivanka Trump tweeted on Wednesday, after the executive order was signed: “Thank you @POTUS for taking critical action ending family separation at our border. Congress must now act + find a lasting solution that is consistent with our shared values;the same values that so many come here seeking as they endeavor to create a better life for their families.”      A White House official said on Wednesday that first lady Melania Trump had also been arguing behind the scenes, including in direct conversations with her husband, to end the family separation policy.      But others close to the president had encouraged him to double down on the policy, arguing that border security was one of the central pillars of his campaign and is deeply popular with his conservative base.      “It’s a mess,” one former White House official said.      One Republican former Department of Homeland Security official who has ties to the Trump administration and asked for anonymity to talk about the policy put it bluntly: “I’m ashamed of what they’re doing.”      The White House faced a wave of damaging stories about the family separations — from leaked audio of children crying to the revelations about the high cost of detaining children alone. The AP story, which detailed “play rooms of crying preschool-age children in crisis,” struck a particular chord, prompting MSNBC host Rachel Maddow to break down in tears on her Tuesday night television show.      Trump’s critics also pounced on an offensive comment by Trump’s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, on Fox News. When Democratic strategist Zac Petkanas referenced a report that a 10-year-old girl with Down syndrome was among the children who had been separated from her family at the border, Lewandowski could be heard saying, “Womp, womp,” later adding that immigrants give up rights when they cross the border illegally.      Lewandowski is still firmly in Trump’s inner circle as an informal adviser and recently joined Vice President Mike Pence’s political action committee.      In response to criticism of his remarks, Lewandowski complained Wednesday on Twitter that there was “lots of Fake News today” and argued he simply “mocked a liberal who attempted to politicize children as opposed to discussing the real issue which is fixing a broken immigration system.”      While some in Trump’s inner circle have defended the policy, lawmakers in both parties have condemned it. Even the pope has weighed in, telling Reuters that he agreed with recent comments by U.S. Roman Catholic bishops who called the policy “immoral.”      During her dinner at a Mexican restaurant on Tuesday night, one protester asked Nielsen, “How can you enjoy a Mexican dinner as you’re deporting and imprisoning tens of thousands of people who come here seeking asylum in the United States?”      Nielsen left the restaurant and a DHS spokesman later said: “While having a work dinner tonight, the secretary and her staff heard from a small group of protesters who share her concern with our current immigration laws that have created a crisis on our southern border. The secretary encourages all — including this group — who want to see an immigration system that works, that contributes to our economy, that protects our security, and that reflects our values to reach out to members of Congress and seek their support to close the terrible immigration loopholes that have made our system a mess.”      Ted Hesson, Rachael Bade, Eliana Johnson, Josh Gerstein and Stephanie Murray contributed to this report. ||||| (CNN) President Donald Trump on Wednesday reversed his debunked argument that he had no authority to stop separations of undocumented immigrant families at the border, signing an executive order to keep parents and kids together.      \\"We're signing an executive order. I consider it to be a very important executive order. It's about keeping families together, while at the same time being sure we have a very powerful, very strong border,\\" Trump said.      Trump's climbdown came after he faced intense pressure from across the political spectrum and from religious, political and world leaders to halt the separations, which produced days of heartrending news coverage of crying children -- some of whom were kept in cage-like detention centers.      The President claimed, though, that he isn't backing down.      \\"The border is just as tough. But we do want to keep families together,\\" Trump said in the Oval Office. \\"We are keeping the family together.\\"      Earlier Wednesday after a frenzied morning in which he huddled with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and other key officials, Trump first flagged his reversal saying, \\"I'll be doing something that's somewhat preemptive and ultimately will be matched by legislation I'm sure.\\"      Just the day before, Trump had claimed his administration's hands were tied without congressional action.      \\"Under current law, we have only two policy options to respond to this massive crisis. We can either release all illegal immigrant families and minors who show up at the border from Central America or we can arrest the adults for the federal crime of illegal entry. Those are the only two options, totally open borders or criminal prosecution for law-breaking,\\" the President had said.      By Wednesday morning, he had changed course.      In the executive order he signed on Wednesday, Trump declared it is his administration's policy to \\"maintain family unity,\\" including by detaining entire families together \\"where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources.\\"      The order directs other agencies, including the Pentagon, to take steps to find places to house family units.      The order specifies that migrants entering the US with children will not be kept together if there's a fear for the child's welfare. Families will also be prioritized in the adjudication process.      Even so, the move is almost certain to face immediate legal action challenging the administration's authority to keep families detained at length.      The President was not required to sign anything to change the administration's practice that elicited outrage. He could have reversed the practice of splitting children from their parents with a phone call.      Executive orders typically require input from the Office of the Legal Counsel. The details of the executive order were worked out between the White House, the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, a source said.      The White House may run into legal difficulties if the executive order requires families to be held intact together indefinitely since a federal consent decree known as the Flores settlement says children must be released after 20 days.      Reversal      Trump's decision to relent was a reversal since he had gambled that he could use the plight of the children and public outrage to ram through his hardline changes to immigration police in legislation.      The President continued to use tough immigration rhetoric even on Wednesday though, signaling that he is not softening his desire to change the country's laws more broadly.      \\"The dilemma is that if you're weak, if you're weak, which some people would like you to be, if you're really, really pathetically weak, the country's going to be overrun with millions of people,\\" Trump said.      \\"And if you're strong, then you don't have any heart. That's a tough dilemma. Perhaps I would rather be strong, but that's a tough dilemma,\\" he said.      Trump also postponed Thursday's congressional picnic at the White House, an event that is always keenly awaited by lawmakers and their families, saying it didn't feel right.      The President's decision came a day after he met Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill who fear that their own political prospects with the midterm elections are being damaged by the separation policy.      Democrats welcomed Trump's apparent change of course but said he had only himself to blame.      \\"The President is the one that created this humanitarian crisis,\\" Texas Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.      \\"I hope the President will fix the problem that he created.\\"      Crafting the order      While Attorney General Jeff Sessions was not at the meeting at the White House Wednesday morning, his chief of staff has been there to represent the Justice Department, the source added.      Prior to Trump's remarks, White House aides refused to comment on rumors of an executive order and Republicans on Capitol Hill seemingly had no knowledge of a coming executive action. Until now, Trump and White House officials have instead been pushing GOP lawmakers this week to pass legislation that deals with immigration reform.      The move -- if it retreats from his current stance that the administration is simply following the current law and needs congressional action to stop the separations -- would mark a huge reversal by the President.      Both first lady Melania Trump and Nielsen reportedly had roles in the changing course.      The first lady has been working for several days behind the scenes, encouraging the President to keep families together, a White House official told CNN. She has had several private conversations with her husband, pushing him to do all he can to keep families at the border intact, whether via a legislative route, or acting alone to stop the process, the official said.      The shift in Trump's thinking came an hour after Speaker Paul Ryan said the House would vote Thursday on a compromise between conservative and moderate Republican lawmakers that would address the issue of family separations.      The measure would also offer protections to another vulnerable group -- Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients -- who are undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children.      But the chances of the bill passing are unclear as is the case with any bill dealing with the volatile issue of immigration. The fact that it includes fundamental changes to the legal immigration system mean its chances in the Senate are even more uncertain. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"President Trump signed an executive order to end the separation of undocumented immigrant families at the U.S. border.

Steven Gerrard is haunted by that momentary slip three matches from the end of last season which pulled the Anfield turf out from under Liverpool as Premier League champions-elect. Given time to reflect plus the priceless gift of hindsight, his most vital loss of footing can now be seen as his stumbling failure nine years earlier to drive through a transfer to Liverpool’s opponents on that fateful April afternoon. Chelsea, who capitalised on that rare Gerrard error to both defeat Liverpool and deflate their title challenge, had made a £32million bid for him in the summer of 2005. Steven Gerrard checks his studs after slipping against Chelsea at Anfield last season. Gerrard lifts the European Cup in 2005 after the greatest night of his professional career. That came just six weeks after he captained Liverpool to the greatest comeback in Champions League final history, that epic victory over AC Milan from 3-0 down in Istanbul. Liverpool instantly rejected Chelsea’s offer. But Gerrard, although still only 25, was already suspecting that if he was ever to win a Premier League title it would have to be with a different team. Sadly, he has been proved right. In fact the drama and emotion of that astonishing night on the banks of the Bosphorous had brought him only temporary relief from that sense of foreboding, which had been nagging at him since Liverpool finished 30 points off the pace the preceding season. So he asked for a transfer. Coming from a very local hero, that request was perceived as heresy by the Liverpool faithful and they took to burning replicas of his shirt in the streets. As the protests reached a crescendo their Stevie G relented. Instead of insisting on his right to join the then-reigning League champions at Stamford Bridge, he signed a new £100,000 a week contract. The rest, as we always say, is history. Except that for Gerrard  it is not historic. Since 2005 he and Liverpool have won just one FA Cup and one League Cup – and still no Premier League medal for this valiant war-horse for whom the championship of England has been the Holy Grail since he signed for the club round the corner from his house at the age of eight. Nor is he likely to get one now. Chelsea, in that time, have won their first Champions League, four FA Cups, one League Cup, the Europa League once… and that Premier League title which Gerrard so covets, not once but twice. John Terry lifts the Premier League trophy in 2010 - it is an honour that has eluded Gerrard. Right now they lead the championship race by more points than Liverpool can remotely hope to retrieve and Gerrard is in his Last Chance Saloon, with the light fading. Ah, what might have been. Perhaps a life in English football would have been impossible for him, given how threatening the passions on Merseyside would have remained had he left the club for which he was born to play. But for whatever reason he let his heart over-rule his head, these subsequent nine years have been overflowing from midfield with his commitment to a great club striving to recapture the glory days, and last season so close to doing so. This has become a story of uplifting self-sacrifice in this age when footballers change clubs as often as their socks. Loyalty, however, is oft rewarded by a kick in the head. Gerrard (left), Glen Johnson (centre) and Jordan Henderson on the bench at the Bernabeu. The 34-year-old was also among the subs against Stoke on the 16th anniversary of his Liverpool debut. Gerrard was left out of what might well have been his last huge night in that hallowed red shirt – last month’s Champions League match at Real Madrid. Then he was dropped on his 16th anniversary of becoming a Liverpool player. At 34, this one-club servant finds himself embroiled in turmoil as to whether Liverpool want to contract him to end his career with them – or if even he would prefer now to cash in on his last legs with a move to somewhere like the booming US soccer market. Again, emotions are coming to the boil on Merseyside. The Liverpool skipper celebrates scoring his side's second goal against Leicester on Tuesday. Players past and present are urging him to stay. The fans are petitioning the board to extend his contract. And one of the outstanding players of his generation - the dyed-red Liverpool man who told true-blue Chelsea that he couldn’t quite bring himself to ‘jump off the cliff’ - finds himself back on the precipice. This time with the ground crumbling beneath his feet. Let us hope he makes a happy landing. If the Premier League title is not to be, that is the least Steven Gerrard deserves. Gerrard (third right) poses with fellow Liverpool greats (from left) Ron Yeats, Roger Hunt, Ian Callaghan, Phil Thompson, Phil Neal, Alan Kennedy, Alan Hansen, Kenny Dalglish, Ian Rush, Robbie Fowler, Jamie Carragher and youngsters Raheem Sterling and Jordan Rossiter, with Ian Ayre and Brendan Rodgers at the front. Pele and Ali are The Greatest - long may they last. Muhammad Ali posts a smiling selfie and declares himself fit and well to keep up the good fight against Parkinson’s. Pele reports himself back in the game after a spell in hospital. The Greatest Of All Time and the Greatest Footballer Ever… long may they last. The selfie posted by Muhammad Ali to demonstrate that he is getting better. Back to the Future - it's 1-0 to the Arsenal. To the Arsenal, one-nil. What is going on with the team that couldn’t hold on to a dog lead this season, until now. Is it back to the future? Back to the days when one goal was invariably enough for the Gunners? Perhaps not. The answer now seems to be scoring so late – as Alexis Sanchez did to beat Southampton on Wednesday night – that they only have to defend their lead for a minute or two.

Article:","output":"A Single Juror Stands Between Conviction and a Mistrial in the Michael Slager Case After more than two days of deliberations, a jury consisting of 11 whites and one African-American is unable to reach a unanimous verdict in the trial of former South Carolina police officer Michael Slager, who is charged with murder in the fatal shooting of unarmed black motorist Walter Scott. The jury's foreman informed the judge on Friday that one juror was preventing them from reaching a verdict. The juror in question expressed their inability to convict Slager in a letter read out in court, saying, \\"I cannot in good conscience consider a guilty verdict”. They further elaborated on their struggle, stating, \\"I still cannot, without a reasonable doubt, convict the defendant. At the same time, my heart does not want to have to tell the Scott family that the man who killed their son, brother, and father is innocent. But with the choices, I cannot and will not change my mind.\\" Slager, a white ex-cop, was filmed shooting Walter Scott, an African-American man, in the back as he ran away during a traffic stop in North Charleston in April 2015. The video, recorded by a bystander, went viral and caused nationwide outrage. As a result, Slager was charged with murder. The jury also has the option of convicting Slager of manslaughter, although it remains unclear which charge the 11 jurors are leaning toward. When Circuit Judge Clifton Newman was informed by the jury on Friday afternoon that they were unable to reach a verdict, he ordered them to resume deliberations, emphasizing their duty to \\"make every reasonable effort to reach a unanimous verdict.\\" The jury requested to continue the deliberations on Monday. If they remain deadlocked, a mistrial will be declared. The case reignited the national debate on racial bias and the use of excessive force by law enforcement against black citizens. Slager maintains that he feared for his life during the encounter with Scott, claiming that Scott had grabbed his Taser during a struggle. In addition to the state murder charge, Slager is facing a federal civil rights trial next year. If a mistrial is declared, it will raise questions about the role racial bias may have played in this case. While the majority of the jurors are white, it is crucial to consider that a unanimous verdict is required for either an acquittal or a conviction. The fact that all the other jurors, regardless of their race, were willing to convict Slager, while one juror could not, highlights the complexity of such cases and the division in views on law enforcement’s treatment of black citizens. As the nation awaits the jury's decision on Monday, the outcome of this case will carry significant implications for the ongoing conversation about racism and the relationship between law enforcement and the African-American community in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As enthusiasm for war rose among the English populace, privateers began to attack Dutch ships, capturing them and taking them to English harbors.  By the time that Charles II of England declared war on the United Provinces about two hundred Dutch ships had been brought to English ports.  Dutch ships were obligated by the new treaty to salute the English flag first.  In 1664, English ships began to provoke the Dutch by not saluting in return.  Though ordered by the Dutch government to continue saluting first, many Dutch commanders could not bear the insult. Still, the resulting flag incidents were not the casus belli as in the previous war. To provoke open conflict, James already in late 1663 had sent Robert Holmes, in service of the Royal African Company, to capture Dutch trading posts and colonies in West Africa.:67  At the same time, the English invaded the Dutch colony of New Netherland in North America on 24 June 1664, and had control of it by October. The Dutch responded by sending a fleet under Michiel de Ruyter that recaptured their African trade posts, captured most English trade stations there and then crossed the Atlantic for a punitive expedition against the English in America.:68 In December 1664, the English suddenly attacked the Dutch Smyrna fleet.  Though the attack failed, the Dutch in January 1665 allowed their ships to open fire on English warships in the colonies when threatened. Charles used this as a pretext to declare war on the Netherlands on 4 March 1665.

Originally published August 7, 2014 at 8:33 PM | Page modified August 7, 2014 at 11:13 PM      The search for Jenise Wright has shifted to a criminal probe after the body of a child believed to be that of the 6-year-old was discovered near her East Bremerton home.      BREMERTON — The investigation into the disappearance of Jenise Wright shifted to a criminal probe Thursday after a body believed to be that of the 6-year-old was discovered near her home.      Although formal identification by the Kitsap County coroner isn’t expected until Friday, detectives said Jenise’s parents had been notified of the discovery and grief counseling was being arranged for the family.      An autopsy Friday will determine how the girl died, said Scott Wilson, a spokesman for the Kitsap County Sheriff’s Office.      Wilson did not release detailed information about the location or condition of the girl’s body, but said during a media briefing Thursday, “we suspect that she just did not go off by herself and fall into some bushes and die.”      He said a suspect has not been identified, but that is now the focus of the local, state and federal law-enforcement officers who have been working the case since Monday.      The incident commander, Detective Lt. Earl Smith of the Sheriff’s Office, said the body was discovered in a wooded area that had been searched earlier in the week. He said it was found as searchers began honing in on smaller and smaller areas.      “That’s why we search again and again and again,” said Wilson.      Frank Montoya Jr., special agent in charge of the FBI Seattle office, said the girl’s body was discovered by his office’s Evidence Research Team with the assistance of K-9 units.      Jenise, who was to have started first grade next month, was last seen at about 10 p.m. Saturday when she went to bed in her home in the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park in unincorporated Kitsap County.      Her parents noticed she was gone Sunday morning, but were not initially alarmed because Jenise was known to wander freely around the park and find playmates, Wilson said.      Her parents began to worry about 8:30 p.m. Sunday and went door to door looking for her, he said. The Sheriff’s Office was alerted about an hour and a half later.      Wilson said Thursday there were no signs of forced entry at the girl’s home, and no indication she was taken from her room.      On Wednesday, when the focus was still on trying to find the girl, Wilson sought to deflect mounting criticism of the girl’s mother and father and their parenting choices.      He acknowledged the delay in contacting law enforcement seemed unusual but said the family lived unconventionally.      For example, he said, all the Wright children who were living in the home at the time were sharing one bedroom.      Child-welfare workers on Monday removed two children from the home.      Wilson also said earlier this week that investigators were aware that Jenise’s father had a criminal history but did not believe it was connected with the girl’s disappearance.      According to court records, James Wright was charged with first-degree child molestation in February 2000 for allegedly touching an 8-year-old girl inappropriately after a New Year’s Eve celebration.      Court records show Wright was additionally charged with third-degree child molestation six months later after a 15-year-old girl who was baby-sitting the 8-year-old girl during the New Year’s Eve party said Wright touched her breasts and put his hands down her pants, according to the records.      Wright pleaded guilty in December 2001 to a misdemeanor assault charge related to the older girl. He was sentenced to a year in jail, but a judge suspended the entire jail time provided he followed certain conditions.      Jenise’s parents took lie-detector tests Monday, but investigators are not disclosing the results. The family’s home has been searched at least three times by the Washington State Patrol and the FBI.      On Thursday, law-enforcement agents entered the home several times after the body was found, wearing white hazmat protection suits.      Police would not disclose if anything was taken from the home.      Incident commander Smith, noting authorities had received hundreds of tips, called again on the public for assistance.      Investigators are asking residents to call with any information they may have on unusual activity in or around Steele Creek Mobile Home Park from last Friday through Sunday.      “We want to know anything you might have seen or heard this weekend,” he said.      Anyone with possible information is asked to call the FBI tip line at 1-800-CALL-FBI.

FBI and other officials have received over 200 leads in the search for the six-year-old.      Authorities encourage the public to continue calling in tips and information in the case to 1-800-CALL-FBI.            Officials say the case is now a criminal investigation.      BREMERTON, Wash. - A four-day search for a missing 6-year-old Bremerton girl ended tragically Thursday, as authorities say they believe they have found the body of Jenise Wright.      \\"We are awaiting confirmation of the child’s identity by the coroner; however it appears that the body is      that of Jenise. Sheriff’s detectives expect that formal identification may occur tomorrow. The family has been notified,\\" said the Kitsap County Sheriff's Office in a released statement.      An autopsy will be conducted Friday by the county’s forensic pathologist. The coroner will determine cause and manner of death, which will help in the case, which officials are now calling a criminal investigation.            Authorities in Kitsap County are trying to narrow in on a suspect. They said there have been no arrests in the case, and no cause of death was given.            An FBI team using search dogs discovered the body in a forested area near the mobile home park where the girl lived about 11:30 a.m. Thursday. Her family has been notified. The body has been turned over to the county coroner, who is expected to positively identify and determine the cause of death on Friday.      The body was found near Still Creek mobile home park. Jenise was last seen there by her family Saturday night when she went to bed. She was reported missing the next day, launching a huge search with more than 100 people and 15 agencies, including the FBI. Searchers like father and son team, Tom and John Holt, said they were hoping for a better ending.      \\"It's just closure for the family,\\" said Tom Holt. \\"It's always hard. You always hope you're going to find somebody alive, maybe not hurt but just lost.\\"      The sheriff’s office said the discovery was due to a combination of information from the community, a pursuit of the hundreds of leads that have come in and the extensive search efforts. The FBI continues to collect tips at 1-800-CALL-FBI.            Community members began leaving items at the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park in honor of Jenise Wright. Others came to offer their condolences and say a prayer for the little girl.      \\"I have an 8-year old and she comes down to the neighborhood to play with some kids sometimes, and we are just so heartbroken right now,\\" said Ronald Newton, who never met Jenise but felt like he had seen her before.      Investigators also said no arrests have been made, but did not go into detail about whether they believed foul play was involved though they are calling this a criminal investigation.      \\"We don't suspect she went into the woods by herself and fall into the bushes and die,\\" said Kitsap County Sheriff's Department Deputy Scott Wilson.            The parents took FBI lie-detector tests Monday night, but the results have not been disclosed. Their home was also searched twice by different sets of authorities.            Officers have been going door to door at the mobile home park. They were also pulling surveillance video from nearby businesses and checking in with sex offenders in the county.            Court records show Jenise’s father, James Wright, was charged more than a decade ago with molesting two girls, ages 8 and 15. He pleaded guilty in Whatcom County Superior Court in December 2001 to a misdemeanor assault charge related to the older girl. It was not immediately clear why the molestation charges were dropped.      According to court records, the girl's father was charged with first-degree child molestation in February 2000, accused of molesting an 8-year-old girl following a New Year's Eve celebration. The girl told a detective and case worker that he inappropriately touched her, according to court documents.            More than a year later, in June 2001, the charges were amended to include third-degree child molestation after a 15-year-old girl who was babysitting the girl during New Year's Eve 2000 said that Wright touched her breasts and put his hands down her pants, according to court documents.            A judge in Whatcom County Superior Court sentenced Wright to a year in jail but suspended the entire jail time provided he followed certain conditions, including paying fees. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The investigation into the disappearance of 6-year-old Jenise Wright has turned into a criminal probe after a child's body, believed to be hers, was found near her East Bremerton home.

Bush with particular reference to his popular image as a war hero cemented in the public mind by his landing on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln for the 2003 Mission Accomplished Speech . However Palast alleges that Bush used his father s influence to gain a draft-dodging placement with the Texas Air National Guard Which he subsequently failed to serve . Palast picks up the story with Bush s 2000 US Presidential Election campaign where he claims Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris used their influence to purge and discount the ballots of predominantly Gore-supporting black voters through the fake felons list compiled by private company DBT/ChoicePoint for US 4 million . Palast goes on to examine the corporate donors to Bush s election campaign , such as Enron CEO Ken Lay , who as members of Bush s pioneer network contributed huge sums through family and friends , and who he claims subsequently profited from the Bush presidency with senior government appointments , no-bid contracts , executive orders and deregulation . Palast outlines what he refers to as the Bush-cycle , where Bush family members use money to gain political office and then use the office to gain even more money , dating back to Senator Prescott Bush who funded the family s entry into the oil business , citing the example of Bush s Harken Energy winning a contract to drill in the Persian Gulf thanks he alleges to Bush Snr s presidency .

I would like to give the app 3 stars. Firstly, the user interface is straightforward and easy to navigate. This makes it relatively simple for someone new to the app to explore its various options. However, I noticed that the design could be more aesthetically pleasing, as it seems outdated and dull. The app's performance is satisfactory, but it lacks speed and efficiency in certain areas. I experienced occasional lags and long loading times which impacted my overall experience with the app. I would recommend the developers to optimize the app's performance in future updates. One major aspect that I appreciated was the app's functionality. It serves its purpose and offers useful tools for users who need it. However, the app's feature set could be expanded to keep up with competing alternatives and provide a more comprehensive experience. Lastly, I found the in-app ads to be quite intrusive; they can hinder the user experience and distract from the app's main purpose. I would suggest offering an ad-free version or reducing the number of ads displayed to improve the overall experience. In conclusion, the com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid app has potential. With some adjustments and improvements in design, performance, and features, this app could compete well with other alternatives in the market.

I have a new situation: Two farmer's associations used different agricultural methods when growing crops. Bold farm used lots of fertilizers over the years, while Shallow farm used organic methods combined with methods from permaculture.  But I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  What is an answer for this question: Which farm put less nitrogen into bodies of water? A:","output":"Based on the given information, Shallow farm put less nitrogen into bodies of water. Step 1: Identify the farming methods used by each farm. - Bold farm used lots of fertilizers. - Shallow farm used organic methods and permaculture principles. Step 2: Determine the likelihood of nitrogen runoff from each farm. - Bold farm, which used lots of fertilizers, is more likely to have higher nitrogen runoff due to rain dissolving the fertilizers and carrying them away. - Shallow farm, which used organic methods and permaculture principles, is less likely to have high nitrogen runoff as these methods typically focus on reducing synthetic inputs like chemical fertilizers and promoting natural processes. Step 3: Connect the nitrogen runoff to its effect on bodies of water. - The nitrogen in the runoff from Bold farm would contribute to increased algae growth, leading to dead zones in bodies of water. - The organic methods and permaculture practices used in Shallow farm would contribute less nitrogen to bodies of water, thus reducing the chances of creating dead zones. In conclusion, Shallow farm put less nitrogen into bodies of water than Bold farm due to its use of organic methods and permaculture principles, which result in less nitrogen runoff."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

If you have learned to use the Internet, you can have a lot of interest on the World Wide Web   . What is the World Wide Web? The World Wide Web has been the most popular development of the Internet. It is like a big electronic   book with millions of pages. These pages are called homepages. You can find information about almost anything in the world on these pages. For example, you can use the Internet instead of a library to find information for your homework. You can also find information about your favourite sport or film star, talk to your friends or even do some shopping on the pages. Most pages have words, pictures and even sound or music. What is e-mail? Electronic mail (e-mail) is a way of sending messages to other people. It's much quicker and cheaper than sending a letter. If you want to use e-mail, you must have an e-mail address. This address must have letters and dots   and an @ (means \\"at\\"). For example: Lily @ Yahoo.com. Write a message, type a person's e-mail address, and then send the message across the Internet. People don't need to use stamps, envelopes or go to the post office because of the invention of the Internet. Quick, easy and interesting -- that's the Internet. Question: People like to use e-mail to send messages to their friends because  _  . - they don't have to pay any money - it's faster and cheaper - they don't need to have stamps, envelopes or addresses - it's interesting A:","output":"it's faster and cheaper"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There are two Campfire Circles which are used extensively during the peak camping season. The Large Campfire Circle has a Maori Gatewat which was presented by the Scouts New Zealand in 1951. The Lime Walk, constructed by previous estate owner Margaret Chinnery, surrounds the Training Ground which was the original main lawn area of the White House. Few of the Lime trees survive to this day. On this path sits the Jim Green Gate, a 1930 tribute to Jim Green, an editor of The Scouter magazine. The Buffalo Lawn is so called because of the replica of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Silver Buffalo Award that was presented by the Boy Scouts of America in 1926. This was to honour the Unknown Scout that helped William D. Boyce bring Scouting to the United States. Located there is a signpost with the directions and distances to all the World Scout Jamborees from Gilwell Park. Surrounding the Buffalo Lawn is part of the original balustrade of London Bridge which was re-built in 1820. The sections were moved to Gilwell Park after being purchased at auction in 1826. Considered by many to be the most important Scouting site, The Training Ground is where Wood Badge training was historically held and where the Gilwell oak tree is located. Contrary to popular belief, the Wood Badge beads have never been made of Gilwell Oak. On the Training Ground sits the Gidney Cabin, a memorial to the first Camp Chief, Francis Gidney, in 1929. Across from the Gidney Cabin is the Thurman Memorial, in memory of Camp Chief John Thurman. The caravan trailer, presented to Chief Scout Sir Robert Baden-Powell, along with a new Rolls-Royce car, during the 3rd World Scout Jamboree in 1929 is on display during the summer months. The caravan was nicknamed Eccles. The car, nicknamed Jam Roll, was sold after his death by Olave Baden-Powell in 1945.

Answer a question about this article: In 2001, Fuller, Cowell, and TV producer Simon Jones attempted to sell the Pop Idol format to the United States, but the idea was met with poor response from United States television networks. However, Rupert Murdoch, head of Fox's parent company, was persuaded to buy the show by his daughter Elisabeth, who was a fan of the British show. The show was renamed American Idol: The Search for a Superstar and debuted in the summer of 2002. Cowell was initially offered the job as showrunner but refused; Lythgoe then took over that position. Much to Cowell's surprise, it became one of the hit shows for the summer that year. The show, with the personal engagement of the viewers with the contestants through voting, and the presence of the acid-tongued Cowell as a judge, grew into a phenomenon. By 2004, it had become the most-watched show in the U.S., a position it then held on for seven consecutive seasons.

It represents the volume of a cube with each side measuring one foot in length. A cubic inch, on the other hand, represents the volume of a cube with each side measuring one inch in length. To determine the number of cubic inches in a cubic foot, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Understand that a cubic foot consists of a cube with sides measuring 12 inches each, as there are 12 inches in one foot. Step 2: Calculate the volume of the cube in cubic inches. To do this, multiply the length of one side (12 inches) by the width of the other side (12 inches) and by the height (12 inches):  12 inches * 12 inches *12 inches = 1,728 cubic inches So, there are 1,728 cubic inches in a cubic foot."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: The Entity Movie plot: The movie begins as single mother Carla Moran (Barbara Hershey) is violently raped in her home by an invisible assailant. A subsequent episode of poltergeist activity causes her to flee with her children to the home of her friend Cindy (Margaret Blye). They return to Carla's home and the following day, Carla is nearly killed when her car mysteriously goes out of control in traffic. Urged by Cindy to see a psychiatrist, Carla meets with Dr. Sneiderman (Ron Silver) and tentatively agrees to undergo therapy. A subsequent attack in her bathroom leaves bite marks and bruises, which Carla shows to Dr. Sneiderman, who believes she has inflicted them on herself (despite the marks showing up in places impossible for her to reach). We learn that Carla suffered a variety of traumas in her childhood and adolescence, including sexual and physical abuse, teenage pregnancy and the violent death of her first husband. Dr. Sneiderman believes her apparent paranormal experiences are delusions resulting from her past psychological trauma. Carla is attacked again, this time in front of her children. Her son tries to intervene but he is hit by electrical discharges and his wrist is broken. Dr. Sneiderman urges her to commit herself to a psychiatric hospital for observation, but she refuses. After Cindy witnesses an attack, the two discuss possible supernatural causes. While visiting a local bookstore, Carla happens to meet two parapsychologists, whom she convinces to visit her home. Initially skeptical, they witness several paranormal events and agree to study the home. During their study, Dr. Sneiderman arrives and confronts Carla, trying to convince her that the manifestation is in her mind, but she dismisses him. Reassured that her case is being taken seriously, Carla begins to relax. Her boyfriend Jerry (Alex Rocco) visits and she suffers a particularly disturbing attack, which he witnesses.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Process:  - You breathe air in - Air enters bronchial tubes - Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung - Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs - Alveoli is surrounded by many small blood vessels - Oxygen passes through alveoli into blood vessels - Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body - Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"You havent gotten your flu shot\\" happens, how will it affect Your lungs are inflamed with pneumonia.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation \\"You haven't gotten your flu shot\\" has an indirect effect on the process of breathing, especially if your lungs are already inflamed with pneumonia.  When you do not get a flu shot, you are at a higher risk of contracting the influenza virus. The flu is a respiratory illness that can lead to complications such as pneumonia, particularly in high-risk individuals like young children, the elderly, or those with pre-existing health conditions. Pneumonia is an infection that causes inflammation in the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs, making it more difficult for oxygen to pass through into the bloodstream and for carbon dioxide to be released when exhaling. In such a case, the process of breathing will be affected as follows: 1. You breathe air in: With inflamed lungs due to pneumonia, breathing may become more labored and difficult as the inflammation narrows the airways, making it harder for air to flow in and out. 2. Air enters bronchial tubes: Inflammation may cause the bronchial tubes to become swollen, further restricting airflow. 3. Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung: As with the bronchial tubes, the bronchioles may also become narrowed due to inflammation. 4. Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs: The alveoli may fill with fluid or pus due to the infection, reducing their ability to effectively absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide. 5. Alveoli are surrounded by many small blood vessels: The inflammation can also affect the surrounding blood vessels, causing them to become less efficient in transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide. 6. Oxygen passes through alveoli into blood vessels: The inflamed and fluid-filled alveoli impair the transfer of oxygen into the bloodstream. 7. Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body: With a reduced amount of oxygen being absorbed, the blood may carry less oxygen to the body's cells. 8. Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs: The reduced efficiency in gas exchange also affects the removal of carbon dioxide from the bloodstream. 9. Carbon dioxide is released when you exhale: The impaired gas exchange in the lungs makes it harder to release carbon dioxide, causing you to potentially experience shortness of breath and other symptoms. In conclusion, not getting a flu shot can indirectly affect the process of breathing by increasing your risk of contracting the flu, which may lead to pneumonia. This, in turn, causes inflammation in the lungs that impairs the normal breathing process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article based on this \\"A spate of scams in which criminals use technology to take over victims' computers has been reported by an anti-fraud group.\\"","output":"Title: The Rising Tide of Tech-Driven Scams: How Criminals are Exploiting Technology to Hijack Computers Introduction In recent years, there has been a significant increase in technology-driven scams, with criminals using ingenious and sophisticated methods to take control of people's computers to gain unauthorized access to their personal and financial information. An alarming number of such cases have been reported by an anti-fraud group, highlighting the urgent need to create awareness and educate people on how to protect themselves from falling prey to these scams. The Evolution of Cyber Scams Cyber criminals have come a long way since the days of simple phishing emails asking for personal details. They now employ various tactics to trick victims into granting them access to their computer systems. Some of these tactics include: 1. Social Engineering Attacks: These scams involve tricking people into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that inadvertently grant the attacker access. For example, the attacker may impersonate a legitimate entity such as a bank or government agency and send an email requesting the victim to disclose their login credentials or install a seemingly legitimate software update. 2. Remote Access Trojans (RATs): Cybercriminals can use RATs to gain unauthorized access to an individual's computer. Once the malware is installed on the victim's machine, the attacker has control over their desktop, files, and webcam, among other components. This allows the hacker to carry out nefarious activities, such as identity theft, financial fraud, and the theft of sensitive personal or business information. 3. Ransomware Attacks: In this type of attack, criminals install malware that encrypts users' files, rendering them inaccessible without the decryption key. They then demand a ransom, usually in the form of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, in exchange for the decryption key. If the ransom is not paid, the criminal may threaten to delete the files or release them publicly. How Criminals Exploit Technology To carry out their scams, criminals leverage technological tools and weaknesses to infiltrate computer systems. Some of the exploitation methods include: 1. Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities: Many cyber attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in commonly used software applications and operating systems. They take advantage of these flaws to inject malicious code that grants them unauthorized access. 2. Deploying Malicious Software: Hackers can infect computers with malware through various channels, such as phishing emails, malicious website downloads, or infected USB devices. Once the malware is installed on a victim's computer, it can carry out multiple damaging activities. 3. Spear Phishing: Cybercriminals use carefully crafted, targeted emails to deceive recipients into clicking on malicious links or opening infected attachments. These emails may appear to come from a trusted contact, making it difficult for recipients to identify them as scams. 4. Drive-by Downloads: Some cyber-attacks involve injecting malicious software into legitimate websites. This allows them to exploit web browser vulnerabilities and initiate an automatic download of malware, often without the victim even realizing it. Protecting Yourself From Scams The consequences of falling victim to a tech-driven scam can be devastating, both emotionally and financially. Here are some steps individuals and businesses can take to mitigate these risks: 1. Keep Software Updated: Regularly update operating systems, applications, and antivirus software to fix security vulnerabilities and improve overall protection. 2. Employ Multi-Factor Authentication: Use multi-factor authentication whenever possible. This requires two or more forms of verification to access an account, making it more difficult for criminals to gain unauthorized access. 3. Be Aware of Phishing Scams: Learn to recognize and avoid suspicious emails, text messages, and social media posts. Do not click on links or open attachments in unsolicited communications. 4. Use Strong Passwords: Create unique, complex passwords for each account and change them regularly. Avoid using easily guessed passwords like \\"123456\\" or \\"password.\\" 5. Educate and Train Employees: Companies should educate their employees about best cyber-security practices and the importance of maintaining a strong security posture. Regular training and awareness programs can help employees identify potential threats and scams. Conclusion As technology continues to evolve and become an integral part of our lives, it is crucial to remain vigilant against the ever-growing threat of scams. By staying informed about the latest trends in cybercrimes and taking precautionary measures, individuals and businesses can safeguard themselves against the risk of falling victim to these sophisticated scams. The collaboration between law enforcement agencies, cybersecurity experts, and anti-fraud groups will be essential in the fight against these malicious attacks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Octavia Estelle Butler was born on June 22, 1947, in Pasadena, California, the only child of Octavia Margaret Guy, a housemaid, and Laurice James Butler, a shoeshine man. Butler's father died when she was seven, so Octavia was raised by her mother and maternal grandmother in what she would later recall as a strict Baptist environment. Growing up in the racially integrated community of Pasadena allowed Butler to experience cultural and ethnic diversity in the midst of racial segregation. She accompanied her mother to her cleaning work, where the two entered white people's houses through back doors, as workers. In the mid-1990s, Butler published two novels later designated as the Parable (or Earthseed) series. The books depict the struggle of the Earthseed community to survive the socioeconomic and political collapse of twenty-first century America due to poor environmental stewardship, corporate greed, and the growing gap between the wealthy and the poor. The books propose alternate philosophical views and religious interventions as solutions to such dilemmas.  The first book in the series, Parable of the Sower (1993), features a fifteen-year-old protagonist named Lauren Oya Olamina, and is set in a dystopian California in the 2020s. Lauren, who suffers from a syndrome causing her to literally feel any physical pain she witnesses, decides to escape the corruption and corporatization of her community of Robledo. She forms a new belief system, Earthseed, in order to prepare for the future of the human race on another planet. Recruiting members of varying social backgrounds, Lauren relocates her new group to Northern California, naming her new community \\"Earthseed\\".  Her 1998 follow-up novel, Parable of the Talents, is set sometime after Lauren's death and is told through the excerpts of Lauren's journals as framed by the commentary of her estranged daughter, Larkin. It details the takeover of Earthseed by right-wing fundamentalist Christians, Lauren's attempts to survive their religious \\"re-education\\", and the final triumph of Earthseed as a community and a doctrine.  In between her Earthseed novels, Butler published the collection Bloodchild and Other Stories (1995), which includes the short stories \\"Bloodchild\\", \\"The Evening and the Morning and the Night\\", \\"Near of Kin\\", \\"Speech Sounds\\", and \\"Crossover\\", as well as the non-fiction pieces \\"Positive Obsession\\" and \\"Furor Scribendi\\".

The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost.  Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change.

A Rockland, Maine, woman says she would rather go to jail than take down her pro-Donald Trump signs.      Susan Reitman has hung two banners on her front gate: One that says \\"I love Trump\\" and another that says \\"He Won, Get over it.\\"      She received a notice from the city’s code enforcement office a few days ago, asking her to take them down.      \\"I was shocked,\\" she said. \\"This is my freedom of speech. People have a right to voice their opinion.\\"      FBI Director Wray Says He’s ‘Angry’ About Shutdown      FBI Director Christopher Wray shared his thoughts on the ongoing government shutdown with a publicly released video. (Published Friday, Jan. 25, 2019)      Assistant Code Officer Bill Butler said another Rockland resident complained about the signs' size. The city ordinance states residential signs can be no larger than 2 square feet.      Reitman’s signs are a little larger than 3 feet by 2 feet.      \\"They’re well over the limit,\\" Butler said.      He said residents need to apply for permits to display signs like that. They are able to follow an appeals process if their permits are denied.      Reitman said she wasn’t aware of the ordinance and feels it should be changed to allow for this kind of political speech.      She has until Friday to remove the banners, or else face a fine between 100-1,000 a day.      Trump Confidant Roger Stone Arrested in Russia Probe      Another confidant of President Donald Trump was arrested during the course of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Roger Stone was charged with witness tampering, obstruction and lying to authorities. (Published Friday, Jan. 25, 2019)      Reitman has no plans to pay fines or remove signs.      \\"If I have to sit in jail for the rest of eternity, that’s my choice,\\" she said. \\"I guess I’m being stubborn ... but I’m not going to back down from what I believe.\\" ||||| ROCKLAND — A 75-year-old Rockland woman says she would rather go to jail than follow a city directive to remove signs supporting President Trump.      Susan Reitman has been directed to remove the pro-Trump signs because they exceed the size of signs allowed on residential properties, Rockland Assistant Code Enforcement Officer William Butler said.      He said the directive has nothing to do with the signs’ content.      “I admire your passion for our president. Truly, I do,” Butler said in a Monday email to Reitman. “However, we have received a complaint and I have to do my due diligence and I have determined your signs are not in compliance with the Rockland Code.      “It is your business what you put on the signs. It is the city’s business regarding the size and number of signs.”      There was no threat of jail mentioned in the email and the city would first need to file a land-use complaint in court. Jail would be a risk only if a judge ordered the removal of the signs and Reitman refused to follow the court order.      The city’s sign ordinance limits residences to one sign, either one that is attached to a structure and is no more than 2 square feet or a free-standing sign of no more than 4 square feet.      The gate to Reitman’s driveway has two signs that exceed the size limits, and she also has one on her ranch-style house on Seavey Lane, a dead-end road off South Main Street that has 10 homes.      She said the assistant code officer had been on her property earlier this month about a request she had to add a fence and she was not told the signs were in violation at that time.      Butler said he received an email complaint from a resident and that he was obligated to respond. He declined to release the name of the complainant, but said the identity would be released if a formal Freedom of Access Act request was made. The Courier-Gazette filed such a request Monday.      Reitman said she would not remove the signs, despite the warning from the city.      “They can put me in jail. I won’t take them down,” she said.      The city ordinance carries a potential penalty of between 100 and 1,000 per day for violations.      Reitman said she also will refuse to pay any fine and that the city can place liens on her property if it wants to. She said she is living on a fixed income.      “I have the right to support our president. This is about freedom of speech,” she said.      Rockland, which had a population of 7,179 in 2016 according to the U.S. Census, has 1,798 registered Democrats and 1,223 registered Republicans. Hillary Clinton won the city’s presidential vote in November, 58 percent to 35 percent for Donald Trump. Both of the state legislators representing the city, one in the House and one in the Senate, are Democrats.      Reitman, who is retired and a widow, has lived in the home since 2006. Trained as a nurse, she last worked for Coastal Opportunities in Camden.      Maine law allows campaign signs to be on the state road right-of-way six weeks before an election and one week after the vote. State law allows campaign signs on private property if they are not within a road right-of-way. State law, however, says that municipalities can impose stricter regulations.      Reitman said that if the signs are within the road right-of-way she would move them to her house.      However, Butler said that the law on campaign signs has no bearing on the situation and that he issued the directive because the signs violate the ordinance governing the size and number of signs on a residential property.

What does it mean when a girl mentions her boyfriend in conversation a lot to another guy she just met? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"When a girl sends a picture of her legs while bathing to someone, it can mean different things depending on the context of the conversation and the nature of the relationship between the two individuals involved. Here are some possible interpretations: 1. Friendly gesture: It is possible that the girl considers the recipient a close friend and trusts him enough to share a casual picture of herself. This could just be a way to catch up, start a conversation, or share her relaxation time with a trusted friend. 2. Seeking attention or validation: The girl may be looking for feedback or compliments on her appearance. She could be feeling insecure or needing a confidence boost, and by sharing the picture, she may be hoping for some positive reinforcement or validation. 3. Flirting: In some cases, the girl might be trying to flirt with the recipient or gauge his level of interest in her. Sending a picture of her legs while bathing can be seen as a light-hearted, yet subtle way of suggesting physical attraction or stirring up intrigue. Regarding the second scenario where a girl mentions her boyfriend frequently in conversation with a guy she just met, it can also have multiple meanings: 1. Setting boundaries: She might be trying to make it clear that she is in a committed relationship and not looking for anything romantic or sexual with the other guy. By continuously mentioning her boyfriend, she establishes her relationship status and signals that she is off-limits. 2. Bragging or seeking validation: She could be proud of her relationship and feel the need to share her happiness and excitement with others. By frequently bringing up her boyfriend, she may seek validation for her relationship or want to portray it as a significant aspect of her life. 3. Testing the waters: In some cases, the girl might be trying to gauge the other guy's reaction to her relationship status. If she is unsure about her feelings toward her boyfriend and is exploring other possibilities, she might repeatedly mention her boyfriend to see if the other guy is still interested or stays in contact. Given the scenarios mentioned above, it is evident that the two questions are not the same. While both situations involve some form of communication between a girl and a guy, the context and potential intentions behind the interaction differ significantly. The first scenario deals with a girl sending a suggestive picture, which primarily focuses on the physical aspect and may indicate flirting or a friendly gesture. Conversely, the second scenario revolves around a girl mentioning her boyfriend in the conversation, which can serve as a way to gauge the other guy's reactions and set boundaries or expectations. Therefore, the two questions are distinct from one another and cannot be treated as the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How might humans reduce greenhouse gases? - Available choices: (a). Buy cars that use gasoline. (b). Build power plants that use coal. (c). Use renewable resources to generate power. (d). Use nonrenewable resources to generate power.","output":"To reduce greenhouse gases, humans could turn towards a more sustainable form of energy production and consumption. Among the options provided, the one most likely to help in achieving this goal is option (c) - using renewable resources to generate power. Here's a detailed explanation as to why that is, and the ways our species might succeed in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 1. Renewable Energy: This is a type of energy that is derived from natural processes that are replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed. This includes sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. The large-scale deployment of renewable energy technologies accelerates our shift from fossil fuels and thus reduces greenhouse gases. For instance, solar panels convert sunlight directly into electricity, and wind turbines convert the kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical power. Both methods do not emit any greenhouse gases and are considerably friendlier to the environment compared with conventional fuels. 2. Energy Efficiency: In addition to using renewable energy, we can also strive for energy efficiency. This involves doing more with less energy, such as using energy-efficient appliances or improving insulation to reduce the need for heating and cooling. It reduces the amount of energy required for a given service or level of activity. By using less energy, we reduce the demand for fossil fuel energy and thus decrease the greenhouse gases that would be emitted. 3. Green Transportation: Another way to reduce greenhouse emission is by modifying our means of transportation. Vehicles that run on gasoline or diesel are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, promoting the use of electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid vehicles, or biofuel-powered vehicles can decrease carbon dioxide emissions substantially. In addition, encouraging biking, walking, or using public transit where possible also contributes to lower emissions. 4. Sustainable Agriculture: The agricultural industry is another substantial source of greenhouse gases. Sustainable farming practices, such as organic farming, agroecology, and permaculture, can help reduce emissions by sequestering carbon in the soil, reducing the use of synthetic fertilizers, and reducing the amount of methane produced by livestock. 5. Forestation and Reforestation: Planting trees, also known as afforestation, can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing the overall impact of emissions. Similarly, reforestation, the process of replanting an area with trees, can restore damaged ecosystems and offset emissions. 6. Widespread Education and Advocacy: Creating mass awareness about the adverse effects of greenhouse gases and global warming can help bring about a shift in public behavior and mindset. As more and more people understand the urgency to act against climate change, it can lead to more sustainable consumer choices and increased political will to implement climate-friendly policies. To sum it up, while options (a), (b), and (d) such as buying gasoline cars, building coal power plants, and using nonrenewable resources to generate power would exacerbate the problem of greenhouse gas emissions, option (c) – using renewable resources to generate power – would indeed reduce the concentration of these gases. However, it should be emphasized that moving to renewable energy sources is just one of many changes that need to be made in the way we live and work if we wish to reduce our carbon footprint significantly."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment.  \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not. So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet,\\" Buhari said. According to the above context, answer the following question. How does Nigeria feel about Trump's comments? OPT: *not enough information; *confused; *humored; *outraged; The answer is:","output":"Based on the provided context, Nigeria felt outraged about Trump's comments. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries.

Background: Tyson Cleotis Chandler (born October 2, 1982) is an American professional basketball player for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Chandler was the second overall pick of the 2001 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Clippers, then was immediately traded to the Chicago Bulls. He has also played for the New Orleans Hornets, Charlotte Bobcats, Dallas Mavericks, and New York Knicks. As starting center for Dallas, he played an integral role in the franchise's first NBA championship in 2011. Context: Chandler was born to Frank Chandler and Vernie Threadgill, though he did not meet his father Frank until later in his life. He grew up in a family farm in Hanford, California, just south of Fresno, California. Chandler began playing basketball at the age of three years on a basket Chandler's grandfather, Cleotis, fixed on a tree. Chandler grew up doing farm work such as milking cows, slopping pigs, and cultivating crops. At the age of nine years, Chandler and his mother moved to San Bernardino, California; he was already nearly six feet tall. As a child, Chandler was teased because of his height; children on his school basketball team joked that he was older than he really was, and that he had been left back several times in school.  Chandler and his family then moved to Compton, California, where he enrolled at Dominguez High School, a school known for its athletics, producing basketball players such as Dennis Johnson and Cedric Ceballos. In his freshman year, Chandler made the varsity team and played with future NBA player Tayshaun Prince, who was then a senior. With the Dominguez Dons, Chandler became a teenage sensation; current players such as DeMar DeRozan watched him play and claimed \\"he was like Shaq\\". Point guard Brandon Jennings, who was a ball boy for Dominguez at the time, said, \\"You'd see the girls around Tyson, the Escalade he drove, and you wanted to be like him\\". Chandler earned accolades from Parade Magazine and USA Today, and was selected to the McDonald's High School All-America Team. As a freshman, he was profiled on current affairs TV program 60 Minutes.  In his junior year, Chandler averaged 20 points, 12 rebounds, 6 assists and 3 blocks. In his senior year, Chandler led Dominguez to a state championship and a 31-4 record, averaging 26 points, 15 rebounds, and 8 blocks a game. Chandler was recruited by several universities and considered UCLA, Arizona, Syracuse, Memphis, Kentucky and Michigan. Chandler then declared for the 2001 NBA draft as a prep-to-pro. Question: When did his high school career begin? Answer:","output":"Tyson Chandler's high school career began when he enrolled at Dominguez High School in Compton, California.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn’t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out – and they knew him.

Scary Monsters and Super Creeps (1980) produced the number-one hit \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \\"Space Oddity\\". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal.

Minogue acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, \\"If you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go.\\"In 1993, Baz Luhrmann introduced Minogue to photographer Bert Stern, notable for his work with Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism. Throughout her career, Minogue has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new \\"look\\" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge The Face to the more traditionally sophisticated Vogue and Vanity Fair, making the Minogue face and name known to a broad range of people. Stylist William Baker has suggested that this is part of the reason she entered mainstream pop culture in Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate solely on selling records.By 2000, Minogue was considered to have achieved a degree of musical credibility for having maintained her career longer than her critics had expected. Her progression from the wholesome \\"girl next door\\" to a more sophisticated performer with a flirtatious and playful persona attracted new fans. Her \\"Spinning Around\\" video led to some media outlets referring to her as \\"SexKylie\\", and sex became a stronger element in her subsequent videos. William Baker described her status as a sex symbol as a \\"double edged sword\\", observing that \\"we always attempted to use her sex appeal as an enhancement of her music and to sell a record.

Another popular news presenter is Kirsty Young. She has a more modern style of reading the news, as you can see, she sits on the desk not on a chair! Television news presenters need to have worked as journalists because they have to write most of the news that they read. Sometimes an important new event happens after the program has started, so the presenter has to be able to read something without looking at it first. They must always keep calm even when there are many changes during the program. At the end of \\"News at Ten\\"Trevor McDonald says \\"And finally...\\". Then he reads an unusual or interesting item.

A one-year-old whose face is paralyzed due to an extremely rare neurological condition is set to. undergo groundbreaking surgery that will see him smile for the first. time. Preston Tassi from Des Moines, Iowa, is one of several thousand people worldwide who suffers from Moebius Syndrome, which means he cannot blink, look side-to-side or move his mouth. However, doctors told KCCI.com that they are planning to treat his debilitating symptoms through a special procedure that will insert nerve and muscle tissue from his inner thigh into the jaw area. Expressionless: Preston Tassi from Des Moines, Iowa, whose face is paralyzed due to an extremely rare neurological condition, is set to undergo groundbreaking surgery that will see him smile for the first time. Preston's parents are now desperately trying to raise the 100,000 needed for the operation, often referred to as smile or reanimation surgery, which will take place when he turns five. Sarah Tassi said she and her husband, Jason first realized something was wrong shortly after Preston's birth on May 18, 2012. While ultrasounds had not detected anything unusual, they were surprised to see that he only had one finger on his right hand. Nurses were also concerned that he was breathing oddly and his eyes stayed wide open while he cried. Hoping to see their son smile: Sarah and Jason Tassi are desperately trying to raise the 100,000 needed for surgery to correct Preston's debilitating symptoms. After doctors assessed the newborn's condition, Mr and Mrs Tassi were called in to meet with a neurologist. An MRI scan confirmed that Preston had Moebius Syndrome. The incurable birth disorder prevents the cranial nerves around the brain from developing, resulting in an inability to move the eyes and face. In some cases it also impacts hearing. 'Just because someone may not smile on the outside, doesn't always mean they're not smiling on the inside' Other indicators include clubbed feet, missing digits and breathing difficulties. It is thought to affect roughly two to 20 births in every one million and a 2007 study identified 2,000 cases globally. Since birth Preston has been going to. weekly physical therapy sessions, but to restore control of his lips and. tongue surgical intervention will be needed. Mrs Tassi says that at the moment he is unable to eat unaided. 'As we feed him we have to hold his. cheeks in,' she explained. On the flip side Preston's motor skills are. on track with other children his age and he is almost ready to walk. In a bid to raise the thousands of dollars needed for surgery the Tassis have moved back in with their parents and set up a website called smilesforpreston.com. Step-by-step: Since birth Preston has been going for weekly physical therapy sessions. On their site they write: 'Preston is a remarkable little boy. Nothing is going to stand in his way. And we hope that sharing our story (his story), it will raise more awareness for others with this very rare syndrome. 'And for others to realize you can't always judge a book by it's cover. Just because someone may not smile on the outside... doesn't always mean they're not smiling on the inside.' Dr Nate Noble, Preston's doctor at Blank Children's Hospital, says his case will help professionals to better understand Moebius syndrome. Despite the challenges they have faced as new parents, Mr Tassi added: 'We just feel blessed to have him in our lives. Every second of it.' Moebius Syndrome, first described in 1888, is an extremely rare congenital neurological disorder which is characterized by facial paralysis and the inability to move the eyes from side-to-side. Most people with the condition have normal intelligence but they are born with complete facial paralysis and cannot close their eyes or form facial expressions. Other indicators include clubbed feet, missing digits and breathing difficulties. It is thought to affect two to 20 births in every one million. The disorder results from the underdevelopment of cranial nerves around the brain which control lateral eye movement and facial expression. Ocassionally hearing can also be affected. It is estimated that there are two to 20 cases of Moebius syndrome per million births. There is no single course of medical treatment or cure. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy are recommended to improve motor skills and coordination. Smile or reanimation surgery, which transfers muscle and nerves grafted from the thigh to the corners of the mouth, can be performed to provide the ability to smile.

Is the question \\"What island group is Guadalcanal a part of ?\\" asking about an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric entity?","output":"The question \\"What island group is Guadalcanal a part of?\\" is asking about a location. The question seeks information about the larger geographic context or group of islands that Guadalcanal, which is itself an island, belongs to. Guadalcanal is a part of the Solomon Islands, an archipelago consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands. The Solomon Islands are located in the South Pacific, to the northeast of Australia and east of Papua New Guinea. The archipelago is part of the geographic region known as Oceania, which also encompasses other Pacific Island countries such as Fiji, Vanuatu, and the Federated States of Micronesia. The Solomon Islands cover a land area of approximately 28,000 square kilometers and possess a diverse range of ecosystems, from coral atolls and volcanic islands filled with lush vegetation to mountainous interiors and low-lying coastal plains. The islands are known for their rich biodiversity, including unique wildlife, dense rainforests, and pristine marine habitats. The Solomon Islands have a complex history, marked by centuries of diverse cultural and linguistic influences from Melanesian, Polynesian, and Asian peoples. Encounters with Europeans began in the 17th century, and the islands were later colonized by the British in the late 19th century. The Solomon Islands gained independence in 1978. During World War II, the Solomon Islands became a crucial battleground in the Pacific theatre, particularly between the United States and Japan. Guadalcanal, the largest of the Solomon Islands, was the site of the Guadalcanal Campaign in 1942-1943. The intense, months-long conflict between the Allied (primarily American) forces and the Japanese forces resulted in significant casualties on both sides and ultimately led to a strategic victory for the Allies. The Battle of Guadalcanal is considered one of the turning points of the Pacific War. In conclusion, the question \\"What island group is Guadalcanal a part of?\\" is asking about a location, specifically about the group of islands in which Guadalcanal is situated.

Sweden's Klarna to Enter U.S. Online Payment Market STOCKHOLM—The already-crowded U.S. online-payments market is getting another player, with Sweden's Klarna AB saying it will join the fray early next year. The nine-year-old Swedish company has expanded at a fast clip from the Nordic countries to a number of large markets including the U.K. and Germany. Now, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Sebastian Siemiatkowski says the time is right to enter the U.S., with a launch planned there just after Christmas. Klarna is currently setting up offices in New York, Mr. Siemiatkowski said in an interview. The company expects to launch with five to 10 merchants signed up for the service. \\"Some are ones you definitely have heard of. Others will be more small, regional players. We will want a good variety to go to market with,\\" he said. \\"We've felt over the years that the opportunity is there, that our checkout product really has huge potential in the U.S.\\" He said Klarna, which has bagged close to 300 million in outside backing to date, can launch in the U.S. without having to raise any additional capital. But it may look at raise more money as it ramps up, Mr. Siemiatkowski said, anticipating a U.S. staff of more than a hundred in a couple of years, from around 20 expected at launch time. Klarna's management team includes fresh hires from both eBay Inc. EBAY -0.10 % 's PayPal unit and Apple Inc. AAPL 0.05 % The company would be facing huge rivals, including PayPal, which posted revenue of some 7 billion last year, compared with Klarna's 219.1 million in 2013. PayPal is currently the default payment option on millions of U.S. websites. And through its 800-million acquisition of Braintree Payments last year, PayPal also provides the payment back-end for many prominent startups, such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc. Nevertheless, in less than 10 years, Klarna has grown into a substantial payment business. It expects revenue of 300 million this year. It has over a thousand employees set to handle over €7 billion (9.06 billion) of transactions this year in 15 markets. In a funding deal last year, it was valued at 1.4 billion. Sequoia Capital, whose previous investments includes early stakes in Apple and Google Inc., GOOGL 0.26 % is Klarna's largest outside backer. Mr. Siemiatkowski said Klarna's payment solution reduces to an absolute minimum the amount of information required from buyers to complete online purchases. \\"Basically, we are a user interface company with a very sophisticated risk engine,\\" Mr. Siemiatkowski said. Klarna earns most of its money through fees it charges merchants, but it also underwrites risk for online merchants and offers their buyers credit products such as installment plans. \\"We assume all the risk. We have the skin in the game,\\" said Brian Billingsley, the company's recently hired U.S. chief. In the U.S. Klarna will face a number of other upstarts trying to eke out market share in online and mobile payments, including Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -0.05 % and Stripe Inc. Amazon last year rolled out an online checkout option for websites that mirrors PayPal's, though it has yet to attract many well-known websites. San Francisco-based Stripe recently reached agreement to provide online payments systems for both Apple and Twitter Inc. TWTR -3.82 % By one measure, Apple far outpaces PayPal or Amazon in online payments. With iTunes, Apple has at least 800 million active accounts, many of which have associated credit cards, compared with 250 million active accounts at Amazon and 150 million for PayPal. This month, Apple introduced Apple Pay, a wireless payments system for its new line of smartphones and smartwatches, that will let users buy merchandise simply by waving a newer iPhone or Apple Watch in front of a reader. —Greg Bensinger in San Francisco contributed to this article.

Given the question: Article: Europe's deadly outbreak of a rare form of E. coli bacteria   has brought new attention to food safety issues. One of the problems when people get sick from food is that the simplest question is often difficult or even impossible to answer. Just what did the people eat that made them sick? Of course, one way to avoid these medical mysteries is to keep dangerous organisms out of the food supply. This is easier said than done, but scientists keep looking for new ways. Scientists in the United States have developed an experimental system that uses a high-tech optical scanner. The system is designed to identify the presence of contaminants  like soil or animal waste on fresh produce. These can be sources of E. coli. E. coli bacteria naturally live in the intestines  of humans and many animals. Most kinds of E. coli are harmless but some can make people sick. The new scanner can also show damage and imperfections that might make the produce unappealing to shoppers. Scientists designed the system at a Department of Agriculture research center in Beltsville, Maryland. Moon Kim of the Agricultural Research Service led the team. MOON KIM: \\"We were requested, we were asked, to develop a method to detect contamination in produce. So we started with the apple as the model sample.\\" The scanner uses a high-speed camera placed over the conveyer belt that moves the produce along. As the apples move along the belt, the scanner captures images of each piece of fruit. Moon Kim says the team hopes the system will be available before long. MOON KIM: \\"We are targeting for development in commercial plants for the next several years.\\" The scanner can direct a sorting machine to separate the bad apples from the good ones. The system is currently able to show the surface of only half the apple as it speeds by. The inventers hope to improve the process so it can show the whole surface.

Movie title: 5ive Girls Context: The story takes place at St. Mark's, a Catholic boarding school for girls. One day, a young student, Elizabeth, is studying in a classroom on the third floor, when without warning, she is attacked by unseen evil forces. One of St. Mark's priests, Father Drake, attempts to save Elizabeth from the apparently demonic aggressor, but he quickly proves to be powerless against it, and the girl vanishes without a trace.The school is immediately shut down, and all of the students are removed from campus by worried families. Five years later, the school reopens. A harsh headmistress, Miss Pearce, rules the girls with an iron fist; Father Drake remains at the school as a teacher, but because of the disappearance of Elizabeth he has become a drunkard, found by Miss Pearce at a bar. Five troubled and unwanted girls are left by their families at the school: Alex, Mara, Cecilia who is blind, Leah, and Connie. The girls are strictly forbidden to go to the third floor (the site of Elizabeth's disappearance). Cecilia and Mara enter the third floor, prompting Miss Pearce to punish the responsible party. Alex takes the blame and is severely beaten with a ruler.Alex begins to have visions of Elizabeth being possessed by a demon. Other strange things begin to happen, revealing that all five of the girls possess supernatural gifts. Connie is a \\"conduit,\\" or a magnet for spirit activity, Leah can pass through objects (though not doors or walls), Cecilia has \\"second site\\" or what the viewer could interpret as ESP, Mara can heal recent wounds (she heals Alex after her beating), and Alex has telekinesis. It is revealed that Miss Pearce has brought the girls to the school for a very specific reason and is seen conjuring them to a pentagram on the third floor, after which Connie appears to be possessed. A possessed Connie then attempts to drown Leah and the demon passes into her while Connie falls dead. Leah/Legion (who can now pass through doors) goes to confront Father Drake, revealing the name of the demon: Legion. They argue, Father... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"5ive Girls,\\" Alex, one of the five troubled and unwanted girls at St. Mark's Catholic boarding school, ultimately forces Legion, the demon possessing the girls, into the body of the malicious headmistress, Miss Pearce. As the story unfolds, it is revealed that all five girls possess supernatural gifts, but their hidden abilities lead to possession and chaos. A series of events leads Legion, the demon initially revealed through Connie's possession, to jump between the girls, ultimately reaching Leah. After Leah confronts Father Drake and reveals the demon's name, the girls devise a plan to deal with the demonic presence. Understanding the grave danger that Legion poses and relying on her telekinetic abilities, Alex takes decisive action, forcing the demon out of Leah's body and into Miss Pearce's. Miss Pearce, who secretly orchestrated the girls' arrival at the school for her nefarious purposes, suffers the consequences of her actions as the demon she hoped to control is now turned against her. By transferring Legion into Miss Pearce, the girls break free from the demonic influence, and the once-possessed Leah is spared. Unfortunately, the other girls who were previously possessed – Connie, Mara, and Cecilia – pay the ultimate price as they die from the torment of the demon during the course of the movie. The movie concludes with Alex and Father Drake taking a stand against Legion and its host, Miss Pearce, in a climactic battle with the forces of evil. The outcome of this confrontation determines the fate of the survivors as they face the demonic entity that has haunted their school."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the question In Rutherford's experiment, what caused some high-energy particles to bounce off the metal, while most pass straight through? Choose your answer from: a). light waves b). magnetic waves c). positive charges d). negative charges","output":"In Rutherford's experiment, the factor that caused some high-energy particles to bounce off the metal while most pass straight through is c). positive charges. Ernest Rutherford, a New Zealand-born physicist, conducted the famous gold foil experiment in 1909. The experiment involved firing alpha particles - which are positively charged helium nuclei containing two protons and two neutrons - at very thin gold foil. Rutherford aimed to investigate the structure of atoms and the behavior of these high-energy particles as they interacted with the atoms within the gold foil. Three main observations were made during the experiment: 1. Most alpha particles went straight through the foil with little or no deflection. 2. Some particles were deflected at significant angles. 3. A few particles bounced back almost directly towards the source. Before the gold foil experiment, the prevailing model of atomic structure was J.J. Thomson's \\"plum pudding model.\\" This model postulated that the atom's positive charge was evenly distributed throughout a sphere, with negatively-charged electrons embedded in it. Rutherford's observations, specifically the deflection and bouncing back of some alpha particles, contradicted the plum pudding model. Since most of the alpha particles passed through the foil without deflection, it indicated that atoms are mostly empty space. The instances where the alpha particles bounced back or were deflected at large angles revealed that there must be a small, dense, positively-charged center within each gold atom - what is now known as the nucleus. Rutherford concluded that the gold atom's positive charges (found in the nucleus) were responsible for repelling the positively-charged alpha particles. The closer the alpha particles got to the nucleus of a gold atom, the stronger the repulsive force, resulting in more significant deflection or even bouncing back. This observation led Rutherford to propose a new model of the atom, known as the Rutherford model or \\"solar system model\\". In this model, a central nucleus containing positively-charged protons and electrically neutral neutrons is surrounded by negatively-charged electrons, which orbit the nucleus much like planets orbit the sun. Although this model has been further developed and refined through quantum mechanics, Rutherford's experiment established the foundation for our modern understanding of atomic structure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode. Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the following process is the formation of magma within the Earth's mantle or crust. Here's a detailed explanation of the complete process, now including the missing first step: 1. Formation of magma: Magma is formed by the partial melting of the Earth's mantle or crust. This occurs when heat and pressure beneath the Earth's surface rise, causing the solid rocks from Earth's mantle or crust to melt partially. The melted rock, also known as magma, is less dense than the surrounding solid rocks. Magma composition varies based on the rocks that were melted, ranging from basaltic to rhyolitic. 2. The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface: As magma forms, dissolved gases from the deep Earth, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other volatile elements, are released into the magma. These gases reduce the magma's density further and create buoyancy, which drives the magma upward through the Earth's crust. The magma and gas mixture begins to rise towards the surface, moving along fractures or weak areas in the Earth's crust. 3. The magma cools: As magma rises closer to the Earth's surface, it begins to cool and crystallize slowly. The cooling magma turns into solidified rock called igneous rock. During this process, some gas may be trapped within the cooling magma, resulting in the formation of bubbles or vesicles in the solidified rock. 4. With enough time, the pressure builds up greatly: If the magma continues to rise and encounters a barrier, such as a thick layer of crust, it may accumulate in a magma chamber. Over time, the magma within the chamber continues to cool and solidify, and the trapped gases exert even greater pressure on the surrounding rocks. 5. The resulting volcano may explode: When the pressure within the magma chamber becomes too great, it can cause the overlying rocks to fracture and release the pressure in the form of an explosion. This explosive eruption propels the magma, now called lava, and volcanic gases out of the Earth's surface, forming a volcanic cone or a fissure eruption. Depending on the magma's composition and gas content, volcanic eruptions can vary in style, from effusive lava flows to highly explosive eruptions that produce ash and pyroclastic materials. This detailed process outlines the primary steps involved in the formation, ascent, and eruption of volcanic materials, with the first step being the formation of magma within the Earth's crust or mantle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As part of the experiment, Robert first has to create waves with a long wavelength, waves that we will call long waves. Afterwards, Robert has to create waves with a short wavelength, waves that we will call short waves.  But I can use this background: Figure B above shows an important relationship between the wavelength and frequency of a wave. The top wave clearly has a shorter wavelength than the second wave. However, if you picture yourself at a stationary point watching these waves pass by, more waves of the first kind would pass by in a given amount of time. Thus the frequency of the first waves is greater than that of the second waves. Wavelength and frequency are therefore inversely related. As the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases. The equation that relates the two is  What is an answer for this question: Which waves will have a higher frequency? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided and the inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency, the waves with a higher frequency will be the short waves. As the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases (and vice versa). In Robert's experiment, first he creates long waves, which have a longer wavelength, meaning they have a lower frequency.

Please answer this question: For which clothing company did the former Kate Middleton work as an accessory buyer?","output":"Before becoming the Duchess of Cambridge and joining the British royal family, Catherine Elizabeth Middleton, commonly known as Kate Middleton, worked as an accessory buyer for the clothing company Jigsaw. Established in 1970 by John Robinson and Malcolm Webster, Jigsaw is a British fashion brand specializing in clothes, shoes, bags, and accessories. The brand is known for its high-quality, luxurious fabrics, and timeless designs, offering a wide range of wardrobe essentials for both men and women. Kate Middleton joined Jigsaw in 2006 after she graduated from the University of St Andrews, where she obtained a degree in Art History. She started working as an accessory buyer in the company's head office in Kew, London. In this role, she was responsible for selecting, purchasing, and coordinating a wide range of accessories, including bags, belts, hats, scarves, and jewelry, to complement the clothing and shoes featured in Jigsaw collections. It is believed that Kate took this job as it provided the flexibility to balance her work and personal life, particularly her high-profile relationship with Prince William at that time. As an accessory buyer, Kate collaborated with designers, suppliers, and merchandisers to ensure the accessories were in line with current fashion trends and the brand's identity. She would also manage budgets, negotiate prices, and analyze sales data to best optimize profit margins and meet customer demands. During her tenure at Jigsaw, Kate gained valuable experience in the fashion industry, developing her skills in trend forecasting, fashion buying, and relationship management. This experience has undoubtedly contributed to her iconic fashion sense and status as a style icon in the years following her marriage to Prince William in 2011. Kate Middleton has since taken on multiple titles, including the Duchess of Cambridge, Countess of Strathearn, and Lady Carrickfergus. She has also become an influential patron of various organizations, focusing on mental health, children's welfare, and arts and culture.

Given the question: Information:  - The Master of the Grudzidz Altarpiece was a Bohemian artist , active at the end of the 14th and the beginning of the 15th century . His name is derived from an altarpiece which hung in the castle of the Teutonic Knights in Grudzidz ( German : Graudenz ) , and may now be seen in National Museum in Warsaw . Closed , the altarpiece depicts the Noli me tangere and the resurrection of the dead on two registers to the left ; on the right , Christ in Majesty and the Virgin and John the Apostle . The wings show eight scenes from the Passion , while inside are scenes from the Life of the Virgin . At the center is an image of the Death and Coronation of the Virgin . It seems probable that the Master worked on the altarpiece with the aid of another artist ; he seems to have been responsible for the Coronation scenes himself , showing a debt to the Master of the Tebo Altarpiece in the process . The Passion cycle is likely by the hand of a painter from Lower Saxony , from the circle of Master Bertram .  - Pomeranian Voivodeship, Pomorskie Region, or Pomerania Province (in Polish \\"województwo pomorskie\\" , in Kashubian \\"Pòmòrsczé wòjewództwò\\"), is a voivodeship, or province, in north-central Poland. It comprises most of Pomerelia (the easternmost part of historical Pomerania), as well as an area east of the Vistula River. The western part of the province, around Supsk, belonged historically to Farther Pomerania, while Pomerelia and the eastern bank of the Vistula belonged to the historical region of Prussia. The central parts of the province are also known as Kashubia, named after the Kashubian minority. The provincial capital is Gdask.  - Heaven, the heavens or seven heavens, is common religious, cosmological, or transcendent place where beings such as gods, angels, jinn, saints, or venerated ancestors are said to originate, be enthroned, or to live. According to the beliefs of some religions, heavenly beings can descend to earth or incarnate, and earthly beings can ascend to Heaven in the afterlife, or in exceptional cases enter Heaven alive.  - Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost is a term found in English translations of the Bible that is understood differently among the Abrahamic religions. Holy Spirit is stated to be \\"a realm beyond the ability of words to properly convey. It must be experienced, realized, kindled within like a holy fire.\\" The term is also used to describe aspects of other religions and belief structures.  - Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south. Bordered by Germany to the west; the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south; Ukraine and Belarus to the east; and the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad Oblast (a Russian exclave) and Lithuania to the north. The total area of Poland is , making it the 69th largest country in the world and the 9th largest in Europe. With a population of over 38.5 million people, Poland is the 34th most populous country in the world, the 8th most populous country in Europe and the sixth most populous member of the European Union. Poland is a unitary state divided into 16 administrative subdivisions, and its capital and largest city is Warsaw. Other metropolises include Kraków, Wrocaw, Pozna, Gdask and Szczecin.  - The Coronation of the Virgin or Coronation of Mary is a subject in Christian art, especially popular in Italy in the 13th to 15th centuries, but continuing in popularity until the 18th century and beyond. Christ, sometimes accompanied by God the Father and the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, places a crown on the head of Mary as Queen of Heaven. In early versions the setting is a Heaven imagined as an earthly court, staffed by saints and angels; in later versions Heaven is more often seen as in the sky, with the figures seated on clouds. The subject is also notable as one where the whole Christian Trinity is often shown together, sometimes in unusual ways. Although crowned Virgins may be seen in Orthodox Christian icons, the coronation by the deity is not. Mary is sometimes shown, in both Eastern and Western Christian art, being crowned by one or two angels, but this is considered a different subject.  - God the Father is a title given to God in various religions, most prominently in Christianity. In mainstream trinitarian Christianity, God the Father is regarded as the first person of the Trinity, followed by the second person God the Son (Jesus Christ) and the third person God the Holy Spirit. Since the second century, Christian creeds included affirmation of belief in \\"God the Father (Almighty)\\", primarily as his capacity as \\"Father and creator of the universe\\". Yet, in Christianity the concept of God as the father of Jesus Christ goes metaphysically further than the concept of God as the Creator and father of all people, as indicated in the Apostle's Creed where the expression of belief in the \\"Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth\\" is immediately, but separately followed by in \\"Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord\\", thus expressing both senses of fatherhood.  - Pomerania is a region on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea in Central Europe, split between Germany and Poland.  - The Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, also known as Cuiavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship or simply Kujawsko-Pomorskie or Kujawy-Pomerania Province (in Polish, \\"województwo kujawsko-pomorskie\\" ), is one of the 16 voivodeships (provinces) into which Poland is now divided. It is situated in mid-northern Poland, on the boundary between the two historic regions from which it takes its name: Kuyavia and Pomerania. Its two chief cities, serving as the province's joint capitals, are Bydgoszcz and Toru.  - Toru Voivodeship was a unit of administrative division and local government in Poland in the years 19751998, superseded by the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. Its capital city was Toru.  - Grudzidz (or \\"\\" or \\"Grudentia\\") is a city of 96 042 inhabitants (2010) on the Vistula River in northern Poland. Situated in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship (since 1999), the city was in the Toru Voivodeship from 1975 to 1998.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","output":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. To elaborate on the answer, it's important to understand the function and process of the kidneys, as well as how the presence of excess grease might affect their function. The kidneys are critical organs responsible for filtering waste and excess substances, including fluid and electrolytes, from the blood. The process you described in the original question is called glomerular filtration, which is a crucial function of the kidneys. When there is an abundance of grease in the system, it can lead to several potential indirect effects on the kidneys: 1. Formation of kidney stones: Excessive grease in the diet may lead to an increased risk of kidney stones, which are solid masses of crystallized substances. These stones can obstruct the urinary tract, impede urine flow, and cause damage to the kidneys if left untreated. 2. Impact on blood pressure: A high-fat diet, rich in grease, can contribute to elevated blood pressure. High blood pressure is a known risk factor for kidney damage as it puts additional strain on the blood vessels within the kidneys, eventually impairing their ability to filter waste and excess fluid from the blood effectively. 3. Atherosclerosis: Excess grease in the bloodstream may lead to atherosclerosis, a condition where plaques build up in the arterial walls, narrowing the blood vessels and reducing blood flow to various organs, including the kidneys. This decreased blood flow can impair kidney function and lead to kidney damage. 4. Obesity: A diet high in grease typically contributes to weight gain and obesity, which is another risk factor for kidney disease. The increased load on the kidneys can exacerbate any existing kidney dysfunction, hindering their ability to effectively filter waste products from the bloodstream. 5. Inflammation: Increased intake of grease, especially if it is from unhealthy saturated and trans fats, can lead to inflammation in the body. Chronic inflammation is a contributing factor to the development of kidney disease and can hinder the kidneys' ability to perform their functions properly. It is essential to note that the presence of excess grease does not directly impact any individual step of the kidney filtration process but can have several indirect effects by increasing the risk of kidney stones, elevating blood pressure, leading to atherosclerosis, obesity, and inflammation. These factors can compromise kidney function over time, increasing the overall burden on the kidneys and contributing to the development or progression of kidney disease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It includes not only \\"remembering\\" things like arithmetic or historical facts, but also involves any change in the way an animal typically behaves. Memory is involved when a rat gives up eating grain because he has sniffed something suspicious in the grain pile. Memory is also involved when a six-year-old child learns to swing a baseball bat.    Memory exists not only in humans and animals but also in some physical objects and machines. Computers, for example, contain devices from storing data for later use. It is interesting to compare the memory-storage capacity of a computer with that of a human being. The instant-access memory of a large computer may hold up to 100,000 \\"words\\"--ready for instant use. An average prefix = st1 /U. S. teenager probably recognizes the meaning of about 100,000 words of English. However, this is but a fraction(, ) of the total amount of information which the teenager has stored. Consider, for example, the number of faces and places that the teenager can recognize on sight.  The use of words is the advanced problem-solving intelligence of human beings. A large part of a person's memory is in terms of words and combinations of words. Question: The comparison made between the memory capacity of a large computer and that of a human being shows that   _  . Options: A: the computer's memory has a little bigger capacity than a teenager's B: the computer's memory capacity is much smaller than an adult human being's C: the computer's memory's capacity is much smaller even than a teenager's D: both A and B A:","output":"the computer's memory's capacity is much smaller even than a teenager's"},{"instruction":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Plot title: Don: The Chase Begins Again Movie plot: In 2006, the illegal drug trade based in Kuala Lumpur is booming. The Malaysian authorities are called upon for assistance by their Indian counterparts. The Indian team sent to Kuala Lumpur is headed by Deputy Commissioner of Police De Silva (Boman Irani), who targets the illegal drug operations of Singhania (Rajesh Khattar). Helping him along the way is Inspector Vishal Malik (Om Puri), an Indian officer from Interpol. Both of them know that in order to put an end to the illegal drug trade, they must capture \\"Don\\" (Shah Rukh Khan) who manages Singhania's business in Kuala Lumpur. Singhania was one of the two closest and most trusted men of Boris, a criminal who went underground and was presumed dead by the police. Boris's other lieutenant was a man called Vardhan, equally ruthless as Singhania, but his whereabouts are unknown. De Silva explains that Singhania had killed Vardhan upon learning that Boris was about to hand over his drug business to Vardhan. Singhania's subordinate, Don, is known for murdering one of his close associates, Ramesh (Diwakar Pundir), who had attempted to leave the cartel. Ramesh's future wife Kamini (Kareena Kapoor) decides to help the police arrest Don but in the process she is also killed. Now, Ramesh's sister Roma (Priyanka Chopra) plans to avenge her brother and his fiancÃ©. She manages to infiltrate Don's gang. Don and his inner circle, which consists of Anita (Isha Koppikar) and Narang (Pawan Malhotra), travel to India for a cocaine transaction. An Indian police team led by De Silva follow them there and capture Don, who is fatally injured while trying to flee from the police. De Silva keeps this a secret from the department and media as he decides to track down an exact look-alike of Don named Vijay (Shah Rukh Khan) from Mumbai, asking Vijay to pose as Don so the police can get to Singhania. Vijay agrees when De Silva promises to admit Deepu (Tanay Chheda), a kid Vijay looks after, to a school in Kuala Lumpur. Meanwhile, Jasjit (Arjun Rampal), Deepu's father, has just been...

Article: If you are planning on traveling, there are few simple rules about how to make life easier both before and after your journey. First of all, always check and double-check departure   time. It is surprising how few people really do this carefully. Once I arrived at he airport a few minutes after ten. My secretary had got the ticket for me and I thought she had said that the plane left at 10:50. When I arrived at the airport, the person at the departure desk told me that my flight was closed. Therefore, I had to wait three hours for the next one and missed an important meeting. The second rule is to remember that even in this age of credit cards  , it is still important to have some local money in cash  . Once I arrived at a place at midnight and the bank at the airport was closed. The only way to get to my hotel was by taxi but because I had no dollars, I offered to pay in pounds instead. \\"Listen! I only take real money!\\" the driver said angrily. You can imagine how terrible I felt at that moment. The third and the last rule is to find out as much as you can about the weather at your destination  before you leave. I feel sorry for some of my workmates who travel in heavy suits and raincoats in May, when it is still fairly cool in London or Manchester, to places like Athens, Rome of Madrid, where it is already beginning to get quite warm during the day.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot. You need to read the extract and create questions that can be answered from the extract. The questions should be well-formed and grammatically correct. The questions should be completely answerable from the given passage and should not require any external knowledge. Subjective questions are not allowed. Create questions that result in factoid answers. A simple rule of thumb to decide whether a question is factoid or not is to see if two different people with average reading/comprehension skills would come up with the same answer after reading the passage. At a psychiatric hospital, former Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is largely recovered from his obsession to kill the new Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers) and is about to be released when Clouseau, arriving to speak on Dreyfus' behalf, drives Dreyfus insane again. Dreyfus promptly escapes from the asylum and once again tries to kill Clouseau by planting a bomb while the Inspector (by periodic arrangement) duels with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk). The bomb destroys Clouseau's apartment and injures Cato, but Clouseau himself is unharmed, being lifted from the room by an inflatable disguise. Deciding that a more elaborate plan is needed, Dreyfus enlists an army of criminals to his cause and kidnaps nuclear physicist Professor Hugo Fassbender (Richard Vernon) and the Professor's daughter Margo (Briony McRoberts), forcing the professor to build a \\"doomsday weapon\\" in return for his daughter's freedom.Clouseau travels to England to investigate Fassbender's disappearance, where he wrecks their family home and ineptly interrogates Jarvis (Michael Robbins), Fassbender's cross-dressing butler. Although Jarvis is killed by the kidnappers, to whom he had become a dangerous witness, Clouseau discovers a clue that leads him to the Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany. Meanwhile, Dreyfus, using Fassbender's invention, dissolves the United Nations headquarters in New York City and blackmails the leaders of the world, including the President of the United States and his adviser (based on Gerald Ford and Henry Kissinger), into assassinating Clouseau. However, many of the nations instruct their operatives to kill the other assassins to gain Dreyfus's favor and possibly the Doomsday Machine. As a result of their orders and Clouseau's habitual clumsiness, the assassins all end up killing each other until only the agents of Egypt and Russia remain.The Egyptian assassin (an uncredited cameo by Omar Sharif) shoots one of Dreyfus' henchmen, mistaking him for Clouseau, but is seduced by the Russian operative Olga Bariosova (Lesley-Anne Down), who makes the same mistake. When the real Clouseau arrives, he is perplexed by Olga's affections but learns from her Dreyfus's location at a castle in Bavaria. Dreyfus is elated at Clouseau's apparent demise, but suffers from a toothache; Clouseau, disguised as a dentist, sneaks into the castle - eventually (his entry frustrated by the castle's drawbridge). Not recognized by Dreyfus, Clouseau ends up intoxicating both of them with nitrous oxide. Realising the deception when Clouseau mistakenly pulls the wrong tooth, Dreyfus prepares to use the machine to destroy England. Clouseau, eluding Dreyfus's henchmen, unwittingly foils Dreyfus's plans when a medieval catapult outside the castle launches Clouseau on top of the Doomsday machine. The machine begins to malfunction and begins firing on Dreyfus and the castle itself. As the remaining henchmen, Fassbender and his daughter, and eventually Clouseau himself escape the dissolving castle, Dreyfus plays \\"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\\" on the castle's pipe organ, while himself disintegrating, until he and the castle vanish.Returning to Paris, Clouseau is finally reunited with Olga. However, their tryst is interrupted first by Clouseau's apparent inability to remove his clothes without a struggle, and then by Cato, whereupon all three are hurled by the reclining bed into the Seine. Immediately thereafter, a cartoon image of Clouseau begins swimming, unaware that a gigantic version of the Pink Panther character is waiting below him (a reference to the film Jaws, made obvious by the thematic music as the movie ends).","output":"Task Explanation: 1. This task asks you to create a series of questions drawn from an extended movie plot extract. 2. The questions you create must be answerable exclusively from the provided extract; they should not require external knowledge. 3.

The Roots is an American hip hop band, formed in 1987 by Tariq \\"Black Thought\\" Trotter and Ahmir \\"Questlove\\" Thompson in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The Roots are known for a jazzy and eclectic approach to hip-hop featuring live musical instruments. Malik B., Leonard \\"Hub\\" Hubbard, and Josh Abrams were added to the band (formerly named \\"The Square Roots\\"). Since its first independent album-length release the band has released 10 studio albums, two EPs, two collaboration albums (with other artists), and also collaborated on recordings and in live shows with a wide variety of artists in many musical genres. The Roots originated in Philadelphia with Ahmir \\"Questlove\\" Thompson and Tariq \\"Black Thought\\" Trotter while they were both attending the Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts. They would busk out on the street corners with Questlove playing bucket drums and Tariq rapping over his rhythms. Their first organized gig was a talent show in 1989 at the school where they used the name Radio Activity, which began a series of name changes that progressed through Black to the Future and then The Square Roots. In 1992, they dropped the \\"Square\\" because a local folk group had claim to the name.  Organix was the band's first album, released and sold independently in 1993. It drew offers from music labels, and the band signed with DGC/Geffen. The Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??!, was released in 1994. It was a moderate hit among alternative music fans, boosted by the group's appearance at Lollapalooza. The band performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival that year. Touring guests, beatboxer Rahzel and producer Scott Storch, joined The Roots.  The 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to break the Top 40 on the Billboard 200 chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \\"What They Do\\" (a parody of rap video cliches) and \\"Clones\\", which was their first single to reach the top five on the rap charts. \\"What They Do\\" was also the group's first single to hit the Top 40 of Billboard's charts, reaching a peak of #34.

Female fruit flies rid of the ability to smell food outlive their peers.The sense of smell may be linked to the cellular ageing process in many other organisms--even people.A link has recently been found between sensory experiences and lifespan in both worms and flies.For example, Scott Pletcher, a biologist at the University of Michigan, found that eliminating   fruit flies' ability to smell enabled them to live nearly 20 percent longer than flies with an intact sense of smell. Pletcher's team reasoned that food smells were the ones most likely to affect ageing, as nutrition and longevity are known to be linked in many organisms.To test the idea that food odors affect lifespan, Pletcher's team eliminated flies' ability to smell carbon dioxide, which is produced by some fly foods.They left the rest of the smelling system intact. This intervention had no effect on male flies, but the females lived 30 percent longer than normal.Pletcher thinks eliminating the ability to smell CO2may deprive flies of information about food availability.This could signal to cells that food is scarce, causing processes that promote survival.Indeed, his team found that the CO2-insensitive female flies stored extra fat and that both males and females immune to CO2were more resistant to stress than normal flies.Pletcher isn't sure why the change in his fruit flies only affected the lifespan of the females, but he suggests that females may simply be more sensitive to the odor of CO2. A smell or taste that stretches lifespan in humans could be a potential preventative for age-related disease, he adds.Although in fruit flies it appears to be the smell of CO2that affects ageing, he says that an analogue in humans might be a smell or taste linked to human food--or a lack of it.Matt Kaeberlein studies ageing at the University of Washington in Seattle. He cautions that we don't know whether ageing and smell are linked in mammals.But \\" we definitely undergo physiological changes in response to smelling...

They had met in high school and had maintained their friendship throughout college and their adult lives. Despite the different paths their lives had taken, they remained incredibly close. Emily was happily married with a thriving business, while Jennifer had recently gone through a tough breakup.  As a strong, empathetic, and supportive friend, Emily knew how difficult the end of a relationship could be. She remembered her own past breakups and how lonely and disheartening those times had been. So, when she saw the beautiful box of chocolate on sale at a local store, she immediately thought of Jennifer and how it might be the perfect small gesture to lift her spirits, even if only for a little while.  With the box of chocolate beautifully wrapped and adorned with a ribbon, Emily drove over to Jennifer's apartment. She was excited at the prospect of cheering up her friend and planned to spend the evening with her, sharing stories, laughter, and indulging in the delicious chocolates together.  Jennifer opened the door, her face visibly illuminated at the sight of her dear friend. She had been feeling particularly low that day, having spent hours scrolling through old pictures and memories she had shared with her now ex-boyfriend. Emily stepped inside, presenting Jennifer with the box of chocolate. \\"What's this for?\\" Jennifer asked, puzzled. \\"Just a little something to cheer you up,\\" Emily replied with a gentle smile.  Jennifer hesitated for a moment, looking at the box and then back to Emily. She knew that her friend had a knack for understanding what others needed, often before they even realized it themselves. Jennifer couldn't help but feel a sense of warmth and gratitude. She embraced Emily in a tight hug. \\"Thank you, Emily. I really needed this.\\" As the two friends settled in to share the box of chocolates, they spent the night talking about memories of the past, discussing current challenges, and dreaming about the future. Emily could see the dim light returning to Jennifer's eyes, her laughter growing more genuine and carefree as the evening went on. The chocolate, while a seemingly simple gesture, had worked its magic. It had opened the door for Jennifer to acknowledge her pain and sadness, but also to recognize the importance of friendship and the support it provides. Emily had given her a tangible reminder that she was not alone and a clear message that she was there to help her through the difficult times. That night, Emily's gift of chocolate symbolized more than just a sweet treat. It rekindled the spirit of hope, the power of friendship, and the promise of brighter days ahead. The bond between Emily and Jennifer grew even stronger, both of them knowing that no matter the challenges life brought their way, they would face them together with love, compassion, and, occasionally, a box of chocolate."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: The Mole People Movie plot: A narration by Dr. Frank Baxter, an English professor at the University of Southern California, explains the premise of the movie and its basis in reality. He briefly discusses the hollow earth theories of John Symmes and Cyrus Teed among others, and says that the movie is a fictionalized representation of these unorthodox theories. Archaeologists Dr. Roger Bentley and Dr. Jud Bellamin find a race of Sumerian albinos living deep under the Earth. They keep mutant humanoid mole men as their slaves to harvest mushrooms, their primary food source, since mushrooms can grow without sunlight. The Sumerian albinos' ancestors relocated into the subterranean after cataclysmic floods in ancient Mesopotamia. Whenever their population increases, they sacrifice old people to the Eye of Ishtar, which is really natural light coming from the surface. These people have lived underground for so long that they are weakened by bright light which the archaeologists brought in the form of a flashlight. However, there is one girl named Adad who has natural Caucasian skin who is disdained by the others since she has the \\"mark of darkness.\\" They believe the men are messengers of Ishtar, their goddess. When one of the archaeologists is killed by a mole person, Elinu, the High Priest, realizes they are not gods. He orders their capture and takes the flashlight to control the Mole People, not knowing it is depleted. The archaeologists are then sent to the Eye just as the Mole People rebel. Adad goes to the Eye only to realize its true nature and that the men had survived. They then leave for the surface. Unfortunately, Adad dies after reaching the surface, when an earthquake causes a column to fall over and crush her.

Get Enough Sleep Getting 6 hours of less can put you into what's called a sleep deficit,or lack of sufficient sleep,which can actually make you less sharp mentally and thus negatively affect your performance on tests,even if you spent those missed hours of sleep studying.So it's very important for you to get all of your studying done so you can get a good night of sleep before your big day. Study Smarter Being organized with your studies can help you keep from pulling all-nighters to get all of your studying in and blowing the test because you're exhausted.How do you study 'smarter'? Make a list of the most important things you need to learn,in order of importance,and hit the items at the top of the list first.That way,if you run out of time,you're mostly covered.Make a list of all the work you have to do,estimate how much time each item will take,and compare that with the amount of hours you have available;this will tell you if you can carefully read or just skim,how many times you can afford to revise papers,and other ways to pace yourself so you can get everything done.If you're pressed for time,it's important to learn to let go of being perfect.Oh,and turn off the TV as much as possible until your tests are behind you. Visualize Success Before you fall asleep each night,it is a great way to visualize yourself taking the tests and doing wonderfully.Detailed visualizations can help you feel like you're really experiencing something,and visualizing yourself doing well is a way to 'practice' success in a way that can actually help you perform better and feel confident.Being confident as you take your exams can keep you from choking because of the stress.Visualizations can also help you to remember...

I like that it's shapes. My baby has enjoyed it since we bought it at 9.5 months, and he still likes chewing on them at 11 months. Is the review positive or negative? A:","output":"The review provided for the Jumbo Knobs is primarily positive. The reviewer highlights several aspects that they appreciate about the product, which contributes to the overall positive tone of their review. Firstly, the reviewer mentions that the Jumbo Knobs are \\"really helpful for the young ones.\\" This statement implies that the product is valuable for its intended audience, namely, young children. The reviewer also appreciates the product's design, specifically mentioning that it includes shapes. The fact that it incorporates different shapes likely makes the Jumbo Knobs more appealing and engaging for children, contributing to the product's positive review. Another aspect the reviewer comments on is their baby's continued enjoyment even after owning the product for several months. This is an essential factor in evaluating the quality of a product aimed at young children, as their interests can change quickly. The fact that their baby \\"has enjoyed it since we bought it at 9.5 months, and he still likes chewing on them at 11 months\\" illustrates that the Jumbo Knobs maintain a level of appeal and entertainment value for the baby. It also signifies that the baby is content and safe with the product. Additionally, the reviewer mentions that their baby enjoys chewing on the Jumbo Knobs, which further suggests that the product is a good sensory toy for little ones, as it provides comfort and stimulation for their gums as they develop. This aspect of the product seems to be another positive feature in the reviewer's eyes. Thus, considering the multiple points of praise and appreciation mentioned by the reviewer, it's clear that this review presents a largely positive opinion of the Jumbo Knobs. The reviewer shares their satisfaction with the product and how it caters to the needs of their young child, ultimately reflecting a positive assessment of the Jumbo Knobs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller.  Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff.  But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said.  Warner’s committee is also investigating possible... Question: What is probably true about Trump's campaign manager?

Sentence 2: While disputed, some feel that the Soviets were only there to take Egypt for themselves. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Select from: --yes --it is not possible to tell --no","output":"It is not possible to tell. The two sentences describe different aspects of the relationship between Egypt and the Soviet Union during the rule of Nasser. Sentence 1 states that Nasser ruled for 17 years, during which Egypt embarked on a modernization program with Soviet assistance. Sentence 2, on the other hand, acknowledges that some people believe the Soviets had ulterior motives in helping Egypt, possibly seeking to take over the country for themselves.  While the first sentence is true, as Nasser indeed ruled Egypt from 1954 to 1970 and the modernization program with Soviet aid was indeed initiated, the truth of the second sentence cannot be definitively established based solely on the information provided. The fact that the Soviets helped Egypt in modernizing does not conclusively indicate that they also wanted to take over the country. The second sentence itself states that this viewpoint is disputed.  Given that there are multiple perspectives on the Soviets' motivations, and considering the complex geopolitical context of the time, it is not possible to definitively determine the truth of the second sentence based solely on the information available in Sentence 1. The motives and goals of international relations, particularly during the Cold War era, can be intricate and multifaceted, and one cannot easily draw a conclusion on the truth of the second sentence without a more in-depth analysis and assessment of the historical evidence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If \\"A surfer with a yellow board rides a wave.\\", can we conclude \\"A surfer is in a contest.\\"?","output":"No, we cannot definitively conclude that \\"A surfer is in a contest\\" based merely on the statement \\"A surfer with a yellow board rides a wave.\\" The given statement only provides specific information about a surfer's action (riding a wave) and a particular detail about their surfboard (its color being yellow). This information is not sufficient to infer the context of a contest. Surfing, as a sport or recreational activity, can take place under different circumstances and contexts. People often surf for leisure, practice, or just for fun without participating in any competitions. Consequently, just because someone is observed riding a wave, it does not necessarily imply that they are participating in a surf contest. Additionally, having a yellow surfboard does not inherently signify contest participation either. Surfboards come in various shapes, sizes, and colors, chosen based on the surfer's personal preference or the specific wave conditions they wish to tackle. The color of a surfboard does not usually indicate the surfer's competitive status. In order to conclude that a surfer is participating in a contest, more contextual information would be required. For example, if there are judges present, a group of competing surfers, or an announcer commentating throughout the event, these factors contribute to a stronger indication of a contest taking place. Overall, the statement \\"A surfer with a yellow board rides a wave\\" only establishes that a surfer is engaged in the act of surfing, but it does not provide enough information to support the conclusion that the surfer is in a contest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Of the 132 of those yet to respond, 64 are from South Yorkshire Police and 68 from West Midlands Police. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died as a result of the crush in April 1989. In her latest update, IPCC Deputy Chair Rachel Cerfontyne said attempts to contact those \\"who have not assisted our investigation so far\\" was ongoing. She added: \\"Some were unable to provide an account for reasons such as poor health. Others have not responded to our contact and there are a number of individuals who couldn't be traced.\\" The potential witnesses had been identified because they may have useful information and further efforts would be made \\"to persuade this group to engage with us\\", she said. To date, the IPCC said it has recorded over 4,000 witness accounts, with about 1,200 of those coming from police staff. But while the watchdog can compel police witnesses who are still serving to give evidence it cannot compel retired officers to do so, Ms Cerfontyne said. A separate criminal investigation, Operation Resolve, is looking into the crush and the match day itself, A spokesman for Operation Resolve said the appeal had resulted in 41 possible identifications for 16 of the people. He said those sought were not suspected of wrongdoing but may have helpful information. The 19 people police want to trace were seen on CCTV at about 14:50 before the FA Cup semi-final, at the stadium's Leppings Lane end near exit gate C. In April, the jury at the inquests into the deaths of the 96 Hillsborough victims concluded they were unlawfully killed.

Please answer this question: electric wires are covered with rubber like material give reason?","output":"Sure, I'd be happy to answer that question. The reason electric wires are covered with rubber-like material is mainly for safety and protection purposes. Step 1: Start With Basics Electricity is a form of energy resulting from charged particles such as electrons and protons, and it can produce heat, light, and cause chemical changes. Conductors like metal wires are used to transmit electricity due to their property of letting electrons move freely. Step 2: Understand the Danger However, this flow of electrons (electric current) through a conductor can be dangerous if we come into direct contact with it, because our bodies can also act as a conductor leading to serious risks such as electric shocks or fires. Step 3: Recognize the Protection Mechanism Insulators are materials that resist the flow of electric current. Rubber is a good insulator. Therefore, the electric wires are covered with a rubber-like material. Step 4: Confirm the Reason So, the main reason electric wires are covered with rubber-like material is to insulate the conductor (metal wire carrying current) and prevent electrical shocks or short circuits that could occur if live wires come in contact with each other or a human body. The rubber-like material also serves a secondary purpose of protecting the wires from external damage (like environmental elements or physical stress), which might impair their function. This reasoned and step-by-step approach makes it clear why electric wires need to have this layer of insulation in the form of a rubber-like covering."},{"instruction":"I heard that Casey had robbed a bank and he remained at large and was not even seen.

Movie plot title: Let's Go to Prison Movie plot: John Lyshitski (Dax Shepard) has spent most of his life being a slimeball, thanks to Judge Nelson Biederman III, who has been giving him hard sentences ever since he stole a car at the age of eight. Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers. At his sentencing he pleads guilty to the same judge Nelson IV had, and asks for the same sentence (3-5) at the same prison. After negotiating with the judge and bribing a few guards, he ends up as Nelsons cellmate, and here he pretends to be his friend, all in an attempt to give him the wrong advice on surviving life in prison.Somehow, Nelson gets himself out of a numerous array of jams, even discovering that he's gay and meeting the love of his life, gang leader Barry (Chi McBride), a hulking, burly gay caballero with the heart of a dashing romantic hero beating within his massive, hairy...

Article: Chopin's relations with Sand were soured in 1846 by problems involving her daughter Solange and Solange's fiancé, the young fortune-hunting sculptor Auguste Clésinger. The composer frequently took Solange's side in quarrels with her mother; he also faced jealousy from Sand's son Maurice. Chopin was utterly indifferent to Sand's radical political pursuits, while Sand looked on his society friends with disdain. As the composer's illness progressed, Sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to Chopin, whom she called her \\"third child\\". In letters to third parties, she vented her impatience, referring to him as a \\"child,\\" a \\"little angel\\", a \\"sufferer\\" and a \\"beloved little corpse.\\" In 1847 Sand published her novel Lucrezia Floriani, whose main characters—a rich actress and a prince in weak health—could be interpreted as Sand and Chopin; the story was uncomplimentary to Chopin, who could not have missed the allusions as he helped Sand correct the printer's galleys. In 1847 he did not visit Nohant, and he quietly ended their ten-year relationship following an angry correspondence which, in Sand's words, made \\"a strange conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship.\\" The two would never meet again.

Choices:  - spring into action - accept his fate - cross street - feel upset - travel to europe  The rationale to choose \\"spring into action\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","output":"\\"spring into action\\" because it is the most appropriate choice closely related to achieving one's dreams. The question mentions that the person knew what he had to do to achieve his dreams; therefore, the action he should take should be focused on pursuing those dreams. Let's analyze the other choices: 1. Accept his fate: This choice suggests passivity and resignation instead of actively pursuing one's goals and dreams. It's not aligned with the idea of knowing what one has to do and working towards achieving dreams. 2. Cross street: This choice seems unrelated and too specific to be applied to the broader concept of achieving dreams. It doesn't convey any meaningful action towards reaching personal goals. 3. Feel upset: This choice involves an emotional reaction but isn't an active approach to achieving dreams. It's also counterproductive as it suggests a negative response rather than proactively taking steps towards success. 4. Travel to Europe: While traveling can be a life-changing experience, it's not a generic answer that applies to the pursuit of dreams for everyone. Traveling to Europe might be relevant if the person's dreams were specifically connected to that location, but in this context, it doesn't make sense as the best answer.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai.

NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

Article: Their cheery song brightens many a winter's day. But robins are in danger of wearing themselves out by singing too much. Robins are singing all nightas well as during the day, British-based researchers say. David Dominoni, of Glasgow University, said that light from street lamps, takeaway signs and homes is affecting the birds' biological clock, leading to them being wide awake when they should be asleep. Dr Dominoni, who is putting cameras inside nesting boxes to track sleeping patterns, said lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk. His study shows that when robins are exposed to light at night in the lab, it leads to some genes being active at the wrong time of day. And the more birds are exposed to light, the more active they are at night. He told people at a conference, \\"There have been a couple of studies suggesting they are increasing their song output at night and during the day they are still singing. Singing is a costly behaviour and it takes energy. So by increasing their song output, there might be some costs of energy.\\" And it is not just robins that are being kept awake by artificial light. Blackoiids and seagulls are also being more nocturnal. Dr Dominoni said, \\"In Glasgow where I live, gulls are a serious problem. I have people coming to me saying \`You are the bird expert. Can you help us kill these gulls?'.During the breeding season, between April and June, they are very active at night and very noisy and people can't sleep.\\" Although Dr Dominoni has only studied light pollution, other research concluded that robins living in noisy cities have started to sing at night to make themselves heard over loud noise. However, some birds thrive in noisy environments. A study from California Polytechnic University found more hummingbirds in areas with heavy industrial machinery. It is thought that they are capitalising on their predators fleeing to quieter areas. Question: What is the researchers' concern over the increase of birds' song output?

Article: Greater understanding of the importance of environmental enrichment in enhancing an animal's physical and social environment is bringing benefits for pet cats -- particularly those that are kept solely indoors.      Our feline companions are very similar to their closest ancestor, the African wildcat, in terms of their behavioural needs; and an indoor-only lifestyle, unless managed appropriately, can give rise to health issues (such as obesity and diabetes) and problem behaviours (including aggression, house-soiling and attention-seeking). The latter can threaten the relationship between cat and owner, and in extreme cases even lead to euthanasia of the cat. One approach to mitigating these potential problems is with the use of 'food puzzles' -- devices that release food when an animal interacts with them and which were originally developed to provide enrichment for captive zoo and laboratory animals.      Food puzzles take advantage of cats' natural instincts to work for their food. There is a wide range of puzzles on the market: some are mobile (rolled or pushed with the cat's nose or paws), others are stationary, and they can be used with either wet or dry food. For the creative and/or cost-conscious cat owner, DIY food puzzles can also be easily made; for example, by cutting holes in egg boxes or water bottles.      The effect of food puzzles on cats is a relatively new area of study and a group of veterinarians and cat behaviour consultants in the USA provide a welcome addition to the peer-reviewed literature with a state-of-the art review in this month's Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery.1 As well as reviewing existing empirical evidence of the physical and emotional benefits imparted by food puzzles, the authors have collated details of over 30 cases from their own practices where food puzzles were introduced to aid with a specific health or behavioural concern. Examples include an obese 8-year-old male domestic shorthair cat who lost 20% of his bodyweight within 12 months of puzzle implementation; a 3-year-old British Shorthair male cat, whose impulsive and frustration-based aggression towards his owner instantly improved and resolved completely within 6 months; and a 2-year-old domestic shorthair cat whose fear of people (his owners included) significantly improved following the addition of both mobile and stationary food puzzles, to the point that he would come when called and was relaxed for cuddles.      Cats are likely to have individual preferences in terms of types of food puzzles, and there may be some initial owner reluctance to overcome. The authors offer valuable practical advice, with a checklist of pointers for choosing a starter puzzle and guidance on how to implement food puzzles, as well as tips for troubleshooting potential challenges, such as owner concerns about night-time noise or having food scattered around the home. Given time, patience and appropriate introduction, most, if not all, cats can adjust to food puzzles. So much so, in fact, that the authors' advice extends to methods for increasing the difficulty of food puzzles for 'advanced foragers'!      Ultimately, the end goal is to have several types of puzzles available and for all of the cat's meals to be provided by this enriching means. ||||| PRACTICAL RELEVANCE:      Many pet cats are kept indoors for a variety of reasons (eg, safety, health, avoidance of wildlife predation) in conditions that are perhaps the least natural to them. Indoor housing has been associated with health issues, such as chronic lower urinary tract signs, and development of problem behaviors, which can cause weakening of the human-animal bond and lead to euthanasia of the cat. Environmental enrichment may mitigate the effects of these problems and one approach is to take advantage of cats' natural instinct to work for their food.      AIM:      In this article we aim to equip veterinary professionals with the tools to assist clients in the use of food puzzles for their cats as a way to support feline physical health and emotional wellbeing. We outline different types of food puzzles, and explain how to introduce them to cats and how to troubleshoot challenges with their use.      EVIDENCE BASE:      The effect of food puzzles on cats is a relatively new area of study, so as well as reviewing the existing empirical evidence, we provide case studies from our veterinary and behavioral practices showing health and behavioral benefits resulting from their use.      © The Author(s) 2016. |||||Summary:","output":"A recent article explains how environmental enrichment is important for pet cats, especially those kept indoors. Cats share similar behavioral needs with their ancestor, the African wildcat, and keeping them indoors may cause health issues and bad behavior. 'Food puzzles' can help solve this problem by letting cats work for their food, which is something they do naturally. There are many types of food puzzles available for purchase, or people can make them at home. When cats use food puzzles, they are happier and healthier. This idea is still new, but studies have shown very good results for cats who use food puzzles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. How does the sentence end? See options at the end The wet hair would not fit in the hat because the  Pick from: 1). hat is too compact.; 2). hair is too compact.;","output":"The wet hair would not fit in the hat because the hat is too compact. This choice is more plausible because it implies that the hat's size or structure is not spacious enough to accommodate the wet hair comfortably. The word \\"compact\\" in this context communicates that the hat's dimensions are small and that it doesn't afford enough room to hold the added volume or dampness of the wet hair. This could be due to the hat being designed for a smaller head size or having a tighter, more rigid construction. On the other hand, the second option – \\"the hair is too compact\\" – does not convey a clear or sensible explanation for the reason the wet hair is not fitting in the hat. The compactness of the hair would refer to the hair being pressed closely together or tightly knit. However, it would not logically explain why wet hair wouldn't fit into a hat, as compact hair should theoretically take up less space rather than more. In more detail, when hair is wet, it becomes heavier and might stick together, which could cause it to have difficulty fitting inside a hat, particularly if the hat is too small or tight. This is due to the combination of water being absorbed in the hair strands, causing them to expand, and the added weight from the absorbed water making the hair bulkier. The soaking effect of the water can cause the hair to clump together, which might lead to the notion of the hair being too compact. However, this concept is less logical and less likely to result in difficulty fitting the hair into the hat as compared to the hat itself being too compact. Therefore, the more accurate and sensible choice is to conclude that, \\"The wet hair would not fit in the hat because the hat is too compact.\\" This option pinpoints the issue at the hat instead of the hair, providing a clearer understanding of why wet hair might have difficulty fitting in it. In real-life situations, a hat might need to be adjusted, resized, or even replaced to accommodate wet hair comfortably."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, we are going to talk about something called \\"rejection.\\" Sometimes, when we want to be friends with someone or we like someone very much, they might not feel the same way. That's okay because everyone has different feelings. When someone says \\"no\\" or \\"I don't want to be your friend,\\" it can make us feel sad, but it is important to understand why and learn from it.  First, let's try to figure out why they rejected us. Just like trying to solve a puzzle, we need to think about all the pieces that could have made them feel that way. Maybe we said something that hurt their feelings or didn't share our toys with them. If we can understand why they said \\"no,\\" then we can learn how to be better friends. Next, we should think about our current relationship with that person. Are we already friends, or do we just know each other from school? Sometimes, if we don't know someone very well, that person might be unsure or nervous about being our friend. Spending more time together might help them feel more comfortable, but we should never force someone to be our friend. Now, let's examine our approach. Did we ask the person to be our friend nicely, or did we yell or say something mean? We should always try to be friendly and polite when we talk to others. If we made a mistake, it's okay; we just need to try to be better next time. It is also very important to respect their answer. If someone says they don't want to be our friend, we should say, \\"That's okay,\\" and don't ask them again and again. This is a big word called \\"respect,\\" and it means to understand and accept someone's feelings and choices. Lastly, we need to be patient. Sometimes, people need time to think or feel more comfortable before they can be our friend. While we are waiting, we can still be nice and friendly, but we should also try to make new friends too. There are so many people in the world, and we might find someone who wants to be our friend right away. In conclusion, it's essential to remember that not everyone will want to be our friend, and that's okay. When we face rejection, we can learn from it and become even better at making friends. We need to understand why they rejected us, think about our relationship, examine our approach, respect their answer, and be patient.

The question is about the power dynamics on a global scale and emphasizes critical decisions pertaining to the entire Earth. Step 2: Consider the structure of decision-making on Earth. There is no centralized authority or individual who has all the power or makes critical decisions for the entire Earth. Power is distributed among sovereign nations, international organizations, corporations, non-governmental organizations, and individuals. Step 3: Provide an answer based on the analysis. No single entity or individual has all the power or directs the critical decisions of the Earth. Power is held by various sovereign nations, international organizations, corporations, NGOs, and individuals, who come together to make decisions on a global scale. To answer the second question: \\"Who really has all the power and directs the critical decisions of the USA?\\" Step 1: Analyze the question to determine its scope. The question concerns the power dynamics and critical decision-making in the United States. Step 2: Examine the political structure and systems in the USA. The US is a federal republic with a representative democracy, and power is divided among federal, state, and local levels. The decision-making process involves the President, Congress, the judicial system, corporations, and citizens. Step 3: Provide an answer based on the analysis. No single entity or individual has absolute control or directs critical decisions of the USA. Power is shared among the President, Congress, the judicial system, corporations, and individual citizens. Decision-making processes involve the collaboration of these various parties.

The mandolin grew in popularity over the next 60 years, in the streets where it was used by young men courting and by street musicians, and in the concert hall.

Q:Information:  - Saint Brendans Isle, also spelled St Brendans Isle, is a phantom island, or mythical island, supposedly situated in the North Atlantic somewhere west of Northern Africa. It is named after the Saint Brendan who founded the Clonfert monastery and monastic school. It is said to have been discovered by the saint and his followers while they were traveling across the ocean, evangelizing islands. It appeared on numerous maps in Christopher Columbus's time, most notably Martin Behaim's Erdapfel of 1492. It is referred to as \\"La isla de San Borondón\\" or \\"isla de Samborombón\\" in Spanish.  - Clonfert is a small village in east County Galway, Ireland, halfway between Ballinasloe and Portumna. The village gives its name to the Diocese of Clonfert. Clonfert Cathedral is one of eight cathedral churches of the Church of Ireland Diocese of Limerick and Killaloe. The cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clonfert is located in Loughrea.  - Connacht or Connaught (or \\"Cúige Chonnacht\\") is one of the provinces of Ireland, situated in the west of the country. Up to the 9th century it consisted of several independent major kingdoms (Lúighne, Uí Maine, and Iarthar Connacht).   - The Diocese of Clonfert is a Roman Catholic diocese in the western part of Ireland. It is in the Metropolitan Province of Tuam and is subject to the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Tuam. The current Bishop is the Most Reverend John Kirby who was appointed by the Holy See on 18 February 1988 and (ordained bishop) on 9 April 1988.  - Saint Brendan of Clonfert (484  c. 577) (Irish: \\"Naomh Bréanainn\\"; ), also referred to as Brendan moccu Altae, called \\"the Navigator\\", \\"the Voyager\\", \\"the Anchorite\\", or \\"the Bold\\", is one of the early Irish monastic saints. He is chiefly renowned for his legendary quest to the \\"Isle of the Blessed,\\" also called Saint Brendan's Island. The \\"Voyage of Saint Brendan\\" could be called an immram (Irish navigational story). He was one of the Twelve Apostles of Ireland.  - Portumna (- meaning 'the landing place of the oak') is a market town in the south-east of County Galway, Ireland, on the border with County Tipperary. The town is located to the west of the point where the River Shannon enters Lough Derg. This historic crossing point over the River Shannon between counties Tipperary and Galway has a long history of bridges and ferry crossings. On the south-western edge of the town lie Portumna Castle and Portumna forest park.  - Galway is a city in the West of Ireland in the province of Connacht. Galway City Council is the local authority for the city. Galway lies on the River Corrib between Lough Corrib and Galway Bay and is surrounded by County Galway. It is the fourth most populous urban area in the Republic of Ireland and the sixth most populous city in the island of Ireland.  - A cathedral (French: \\"cathédrale\\" from Latin: \\"cathedra\\", \\"seat\\" from the Greek \\"kathédra\\" (), seat, bench, from \\"kata\\" \\"down\\" + \\"hedra\\" seat, base, chair) is a Christian church which contains the seat of a bishop, thus serving as the central church of a diocese, conference, or episcopate. The counterpart term for such a church in German is \\"Dom\\" from Latin \\"domus ecclesiae\\" or \\"domus episcopalis\\"; also Italian Duomo, Dutch \\"Domkerk\\" and cognates in many other European languages. Churches with the function of \\"cathedral\\" are usually specific to those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy, such as the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, and some Lutheran and Methodist churches. Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appear in Italy, Gaul, Spain and North Africa in the 4th century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the 12th century, by which time they had developed architectural forms, institutional structures and legal identities distinct from parish churches, monastic churches and episcopal residences.  - The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago.  - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water.

Context: My fraternal twins were born 2 months early. The staff had already stopped premature labor at six months gestation but it proceeded too quickly this time. Total labor 2.5 hours. Needless to say, they were tiny - female 2 lbs. 3 oz, male 3 lbs. 10 oz. Female was born dark blue - luckily, I was at the finest maternity hospital in this half of the State (McGee Women’s). They brought the female around to breathing, while I cried, thinking that she was dead. The twins were rushed to the NICU, too tiny to breast feed except with pumped milk through a feeding tube. Both were watched closely by doctors and nurses as they were not passing waste properly. The day it was decided that the male needed surgery, the female was discharged to home. The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis. He kept the colostomy bag until he was about 5 months old; back into the hospital for the colostomy reversal. The sign that I hung above their shared playpen said “Whatever doesn’t kill me, makes me stronger”. How did I cope with it? Mostly alone. The hospital offered group sessions for parents of severely premature infants. During the very first session, I had a zen realization that, once I realized that the circumstances were out of my control, I GAINED control of myself and my life. A bit like the Serenity Prayer. I shared that epiphany with the group and they looked at me like I had two heads. I had never heard of the Serenity Prayer and I’d been an atheist since age 13, so religion was not my go-to then, nor is it now. That realization helped. The twins are 37 now. Question: Why did the babies have to go to the NICU? Answer: A:","output":"The babies had to go to the NICU because they were born prematurely and were too tiny to breastfeed properly, requiring milk to be given through a feeding tube. Additionally, they were not passing waste properly, so they needed close monitoring and medical care from the doctors and nurses in the NICU."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this post-nuclear society, Caesar tries to cultivate peace between the apes and the surviving humans. A gorilla general named Aldo (Claude Akins) however opposes this and plots Caesar's downfall. Caesar is married to Lisa (Natalie Trundy), the female ape of the previous film, and they have a son named Cornelius (Bobby Porter) in honor of Caesar's father. Caesar regrets never having known his parents until his human assistant MacDonald (Austin Stoker) tells him about an archive film of his parents where he can also learn about the future. The archives are located in the Forbidden City, now a radioactive ruin. After obtaining a geiger counter and weapons from the armory, Caesar travels with MacDonald and orangutan Virgil (Paul Williams) to the Forbidden City and sneaks in to find the archives.

Information:  - Pierre Marie Félix Janet (30 May 1859  24 February 1947) was a pioneering French psychologist, philosopher and psychotherapist in the field of dissociation and traumatic memory.  - Elizabeth F. Loftus (born Elizabeth Fishman, October 16, 1944) is an American cognitive psychologist and expert on human memory. She has conducted extensive research on the malleability of human memory. Loftus is best known for her ground-breaking work on the misinformation effect and eyewitness memory, and the creation and nature of false memories, including recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse. As well as her prolific work inside the laboratory, Loftus has been heavily involved in applying her research to legal settings; she has consulted or provided expert witness testimony for hundreds of cases. Loftus has been recognized throughout the world for her work, receiving numerous awards and honorary degrees. In 2002, Loftus was ranked 58th in the \\"Review of General Psychology\\"s list of the 100 most influential psychological researchers of the 20th century, and was the highest ranked woman on the list.  - Hungry for Monsters is a 2003 documentary by George Paul Csicsery ( b , 1948 ) about false memory , focussing on Nicole Althaus ' disproved allegations of sexual abuse against her father , made when she was 15 years old .  - False memory syndrome (FMS) describes a condition in which a person's identity and relationships are affected by memories that are factually incorrect but that they strongly believe. Peter J. Freyd originated the term, which the False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF) subsequently popularized. The term is not recognized as a psychiatric illness in any of the medical manuals, such as the ICD-10 or the DSM-5; however, the principle that memories can be altered by outside influences is overwhelmingly accepted by scientists.  - False memory is the psychological phenomenon in which a person recalls a memory that did not actually occur. False memory is often considered in legal cases regarding childhood sexual abuse. This phenomenon was initially investigated by psychological pioneers Pierre Janet and Sigmund Freud. Freud wrote \\"The Aetiology of Hysteria\\", where he discussed repressed memories of childhood sexual trauma in their relation to hysteria. Elizabeth Loftus has, since her debuting research project in 1974, been a lead researcher in memory recovery and false memories. False memory syndrome recognizes false memory as a prevalent part of one's life in which it affects the person's mentality and day-to-day life. False memory syndrome differs from false memory in that the syndrome is heavily influential in the orientation of a person's life, while false memory can occur without this significant effect. The syndrome takes effect because the person believes the influential memory to be true. However, its research is controversial and the syndrome is excluded from identification as a mental disorder and, therefore, is also excluded from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. False memory is an important part of psychological research because of the ties it has to a large number of mental disorders, such as PTSD.  - Sigmund Freud ( born Sigismund Schlomo Freud; 6 May 1856  23 September 1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. Freud was born to Galician Jewish parents in the Moravian town of Freiberg, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the University of Vienna. Upon completing his habilitation in 1885, he was appointed a docent in neuropathology and became an affiliated professor in 1902. Freud lived and worked in Vienna, having set up his clinical practice there in 1886. In 1938 Freud left Austria to escape the Nazis. He died in exile in the United Kingdom in 1939.  - The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), offers a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders. It is used, or relied upon, by clinicians, researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, the legal system, and policy makers together with alternatives such as the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), produced by the World Health Organization (WHO). The DSM is now in its fifth edition, DSM-5, published on May 18, 2013. It evaluated the patient on five axes or dimensions rather than just one broad aspect of 'mental disorder'. These dimensions relate to biological, psychological, social and other aspects. The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, and from a United States Army manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have incrementally added to the total number of mental disorders, although also removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders.    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'main subject'. The answer to this question is:","output":"The subject entity is 'false memory,' and the object entities are 'Pierre Janet,' 'Sigmund Freud,' 'Elizabeth F.

Though you could choose any major you want, it's best to study something like physiology, biology, or social science. These majors will help you build the prerequisite skills for medical school.","output":"After obtaining a bachelor's degree in a science-related major, the next steps to become an endocrinologist are as follows: 1. Take the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT): This standardized, multiple-choice test is an essential part of the medical school admissions process. It is designed to assess your problem-solving, critical thinking, and knowledge of foundational science concepts necessary for the study of medicine. Begin preparing for the MCAT during your undergraduate studies by engaging in study groups and utilizing test preparation resources. 2. Apply to medical school: Research and apply to medical schools that best align with your professional and personal goals. Medical schools typically require prerequisite courses in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and English. Provide your MCAT scores, letters of recommendation, and create a compelling personal statement as part of your application. 3. Complete medical school: Medical school generally takes four years to complete and consists of two phases: preclinical and clinical. During the preclinical phase, which typically lasts for the first two years, you will study medical theory and foundational science courses. In the clinical phase, you will engage in rotations through various medical specialties to gain hands-on experience in a supervised setting. 4. Choose your specialty: As you near the end of medical school, you should decide to specialize in endocrinology. This specialty focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of hormone-related disorders, such as diabetes, thyroid diseases, and reproductive health issues. 5. Complete a residency: After graduating from medical school, you will need to enter a residency program in internal medicine, which usually takes three years to complete. Throughout your residency, you will practice under the supervision of experienced physicians and gain more in-depth knowledge in your chosen specialty. 6. Pursue a fellowship in endocrinology: Once you have completed your residency in internal medicine, you must then complete an additional two- to three-year fellowship in endocrinology. During your fellowship, you will receive specialized training in diagnosing, treating, and managing hormone-related disorders. 7. Obtain board certification: After completing your fellowship in endocrinology, you will need to become board certified by passing the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism Certification Exam. This exam tests your knowledge and clinical judgment in the field of endocrinology. 8. Obtain state licensure: As a medical professional, you will need to apply for and obtain a state medical license to practice medicine legally in your state. Licensing requirements may vary from state to state, so it is essential to review the specific guidelines for your region. 9. Gain experience and professional development: Begin your career as an endocrinologist by working in hospitals, private practices, or other healthcare settings. Maintain your board certification by keeping up-to-date with the latest advancements in endocrinology and participating in periodical recertification exams. 10. Always continue learning: As an endocrinologist, you must stay current with the latest research, best practices, and advancements in your field. Attend conferences, obtain continuing medical education (CME) credits, and collaborate with colleagues to ensure you are providing the best possible care to your patients. By following these steps and dedicating yourself to your studies and professional development, you will be well on your way to becoming a skilled, knowledgeable, and successful endocrinologist."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence: Mark Arm has been in Mudhoney and Green River.","output":"After thoroughly reading and analyzing the text, it can be determined that the sentence, \\"Mark Arm has been in Mudhoney and Green River,\\" is indeed true. The text states that Mark Arm, born as Mark Thomas McLaughlin, is the vocalist for the grunge band Mudhoney. The text also mentions that his former group, Green River, is one of the first grunge bands, which confirms his involvement in both of the mentioned bands. Mudhoney, formed in 1988, is best known for its early releases on the Sub Pop label. Their music has been influential in shaping the grunge genre, with a sound characterized by heavy distortion, fuzz, and feedback. Mudhoney has built a dedicated fan base throughout its career and is still active today, with Mark Arm as their frontman. Green River, on the other hand, had a shorter lifespan, existing from 1984 to 1988. However, despite its relatively brief existence, the band played a crucial role in the development of the grunge sound and paved the way for many bands that came later, including Mudhoney. Green River's lineup featured key members who later went on to form influential bands like Mudhoney and Pearl Jam. In addition to his contributions as a vocalist to Mudhoney and Green River, Mark Arm has also worked in various other roles. The text explains that he is the manager of the Sub Pop warehouse, a position that has likely provided him with a unique perspective on and involvement in the Pacific Northwest's music scene. Furthermore, he previously worked at Fantagraphics Books, which publishes and distributes alternative and underground comics, graphic novels, and additional art-related media, which demonstrates his broader involvement in the arts and counterculture. In conclusion, the sentence that Mark Arm has been in both Mudhoney and Green River is accurate, as the text explicitly states Mark Arm's affiliation with both bands. Additionally, Arm's creative and professional experiences further solidify his status as a key figure in the grunge music scene and the broader Pacific Northwest artistic community."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q: I heard that Remy was terrified of flying, but Taylor allayed Remy's fear by telling them how safe it was.  And I was wondering How would Taylor feel afterwards? A:","output":"Assuming this task involves understanding the given situation and making an inference on Taylor's feelings, here are the steps I would undertake: 1. First, I will analyze the given scenario. In this case, Remy was terrified of flying and Taylor managed to allay Remy's fear by assuring them about the safety of flying. 2. In analyzing relationships between emotions and actions, it's often seen that when a person consoles another, they usually feel satisfaction or relief after successfully reassuring the other person.  3. Since Taylor was successful in calming Remy's fear, it would be safe to assume that Taylor would feel relieved or satisfied. 4. However, emotions can be complex and multifaceted. While relief or satisfaction is likely, Taylor might also feel empathetic, considering Remy's fear. This shows Taylor's understanding for Remy's situation. Conclusion: Based on the mentioned situation, Taylor would likely feel relieved or satisfied having allayed Remy's fear.

Background: Aaron Charles Carter was born on December 7, 1987, at the Tampa General Hospital in Tampa, Florida, where his parents, Jane Elizabeth (nee Spaulding) and Robert Gene Carter (1952-2017), ran the Garden Villa Retirement Home. The family was originally from New York City, where his older brother Nick, of the boy band Backstreet Boys, was born. In addition to his brother Nick, he also has three sisters: twin sister Angel (a model), B.J. and Leslie (1986-2012). Carter is named after his paternal grandfather, Aaron Charles Carter, and his maternal grandfather, Douglas \\"Charles\\" Spaulding. Context: Carter's next album, Another Earthquake!, was released on September 3, 2002, during the \\"Rock, Rap, and Retro\\" tour. The album featured the patriotic-themed \\"America A.O.\\" and the ballad \\"Do You Remember\\". He guest starred on three episodes of the Nickelodeon TV show, All That and sang the theme song to the PBS animated series Liberty's Kids, titled \\"Through my own Eyes.\\"  During that time, Carter's parents filed a lawsuit against his former manager, Lou Pearlman (now deceased), in 2002 alleging failure to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties on Carter's 1998 album, which was released through Pearlman's label and production company, Trans Continental. On March 13, 2003, Pearlman was declared in contempt of court for ignoring a court order to produce documents relating to royalty payments.  Carter had also dated Lindsay Lohan along with his girlfriend Hilary Duff at the same time (leading to a feud between the two), but he broke up with Lohan in April 2003, and resumed dating Duff. Later, that same year, he reportedly cheated on her and Duff ended their on-and-off relationship after two years. Carter's Most Requested Hits, a collection including tracks from his last three albums as well as a new single, \\"One Better\\", was released on November 3, 2003.  \\"Saturday Night\\", which was released on March 22, 2005 and was promoted by Carter during his summer 2005 Remix Tour.

The direct-to-video film was based heavily on his own life as a performer. A real-life motocross racer, Carter also appeared in 2005's Supercross. On March 21, 2006, Trans Continental filed a lawsuit against Carter within the Los Angeles Superior Court, citing that Carter allegedly reneged on a recording deal. Carter had signed the contract on December 7, 2004, when he was 17 and underage. His attorney however stated that Carter had the right to \\"cancel or void various agreements\\" that were signed when he was a minor.

Here is an article: Nick Clegg's office sent out private briefings to Liberal Democrat MPs on Monday urging them to condemn Theresa May's plans to pull out of all EU judicial co-operation as an example of Eurosceptic Tory dogma being put before the need to keep UK families safe from criminals. In a sign of the scale of the rift at the top of the coalition, the briefing paper says the home secretary's decision represents \\"an open goal for the Liberal Democrats\\". The briefing paper, written by Ed Webber, the special adviser to the Lib Dem leader on EU affairs, also questions whether the prominent Tory party backer Lord Ashcroft can support opting out of the 130 EU co-operation measures, including the European arrest warrant. The charity Crimestoppers, founded by Ashcroft, has used the European warrant to arrest more than 50 British fugitives hiding elsewhere in Europe, the briefing paper points out. Due to the severe divisions between Tories and Lib Dems on the matter, May told MPs that the coalition was minded at present to opt-out of all EU judicial co-operation en bloc but was unable to say which forms of co-operation she would seek to negotiate back into. She stressed that, in many cases, she might seek memorandums of understanding rather than opt-ins. Negotiating individual opt-ins would represent a challenge for Britain as it would require the agreement of its European partners. Some countries, such as Bulgaria, might demand free movement of its citizens within the UK in return for letting Britain back in, it was suggested. The European commission might impose higher administration costs for police co-operation on the UK as a result of the opt-out. May is required to state by June 2014 whether or not Britain will retain the 133 European crime-fighting and justice measures, including the European arrest warrant. After that deadline, the European court of justice would have greater powers over EU police co-operation in the UK. The opt-out would mean all European judicial co-operation measures would cease to apply to the UK by December 2014. David Cameron will attend a European heads of government summit in Brussels this week, where he will seek to defend UK banking interests from EU plans for greater banking co-operation. There are doubts about the effectiveness of any UK veto in this area. A group of cabinet ministers led by the education secretary, Michael Gove, has let it be known that Britain should leave the EU if its demands for a repatriation of powers are not met. The Foreign Office is undertaking a systematic inquiry into the balance of powers, which is likely to be completed by 2014 in time for the Conservative party to make a manifesto commitment on a referendum. May is opposed to plans for a European-wide public prosecutor with powers of investigation and arrest across member states. She says the European arrest warrant has been used disproportionately, pointing out that Britain hands over many more suspects to other countries than it receives to face justice in the UK. In February 102 Tory backbenchers signed a letter, published in the Telegraph, calling on the government to pull out of all of these measures. In August 13 senior former UK police and security chiefs, including a former head of MI5, signed a letter to the prime minister warning that pulling out of many of these measures risked putting national security, public safety and the UK's reputation and international leadership in this area at risk. The Lib Dem briefing paper states: \\"This is about Eurosceptic Tories wanting to make it harder for the UK police to catch criminals, counter-terrorism and keep our streets and our families safe from dangerous criminals. They have put themselves in an extraordinary position and this is an open goal for the Liberal Democrats. \\"There are thousands of cases where the police have used these measures to catch criminals abroad and deport dangerous foreign criminals from the UK, including one of the failed 21/7 London bombers. Only this year, the home secretary and prime minister's local police force, Thames Valley police, secured the arrest of a man wanted for 15 child sex offences as result of a joint investigation between Thames Valley and Danish police.\\" Write a title for it.","output":"UK Political Parties Disagree on EU Judicial Cooperation Plans"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is likely to be true as well. However, it's essential to analyze the premise and the hypothesis closely to understand the reasoning behind this conclusion. Premise: The premise describes a situation where the individual feels that consuming too much of something (presumably television or media content) is becoming overwhelming. As a result, they have decided to limit their exposure to a couple of hours per day, one hour in the morning and another hour in the evening. The premise implies that the individual is taking conscious action to mitigate the effects of excessive consumption, reflecting a sense of self-awareness and the ability to implement self-restraint. Hypothesis: The hypothesis suggests that, due to feeling overwhelmed, the individual has decided to watch content for one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening. It seems plausible that these actions are being taken to reduce the feeling of being inundated and to manage their consumption in a healthy manner. The hypothesis is a possible explanation of the premise, as it proposes a direct connection between the feelings of being overwhelmed and the decision to set a time limit in the morning and evening. Conclusion: Given the premise and hypothesis, it can be concluded that if the premise is true - that the individual almost felt like it was too much and found themselves restricting their viewing to a couple of hours a day (one in the morning and one in the evening) - then it is likely that the hypothesis is true as well. The hypothesis aligns with the premise by explaining the possible reasoning behind the individual's decision to limit their consumption. It focuses on their self-awareness and self-restraint, offering a plausible explanation for their actions, and thus supports the likelihood of the premise holding true. However, it is important to note that while the hypothesis seems valid and strongly connected to the premise, other external factors, different viewpoints, and alternative explanations could influence the relationship between the two. As a result, although the hypothesis is a possible explanation that is likely true if the premise is true, it is not the only explanation. The analysis, in this case, is based solely on the given information, and there may be other factors at play that we are not aware of."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Contemporary history of India generally refers to the period from the time of India's independence in 1947 to the present day. Many books have been written covering different aspects of this modern history. The best books on contemporary history of India are those that provide an in-depth understanding of the nation's political, social, and economic developments. Some of the prominent books in this category are: 1. \\"India After Gandhi: The History of the World's Largest Democracy\\" by Ramachandra Guha: This comprehensive and well-researched book provides an extensive overview of India's political journey from the time of Independence to the early 21st century.

The author delves into the ideas and individuals who have shaped the course of Indian democracy while confronting contemporary challenges. Second question: Which are the best books to read on Indian history?

Some key books on the subject include: 1. \\"A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India\\" by Upinder Singh: This book provides an in-depth account of India's history from the earliest civilizations, such as the Indus Valley civilization, through to the early medieval period. 2. \\"India's Ancient Past\\" by R.S. Sharma: This is another essential book for those interested in ancient Indian history, covering political, economic, and social development from the Stone Age to the 12th century. 3. \\"The Discovery of India\\" by Jawaharlal Nehru: Written by India's first prime minister, this book is regarded as both a historical classic and a philosophical work, exploring India's rich cultural past, as well as its role in the fight for freedom and the formation of a modern, secular, democratic state. 4. \\"Ashoka: The Search for India’s Lost Emperor\\" by Charles Allen: This book delves into the life of one of India's most famous emperors, Ashoka Maurya, and the impact of his reign on Indian history. 5. \\"Indian Summer: The Secret History of the End of an Empire\\" by Alex von Tunzelmann: This book provides a compelling and detailed account of the complex events leading to India's independence and the subsequent partition of India and Pakistan.

Here, we'll explore both the positive and negative interpretations of the phrase: Positive Interpretation: 1. High Awareness: If a person is \\"wide-awake all the way,\\" it can mean that they are completely alert and attentive throughout a task or situation. This can often be seen as a positive quality, as being attentive allows one to focus and ensure that any task at hand is done efficiently and effectively. 2. Preparedness: Being 'wide-awake' can imply that someone is prepared for any challenge that may come their way, which can be seen as a positive trait. It reflects a person's ability to adapt and respond to changing situations with confidence. 3. Enthusiasm: The phrase can also be interpreted as a sign of enthusiasm or excitement, as someone who is wide-awake is often eager and willing to engage in activities. This kind of enthusiasm can be contagious and motivate others around them to be more engaged and proactive. Negative Interpretation: 1. Lack of Sleep: In some contexts, the phrase could be seen as negative, suggesting that the individual is experiencing sleep deprivation or is unable to sleep properly. This can be harmful to one's mental and physical health, as proper rest is essential for overall well-being. 2. Overstimulation: If someone is \\"wide-awake all the way,\\" it could indicate that they are overstimulated or experiencing an excessive amount of stress. This may lead to feelings of anxiety, irritability, or burnout over time, which can negatively impact one's personal and professional life. 3. Inability to Relax: The phrase might also suggest that a person has difficulty allowing themselves to relax or take a break from work or other responsibilities. This can lead to an unhealthy balance between work and personal life, which may contribute to increased stress and a diminished quality of life. In conclusion, the phrase \\"wide-awake all the way\\" does not have a definitive positive or negative connotation. Its interpretation depends on the context in which it is used and the perspective of the person analyzing it. It can communicate positive attributes such as alertness, preparedness, and enthusiasm, or negative qualities such as sleep deprivation, overstimulation, and an inability to relax."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The work's coverage of American and Canadian geography and history has been a traditional strength. Written by 6,500 contributors, the \\"Encyclopedia Americana\\" includes over 9,000 bibliographies, 150,000 cross-references, 1,000+ tables, 1,200 maps, and almost 4,500 black-and-white line art and color images. It also has 680 factboxes. Most articles are signed by their contributors.  Long available as a 30-volume print set, the \\"Encyclopedia Americana\\" is now marketed as an online encyclopedia requiring a subscription. In March 2008, Scholastic said that print sales remained good but that the company was still deciding on the future of the print edition. The company did not produce an edition in 2007, a change from its previous approach of releasing a revised print edition each year. The most recent print edition of the \\"Encyclopedia Americana\\" was published in 2006.  The online version of the \\"Encyclopedia Americana\\", first introduced in 1997, continues to be updated and sold. This work, like the print set from which it is derived, is designed for high school and first-year college students along with public library users. It is available to libraries as one of the options in the Grolier Online reference service, which also includes the \\"Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia\\", intended for middle and high school students, and \\"The New Book of Knowledge\\", an encyclopedia for elementary and middle school students.

Will the pressure of a sealed container increase or decrease when a gas inside it is heated?  Gwen owns a sauna. She wants to try something new and decides to make the room air tight, meaning no air can escape the room. After trialing this with a few customers she asks them for some feedback. The customers say they really like how there is never a draft in the room but they feel weird when they leave the room and their ears pop like when they are are on an airplane and the pressure is uneven.  Hint: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease.","output":"The pressure of a sealed container will increase when a gas inside it is heated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 3: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise presents a situation where White is holding two circuit breakers together and dismisses the problem as 'nothing,' which implies that the problem was resolved at least to some extent. The hypothesis claims that White fixed the problem easily. The premise doesn't directly entail that the problem was completely fixed, but it does suggest a level of easiness in solving it.

Group A ate lots of fats(lipids), while Group B  had a more balanced diet with few fats. Group A gained a lot of weight over the course of the 6 month study.  Hint: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.

Often, omnivores also have the ability to incorporate food sources such as algae, fungi, and bacteria into their diet as well.  - The pig-footed bandicoot (\\"Chaeropus ecaudatus\\") was a small marsupial of the arid and semi-arid plains of Australia. The distribution range of the species was later reduced to an inland desert region, where it was last recorded in the 1950s; it is now presumed to be extinct.  - Marsupials are any members of the mammalian infraclass Marsupialia. All extant marsupials are endemic to Australasia and the Americas. A distinctive characteristic common to these species is that most of the young are carried in a pouch. Well-known marsupials include kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, possums, opossums, wombats, Tasmanian devils, and the recently extinct thylacines. Others include the numbat, the bandicoot, the bettong, the bilby, the quoll, and the quokka.  - Bandicoots are a group of about 20 species of small to medium-sized, terrestrial marsupial omnivore in the order Peramelemorphia. They are endemic to the AustraliaNew Guinea region.  - The Peramelidae family of marsupials contains all of the extant bandicoots . One known extinct species of bandicoot , the pig - footed bandicoot , was so different from the other species , it was recently moved into its own family . Four fossil peramelids are described . They are found throughout Australia and New Guinea , with at least some species living in every available habitat , from rainforest to desert .  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of .

Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands. The state has a population of around 518,500, just over forty percent of which resides in the Greater Hobart precinct, which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city, Hobart.  - The order Peramelemorphia includes the bandicoots and bilbies: it equates approximately to the mainstream of marsupial omnivores. All members of the order are endemic to the twin land masses of Australia-New Guinea and most have the characteristic bandicoot shape: a plump, arch-backed body with a long, delicately tapering snout, very large upright ears, relatively long, thin legs, and a thin tail. Their size varies from about 140 grams up to 4 kilograms, but most species are about the weight of a half-grown kitten: somewhere around one kilogram.  - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania.

The internal revenue service (irs) establishes the maximum individuals can contribute to their 401 k every year. Your employer might also impose limits on you.","output":"To invest successfully in your 401(k), it is crucial to understand the process and develop a sound strategy. Here is a comprehensive overview of the steps involved: 1. Understand the basics of a 401(k) plan: A 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan that allows you to contribute pre-tax dollars from your paycheck to a tax-deferred investment account. This investment account is managed by a financial institution on behalf of your employer. 2. Know your limits: As you mentioned, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) establishes the maximum annual contributions that can be made to a 401(k) plan. For 2021, the contribution limit for employees under the age of 50 is 19,500, while those aged 50 or older can contribute an additional 6,500 as a catch-up contribution, bringing their total to 26,000. Your employer may also limit the percentage of your income that you can contribute. 3. Assess your investment options: Your 401(k) plan will typically offer a range of investment options, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. It's essential to research and understand these options to create a diversified investment portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance, investment objectives, and time horizon. 4. Determine your contribution amount: Based on your financial goals and current financial situation, you need to decide how much you want to contribute to your 401(k) plan. Keep in mind the IRS and employer-imposed limits and try to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of your employer's matching contribution (if offered). 5. Set up payroll deductions: Once you've decided on a contribution amount, you'll need to set up payroll deductions through your employer's human resources or payroll department. Your contributions will be automatically deducted from your paycheck and deposited into your 401(k) account. 6. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio: It's important to regularly review your 401(k) investments and adjust your portfolio as needed. This process, known as rebalancing, ensures that your investments remain aligned with your risk tolerance and long-term goals. You may need to rebalance your portfolio due to market fluctuations or changes in your personal circumstances. 7. Monitor fees and expenses: It's essential to be aware of the fees and expenses associated with managing your 401(k), as these can significantly impact your long-term returns. These fees may include administrative fees, management fees, and expense ratios for individual investment options. Make sure you understand the costs involved and seek lower-cost alternatives when possible. 8. Consider professional advice: If you're unsure about your investment choices or need help developing a comprehensive financial plan, consider seeking the assistance of a financial advisor. A financial professional can provide guidance and help you navigate the complexities of investing for retirement. 9. Plan for required minimum distributions (RMDs): Once you reach the age of 72 (or 70½ if you turned 70½ before January 1, 2020), you'll be required to take minimum distributions from your 401(k) account. Be prepared to factor these RMDs into your overall retirement income strategy. 10. Stay informed and educated: Keep yourself updated on industry trends, legislation changes, and new investment options related to your 401(k) plan. Being knowledgeable about your retirement savings will help you make sound decisions and stay on track to achieve your financial goals. By following these steps and being proactive in managing your 401(k) investments, you can maximize the growth potential of your retirement savings and have peace of mind knowing you're working toward a secure financial future."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Does \\"Congress often writes legislation to restrain executive officials to the performance of their duties, as laid out by the laws Congress passes.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"To what does congress attempt to limit executive officials?\\" Options are: + yes + no","output":"+ yes The correct answer is yes. Congress attempts to limit executive officials by writing legislation that restrains them to the performance of their duties, as laid out by the laws Congress passes. This means that Congress makes rules that tell executive officials what they can and cannot do. The other option, no, is wrong because the statement does explain how Congress tries to limit executive officials."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Inside the car, there were a mom, dad and their five kids, as well as two other family members. They all belonged to a big family group called the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. That night, it was raining a lot, and the rain had filled up a creek so much that it was swelling with water. While the family was driving, something really bad happened. The car suddenly fell into the deep and rain-filled creek. The mom and dad tried their best, but they could only save themselves. They were very, very sad because they lost their five children and the other two people in the car. The father, who drove the car, was hurt and had to go to the hospital. The people who help to figure out what caused accidents, like the sheriff, said that the rain and bad weather did not cause the accident. They are still trying to find out what really happened, and they will do some tests to see if alcohol had anything to do with it. They will tell everyone about the test results on the same day they say goodbye to their loved ones in a special ceremony called a funeral.

Here are some of their stories. \\"You don't know anything about stillbirths until you are forced to look them up and see the statistics,\\" said Chloe Nicholson, who was faced with the tragedy less than two months ago. The 26-year-old's pregnancy came as a big surprise in January this year, but a very happy one. Chloe, from Ilkeston, Derbyshire, said she was considered \\"low risk\\" and despite her experiencing severe vomiting, known as hyperemesis gravidarum, and pelvic pain, known as symphysis pubis dysfunction, it was only her who suffered and the baby was \\"happy as Larry\\" throughout. But, on 8 September, she couldn't feel any movement. \\"I went in just to get checked out,\\" said Chloe. \\"I thought it would be fine and if something was wrong, I would probably have her that day.\\" But when nurses couldn't find a heartbeat, Chloe went for a scan. The nurse then asked for her hand. Less than 24 hours later, she had a stillbirth to deliver Phoebe-Quinn. \\"I was angry at first,\\" she said. \\"I just didn't understand why it had happened. It is terrifying.\\" And when she wanted to talk about it on Facebook, she lost 26 friends. \\"They just didn't want to hear about it,\\" she said. \\"It was like they thought you should be ashamed. People just don't want to discuss it when a baby is involved.\\" After a year of trying for a baby, Luke and Emma Block were thrilled to find they were expecting twins. But the couple from Faversham, Kent, soon discovered problems that would eventually lead to the death of their baby girl, Abigail. \\"It was our first scan,\\" said 40-year-old Luke. \\"They noticed there was a problem with the growth of one of the twins and that we might lose one of them. That is where it all began.\\" There was hope when Abigail made it to 36 weeks, born weighing only 1lb 6oz, while her brother, Ethan, was a healthy baby boy. But after five weeks in intensive care, it was time to say goodbye to one of their children. \\"We feel blessed we had that time with her,\\" said Luke. \\"Some parents don't, but with her, her eyes were open, we could change her nappy and we could be part of her care.\\" They also had new-born Ethan to think of. \\"The pain of losing a child is intense and even more so when you have a healthy baby to look after and get so much joy from,\\" he said. \\"At times we even felt guilty for feeling happy.\\" SOURCE: Stillbirth and Neonatal Death charity (Sands) Aimee and Michael Tulloch, from Birmingham, have had to endure the loss of three babies. After two rounds of artificial insemination (or IUI), Aimee became pregnant in 2013. But an infection at 23 weeks meant baby Eli only lived for four days, dying in his mother's arms. \\"That evening Michael and I left the hospital without our baby,\\" said the 37-year-old. \\"We left with a piece of our hearts missing.\\" In October 2014, another round of IUI saw Aimee become pregnant with twins. But, just before the 25-week mark, she went into hospital with Braxton Hicks contractions, her waters started to leak and real labour contractions began. Their baby girl, Storm, lived for just 17 minutes, while baby boy Isaiah made it to 11 hours. \\"Losing a child is a very lonely place,\\" Aimee said. \\"They will always be my children; I will always be their mum and want to talk about them. \\"I was very lucky with friends and family, although I lost one childhood friend, perhaps because she didn't know how to talk about it. \\"But I felt I had to manage their feelings. It makes people feel uncomfortable and then they end up saying stupid things like 'You can have another one.'\\" Leanne Louch and her partner Paul Seaman got a huge surprise when they found out in March they were expecting identical twins. But the Nottingham couple were left heartbroken after Thomas and Jack both died at 21 weeks gestation, before being born. \\"I was told there were extra risks but no-one went in-depth about what they were,\\" said 30-year-old Leanne. \\"I was getting scanned every two weeks and obviously you hear about things, but no-one talks about it.\\" During a weekend at the end of June, she started feeling some pains and on a Monday morning, one of her waters broke. \\"They told me if I could hang on until 24 weeks, they could give injections of steroids to help lungs develop,\\" she said. But by Wednesday, her second water had broken. On Thursday, doctors gave the couple the news that both boys had died. She then gave birth to the twins on Friday. \\"When I went for the post-mortem results, they said I could go out the backdoor rather than walk through the pre-natal clinic with everyone getting their scans,\\" said Leanne. \\"But I said no, I walked through that room with my head held high. I didn't do anything wrong.\\" Zoe Burdaky and her partner, Kyle Woollacott, are just weeks away from welcoming their child into the world. But less than a year ago they suffered the devastation of losing a daughter at 37 weeks. \\"It was a very straightforward pregnancy,\\" said 24-year-old Zoe. \\"There were no risk factors.\\" But, weeks before the due date, she stopped feeling movement. \\"We just thought we were being oversensitive,\\" said Kyle, who is also 24. \\"We thought they would just tell us everything was OK.\\" Instead, nurses said they could not find a heartbeat and there had been a clot. Baby Lily was delivered the next day, stillborn. \\"It was like a dream,\\" said Kyle. \\"Even when the baby was being born, we thought 'they've got it wrong.'\\" Being pregnant with their second child, with just a few weeks to go, has been an anxious time. \\"What I've found the hardest is when people ask if it's my first,\\" said Zoe. \\"I don't want to put people in that situation when they are being polite, but I want to acknowledge Lily.\\" Kyle said: \\"We are excited now but it is scary too and we are having scans every week.\\" If you need advice or support after experiencing baby loss, there are a number of charities who can help.

To do this, add 49 to both sides of the equation: 151 + 49 = 10*t - 49 + 49 200 = 10*t Step 4: Divide both sides by 10 to solve for t: 200 / 10 = 10*t / 10 20 = t So, the solution is t = 20."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They persuade a reluctant Allan Quartermain (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) to give them a lift to the coast in his wagon. Along the way, they encounter another wagon carrying two men in bad shape. Umbopa (Paul Robeson) recovers, but Silvestra (Arthur Goullet) dies after boasting to Quartermain that he has found the way to the fabled mines of Solomon. Patsy finds the dead man's map. He sneaks off during the night, unwilling to risk his daughter's life. Kathy is unable to persuade Quatermain to follow him. Instead, they rendezvous with Quartermain's new clients, Sir Henry Curtis (John Loder) and retired navy Commander Good (Roland Young), out for a bit of big game hunting. Kathy steals Quartermain's wagon to go after her father. When they catch up with her, she refuses to go back with them, so they and Umbopa accompany her across the desert and over the mountains, as shown on the map. During the arduous trek, Curtis and Kathy fall in love. On the other side of the mountains, they are surrounded by unfriendly natives and taken to the kraal of their chief, Twala (Robert Adams), to be questioned. Twala takes them to see the entrance of the mines, guarded by the feared witch doctor Gagool (an uncredited Sydney Fairbrother). That night, Umbopa reveals that he is the son of the former chief, who was treacherously killed by the usurper Twala. He meets with dissidents, led by Infadoos (Ecce Homo Toto), who are fed up with Twala's cruel reign.

Jason whispered the phoenix had escaped How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"The linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"Jason whispered the phoenix had escaped\\" can be analyzed on multiple levels, considering various aspects of language such as syntax, semantics, morphology, and pragmatics.  1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language. In this sentence, the syntax is relatively clear with a subject (Jason), a verb (whispered), and an object (the phoenix had escaped). It follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) structure, which is standard and intelligible in English. However, some readers might argue that the sentence could be enhanced by inserting a conjunction such as \\"that\\" after the verb \\"whispered\\" for improved clarity. 2. Semantics: Semantics is concerned with the meaning conveyed by the sentence. The sentence's meaning is straightforward: Jason communicated, in a hushed manner, that the mystical bird known as the phoenix was no longer in captivity or restrained. The words used in the sentence are relatively simple and clearly convey the intended message. 3. Morphology: Morphology is the study of word formation and the structure of words. The sentence is composed of common words that follow standard morphological rules in English. \\"Jason,\\" being a proper noun, starts with a capital letter, and the verb \\"whispered\\" is in the past tense with the \\"-ed\\" suffix, correctly indicating a completed action. 4. Pragmatics: Pragmatics is the study of how context influences meaning. This sentence is open to various interpretations depending on context. The sentence does not specify why Jason whispered this information, nor does it clarify where the phoenix was or to whom Jason was speaking. Some details about the characters and the environment surrounding them could have been provided. By doing so, the sentence would have offered a more comprehensive understanding of the context behind the statement. 5. Style and tone: The sentence is relatively simple and devoid of figurative language, making it easier to read and understand. However, more descriptive language or adjectives could be added to enhance the emotional impact or the visual imagery of the scenario. Furthermore, this sentence does not explicitly convey the urgency or the emotional reaction to the escape of the phoenix, which could prompt some critique.  In summary, the sentence \\"Jason whispered the phoenix had escaped\\" showcases linguistic integrity in terms of syntax, semantics, and morphology. However, it could benefit from improvements in terms of context, style, and tone. The sentence may be considered adequate for casual conversation or informal writing. Nonetheless, providing additional contextual information or utilizing more vivid language would promote a more comprehensive understanding and convey the underlying emotions and urgency in the situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A dog picks up a stick with his mouth while treading through water.\\" if \\"A dog retrieving an overthrown stick in the water.\\"?","output":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that \\"A dog picks up a stick with his mouth while treading through water\\" if \\"A dog retrieving an overthrown stick in the water.\\" However, let us analyze both statements closely to see how they relate and how we can derive this conclusion. Statement 1: \\"A dog picks up a stick with his mouth while treading through water.\\" In this statement, we are given a clear image of a dog that is in the water and is picking up a stick using its mouth. The statement also communicates that the dog is treading through the water, which means it is moving or swimming while carrying the stick. Statement 2: \\"A dog retrieving an overthrown stick in the water.\\" In this statement, we are given the information that a dog is retrieving a stick that has been thrown too far (overthrown) and has landed in the water. The dog's action of retrieving indicates that it is moving towards the stick, likely swimming in the water, in order to bring the stick back. Although the statement does not explicitly mention the dog picking up the stick with its mouth, it is reasonable to assume that this would be the method the dog would use, as it is a characteristic behavior of dogs when fetching objects. When comparing the two statements, we are given information about a dog in both, which involves the actions of swimming and retrieving a stick in the water. The goal or purpose of the dog's actions is the same: to acquire the stick.  Considering these similarities and the fact that dogs typically use their mouths to pick up objects, we can safely conclude that the scenario described in Statement 1 - \\"A dog picks up a stick with his mouth while treading through water\\" is a likely outcome or description of the situation presented by Statement 2 - \\"A dog retrieving an overthrown stick in the water.\\" Of course, one must remember that conclusions may not cover every detail and rely on the reader filling in some gaps, such as the method of retrieval (using the mouth) and the dog's movement (treading or swimming). However, it is reasonable to assume that the actions and situations described in both statements are closely related and support the conclusion that they depict the same event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: Cook might just as well be gambling on what color tie President Clinton will wear tomorrow. Hypothesis: President Clinton will wear a t-shirt tomorrow. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we first need to analyze the components of the premise and hypothesis and their relationship.  Premise: \\"Cook might just as well be gambling on what color tie President Clinton will wear tomorrow.\\" The primary focus of the premise is the uncertainty of the outcome, which is compared to the act of gambling. The statement implies that it is difficult to predict which color tie President Clinton will wear the next day. It anchors itself in a specific scenario: President Clinton wearing a tie with an uncertain color.  Hypothesis: \\"President Clinton will wear a t-shirt tomorrow.\\" The hypothesis here is that President Clinton will wear a t-shirt the next day. Contrary to the premise, it does not involve a tie but presents an alternative scenario where he wears a t-shirt. Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. A premise entails a hypothesis when the truth of the premise guarantees or leads to the truth of the hypothesis. In other words, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must necessarily be true because of their inherent logical relationship. In this case, the premise and hypothesis do not necessarily share a direct logical relationship. The premise focuses on the uncertainty of the color of the tie President Clinton will wear, while the hypothesis presents a distinct scenario in which he wears a t-shirt. The truth of the premise does not guarantee or lead to the truth of the hypothesis. For example, President Clinton might still wear a tie but of an unpredictable color, or he might wear something else entirely. However, the statements share a similar theme: uncertainty about President Clinton's choice of attire. Both the premise and the hypothesis address the unpredictability of his clothing decision, but they offer different possible outcomes. Moreover, accepting the premise that predicting President Clinton's tie color is uncertain doesn't negate the possibility that he might wear a t-shirt the next day. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the truth of the premise does not necessarily guarantee or lead to the truth of the hypothesis. While the premise and hypothesis share a common theme of uncertainty regarding President Clinton's attire, they each present separate outcomes and scenario possibilities, which do not rely upon a direct logical relationship between the two statements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert. He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said. Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, \\"Sir, the CAPs are up. Sir, they're going to want to know what to do.\\" Then she recalled hearing him say, \\"Yes sir.\\" She believed this conversation occurred a few minutes, perhaps five, after they entered the conference room. We believe this call would have taken place sometime before 10:10 to 10:15.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If you want to burn fat, is it better to walk or run? How can I lose or reduce thigh and hip fat fast? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choose your answer from: [i] no. [ii] yes.","output":"[i] no. The two questions you posed focus on different aspects of fat loss, although they share the general theme of burning fat and enhancing fitness levels. I will answer each question individually in detail. 1. If you want to burn fat, is it better to walk or run? Determining whether walking or running is better for burning fat depends on several factors, including an individual's fitness level, weight, and personal preferences. In general, the more intense the exercise, the more calories are burned. Walking: Walking is a low- to moderate-intensity exercise that is more accessible for beginners or those who are not physically capable of more intensive activities. It is low-impact, making it suitable for individuals with joint or mobility concerns. When walking at a moderate pace, one typically burns about 300 to 400 calories per hour, depending on their weight. Running: Running is a high-intensity, high-impact exercise that helps you burn calories at a faster rate. Typically, one can burn around 600 to 1000 calories per hour when running, depending on factors such as speed, weight, and fitness level. From a purely calorific perspective, running would seem more effective in burning fat. However, the intensity of the exercise should also be considered. High-intensity workouts can raise your heart rate into the \\"aerobic\\" or \\"anaerobic\\" zones. Exercising in the \\"fat-burning zone\\" (~60-70% of your maximum heart rate) can potentially lead to higher fat oxidation rates, which could optimize fat loss. Moreover, personal preferences should be taken into account. If you enjoy walking and are more likely to stick with it, walking may be a better choice for you. The consistency of exercise is crucial in achieving long-term benefits. 2. How can I lose or reduce thigh and hip fat fast? It is important to understand that spot reduction, or the idea of losing fat from specific body areas, is a myth. Successful and sustainable fat loss happens through a combination of consistent exercise, proper nutrition, and an overall caloric deficit. To lose thigh and hip fat, it is essential to focus on the following: a. Cardiovascular exercises: Engage in regular cardiovascular activities like running, walking, cycling, or swimming to burn calories and improve overall fitness. b. Strength training: Incorporate lower body exercises such as squats, lunges, leg presses, and deadlifts into your fitness routine. This helps to build muscle and tone the thighs and hips while burning calories. c. High-intensity interval training (HIIT): HIIT involves alternating short periods of intense exercise with brief periods of active recovery. This type of training has been shown to increase fat burning and improve cardiovascular health. d. Nutrition: Consume a balanced diet rich in whole, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and complex carbohydrates. Maintain a caloric deficit by consuming fewer calories than you burn in a day. e. Patience and consistency: Remember that losing fat takes time and consistent effort. Focus on creating healthy habits and maintain a long-term perspective on fitness and weight loss. In summary, the two questions are different as one is primarily concerned with the better exercise modality for burning fat (walking or running), while the other focuses on losing fat from specific body regions (thighs and hips). In both cases, creating a calorie deficit through a combination of regular exercise and a healthy diet is crucial for successful and sustainable fat loss."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: In a rematch of their only loss so far this season, the Patriots faced the Buffalo Bills in a road game. After taking the opening kick, the Bills raced 70 yards all the way to the Patriots 5, but the Patriots defense kept Buffalo out of the end zone, forcing them to kick a 23-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Walt Powell forced Matthew Slater to fumble, but Shea McClellin recovered for the Patriots at their own 30. The Patriots drained over half of the remainder of the first quarter, going 70 yards to score on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Amendola. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots were given good field at the Bills 45. An offensive pass interference penalty on Amendola moved the ball back to the Patriots 45, but a holding penalty on Robert Blanton of the Bills moved the ball to mid field. A two-yard run by Blount and incomplete pass brought up a 3rd-and-8 from the Bills 48, and Brady hit Edelman with a 47-yard bomb to the 1-yard line, but the gain was nullified on an ineligible man downfield penalty on Marcus Cannon moving the ball back to the Patriots 47. Then Brady hit Hogan on a 53-yard touchdown bomb, increasing the lead to 14-3. Four possessions later, the Bills raced 59 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on a Mike Gillislee 3-yard touchdown rush. After Amendola returned the ball 24 yards to the Patriots 21, the Patriots countered, using just four plays and Brady found Gronkowski on a 53-yard touchdown, increasing the lead to 21-10. The Bills raced 44 yards in 11 plays to the Patriots 31 on their ensuing possession, but Carpenter missed a 49-yard field goal after it hit the upright. Taking over at their own 39, a 6-yard pass to White, a 15-yard pass to Amendola, and a 7-yard pass to Edelman led the Patriot to Bills 33 and Gostkowski kicked a 51-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 24-10 lead at halftime. Amendola kicked off the second half with fireworks, returning the kick 73 yards to the Bills 24. Two plays later, Brady hit Edelman for a 12-yard touchdown pass, extending the lead to 31-10. The Bills didn't quit, though, using a marathon 75-yard, six minute drive, concluding with Taylor splitting the defense for a 26-yard touchdown run, making it a game again with a 31-17 score. The Patriots countered right back, engineering an 11-play, 75-yard drive with LeGarrette Blount chalking up a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 38-17 late in the third quarter. Using Reggie Bush 35 yard kick return, the Bills drove 50 yards to the Patriots 10 in just 4 plays, but on the first play of the fourth quarter, a Taylor pass bounced off the fingertips of Charles Clay and the Bills turned the ball over on downs. The Patriots put the game away on their next drive, marching 76-yards in 13 plays, taking 7:49 off the clock, with Gostkowski adding a 32-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 41-17 lead with just 7:06 remaining in the game. The Bills drove 52 yards to the Patriots 32 on their next drive, but turned the ball over on downs when Robert Woods was tackled 1-yard short of the first down by Malcolm Butler. The Bills forced a Patriots punt and raced 66 yards in 6 plays, scoring a touchdown on a 1-yard touchdown run by Jonathan Williams with a two-point conversion on a two-yard pass from backup quarterback EJ Manuel to Nick O'Leary trimming the score to 41-25, but only 0:30 remained. After recovering the onside kick, the Patriots took a knee to win the game. Brady was 22/33 for 315 yards and had four touchdown passes to four different receivers (Danny Amendola, Chris Hogan, Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman); LeGarette Blount added a running touchdown and Stephen Gostkowski a field goal. Heading into their bye week, the Patriots improved to 7-1, the best record in the league. Which players caught touchdown passes from Tom Brady in the first half?","output":"In the first half of the game, Tom Brady threw touchdown passes to the following players: Danny Amendola, Chris Hogan, and Rob Gronkowski. Amendola caught a 9-yard touchdown pass, Hogan scored on a 53-yard touchdown bomb, and Gronkowski secured a 53-yard touchdown as well. These plays contributed to the Patriots' 24-10 lead at halftime."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
