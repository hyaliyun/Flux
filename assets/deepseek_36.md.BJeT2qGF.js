Bryant, 37, made his announcement in the form of a short poem titled “Dear Basketball” on The Players’ Tribune, a website founded by the former Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter that publishes first-person narratives from athletes. In short verses of unadorned language, Bryant recalled falling in love with the game of basketball as a child and growing up as a fan of the Lakers. You gave a six-year-old boy his Laker dream And I’ll always love you for it. But I can’t love you obsessively for much longer. This season is all I have left to give. My heart can take the pounding My mind can handle the grind But my body knows it’s time to say goodbye. Bryant had said on numerous occasions in recent months that this season was likely to be his last one — though he always qualified those statements, saying that he could change his mind. After playing in just 41 of 164 Lakers games in the previous two seasons because of a succession of injuries, he has looked like a diminished version of himself this season, producing poor numbers in most statistical categories. In a statement Sunday night, N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver called Bryant “one of the greatest players in the history of our game.” Silver added, “I join Kobe’s millions of fans around the world in congratulating him on an outstanding N.B.A. career and thank him for so many thrilling memories.” Bryant was 17 years old when he was picked 13th over all in the 1996 draft by the Charlotte Hornets, who promptly traded him to the Lakers, the only organization for which he has played in his professional career. He has won five N.B.A. titles and two Olympic gold medals, has been named to 17 All-Star teams and was voted the league’s most valuable player in 2008. He ranks third on the N.B.A.’s career scoring list, behind only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone. For all Bryant’s success, he will leave a somewhat complicated legacy. He will be remembered as one of the best scorers in the history of the game, but he was also known as a difficult and demanding teammate. In 2003, he was accused of sexual assault in Colorado. He pleaded not guilty, and the charges were eventually dropped. Bryant is in the final year of a two-year contract with the Lakers and will earn 25 million in salary, making him the league’s highest-paid player this season. Even before this formal announcement, Bryant was receiving loud ovations in arenas around the country. In Brooklyn this month, Bryant joked that he preferred the typical hostility of opposing crowds. He said then that he did not want the season to turn into a prolonged, gushing farewell tour. But Bryant, after a celebrated career, may not have much of a choice.

Hypothesis: The two animals sit alone. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The premise states that \\"a large brown dog is pushing a small Boston terrier with his face while another dog watches.\\" This premise clearly describes a scene involving three dogs—the large brown dog pushing the small Boston terrier and another dog observing the situation. On the other hand, the hypothesis put forth is that \\"the two animals sit alone.\\" One possible interpretation is that the hypothesis aims to describe a situation where there are only two (unspecified) animals present, and they are alone, which would mean no other animals or beings are with them. Given that the premise involves three dogs, if we were to consider this interpretation, the hypothesis does not hold true in the context of the premise. Considering another interpretation of the hypothesis, if we assume that \\"the two animals sit alone\\" refers to the two dogs that are actively interacting (i.e., the large brown dog and the small Boston terrier), even under this interpretation, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true. This is because, according to the premise, there is still another dog watching the interaction. Therefore, these two dogs are not \\"alone,\\" and the hypothesis is still not true in the context of the premise. In conclusion, the hypothesis does not hold true, given that the premise involves three dogs, while the hypothesis refers to either two animals being alone or two specific animals sitting alone, in which neither situation matches the scenario depicted in the premise."},{"instruction":"Ask a question about Race (human categorization).","output":"What factors contribute to the development and continued existence of race as a form of human categorization, and how does it affect societal dynamics and individual experiences? Race, as a form of human categorization, is a complex, multi-faceted concept that has evolved over time, and has been used to differentiate and classify individuals based on their perceived physical, genetic, and cultural differences. Various factors contribute to the development and perpetuation of race as a concept, including historical developments, social constructions, and psychological factors. Understanding these factors sheds light on the ways in which race influences societal dynamics and individual experiences. 1. Historical Developments: The concept of race has its roots in historical developments, such as colonialism and European exploration. As Europeans encountered other societies and cultures, they began to classify and rank people based on the perceived differences in physical appearance, language, religion, and customs. This had significant consequences, as societies were organized hierarchically, with those classified as racially superior often dominating and oppressing those considered racially inferior. 2. Social Constructions: Race is a socially constructed idea, meaning that it is created and maintained by society through continuous reinforcement of certain patterns of behavior, norms, and beliefs. Race is not a fixed, immutable category determined solely by genetics or biology; rather, it is a fluid and evolving concept that changes based on varying historical and social contexts. Institutions, such as schools, government agencies, and the media, play a crucial role in shaping and reinforcing racial classifications and beliefs through various means, such as discriminatory policies, curriculum and textbook content, and representation in the media. 3. Psychological Factors: Racial categorization has powerful psychological implications, as individuals tend to create and maintain in-group and out-group distinctions based on perceived racial differences. These distinctions often lead to the formation of stereotypes and biases, which can subsequently impact an individual's behavior, perception, and decision-making. Social identity theory postulates that individuals derive a sense of belonging and self-esteem from their group memberships, and as such, may engage in behaviors that preserve and enhance their group's status. This can lead to the perpetuation of racial categories and the reinforcement of racial biases and discrimination. The continued existence of race as a form of human categorization has significant effects on both society and individual experiences. Although race is a social construct, it continues to have real-world implications, such as racial disparities in health, income, education, and criminal justice. Individuals may experience microaggressions, racial prejudice, and discrimination based on their ascribed racial category, which can have negative impacts on their psychological well-being, interpersonal relationships, and opportunities in life. Moreover, race affects societal dynamics by perpetuating patterns of inequality, prejudice, and division. Racial categorization can reinforce social hierarchies, as historical power relations continue to shape current social structures. A deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to the development and perpetuation of race as a human categorization, and its effects on societal dynamics and individual experiences, can help challenge and dismantle systems of racism and promote a more inclusive and equal society."},{"instruction":"Continue the following story. The woman put away the milk and placed the butter on the countertop, because the","output":"beaten eggs in the bowl were waiting to be enriched. She had been working tirelessly in her kitchen to prepare the family's favorite dessert - vanilla pound cake. Recognizing the need to all ingredients blend perfectly and at the right temperature, she took out her whisk and brought the eggs closer. She eyed the stick of butter on the counter and decided it was time to incorporate it into the beaten eggs. Heating slightly the butter to make it soft was the first step. It was necessary because soft butter can be easily mixed with the beaten eggs. It also forms an emulsion which can trap air and with the help of baking powder, the cake will rise well when it's baked. While the butter was heating, she cleaned the leftover milk carton and put it into the recycling bin. She believed in maintaining a neat and organized kitchen even while cooking, leading to more efficient progress and reducing any possible confusion. Now the butter was perfectly soft, she slowly added it into the beaten eggs, whisking continuously. This was needed to ensure the butter and beaten eggs integrated smoothly, avoiding any lumps that could spoil the texture of the pound cake. The scent of the mixture was pleasing - a delicious combination of butter and eggs. Now it was time to add the sugar and vanilla extract. These were the key elements in achieving that characteristic sweet, rich vanilla flavor of the pound cake. She measured and poured the vanilla extract and sugar carefully into the bowl, making sure of the precise proportions required. Parallelly, she preheated the oven, setting it at the right temperature to bake the pound cake properly. Preheating the oven is an essential step as it provides the correct and consistent temperature required to bake the cake. Ensuring all ingredients are at the right proportion and maintaining the process flow properly, the joyful woman continued baking her family's favorite dessert. There was something undoubtedly pleasing about creating something from scratch, something that would bring a bright smile to everyone's face. She found her happiness in these small activities, which encapsulated the essence of her love and care for her family."},{"instruction":"Fact 1: Some viruses live in a dormant state inside the body.

However, he is despised by Aunt Marion (Sylvia Sidney), who favors Mark and thinks Damien a bad influence, even threatening to cut Richard out of her will if he does not separate the two boys. The same night, the appearance of a raven wakes her up and causes a fatal heart attack.Through a friend, Dr. Charles Warren (Nicholas Pryor), who is the curator of the Thorn Museum, Richard is introduced to journalist Joan Hart (Elizabeth Shephard), who was a colleague of Keith Jennings (from the previous film). Having seen Yigael's Wall and drawing a link to all the deaths that surrounded Damien, including Jennings', Joan tries to warn Richard but he throws her out of his limo. After a confrontation with Warren and Ann Thorn at the Thorn Museum, Joan became unsure on whether Damien's face matches the painting on Yigael's Wall. Joan goes to meet Damien at his school, but when she sees his face she drives off in panic. On the road, her car mysteriously dies down. When she gets out of the car, she is attacked by a raven, which pecks her eyes out, causing her to be run over by a passing truck.A few months later at Thorn...","output":"Can't answer"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The oxygen travels into the body - Breaks down into glucose - Carbon dioxide is produced by the glucose breakdown - The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body through the nose or mouth. Answer:","output":"The missing first step in the process you've provided is \\"Inhalation of oxygen through the nose or mouth.\\" The detailed process with the correct order of events is as follows: 1. Inhalation of oxygen through the nose or mouth: The process begins with the inhalation of oxygen-rich air through the nostrils or mouth. When we breathe in, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles between the ribs contract, causing the lungs to expand and draw in air. 2. The oxygen travels into the body: Once the oxygen enters the respiratory system, it travels through the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles before reaching the alveoli, which are small air sacs within the lungs. Here, the oxygen diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli and into the surrounding capillaries. The oxygen then binds to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells, which transport it throughout the body via the circulatory system. 3. Breaks down into glucose: Within the body's cells, oxygen plays a crucial role in the process of cellular respiration. Specifically, it supports the breakdown of glucose, a sugar molecule, in a sequence of chemical reactions called glycolysis. Glycolysis produces pyruvate and a small amount of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is used as a source of energy by cells. 4. Carbon dioxide is produced by the glucose breakdown: During cellular respiration, oxygen combines with hydrogen to form water, and carbon dioxide is produced as a byproduct. This happens within the mitochondria of the cells, where aerobic respiration takes place. The pyruvate generated during glycolysis is transformed into a molecule called Acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle). The citric acid cycle produces more ATP, as well as additional carbon dioxide, which is released as a waste product. 5. The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body through the nose or mouth: Carbon dioxide produced by cellular respiration as a byproduct is transported back to the lungs through the bloodstream, where it dissolves in the plasma and diffuses across the alveolar wall into the alveolar space. As the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, the lungs contract, causing the chest cavity to decrease in size and forcing the carbon dioxide-rich air to exit the body through the nose or mouth during exhalation. In summary, the missing first step is the inhalation of oxygen-rich air through the nose or mouth. This step initiates the process of cellular respiration, which breaks down glucose, produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct, and eventually leads to the expulsion of carbon dioxide from the body through exhalation."},{"instruction":"@huddlesuz I love your new avatar.

Gathering initially as part of a practical joke, members of \\"The Vicious Circle\\", as they dubbed themselves, met for lunch each day at the Algonquin Hotel from 1919 until roughly 1929. At these luncheons they engaged in wisecracks, wordplay, and witticisms that, through the newspaper columns of Round Table members, were disseminated across the country. Daily association with each other, both at the luncheons and outside of them, inspired members of the Circle to collaborate creatively. Context: In addition to the daily luncheons, members of the Round Table worked and associated with each other almost constantly. The group was devoted to games, including cribbage and poker. The group had its own poker club, the Thanatopsis Literary and Inside Straight Club, which met at the hotel on Saturday nights. Regulars at the game included Kaufman, Adams, Broun, Ross and Woollcott, with non-Round Tablers Herbert Bayard Swope, silk merchant Paul Hyde Bonner, baking heir Raoul Fleischmann, actor Harpo Marx, and writer Ring Lardner sometimes sitting in. The group also played charades (which they called simply \\"The Game\\") and the \\"I can give you a sentence\\" game, which spawned Dorothy Parker's memorable sentence using the word horticulture: \\"You can lead a horticulture but you can't make her think.\\" Members often visited Neshobe Island, a private island co-owned by several \\"Algonks\\"--but governed by Woollcott as a \\"benevolent tyrant\\", as his biographer Samuel Hopkins Adams charitably put it--located on several acres in the middle of Lake Bomoseen in Vermont. There they would engage in their usual array of games including Wink murder, which they called simply \\"Murder\\", plus croquet. A number of Round Tablers were inveterate practical jokers, constantly pulling pranks on one another. As time went on the jokes became ever more elaborate. Harold Ross and Jane Grant once spent weeks playing a particularly memorable joke on Woollcott involving a prized portrait of himself. They had several copies made, each slightly more askew than the last, and would periodically secretly swap them out and then later comment to Woollcott \\"What on earth is wrong with your portrait?\\" until Woollcott was beside himself.

After the author brought her the commode; Q: I used to work as a Certified Nurse Assistant at this rehabilitation/skilled nursing facility. I just started my shift that afternoon, got endorsements from the previous shift, and prepared myself to meet my residents. One of my residents that day was post-op total knee replacement. I went to her room, introduced myself as her CNA, and asked her if she needed anything before I leave her room. And then, she told me she’s having a hard time using the commode the previous nurses gave her when she was admitted to our facilty as it was very small for her given the fact that she also had a recent TKA (total knee arthroplasty). Because of this, I told her I’ll do my best to look for a commode that will fit her. I looked in our two storage areas and fortunately, I found one that was perfect for her! Voila! I disinfected it really well and returned to her room with her new commode. Her face immediately lighted up when she saw what I was carrying and she started tearing up! Startled by her reaction, I asked her what’s wrong and why was she crying. And then she told me she’s been asking the previous shifts for two days and no one’s bringing the right commode for her. They kept on telling they’re going to bring her a new one, but they probably ended up forgetting her request. She was so ecstatic! I helped her try the commode and it really was perfect for her and she didn’t have a hard time using it. She thanked me so much, and oh, it was mother’s day that day!

He helped transform the famed fashionista into Frances, a stylish but approachable suburban mommy. “[Parker] had a strong idea of what she wanted [the character] to be,” Bhasin says, “but she was extremely open to what I wanted to do in terms of color palette and silhouette.” To get Frances’ authentic working-mom style, Bhasin and Parker turned to films of the 1970s, such as “Annie Hall” and “An Unmarried Woman,” which portrayed independent Manhattan women in swaggering separates, tweed blazers and dramatic camel-colored coats. That meant none of Bradshaw’s trademark Manolo Blahnik heels or Dolce & Gabbana frocks. “We decided early in the process that we wouldn’t do a lot of big-name-brand fashion shopping,” says Bhasin, who found the character’s ’70s print blouses, ’80s silk dresses and worn-leather accessories at flea markets and vintage shops throughout the country. “We wanted these to be clothes that a woman would have in her closet for years, so they had to look lived-in to give a sense of history for her character,” Bhasin says. He cites Frances’ classic dusty-pink overcoat as a particular example. “The idea of a coat for a woman in New York is so important,” he says. “It’s what you wear when you’re dealing with the elements . . . that coat is [Frances’] favorite — she wears it every day. We would build entire looks around [it].” Bhasin, however, also had to make sure the clothes told the character’s story. “Subdued and muted” colors — beige, brown, dark plum — show Frances’ melancholy, but he would often throw in busy prints to shake things up. “It conveys the inner turmoil and confusion going on in the character’s life,” Bhasin adds. “She has a lot going on in her mind.” Still, relying solely on vintage finds had its challenges. For a scene in which Frances goes to an art gallery, the petite Parker is wearing a 1980s white silk Ungaro dress with an abstract black print that Bhasin found at a flea market — in size 16. “I had to cut the whole thing down to make it fit her!” he says. “But it’s my favorite look from the whole show.” Title:","output":"\\"Sarah Jessica Parker's New Mommy Style in 'Divorce'\\""},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be given a sentence or two along with a change aspect.

Francesca Infante. PUBLISHED:. 04:07 EST, 21 September 2013. |. UPDATED:. 19:02 EST, 21 September 2013. Rising up: Carole, pictured after visiting her grandson George for the first time at St Mary's Hospital in London, has long been seen to have aristocratic aspirations. The agonies of how to design a new family coat of arms is one no doubt familiar to every aspirational family. So it can come as no surprise that faced with such a challenge the astute former air stewardess Carole Middleton - mother of the Duchess of Cambridge - sought the advice of those valued by other great British families - even those that don't actually exist. Downton Abbey has been revealed as the unlikely source of inspiration as the socially mobile Mrs Middleton set out to design her family crest in the run up to the 2011 royal wedding. The family even went to Highclere Castle, the set for ITV's award winning period drama, to meet etiquette expert historian Alastair Bruce who advises the show on social protocol. They were so delighted by the royal equerry's knowledge they asked him for help with the design of their own crest which was later used to adorn the programme at the Royal Wedding in April 2011. Mr Bruce, 53, is an expert on protocol and advises the actors and production team on the set of the show to make sure every aspect of every scene is historically accurate. Affectionately nicknamed the Oracle he has been known to stop filming because he spotted that the 'wrong' shoebrush was being used to shine some boots and is often found pacing the length of the Downton dining room adjusting cutlery and pleading with actors to keep their hands off the table. A source told The Sun: 'Alastair is also a Queen's Herald, so he has a lot of experience. 'But I'm sure people will be amused to know the Middletons looked to Downton Abbey for help in coming up with the coat of arms.' Although as a royal bride Kate would have been entitled to apply for a heraldic design in her own right, it was decided that her parents would commission one. How it might have been: Had she been without the help of her aristocratic advisors this is how the Middleton crest might have turned out. A high-class line-up: The cast of the popular show Downton Abbey. Painstaking process: After much discussion about the design Herald Painter Robert Parsons, sketches the Coat of Arms for the Middleton family. Coats of Arms came into being during medieval tournaments like jousting when knights would be recognised by the motifs on their shields or helmets and heralds quickly learnt the different ones in use, taking up responsibility for the control of their use.Over time their use began to decline in competition and battle but they became more widely used in society.The College of Arms, a branch of the Royal household, is the official body in the UK that deals with coats of arms and their team of experts - funded by the fees they charge and not taxpayers money - design and research heraldic or genealogical issues.The arms are given for free while the money people pay is for the research and design of the coat of arms.However, that doesn't mean that just anybody can pay the fee and get a coat of arms. The cumulative knowledge of the Earl Marshal gathered over hundreds of years has given them the skill of tactfully suggesting that people don't proceed with their application.The late Peter Gwynn-Jones, a former Garter King of Arms, once said: 'In practice, eligibility depends upon holding a civil or military commission, a sound university degree or professional qualification, or having achieved some measure of distinction in a field beneficial to society as a whole.' This gives his entire family – including their other children, Pippa, 30, and James, 26, the right to use the emblem. They met with Mr Bruce and his colleague Thomas Woodcock the College of Arms Garter Principle King of Arms and Senior Herald to invent their crest. Together they settled on a simple design, with three leafy acorns representing each of the couple’s three children – an idea suggested by Kate herself. Acorns were chosen for the analogy that they grow into great oaks. Oak is also a symbol of England and strength, and West Berkshire, where the children were brought up, has many oak trees. Most eye-catching is the gold chevron in the centre of the design representing Kate’s mother, Carole, at the heart of her family with the colour a subtle reference to her maiden name, Goldsmith. The two thin white chevronels on either side allude to mountains and the family’s love of skiing and outdoor pursuits. The background colours of red and blue were chosen as they are the principle colours from the flag of the United Kingdom and match Prince William’s recently revised coat of arms. The College of Arms also likes to include a pun wherever possible and has made the two colours meet squarely in the centre as a play on the words ‘middle tone’. But while Kate's brother James will be able to pass down the coat of arms to his children Pippa, as a woman, will not and can only use it during her lifetime. Yesterday a spokesman for Downton Abbey confirmed: 'Alastair worked with the Garter Principal King of Arms on developing the Middleton crest.' Royal wedding programme: Prince William's coat of arms was printed on the front while Kate's, designed in complimentary colours, decorated the back. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article discusses how Carole Middleton, mother of the Duchess of Cambridge, sought inspiration from the popular British TV show Downton Abbey to design her family's coat of arms before the royal wedding in 2011. The Middletons consulted Alastair Bruce, a protocol expert and an advisor on social protocol for Downton Abbey, for assistance with their emblem design. The final design features three acorns, representing the couple's three children, and a gold chevron symbolizing Carole Middleton. The colors red and blue were chosen as they are the main colors from the flag of the United Kingdom, and also match Prince William's revised coat of arms."},{"instruction":"Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What genres are defined chiefly by lyrical focus?, using the article: The term \\"Viking metal\\" has sometimes been used as a nickname for the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, which was \\"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies\\". It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial. Thus, Viking metal is more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a certain sound. Ashby and Schofield write that \\"The term 'Viking metal' is one of many that falls within a complex web of genres and subgenres, the precise form of which is constantly..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The answer is that Viking metal and pagan metal genres are defined chiefly by their lyrical focus. These genres are more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a specific musical style, and any musical categorizations of these two styles are controversial. Their identification primarily comes from the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers, and especially, the song lyrics that feature evident Viking and pagan themes."},{"instruction":"Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: No data Sensitization","output":"\\"No data sensitization.\\" It appears that you have provided a short phrase that may be lacking context.

After 6 weeks, how many more weeks will Rex need to continue taking lessons to reach his goal? Your thoughts:","output":"To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step. 1. Rex wants to take 40 hour-long lessons in total. 2. He is having two-hour sessions twice a week, which means he takes 4 hours of lessons per week (2 hours x 2 days). 3. After 6 weeks, Rex has taken 24 hours of lessons (4 hours x 6 weeks). Now, let's find out how many more hours of lessons Rex needs to take to reach his goal. 4. Rex has 16 hours of lessons left (40 hours - 24 hours). Now, let's calculate how many more weeks Rex needs to continue taking lessons to reach his goal. 5. Since Rex takes 4 hours of lessons per week, we need to divide the remaining hours by 4 hours/week to find out how many more weeks he needs. 6.

It is unclear whether they had their own structure during the Latin Era or if they were under the Latin Church of Cyprus, as has been the case since the Ottoman Era. During the Ottoman Era, there was a very limited conversion of Armenian Orthodox to Catholicism, mainly due to the proselytising activities of the Franciscan mission in Nicosia and Larnaca, especially during the 17th and 18th centuries; however, these must have been temporary apostasies and their number never exceeded 50 at any given time. In 1794 the small Armenian Catholic community of Larnaca was granted some holy chalices from the auction of the belongings of the old Capuchin monastery of the town. It was during the British Era that the Armenian-Catholic community increased in number, due to the arrival of a large number of refugees from the Armenian Genocide. In 1931, there were about 200 Armenian-Catholics in Cyprus most of them became attached to the Latin places of worship, especially the Holy Cross cathedral in Nicosia and Saint Joseph's convent in Larnaca; between 1921-1923, the latter housed a small Armenian-Catholic school, run by Abbot Jean Kouyoumdjian - who served at the convent between 1921-1928. In 1960, there were less than 100 Armenian-Catholics. However, their number decreased in the following years, due to emigration to other countries and assimilation with the Armenian-Cypriot, the Latin-Cypriot and/or the Greek-Cypriot community. However, due to the influx of Lebanese-Armenians to Cyprus since the mid-1970s, there has been a small increase in the number of Armenian-Catholics on the island.

A study in the Journal of Mammalogy has found that at least seven species of toothed whales—including killer, sperm, and short-finned pilot whales, as well as four dolphin varieties—have been found swimming close by and touching and pushing the bodies of dead younger whales, offering evidence that they mourn their young when they die, National Geographic reports. \\"They are in pain and stressed,\\" says study co-author Melissa Reggente. \\"They know something is wrong.\\" The findings add these marine mammals to other animal species—including elephants, giraffes, and chimps—that have been witnessed exhibiting grieving-type behavior. The scientists involved with this study examined (mostly unpublished) reports pertaining to these seven species and their apparent mourning habits in three different oceans, observed by other researchers on the open water. One scientific expedition in the Red Sea, for example, witnessed an Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin push the corpse of a smaller dolphin through the water; another case showed a female killer whale carrying a deceased newborn whale in her mouth. The researchers noted these cases involved an adult grieving for a calf or juvenile whale and that they were probably related. While it may be tempting to say the whales were just acting out of curiosity or couldn't turn off their nurturing instincts, National Geographic points out that following a dead whale like this can put the living whale in peril because it's not eating or maintaining social relationships with other whales. Instead, researchers say, the study lends credence to the fact that \\"adults mourning their dead young is a common and globally widespread behavior in long-lived and highly sociable/cohesive species of mammals.\\" (Sperm whales can also use their heads as battering rams.)

Whales like killer whales, sperm whales, and some dolphins have been seen swimming close to their dead babies and even touching them, as if they are mourning for them. This is similar to how some other animals, like elephants, giraffes, and monkeys, also show sadness when someone in their family dies. The scientists who studied this looked at stories about different whales and dolphins who seemed to be grieving in different parts of the ocean. They found that usually, it was a grown-up whale looking after a baby or young whale that had died, and they were probably related to each other. This also makes sense because whales and dolphins are known for being social animals that like to live together in groups and take care of each other. Some people might think that the whales are just curious or can't stop their natural instinct to take care of their babies, but the researchers say that's not likely. When a whale spends its time caring for a dead baby, it means that it's not eating or spending time with other whales, which can be dangerous for it. So, it seems that whales really do feel sad and care about their lost babies, just like we do with our loved ones who pass away."},{"instruction":"Write a short summary for this text: american rider christian vande velde fell and broke two ribs on a downhill section during the third stage of the giro d'italia and withdrew from the race .","output":"During the third stage of the renowned Giro d'Italia cycling race, American rider Christian Vande Velde encountered an unfortunate accident.

His funeral in New York was attended by 250,000 people, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page. Close Italian police said the unsolved murder of legendary New York Police Department Lieutenant Joe Petrosino in 1909 is still a badge of honor among suspected mobsters in Sicily. Wiretaps recorded a conversation in which Domenico Palazzotto, a 28-year-old arrested today along with 90 others on charges ranging from extortion to vote buying, boasted that an ancestor of his killed Petrosino, police said in a statement e-mailed today. Paolo Palazzotto, tried last century and eventually acquitted due to a lack of evidence, committed the murder, prosecutors cite Domenico Palazzotto as saying. Petrosino was on duty investigating the mafia in Italy when he was killed. His funeral in New York was attended by 250,000 people, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page. Domenico Palazzotto was born in Palermo, Sicily, where he still lives. Domenico Palazzotto, “as evidence of his own more than 100-year mafia pedigree, guaranteed by his descent from Paolo Palazzotto, confirmed the murder as the work of his own relative,” police said in the statement. Calls to the office of the Palermo prosecutor in an attempt to contact Palazzotto or identify his attorney went unanswered.

Italian police said that an alleged mobster has accidentally revealed the identity of the long-sought killer of New York detective Joseph Petrosino. In a taped conversation underscoring the long-running, tight family ties that characterise Mafia clans, Domenico Palazzotto claimed it was his great-uncle who gunned down the NYPD Lieutenant in Palermo in 1909. \\"My father's uncle, whose name was Paolo Palazzotto, was responsible for the first policeman killed in Palermo,\\" Palazzotto was heard saying as he bragged about his family's criminal history with fellow mobsters. \\"He killed Joe Petrosino, on behalf of Cascio Ferro\\". Palazzotto was among 95 suspected Mafiosi held by Italian police in a massive operation codenamed Apocalypse. The tape transcript was included in the arrest warrant. Petrosino was the first NYPD officer ever to be killed on foreign soil whilst on duty. He was shot four times by unknown attackers upon leaving a restaurant in central Palermo, where he was supposed to meet an informant. The police lieutenant was in the Sicilian capital on a special mission to investigate criminal ties between Cosa Nostra and its increasingly powerful American counterpart, the Black Hand. In particular, Petrosino was to collect evidence against Black Hand's alleged boss Vito Cascio Ferro, who had gone into hiding in his native Sicily after being acquitted from murder charges in the US a few years earlier. Celebrity detective Petrosino was a celebrity detective at the time of his dispatch to Sicily. A tireless worker famous for his tough investigating methods, the Italian native had been extremely successful in fighting gangs of fellow Italian migrants responsible for a wave of violent crimes that hit New York at the beginning of the 20th century. His knowledge of the Italian community and language had proved vital to police, since some 500,000 Italians lived in NYC at the time, more than in any other city in the world but Naples. In 1908 then Police Commission Theodore Roosevelt had appointed him as the head of an all-Italian elite detective squad tasked with investigating the migrant underworld. The squad's main target were indeed Vito Cascio Ferro and his Black Hand group, which, according to police, ran a series of trafficking rings and was responsible for many murders. Its members had also been accused of blackmailing the world famous Italian tenor Enrico Caruso, demanding money in exchange of his life. Paolo Palazzotto was among the members of the Black Hand who were arrested by the Italian squad and deported back to Italy. In February 1909 Petrosino decided to travel to Sicily to collect evidence against Cascio Ferro, despite being advised against it over fears for his safety. Although his mission was supposed to be secret, details had been published in the American press a few days prior to his departure. Two days after his murder the New York Times wrote that the American ambassador warned Petrosino about the risks of his trip, but the detective \\"smiled, as a man feeling sure of himself who did not mind the danger.\\" More than 200,000 people showed up to pay tribute to the policeman at his funerals in New York. Cascio Ferro was eventually accused of having ordered the murder but was acquitted due to lack of evidence. He was arrested on separate murder charges in May 1925, and died in a Palermo jail 20 years later. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Legendary New York Police Department Lieutenant Joe Petrosino was on duty investigating the mafia in Italy when he was killed in 1909.

Chemical signatures found in hardy microscopic crystals called zircons point to a beginning about 4.1 billion years ago. But finding fossilized remains of microbes—undoubtedly the creature of the day—is a far more difficult task. Now, scientists say they have identified fossilized microbial mats, called stromatolites, in Greenland that date to about 3.7 billion years ago—nearly 300 million years older than the previous fossil record holder. The find may help guide scientists searching for life on other planets. “It’s pretty impressive that anything remotely like a stromatolite is being found [in these rocks],” says Abigail Allwood, a geologist with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who was not involved in the study. “It’s another opportunity for us to sharpen our skills and develop rigorous techniques for the search for life.” Earth was a tempestuous place during the Archean Eon, the name geologists give to the planet’s second act, which lasted from about 4 billion to 2.5 billion years ago. At its start, Earth was just half-a-billion years old and still fiery with remnant heat from its formation. Volcanoes were abundant, and the planet was likely too hot for plate tectonics, which may not have existed for another few hundred million years. Asteroids bombarded its surface. The atmosphere was a heady brew of methane and ammonia, with no free oxygen. The sun was fainter, shining at only about 75% of its current brightness. If any hardy life did manage to succeed during that time, finding its traces in the Archean rock record seems unlikely. There are few outcrops of Archean rock on Earth, and they tend to be heavily metamorphosed—twisted and deeply altered by heat and pressure. Yet there have been some lucky finds: evidence for 3.4-billion-year-old fossil cells on an ancient Australian shoreline and, famously, 3.4-billion-year-old stromatolites in western Australia’s Strelley Pool Chert, which Allwood identified in 2006. But the oldest known rocks on Earth are in Greenland, where a formation known as the Isua supracrustal belt (ISB) dates to between 3.7 billion and 3.8 billion years old. Scientists have pored over the belt for signs of life, but until now found only indirect evidence—chemical signatures of carbon and sulfur isotopes that might have been the handiwork of microbes. To find more direct evidence, scientists searched for rocks untouched—or at least less altered by—metamorphism. That’s a needle-in-a-haystack sort of hunt, but a team led by geologist Allen Nutman of the University of Wollongong in Australia reports online this week in Nature that is has finally struck pay dirt, thanks to an unseasonably early spring rainfall that washed away the snow from a promising, largely unmetamorphosed ISB outcrop in Greenland. “This region just happened to avoid strong changes just by luck,” says Martin Van Kranendonk, a geologist at the University of New South Wales, Kensington, in Australia and a co-author on the paper. The new outcrops included two sites with distinctive shapes—cones and peaks made up of thin, regular internal layers. The shapes are set against a distinctive background in the rock with a different texture and chemical makeup, the team reports. Further analyses of rare-earth elements suggest that the rocks were deposited in shallow ocean waters—just like modern microbial mats made by bacteria living in today’s oceans. Taken together, the team says, the evidence points strongly to a microbial origin for the structures—and that would make them the oldest fossilized life yet discovered on Earth. Allwood agrees that the shapes are suggestive and interesting. But, she cautions, “it’s a chalk and cheese comparison with the stromatolites of western Australia—which are controversial in themselves.” Convincing scientists that the 3.4-billion-year-old western Australia stromatolites were made by microbes was a “hard sell,” she says. But those structures are at least widespread, spread out across 10 kilometers of outcrop. The new discoveries are tiny, with few structures to study, she notes. And although the overall shapes of the stromatolites have survived—perhaps against all odds—many of the textural and chemical details within them have degraded significantly. Still, Allwood says, the discovery offers a tantalizing new “biosignature” for scientists hunting for signs of past life—whether on Earth or elsewhere. On Mars, for example, scientists are unsure which sites have the best possible chance of finding life, a key target of space exploration vehicles like the Mars rover. Scientists had thought it unlikely that 3.7-billion-year-old rocks on Mars would have hosted life because the Red Planet—like Earth—was just coming out of a period of heavy asteroid bombardment. But if the Greenland structures are biological, Allwood says, they suggest life could have emerged in that time, and that standing bodies of shallow water would be the likeliest place to look. And because Mars lacks plate tectonics, its rocks haven’t been heavily metamorphosed by internal heat and pressure, as they were on Earth. Allwood says that means ancient signs of life might still linger. ||||| Fossils are 220 million years older than any previously found, dating life on Earth to an earlier point than thought and raising questions about life on Mars Scientists have discovered the oldest physical evidence for life on the planet in the form of fossils in Greenland rocks that formed 3.7bn years ago. The researchers believe the structures in the rocks are stromatolites - layered formations, produced by the activity of microbes, that can be found today in extremely saline lagoons in a few locations around the world. The new fossils are 220 million years older than any previously discovered. “Up until now the oldest stromatolites have been from Western Australia and they are roughly 3,500 million (3.5bn) years [old],” said Clark Friend, an independent researcher and co-author of the research. “What we are doing is pushing the discovery of life earlier in Earth’s history.” The discovery, says Friend, also raises questions about the possibility of life on other planets. “If we have got life at 3,700 million (3.7 bn) years on Earth, did it exist on other planets - because Mars, for example, 3,700 million years ago was wet,” he said. Writing in the journal Nature, Friend, together with a team of Australian scientists including his long-term collaborator Allen Nutman of the University of Wollongong, reveal how they discovered what they believe to be stromatolites in rocks of the Isua supracrustal belt in southwest Greenland. With the Earth’s known rock record only extending around 4.2bn years, the site is home to some of the world’s older rocks.

Figure b shows the layers created by microbes as they formed the Greenland stromatolites (blue lines). ‘Stroms’ are several overlapping stromatolites. Photograph: Nature But there is a hitch. Isua rocks are metamorphic - they formed from sedimentary rocks that have been subjected to intense heat and pressure - conditions that typically deform the rocks. That, the authors say, made the discovery of stromatolites something of a surprise. “We were not exactly expecting to see them,” said Friend, who with Nutman has been studying Greenland’s rocks for more than 35 years. Fortunately, the team had a stroke of luck. A snow patch had melted, exposing an outcrop that still contained evidence of features from its sedimentary past. Visible on the surface of the rock, but extending deeper within it, the newly discovered stromatolites are peak-like structures 1-4cm in height; some dome-like, some more akin to the shape of a shark’s tooth. These structure form from a build-up of very thin layers, produced by microbial communities as they trap and bind sediment or cause carbonate to be deposited from surrounding water. “Sediment is being trapped by algae or bacteria, or a combination of both,” said Friend. “You can find similar things in Australia currently forming in Shark Bay.” While the nature of the microbes in question remains unknown, the researchers say they would have had a watery existence. “We know that’s true because the sediments themselves wouldn’t form unless they were in water,” said Friend, adding that other evidence from the rocks suggests that the water was most likely to have been shallow. Nick Lane, an evolutionary biochemist from University College, London, said that the finding ties in with recent revelations that the Hadean - an eon that ended around 4bn years ago - was probably not the hellish environment it was previously thought. “This idea of the Earth as being bombarded by meteorites and, basically, volcanoes and [having] no water, has kind of evaporated so now we have a rather modern-looking planet with global oceans and some land going back several hundred million years before these fossils were found,” said Lane. While Lane says it is surprising to have found stromatolites in the Greenland rocks, he believes the conditions on Earth 3.7bn years ago make it far from astonishing that life could have been present. Indeed, recent discoveries have offered tantalising suggestions that organisms could have been around 4.1bn years ago, while the authors note that so-called “genetic molecular clocks” also suggest that life is likely to have emerged around that time. “This is really just another piece of evidence that suggests that the world was far more comfortable, if you like, for life as we know it on a global scale than you would perhaps read in even quite recent books,” said Lane of the new discovery. But while the authors say the shape of the newly discovered structures, together with clues from their chemical make-up and signs of layers within them, suggests that they were formed by microbes, not everyone is convinced. Robert Riding, of the University of Tennessee says while the similarities of the structures to younger, better-preserved, stromatolites from Australia are intriguing, the poor preservation of the rocks throws doubt on whether the structures were indeed produced by living organisms as opposed to physical processes. “These examples underscore the problem that we really have not yet found sufficiently well-preserved very old - i.e., between 3500 and 4000 million (3.5 and 4bn) year - sediments to be confident that what we are seeing could definitely be regarded as stromatolites,” he said. But, he adds, “It is completely plausible that we could find stromatolites in rocks of Isua age, and perhaps even older, because available evidence suggests that the Earth’s surface at that time already had conditions suitable for microbial life. We just need to find well-preserved sediments of that age to be really sure.” Lewis Dartnell, an astrobiologist at the University of Westminster, says that if the newly discovered structures are indeed stromatolites, the authors have “struck gold” given that plate tectonics and metamorphism of rocks typically destroys such structures. “Trying to understand such ancient life on our own planet is greatly complicated by the geological activity of the Earth, and the destruction of old crust by plate tectonics and metamorphism of rocks that overwrites many signs of life,” he said. “These stromatolites don’t tell us much about the chemistry or environment of how life originally got started on Earth, but they do indicate the presence of biology in a shallow sea 3.7bn years ago.” Dartnell agrees that the discovery could help researchers explore whether life was once present on other planets. “The Martian surface today is very cold and dry, but around the time that these ancient layered rocks formed in Greenland, Mars was itself a much warmer and wetter, and thus habitable planet,” he said. While finding stromatolites with robotic landers or even manned missions is likely to be challenging, says Dartnell, if stromatolites are present, they could offer a wealth of information. “On Mars, we’d expect stromatolites, even as old as 3.5-3.8 billion years, to be better preserved than on Earth as Mars hasn’t experienced geological processes like plate tectonics,” he said. ||||| Image copyright UOW Image caption Life's record: The wavy features were organised by microbrial activity, it is claimed Some of the world’s earliest life forms may have been captured in squiggles found in ancient rocks from Greenland. The rocks were part of the seafloor 3.7 billion years ago, and the wavy lines, just a few centimetres across, would be remnants of primordial microbial colonies called stromatolites. The evidence is presented in the academic journal Nature. If confirmed, the colonies would predate the previously oldest known fossils by over 200 million years. To put that in context, travelling back a similar time from today would be to leap into the world of the first dinosaurs. But all claims of extremely early life are hotly contested, and this find is as well. The find was made in a desolate expanse of uplands that butt up against the Greenland ice cap, called the Isua Supercrustal Belt. The host rocks were exposed only recently after permanent snow cover melted. The region is famous in geoscience because it is the oldest surviving piece of the Earth’s surface. Image copyright SPL Image caption Go to Shark Bay, Australia, today and it is possible to see see modern stromatolites And in the late 1990s, Minik Rosing, a native Greenlander and professor of geology at the Natural History Museum of Denmark, identified chemical traces of life in its rocks – layers of carbon that had evidently once been part of living bacteria (although this interpretation has also been contested). Prof Rosing suggests those bacteria lived in the surface of the ocean, capturing sunlight and photosynthesising, until they died and “rained down” to the seabed. The layers of carbon are interleaved with volcanic ash that may have come from a nearby island. The stromatolites described by Martin van Kranendonk and colleagues in this week’s issue of Nature would have lived in a quite different way. Stromatolites are effectively living rocks formed of mineral grains glued together by sticky, colonial bacteria. They are rare today – the best known are in the harsh waters of Shark Bay, Western Australia, where bacteria slide up through each new layer of sediment washed up by the tides. Similar mounds found in the Western Australian outback are currently the oldest acknowledged fossils on the planet, at 3.48 billion years old. The older examples now claimed for Greenland appear to be remarkably similar, says Prof van Kranendonk, an early-Earth expert at the University of New South Wales. “We see the original unaltered sedimentary layers, and we can see how the stromatolite structures grow up through the sedimentary layering. And we can see the characteristic dome and cone-shaped forms of modern stromatolites.” Image caption Minik Rosing's own claim for ancient life traces at Isua is also contested The fossil structures are overlain by another thick layer of sediment – a sign the bacterial mats were fatally buried by mud or sand, perhaps during a storm. “There’s plenty of evidence this was a shallow-water environment,” Prof van Kranendonk suggests. “We can see the sands and rocks were moved around by energetic waves.” The stromatolites themselves are limestone – precipitated out of the coastal waters by the original microorganisms, more evidence the researchers say that these are truly ancient. There are no traces of the original microbes, only the mounds they built. But that is still incredibly important, says Prof van Kranendonk. “This helps us think about how life developed on Earth, how fast that process was. It pushes everything back a little further, narrows the window between when we know nothing, and when we begin to know something.” Prof Rosing, however, disagrees with almost every aspect of the analysis. The claim, he says, depends on the belief the samples come from a rare, well-preserved part of the original seabed. But since they were first part of the Earth’s surface, the Isua rocks have been twisted, stretched, crushed, and cooked by tectonic forces; the region is a geological “train-wreck” in the words of another geologist. For example, Prof Rosing argues, the carbonate minerals far from being original biological precipitates, were produced far later, by reactions involving scalding soda water deep in the Earth’s crust. The lines showing internal laminations, said to be primordial sedimentary layers, actually show where those waters percolated through the buried rocks. As for the dome- and cone-forms of the fossils, those are typical shapes seen where rocks of different strengths have been squeezed and stretched. “It’s clear from the pictures in the paper that these are highly deformed rocks,” Prof Rosing told the BBC. Image caption Current record: The fossil stromatolites at Pilbara in Australia are about 3.5 billion years old The problem is familiar in early Earth science – so much has happened to the rocks over geological history, it is hard to know what is original and what is an overprint by later processes. Many claims of early fossils have fallen on close examination. Only a few survive the intense scrutiny of peer review. Prof van Kranendonk stands by his argument that amidst the overall punishment suffered by the Greenland rocks, small pockets have survived well preserved – including the outcrop at the heart of this dispute. “They’re just exceptional windows of preservation, which give us the keys to what happened so long ago.” Geobiologist Michael Tice from Texas A&M University, US, who refereed the paper and approved its publication, takes a half-way position. “The trouble with this kind of science is you’re trying to look at life after geology has done all the nastiest things to it. You’re limited by nature. The study is not definitive, but the evidence has passed all the tests they could apply. \\"The point of publication is to stimulate more effort to find other examples.” Prof Rosing agrees that a joint visit to examine the rocks in their original setting in Isua would be the best way to resolve the dispute. And Prof van Kranendonk hopes there may be further examples, older ones even, in the Greenland record. What unites them is the belief that almost as far back as the rock record goes, life had already taken hold on the Earth. And the desire to know more about what that life was like. Prof van Kranendonk can be heard discussing the new find on this week's Science In Action programme on the BBC World Service. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Scientists have discovered 3.7-billion-year-old microbial mats, called stromatolites, in the Isua supracrustal belt in Greenland, which may be the oldest fossilized life discovered on Earth.

It is also influenced by late-1970s funk music, and it contains elements of soul music as well as dance-pop music. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, the song is composed in the key of G minor with a time signature in common time, and a moderate groove of 106 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of D♯4 to F5. The music is largely based on live instrumentation, including a bass guitar, conga, hi-hat, and horns. A non-live instrument, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, provides the song's heavy and energetic disco beat. Spence D. of IGN Music commented that Beyoncé's vocals on the song are \\"silky smooth\\" and that her vocal range leans toward the high end, hence contrasting to the song's low-end construction. Mike Joseph of PopMatters noted that \\"Déjà Vu\\" is reminiscent of Michael Jackson's \\"Off the Wall\\" (1980). The title refers to the déjà vu phenomenon. The lyrics to \\"Déjà Vu\\" follow the verse–pre-chorus–chorus pattern, and feature two rap verses. It is hook-laden, similar in this respect to \\"Crazy in Love\\". The lyrics detail a woman being constantly reminded of a past lover, shown in the lines, \\"Is it because I'm missing you that I'm having déjà vu?\\" As the song opens, Beyoncé introduces the bass, hi-hat and Roland TR-808 by name. The sounds of the instruments blend as they are being mentioned one after the other; the horns are only audible in the pre-chorus and hook sections, and a short section in the second rap. The bass guitar, which is the first instrument to enter, slides into the main two-bar ostinato.

The city transportation officials have been considering various strategies to reduce the number of accidents and improve traffic flow in this particular area. They have identified several factors that might contribute to the high accident rate, including poor visibility, confusing road signs, and a high volume of pedestrians crossing the intersection. In an effort to make a data-driven decision on how to approach the issue, they are collecting information about similar intersections in other cities and the solutions that have been implemented successfully. To gather relevant data, the city transportation officials are analyzing traffic reports, conducting on-site surveys of the accident-prone intersection, and consulting with traffic engineers. They have also reached out to other cities' transportation departments, as well as local universities conducting traffic research, to obtain insight and guidance. Community involvement is another key aspect being considered in this process, as the local government wants to be transparent about its plans and ensure that residents have an opportunity to voice their concerns or ideas. Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that by redesigning the intersection with improved road signs, enhancing visibility, and implementing a pedestrian overpass or underpass, the city can significantly reduce the number of accidents, improve traffic flow, and enhance overall safety for both drivers and pedestrians. Furthermore, this solution will contribute to a decrease in associated economic losses, such as emergency services response and insurance costs, as well as save lives by preventing fatal accidents. To test this hypothesis, the city transportation officials will gather data related to accident rates and traffic flow at the intersection in question, before and after implementing the proposed changes. This data will be systematically collected and analyzed to determine the efficacy of each solution, starting from the most feasible interventions to the ones that require higher costs and complexity. Additionally, the city will closely monitor the cases where similar solutions have been implemented in other jurisdictions to identify any potential challenges, unintended consequences, or best practices that can be incorporated into its own approach. This learning process will help to ensure that the planned interventions are tailored to the specific context of the accident-prone intersection and informed by experiences from elsewhere. Ultimately, if the hypothesis is confirmed, this would lend strong evidence in favor of the proposed solutions as effective ways to minimize accidents and enhance safety in problematic intersections. This success could prompt the local government to extend the implementation of such solutions to other intersections facing similar issues, leading to a more comprehensive strategy for city-wide traffic safety improvements."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: The rare meeting, held in a state room, apparently lasted at least an hour, during which Mr Putin discussed world affairs with the 11 boys. One of the boys present, David Wei, said on Facebook he had sent more than 1,000 emails to set up the meeting. He said Mr Putin, renowned as a tough leader, had shown \\"his human face\\". Photos of the event were posted on social media, showing the group shaking hands with Mr Putin and sitting around a table listening to the Russian leader, wearing translation headsets. Later, they posed for an informal group photo, apparently in an ante room, celebrating their success in gaining access to the Kremlin's inner sanctum.

Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely? Answer:","output":"The assessment seems to be based on the feedback \\"You Are a foolish.\\" This review appears to be negative; however, it is relatively vague and does not detail why the user found the app displeasing. The feedback does not specify if there were major glitches with the app, if it was too challenging to use, if the content was not stimulating or suitable, or any other particular issue. For this reason, it is somewhat challenging to offer a definite judgement about recommending the app to a friend based solely on this review. However, if we consider the disapproval as a general indicator of poor user experience, without more qualitative details about the nature of the issues encountered by the user, I would lean towards \\"Maybe.\\" It's possible that the points that irritated this particular reviewer might not be a problem for another individual. People's app experiences can be quite personal, tied to their preferences, expectations, and the specific way they interact with the software. The critical aspect to consider here is the utility of the app - if the app's concept, services, or functionality seems useful or intriguing, it might be worth giving it a try. Although the review in question is unfavorable, I would advise potential users, including a friend, to look for more reviews. This way, they can gain a balanced understanding, taking into account a multitude of experiences before making their personal judgment. It's important to remember that a single feedback does not represent the entirety of a product's quality. Lastly, the personal relevance of the app also plays a crucial role - if it aligns with certain individual needs or interests, one might still decide to try an app despite some negative reviews, because of its potential utility. In conclusion, based on the limited information provided from this single review - \\"You Are a foolish,\\" my recommendation stands at \\"Maybe\\" as it's ambiguous to derive a concrete opinion. More data points and qualitative feedback would provide a more comprehensive awareness about the app's overall perceived value and functionality, which can then significantly influence the recommendation."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: Preheat the oven and grease a baking sheet.

Do you know how to make yummy taquitos? It's really easy and fun! Let me show you how to do it! First, you need to get the oven ready by turning it on, so it gets hot enough for cooking. This is called \\"preheating\\" the oven. Ask a grown-up to help you with this step, because the oven can be very hot. Next, you need to make a baking sheet ready for the taquitos. You need to put a little bit of oil, butter, or cooking spray on the sheet so the taquitos won't stick when they cook. This is called \\"greasing\\" the baking sheet. After that, you need to warm up some oil in a pan on the stove. Then, you will cook the onion and garlic in the oil until they become soft and smell really good. Now, it's time for the beef! You need to mix the beef into the pan with the onion and garlic, and cook it until it changes color and becomes brown. Once the beef is brown, you can add yummy things like salsa, chili powder, salt, and pepper into the pan too. Stir it all together and let it cook for about 10 minutes, so all the flavors mix together. While the beef mixture is cooking, you can get the tortillas ready. Put them in the microwave for a little bit until they get soft and bendy. When the tortillas are soft, you can start putting together the taquitos! Take a spoon and put some beef mixture onto each tortilla, and then sprinkle some cheese on top. Be careful not to put too much, or the taquitos might be too full to roll up! Now, you can roll up the taquitos! Put each rolled-up taquito on the greased baking sheet. Then, ask a grown-up to help you put a little bit of oil on top of the taquitos. This will help them get crispy when they bake. Bake the taquitos in the preheated oven until they get crispy and golden. This usually takes a little while, so be patient! Finally, when the taquitos are ready, take them out of the oven and let them cool down a little bit. Now, you can serve them with yummy things like sour cream and more salsa for dipping! And there you have it! Delicious, crispy baked taquitos that you made all by yourself (with a little help from your grown-up)! Remember, always be careful when using the oven or the stove, and ask an adult for help when you need it. Enjoy your tasty taquitos!"},{"instruction":"Okay, I didn't get the Purgatory thing the first time I watched this episode. It seemed like something significant was going on that I couldn't put my finger on. This time those Costa Mesa fires on TV really caught my attention- and it helped that I was just writing an essay on Inferno! But let me see what HASN'T been discussed yet... A TWOP review mentioned that Tony had 7 flights of stairs to go down because of the broken elevator. Yeah, 7 is a significant number for lots of reasons, especially religious, but here's one more for ya. On a hunch I consulted wikipedia, and guess what Dante divided into 7 levels? Purgatorio. Excluding ante-Purgatory and Paradise. (The stuff at the bottom of the stairs and... what Tony can't get to.) On to the allegedly \\"random\\" monk-slap scene. As soon as the monks appeared, it fit perfectly in place with Tony trying to get out of Purgatory. You can tell he got worried when that Christian commercial (death, disease, and sin) came on, and he's getting more and more desperate because Christian heaven is looking kinda iffy for him. By the time he meets the monks he's thinking \\"hey maybe these guys can help me?\\" which sounds like contemplating other religions (e.g. Buddhism) and wondering if some other path could take him to \\"salvation\\". Not that Tony is necessarily literally thinking about becoming a Buddhist, but it appears Finnerty tried that (and messed up). That slap in the face basically tells Tony there's no quick fix- as in, no, you can't suddenly embrace Buddhism and get out of here. Tony was initially not too concerned about getting to heaven. But at the \\"conference entrance\\", he realizes that's not going to be so easy for him. At first I saw the name vs. driver's license problem as Tony having led sort of a double life, what with the killing people and sleeping around that he kept secret from most people. He feels free to have an affair with quasi-Melfi because \\"he's Kevin Finnerty\\". He figures out that he CAN fool some people with KF's cards, like hotel receptionists, but it won't get him out of Purgatory. Those helicopters- the helicopters of Heaven?- are keeping track of him and everything he does. After reading all the theories on \\"inFinnerty\\", though, it seems like KF's identity is a reminder of the infinite different paths Tony could've taken in his life. Possibly along with the car joke involving Infiniti's that made no sense to me otherwise. Aaaand at that point my brain fizzles out.

But Tiger Woods is also battling an injury at the U.S. Open in Pennsylvania. Woods revealed that he hurt his left arm while winning The Players Championship last month, which would explain why he grimaced noticeably on several occasions in the first round. The world's top-ranked golfer was back in action in the second round Friday and shot a level-par 70 to complete two rounds at three-over-par 143. Asked to provide more details about injury, Woods didn't elaborate. \\"Well, it is what it is,\\" Woods said. Woods is bidding to win his 15th major but first since 2008 at the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines. Back then he had to deal with seemingly a more serious injury -- a broken leg. He memorably beat Rocco Mediate in a playoff. Given the challenging conditions at Merion, Woods suggested his total might not be so bad heading into the final two rounds. Storms caused delays of more than four hours Thursday -- Woods had to complete his first round Friday -- and play was eventually suspended due to darkness. Windy conditions added to the degree of difficulty at Merion's shorter East Course. Woods, Rory McIlroy and Masters winner Adam Scott made for a dream pairing and while Scott struggled, Woods and McIlroy -- the second-ranked golfer -- fared better. Seen chatting amicably during the round, the duo compiled identical scores in the first two rounds. Beginning at the 11th hole, Woods birdied the 13th for a good start. Two bogeys, however, on the 14th and 18th, meant he had work to do on the first nine. Answer the following questions: 1. Who is the highest ranked golfer? 2.

At her apartment, Oliver is intrigued by a statue of a medieval warrior on horseback impaling a large cat with his sword. Irena informs Oliver that the figure is King John of Serbia and that the cat represents evil.

The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major by Gustav Mahler is one of the largest-scale choral works in the classical concert repertoire. Because it requires huge instrumental and vocal forces it is frequently called the \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\", although the work is normally presented with far fewer than a thousand performers and the composer did not sanction that name. The work was composed in a single inspired burst, at Maiernigg in southern Austria in the summer of 1906. The last of Mahler's works that was premiered in his lifetime, the symphony was a critical and popular success when he conducted the Munich Philharmonic in its first performance, in Munich, on 12 September 1910. The fusion of song and symphony had been a characteristic of Mahler's early works. In his \\"middle\\" compositional period after 1901, a change of direction led him to produce three purely instrumental symphonies. The Eighth, marking the end of the middle period, returns to a combination of orchestra and voice in a symphonic context. The structure of the work is unconventional; instead of the normal framework of several movements, the piece is in two parts. Part I is based on the Latin text of a 9th-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, Veni creator spiritus (\\"Come, Creator Spirit\\"), and Part II is a setting of the words from the closing scene of Goethe's Faust. The two parts are unified by a common idea, that of redemption through the power of love, a unity conveyed through shared musical themes. Mahler had been convinced from the start of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W....

During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented: It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.

Deciding to watch tv or play with your cell phone might be a routine but they provide no help to fall asleep. The question and answer pair are described below.","output":"Question: Can watching TV or playing with a cell phone help a person fall asleep? Answer: It is generally not recommended for a person to watch TV or play with a cell phone before sleep as they can interfere with one's ability to fall asleep. Justification: 1. Both TV and cell phones emit blue light, which has been shown to suppress melatonin production, the hormone responsible for regulating sleep. By reducing melatonin, the body's natural sleep-wake cycle can be disrupted. 2. Watching TV and playing with a cell phone can be stimulating, making the brain more active and alert, which is counterproductive to falling asleep. Engaging with screens can make it difficult for the mind to wind down and shift into a relaxed state. 3. Establishing a relaxing bedtime routine can help signal the body that it is time to wind down and prepare for sleep. Engaging with screens before bed can interfere with this routine, making it harder to establish healthy sleep habits. In conclusion, although watching TV or playing with a cell phone might be a common routine before sleep, they generally do not aid in falling asleep and can instead hinder the ability to fall asleep due to the blue light emitted and stimulation provided."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Given this review: \\"Greatest son in the universe\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

The manufacturer (Haggerty) stated that their current formulation is a trade secret. is the inside of a lava lamp toxic? Choose your answer from: -- no -- yes","output":"While it is true that lava lamps made in China for the US market since 1970 do not use carbon tetrachloride, the answer to the question of whether the inside of a lava lamp is toxic is not as straightforward as a simple \\"yes\\" or \\"no.\\" Instead, it is crucial to examine different aspects of lava lamps and their various components in order to provide a comprehensive answer. Lava lamps typically consist of two primary ingredients sealed in a glass container: a colored and often viscous liquid and a wax-like substance that forms the \\"lava.\\" The purpose of the lamp is to create a mesmerizing visual display as the molten wax rises and falls within the liquid medium. The exact formulations for these substances are trade secrets held by the manufacturers. Over the years, numerous substances have been used as the liquid medium, including water, oil, alcohol, and other solvents. Some earlier lava lamps did use carbon tetrachloride, which is toxic. However, as you mentioned, its use was banned in 1970. Contemporary lava lamps commonly use water or a distilled version of propylene glycol, a less toxic substance commonly found in food and cosmetic products, as the liquid medium to provide a safe environment for the wax to move. The wax-like substance inside a lava lamp is also a closely guarded trade secret, but it generally consists of mineral oil, paraffin wax, and other compounds that allow the substance to melt and rise when heated. While these substances are not considered highly toxic, they can cause irritation or harm if ingested, inhaled, or exposed to the skin or eyes. When assessing the toxicity of the inside of a lava lamp, it is important to factor in the potential risks associated with the heating source used to warm the contents. Typically, a light bulb is used to generate heat, and if the glass container is accidentally broken, there is a risk of electrical shock. The broken glass and hot liquid could also potentially cause burns or cuts if users attempt to clean up the mess improperly. To summarize, the inside of a modern lava lamp manufactured for the US market is not highly toxic, but it is not completely harmless either. Pre-1970 lava lamps containing carbon tetrachloride have a higher toxicity risk. If a lamp remains undamaged and the contents are not ingested or exposed to skin, there is little risk. In the case of accidents that result in broken lava lamps, promptly taking appropriate safety measures can minimize potential complications. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions when handling and using lava lamps to ensure the best possible safety precautions."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe. Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki. - Ancient Greece was a civilization belonging to a period of Greek history from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th-9th centuries BC to the end of antiquity (AD). Immediately following this period was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine era. Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the period of Archaic Greece and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was followed by the period of Classical Greece, an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars, lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedonia, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire. - Eduard Schwyzer ( 15 February 1874 , Zürich -- 3 May 1943 , Berlin ) was a Swiss Classical philologist and Indo - European linguist , specializing in Ancient Greek and Greek dialects . He was a professor in Zürich 1912 -- 1926 , in Bonn from 1927 and in Berlin from 1932 . - The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism. - Mycenaean Greek is the most ancient attested form of the Greek language, on the Greek mainland, Crete and Cyprus in Mycenaean Greece (16th to 12th centuries BCE), before the hypothesised Dorian invasion, often cited as the \\"terminus post quem\\" for the coming of the Greek language to Greece. The language is preserved in inscriptions in Linear B, a script first attested on Crete before the 14th century. Most inscriptions are on clay tablets found in Knossos, in central Crete, as well as in Pylos, in the southwest of the Peloponnese. Other tablets have been found at Mycenae itself, Tiryns and Thebes and at Chania, in Western Crete. The language is named after Mycenae, one of the major centres of Mycenaean Greece. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - The Spree is a river that flows through the Saxony, Brandenburg and Berlin states of Germany, and in the Ústí nad Labem region of the Czech Republic. Approximately in length, it is a left bank tributary of the River Havel, which itself flows into the Elbe and then the North Sea. It is the river on which the original centre of Berlin was built. - The Havel is a river in north-eastern Germany, flowing through the German states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Berlin and Saxony-Anhalt.

Instead of lunches at Lut��ce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \\"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \\"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas.

Let's solve step-by-step:","output":"1. Examine the premise: The premise states that \\"A man in a green shirt directs trucks in preparation of the racetrack.\\" Based on this, we can infer several details: - There is a man involved. - The man is wearing a green shirt. - The man is directing trucks. - This action is occurring in preparation for a race at a racetrack. 2. Examine the hypothesis: The hypothesis states, \\"A man is directing trucks to staging areas on the racetrack so that the race can begin.\\" From this, we can identify several key pieces of information: - There is a man involved. - The man is directing trucks. - The trucks are being directed to staging areas on the racetrack. - The purpose of this action is to help initiate the race. 3. Compare the premise and hypothesis: We can see that both the premise and hypothesis involve a man directing trucks. In the hypothesis, it is further specified that the trucks are being directed to staging areas on the racetrack. The premise does not explicitly state this detail; however, it does mention that the action is related to the preparation of the racetrack for a race. 4. Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise: Considering the details provided in the premise, it's possible that the hypothesis is entailed, although not explicitly. The preparation of the racetrack mentioned in the premise could align with the hypothesis's idea of directing trucks to staging areas to help initiate the race. However, without further information, we cannot definitively confirm that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.

The defense attorney for Michael Slager claims that his former girlfriend, Judy Malinowski, will be the only victim to provide a \\"deathbed testimony\\" at her murder trial. Malinowski was doused with gasoline and set on fire by Slager in 2015, an attack from which she suffered extensive burns, covering 90% of her body. She survived for almost two years before passing away in 2017 at the age of 33. Slager, who is now 42 years old, pleaded no contest to multiple charges, including arson and assault, back in 2016, and he now faces murder charges. Last week, a judge ruled that Malinowski's testimony, which she gave from her hospital room five months before her death, will be admissible as evidence during the trial. The Associated Press reports that the judge called the situation \\"unprecedented.\\" In the video, Malinowski testified against Slager, detailing the assault she endured. Slager's attorneys attempted to argue that the prosecution had improperly obtained the video testimony. However, the judge pointed out that \\"the State wanted to preserve her testimony due to her fragile medical condition,\\" since Malinowski was critically ill and the only witness able to provide a firsthand account of the events leading to her injuries.

Identify what the cochlea and the stirrup are. 2. Analyze their functions. 3. Determine where they are located in the body based on their functions and other relevant information. Step 1: Identify what the cochlea and the stirrup are The cochlea is a spiral-shaped, fluid-filled structure in the inner ear that plays a crucial role in the process of hearing. The stirrup, also known as the stapes, is one of the three tiny bones called ossicles found in the middle ear. These ossicles transmit sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear to be processed as sound. Step 2: Analyze their functions The cochlea's primary function is to transform sound vibrations into neural signals that the brain can interpret. The stirrup, as part of the ossicles, acts as a bridge between the eardrum and the inner ear, helping to transfer sound vibrations with more force and precision. Step 3: Determine where they are located in the body based on their functions and other relevant information Since both the cochlea and the stirrup are involved in the process of hearing, it's clear that they are both located in the ear. The cochlea is part of the inner ear, while the stirrup (stapes) is one of the three ossicles found in the middle ear.

Article:","output":"Title: Unearthing the Intertwined History of Wars: An Exploration of the Decisive Battle Site of the Wars of the Roses Introduction The Wars of the Roses remains a significant part of English history, with its dramatic and complex tales of power struggles defining the course of the nation for generations. The ongoing exploration and study of the decisive battle site marks a monumental effort to bring to light the intricate web of relationships and events that led to the eventual shaping of modern England. In this article, we delve into the background of the Wars of the Roses, the prevailing significance of the decisive battle in question, and the remarkable efforts currently being undertaken to unearth the secrets and stories buried within the site. Background of the Wars of the Roses The Wars of the Roses, fought between 1455 and 1487, was a series of civil wars in England fought between two noble families, the House of Lancaster and the House of York. These two families, both of a royal lineage with strong claims to the English throne, were embroiled in a deep-rooted rivalry that spanned decades. The conflict arose mainly due to complex political and social situations in England during the latter half of the 15th Century. The war saw numerous shifts in power, with the throne exchanging hands multiple times, leading to immense bloodshed and strife among the nobility as well as the common people. The Decisive Battle Although several battles were fought during this time, one decisive battle ultimately proved to be the turning point in determining the future of the English monarchy. The Battle of Towton, which took place on March 29, 1461, was arguably the largest and bloodiest encounter in English history. It pitted the forces of the House of Lancaster, led by King Henry VI, against the supporters of the House of York, commanded by Edward, Duke of York. After a prolonged and fierce contest, the Yorkists emerged victorious, leading to Edward claiming the English throne, becoming King Edward IV. Unearthing the Battle Site In an effort to gain a deeper understanding of the historical events that unfolded during this crucial period, work has commenced on the exploration and excavation of the battle site. By employing cutting-edge techniques in the fields of archaeology, geophysics, and historical research, experts are meticulously examining the landscape, searching for artifacts, and mapping out the battleground. Notably, the discovery of mass graves will shed light on the brutality of the conflict and the number of casualties suffered on both sides. Such findings are expected to enhance our knowledge of medieval warfare strategies, weaponry, and the soldiers' experiences on the forefront of these bloodycombats. Preserving the Past, Learning for the Future The careful, systematic excavation and analysis of the decisive battle site from the Wars of the Roses is anticipated to yield a wealth of vital information about English society and politics during this turbulent era. As historians and researchers continue to unravel the stories cloaked within the remnants of the past, they contribute to a greater understanding of the implications and consequences of these historical events. The ongoing efforts to explore and preserve the site signify the importance of recognizing and appreciating the complex events that shaped the course of history. Guided by the revelations uncovered at the battle site, we can better comprehend the trials and tribulations that led to the formation of modern England, and in doing so, develop a deeper appreciation for the intricate and interconnected nature of our past, present, and future."},{"instruction":"Write a short summary for this text: it happened fast , out of the spotlight , on a roadside in southern mexico : president vicente fox used the power of his office to try to change a life .

Let's consider the following steps: 1. Calculate the number of years since David L. MacFarlane's birth (as of 2022): 2022 - 1893 = 129 years 2. Convert years to seconds: There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, and 365.25 days in a year (including leap years).

Answer:","output":"Without having direct information about \\"Dominic Brown\\" and the context in which it is used, I cannot explicitly categorize it. Nonetheless, in a general context, \\"Dominic Brown\\" most typically refers to a person's name. 1. Company: It's improbable that \\"Dominic Brown\\" is a company, as businesses usually have names that convey the goods or services they provide. Nonetheless, there are rare instances where people name companies after themselves but I couldn't find any well-known companies with this name. 2. Educational Institution: The name \\"Dominic Brown\\" does not match the usual naming convention of educational institutions, which are typically named after a place or a significant person (often a scholar, saint, or historical figure). 3. Artist: \\"Dominic Brown\\" could indeed be an artist, as artists commonly use their real names. A detailed search could provide specific information if there is an artist by this name. 4. Athlete: Like artists, athletes are often known by their real name. \\"Dominic Brown\\" could potentially be a professional athlete, but it would require further research on the individual. 5. Office Holder: The name could also belong to an office holder, as they are usually recognized by their personal names. 6. Mean of Transportation: This name does not fit the typical naming conventions for modes of transport, which often reflect the type of transport (e.g., airplane, train) or a specific model or brand name (e.g., Boeing 747). 7. Building: Although buildings can sometimes be named after individuals, \\"Dominic Brown\\" would be uncommon. Usually, these named buildings are older or historically significant, named after historically important people. 8. Natural Place: Natural places are usually named after their geographical characteristics or historical background, so \\"Dominic Brown\\" would be an unlikely name for a natural place. 9. Village: It would be unusual for a village to be named \\"Dominic Brown\\". Villages tend to be named for their geographical location, historical events, or notable early settlers, among other factors. 10. Animal: Animals, particularly species or breeds, are not named after individuals in conventional nomenclature, making \\"Dominic Brown\\" an unlikely fit. 11. Plant: Similar to animals, plant species are usually named considering their botanical characteristics and the Latin binomial nomenclature. 12. Album: It could possibly be the title of an album, as many artists title their albums after themselves, especially early in their careers. 13. Film or Written Work: \\"Dominic Brown\\" could also relate to the title of a movie or book. The narrative might be revolving around a character with this name. In conclusion, without more context, it is impossible to definitively categorize \\"Dominic Brown\\". It most likely refers to a person, potentially an artist, an athlete, a politician, or maybe a character in a film or book, or an album title.

Tragic Gabriel was shot while in his mother Olivia's arms by crazed gunman Nordine Amrani who launched the appalling attack on Christmas shopping crowds in Liege's busy Place Saint Lambert.

From an analytical perspective, the individual in question provides specific reasons to underscore their dissatisfaction with various aspects of their dining experience. 1. Caesar Salad: The reviewer comments that the salad was the \\"best of the meal.\\" Given the context, this statement seems more of an implicit critique of other elements of the meal rather than a hearty praise for the salad. 2. Lobster Bisque: The soup was described as overly salty, thus failing to meet the reviewer's expectations. 3. NY Strip Steak: The steak was criticized for being overcooked in the reviewer's opinion - \\"a shade red too much\\". Furthermore, the reviewer was also disappointed with the lack of flavor, especially considering the steep price of 40 for the steak – “it didn't have the 'flavor' a 40 cut should have.\\" 4. Sides: The sides, specifically the asparagus (which was apparently deep-fried), were described as nondescript and a 'big miss.' 5. Service: The reviewer felt the waitstaff was over-familiar in their conversation. This observation is given a slightly nuanced hue when they mentioned that this could have been due to the group size and its characteristics. 6. Atmosphere: This was the only aspect that received a straightforward positive comment. 7. Overall evaluation and intent to return: The last line - \\"Will I come back, nope...\\" — clearly states that their dissatisfaction was significant enough to deter future visits. It's worth noting that even with an overall negative tone, the reviewer does point out positives, such as the atmosphere and the effort put in by the staff - acknowledging their hard work. However, these few positive aspects were overshadowed by their dissatisfaction with the food and service's over-familiarity, leading to an overall negative review."},{"instruction":"Choices: - negative - positive What would be an example of an negative review?","output":"An example of a negative review could be for a restaurant dining experience. Here's a detailed and long negative review: Title: Disappointing Experience at The Gourmet Bistro I had heard a lot about The Gourmet Bistro and what a fantastic dining experience it was supposed to be. So, I decided to visit and try their highly acclaimed dishes with a few friends on Saturday night. However, our experience at this restaurant turned out to be quite disappointing in various aspects, which I will detail below: 1. Service: Our server appeared to be quite unenthusiastic and inattentive. Whenever we needed something, it took multiple attempts to get his attention, which was quite frustrating. And when he did attend to us, the service was delivered begrudgingly, with no sense of warmth or friendliness. 2. Ambiance: The restaurant was poorly lit and had an off-putting odor, which made it anything but inviting. The tables and chairs were jammed close together, making it difficult to have private conversations, and the noise level was unbearably high. Furthermore, the washroom facilities were not adequately maintained, reducing the overall comfort of our dining experience. 3. Food: We ordered a variety of dishes, hoping to sample the best that The Gourmet Bistro had to offer. Unfortunately, the food didn't live up to the hype. The appetizers arrived cold, and the presentation was lackluster. The main courses were nothing to write home about – the steak I ordered was overcooked and lacked proper seasoning, while my friend's pasta was very bland. Moreover, the side dishes were poorly executed, with undercooked vegetables and soggy garlic bread. 4. Drinks: The drink menu seemed interesting, but the cocktails we ordered were weak and not well-balanced. My friends who opted for wine were not thrilled with the available selection, and the server wasn't knowledgeable enough to help them choose a suitable option. 5. Price: Considering the subpar quality of the food, service, and ambiance, I found the prices to be exorbitant. I understand that fine dining can be costly, but the value for money just didn't seem to be there in this case. Overall, our experience at The Gourmet Bistro was a letdown. The restaurant failed to deliver on its promise of exceptional service, inviting ambiance, and delicious cuisine. As a result, I cannot recommend The Gourmet Bistro to others and will not be returning for another visit.

He is best known as the lead singer and lyricist of the post-punk band Joy Division. Joy Division released their debut album, \\"Unknown Pleasures\\", in 1979 and recorded their follow-up, \\"Closer\\", in 1980. - Dance music is music composed specifically to facilitate or accompany dancing. It can be either a whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement. In terms of performance, the major categories are live dance music and recorded dance music. While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving medieval dances. In the Baroque period, the major dance styles were noble court dances (see Baroque dance). In the classical music era, the minuet was frequently used as a third movement, although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The waltz also arose later in the classical era. Both remained part of the romantic music period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the barcarolle, mazurka, ecossaise, ballade and polonaise. - Grant Robert Gee (born 24 October 1964) is a British film maker, photographer and cinematographer. He is most noted for his 1998 documentary \\"Meeting People Is Easy\\" about the British alternative rock group Radiohead. - Peter Hook (born 13 February 1956) is an English singer, songwriter, composer, multi-instrumentalist and record producer.

He is a founding member of both Joy Division and New Order, and is widely credited with the latter band's move towards electronica and synthpop. - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music. - Joy Division is a 2007 British documentary film on the British post-punk band Joy Division , directed by Grant Gee . The film assembles TV clips , newsreel , pictures of modern Manchester and Manchester in the late 1970s , and interviews .

Sir Godfrey Newbold Hounsfield, a British engineer, and Allan MacLeod Cormack, a South African-born physicist, are credited with inventing the CT scanner. Their groundbreaking work in the field of medical imaging earned them the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The development of the CT scanner can be traced back to Sir Godfrey Newbold Hounsfield's early work with radar technology and digital image processing during his time at the Electric and Musical Industries (EMI) Central Research Laboratories in London. Hounsfield began to apply his experience in electronics and radio technology to look for a more effective way to create images of soft tissues in the body, which were often difficult to visualize with traditional X-rays. In 1971, Sir Hounsfield built the first prototype of a CT scanner, initially called EMI-Scanner, that was designed to scan the head. The first patient scan using this technology was performed on October 1, 1971, at the Atkinson Morley Hospital in Wimbledon, London. It revealed a suspected brain tumor, which was later confirmed upon surgery. This revolutionary imaging technology quickly gained momentum and its potential to transform the medical field was soon recognized. Allan MacLeod Cormack, who was working independently at the time, had developed the theoretical foundations of the CT scanner using X-ray data and mathematical methods to reconstruct images. Cormack's work supported and complemented Hounsfield's practical application, becoming an essential part of the CT scanner's function and success. In the years following the invention of the CT scanner in the 1970s, the technology rapidly evolved. The initial head-only scanners expanded to encompass whole-body scanning capabilities, while the image quality and resolution of the scanners improved, along with faster scanning times. Today, CT scans are an invaluable tool in the diagnosis of various medical conditions, as well as in the fields of research and education."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump is not expected to meet the leaders of Cuba and Venezuela when he attends the Summit of the Americas next week, according to White House officials.

The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

President Barack Obama has a few more months in the hot days of summer to get legislation through Congress, but representatives and senators will soon be focused on their campaigns with little thought for anything else. The midterm elections will be extraordinarily important for the composition of Congress. If Republicans can expand their numbers in the House and Senate, they might develop enough muscle to stifle Obama from accomplishing anything else. It could also be enough to put pressure on moderate Democrats to further undercut the legislative gains of the first term by enacting spending cuts and weakening the regulatory apparatus of programs like Dodd-Frank. On the other hand, if Democrats do well they can improve their standing in the House and place more pressure on Republicans to make compromises. Besides the composition of Congress, the midterms will provide some insight into the challenges each party will face and what promises they might make in the 2016 presidential election. The shape of the campaigns will start to clarify what the Republicans intend to stand for and whether they can put forth ideas that excite, rather than turn off, voters outside the reddest parts of the country. The rebellion taking place within the GOP has been growing more intense. Many senior leaders are warning that their party is on a destructive path that will only lead to more rounds of defeat. Many Republicans privately agreed when former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole said the GOP ought to be \\"closed for repairs\\" until next year, and in the meantime, \\"spend that time going over ideas and positive agenda.\\" Since 2010, Republicans invested almost everything in the issue of deficit reduction and saying no to everything that came out of the White House. The bet hasn't been paying off. At a certain point, voters seem to have lost interest in the message and, now that the long-term budget picture is doing much better while the economics of austerity has come under fire, the issue is gaining even less voter traction. The midterm elections will be the opportunity in the next two years for Republicans to show voters they have something more to say, and to offer two or three big ideas they can use in the race for the White House. Democrats face a similar challenge. They need to start hinting at what their party will be about in the post-Obama age. Many Democrats are wondering if the next election will be like 1988, when Vice President George H.W. Bush campaigned on Ronald Reagan's record and essentially promised to do more of the same, just in kinder and gentler fashion. Or will Democrats try to offer something more transformative -- a governing agenda for the challenges we face in 2016 rather than those we faced in 2008? Voters want to hear what Democrats have to say about federal investments in the nation's economic future, about how to handle climate change and how to build on Obama's promise to restore the balance between law and civil liberties and homeland security. If Democrats can start developing ideas for the next candidate to run on, they could not only bolster their numbers on the Hill but strengthen the platform for the next crop of candidates to win over voters. There are also questions about the mood of the electorate. Everyone will have a close eye on the immigrant vote. Although the turnout is much smaller in midterm elections, given the heat of the immigration debates, it will be significant to see if the energy levels are still high among immigrants for the Democrats and how much Republicans have been able to improve their standing with some high-profile party members like Marco Rubio coming out for reform. It will also be important to see whether any kind of anti-immigrant backlash sets in, similar to what Democrats saw against civil rights in 1966 following the race riots in Watts and other cities. The outcome of the debate over immigration legislation in the House will have a big effect. The aftermath of the recent controversies will also be significant. Right now the political cycle is in full scandal swing. The midterms will provide some sense of whether those stories have legs, either detrimentally for Democrats as Republicans suffered in 1974 after Watergate or whether a backlash sets in against the GOP, as New Gingrich and his allies suffered in 1998 amid the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Finally, the midterms will offer a platform for future presidential candidates to show their stuff. In 1966, former Vice President Richard Nixon seized the national spotlight, campaigning for Republicans across the nation, and making it clear, through his fundraising and speeches that he was a formidable candidate who could take on Lyndon Johnson, or any other Democrat. This year, candidates from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will seek to use this moment, with the national spotlight turned on the political playing field, for the same advantage. It will also be a chance for the parties to shake off some of the challenges that are holding them down, such as the right-wing drift of the GOP -- which could hurt the chances of the Republican candidates in 2016, regardless of how charismatic and talented they are. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The upcoming midterm campaigns are crucial for determining the composition of Congress. If Republicans can expand their numbers in the House and Senate, they might develop enough influence to stifle President Barack Obama's attempts to accomplish more. This could also push moderate Democrats to further undercut the legislative gains, enacting spending cuts and weakening regulatory programs like Dodd-Frank. However, if Democrats perform well, they can improve their standing in the House and exert more pressure on Republicans to compromise. The midterm elections will also provide insight into each party's challenges and potential promises moving into the 2016 presidential election. The Republicans must showcase new ideas that can resonate with the wider electorate, not just within the reddest parts of the country. They have been heavily focused on deficit reduction and saying no to White House proposals, but this strategy has not paid off. With the long-term budget looking up and austerity economics under fire, this issue is losing traction with voters. Similarly, the midterms present challenges for the Democratic Party. They need to develop ideas and present a clear agenda for 2016, which will be the post-Obama era. Questions arise whether they will build upon Obama's record or offer more transformative solutions to issues like climate change, economic investment, and balancing civil liberties with homeland security. Key factors to watch during the midterms include the energy levels and voting patterns of immigrant voters, as immigration debates have been particularly heated. The turnout in midterm elections is often smaller, but the immigrant vote's influence cannot be ignored, especially when considering the future political landscape. Additionally, the outcome of current scandals may impact the political parties' reputations and electoral outcomes. The midterm elections also offer a chance for potential presidential candidates to shine. Candidates like Hillary Clinton and Chris Christie will try to capitalize on the national spotlight, displaying their skills and gaining an advantage before the upcoming presidential election. Both parties could use this opportunity to shake off the challenges they face and better prepare for the elections in 2016."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: The hosts scored three goals in the first 30 minutes, with a deft Jamie Vardy header starting the scoring. Riyad Mahrez then headed home before scoring from the spot after a Lee Cattermole foul on the Algerian. Jermain Defoe gave the Black Cats hope but, after Marc Albrighton had struck for the Foxes, Steven Fletcher's late header was mere consolation. The ease with which Leicester scored will worry Sunderland fans, their team seeming to have carried last season's defensive failings into this new campaign. They began with new recruit Younes Kaboul partnering Sebastian Coates - who made his loan move from Liverpool permanent during the close season - in the centre of defence but the new-look partnership failed on the opening day. \\"We clearly weren't at it,\\" said Kaboul. \\"We were late for every ball. We conceded a lot and we were not sharp enough.\\" Sunderland conceded two sloppy goals early on, allowing Marc Albrighton's crosses from the left to find two of the smallest players on the pitch. From then on, Leicester gained confidence and Sunderland failed to cope with the home side's quick, crisp movement. Claudio Ranieri made a winning return to the Premier League, 11 years after being sacked as Chelsea manager by owner Roman Abramovich. Media playback is not supported on this device The Leicester boss, known as 'the Tinkerman' for his constant changing of his starting line-ups, was a surprise replacement for Nigel Pearson in the summer but, should his new team continue to perform with such attacking verve, his first season with the Foxes will be trouble free - although the ease in which Sunderland scored twice is a note of caution. Ranieri described his side's performance as \\"outstanding\\" and, indeed, they could have scored more, with Shinji Okazaki missing one glorious chance in the second half. Mahrez, too, hit the woodwork after the break and forced a fine save Costel Pantilimon. The coach chose to rely on the players who secured top-flight survival last term by winning win seven of their last nine games to finish 14th, with only one summer signing - Okazaki - in his starting line-up, Of the familiar Leicester faces, it was striker Vardy and winger Mahrez who particularly excelled, their creativity and pace causing Sunderland problems. Sunderland were fragile on the right side of their defence and 42.2% of Leicester's attacks came from that flank. Marc Albrighton caused damage in the first half with his crosses from the left wing and combined well with Jeff Schlupp and Okazaki for the second goal, which Mahrez scored. Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri: \\"It was a very good start and I am very happy with my players in the first match, which is so important in front of our fans. I told my players to be the warriors for them. \\"The performance was outstanding from the beginning. Okazaki played very well but I don't like to just say that because the whole team played well.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat: \\"After 10 minutes there were three crosses and three goals. At this level this cannot happen. \\"You have to show every minute away from home and we didn't see that in the first half. We have to wait [for new players]. We struggled again. Everybody can see that we need more.\\" Leicester winger Marc Albrighton: \\"Claudio Ranieri has come in with fresh ideas to add to the way we were playing. He didn't want to change too much but he has new ideas and we are taking them on board.\\" Riyad Mahrez's pace and invention posed havoc all afternoon and the Algeria international could have had a hat-trick before receiving a deserved standing ovation from the Leicester fans as he was substituted towards the end of the match.

Here's why: The reviewer seems to have mixed feelings about the food. While they mention that the brat is good and the buffalo sliders are spicy (which could be a positive for those who enjoy spicy food), they also state that the cheeseburger is just ok and that they did not enjoy the hummus, BLT, or club sandwich. These comments suggest that the reviewer found the food to be hit-or-miss, generally unimpressive, and not living up to their expectations. Their dissatisfaction with the beer list suggests they did not find the selection appealing. This component of the review works against the venue, especially if it's a place where patrons go expecting a robust and diverse beer offering. People actively seeking out a good beverage experience might see this as a significant negative. The reviewer's comments about feeling trapped in a booth can be seen as a criticism about the setting, atmosphere, or seating arrangement of the venue. They also express a disjointed experience of expectation versus reality, hinting that they want the venue to be a bar but feel as though it doesn't meet that desired vibe. Lastly, the reviewer's neutral to lukewarm feedback about the drinks being just \\"ok\\" contributes to the overall underwhelmed feeling coming from the review. In conclusion, while the reviewer does acknowledge a few positive aspects, the negative feelings of dissatisfaction, unmet expectations, and underwhelming food and drink experiences dominate the review. Therefore, it can be categorized as a negative review."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Tsugumo HanshirÅ arrives at the estate of the Ii clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku within the courtyard of the palace. To deter him SaitÅ Kageyu (RentarÅ Mikuni), the Daimyo's senior counselor, tells HanshirÅ the story of another rÅnin, Chijiiwa Motome â formerly of the same clan as HanshirÅ. Motome arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as HanshirÅ. Infuriated by the rising number of \\"suicide bluffs\\", the three most senior samurai of the clanâYazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuroâpersuaded SaitÅ to force Motome to follow through and kill himself. Upon examining Motome's swords, their blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \\"pawn his soul\\", the House of Ii forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating. Despite this warning, HanshirÅ insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he has no intention of leaving the Ii palace alive. After a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, HanshirÅ is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of SaitÅ and the Ii retainers, HanshirÅ successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuroâthe three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness. After provoking their laughter by calling bushido a facade, HanshirÅ recounts his story to SaitÅ and the Ii retainers. He did, he admits, know Motome after all. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the Shogun. His Lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, HanshirÅ planned to die alongside him.

Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee Answer:","output":"Title: A Question of Honor Plot Summary: Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee is a young, talented, and slightly overconfident Navy lawyer assigned to defend two Marines on trial for the murder of a fellow Marine at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The case appears straightforward, but as Kaffee digs deeper, he uncovers a complex web of deceit, corruption, and conflicting loyalties behind the incident. Act 1: The film opens with the brutal death of a young Marine, Private Santiago, on the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. Kaffee (played by Tom Cruise) is assigned to the defense team, along with his colleagues, Lieutenant Commander JoAnne Galloway (played by Demi Moore), and Lieutenant Sam Weinberg (played by Kevin Pollak). They expect a straightforward case of defense, believing the two defendants, Lance Corporal Harold Dawson (played by Wolfgang Bodison) and Private Louden Downey (played by James Marshall), to be clearly guilty. Act 2: As the defense team begins their investigation, they learn that the two defendants were following a borderline illegal order called a \\"Code Red,\\" which was meant to discipline Santiago. The order came from their commanding officer, Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick (played by Kiefer Sutherland), under the direction of Colonel Nathan R. Jessep, the base commander (played by Jack Nicholson). Kaffee, Galloway, and Weinberg face enormous pressure from their superiors to plead guilty and avoid a potentially embarrassing trial. Kaffee initially considers a plea bargain but is challenged by Galloway, who believes there is more to the case than meets the eye. The defense team discovers inconsistencies in Santiago's treatment, ultimately revealing a systemic culture of abuse and secrecy on the base. Act 3: During the trial, Kaffee boldly confronts Colonel Jessep on the witness stand, demanding the truth about Santiago's death. Jessep arrogantly admits his involvement in the \\"Code Red,\\" justifying his actions as necessary for maintaining military discipline. Jessep is arrested, and the two defendants are found not guilty of murder but guilty of conduct unbecoming. Kaffee learns valuable lessons about integrity, honor, and the responsibility of defending those who serve their country. A Question of Honor explores themes of morality, the search for truth, and the balance between military discipline and individual rights.

Question: suppose earth does not crack happens, how will it affect MORE/STRONGER earthquakes. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If the Earth does not develop cracks deep beneath the surface, it would likely result in fewer and weaker earthquakes. The process you've described essentially outlines the mechanism through which earthquakes occur. This process is mainly associated with the movement of tectonic plates, which are large sections of Earth's crust that interact and move over time. The development of cracks is a critical component of this process. When cracks do not form, this suggests that there is less movement and interaction between the tectonic plates. As a result, the pressure that builds up between rocks on either side of the fissures is diminished. In this scenario, there will be less force and energy being applied to the plates, minimizing the possibility of an earthquake occurring. The lack of cracks also means that there is less potential for seismic waves to propagate throughout the Earth's crust. As the supposed perturbation influences the second effect by not allowing cracks to form or preventing them from expanding, the likelihood of powerful earthquakes occurring decreases. The absence of extensive fissures reduces the overall tension and stress built up within the Earth's crust, which is a significant factor contributing to the strength and frequency of earthquakes. Without this build-up of stress and tension, there is less potential energy released during earthquakes. Consequently, the seismic waves generated from such events will be weaker and less impactful. In summary, if the Earth does not develop deep cracks beneath its surface, there will likely be less potential energy stored within the Earth's crust, leading to fewer and weaker earthquakes overall. The supposed perturbation exerts a significant influence over the second effect, ultimately reducing the likelihood and intensity of seismic events."},{"instruction":"Write a question about the following article: The Eagles thumped the Chicago Bears 54-11 on Sunday Night Football.

At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. However, she was rejected since \\"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do.

This is a way to show support and care during a challenging time. - Sentence B: \\"When my sister was in the store, she received cards and flowers.\\" This sentence goes against common sense because it is unusual for someone to receive cards and flowers while they are in a store. People typically buy cards and flowers for themselves or others when they are in a store but do not expect to receive them unsolicited. Based on these considerations, Sentence B goes against common sense more than Sentence A."},{"instruction":"Took a nap and woke up feeling sick! my throate is very sore.

This article was about:","output":"The article refers to the uncovering of an abattoir, also known as a slaughterhouse, near the town of Clones. This discovery was made in the afternoon (shortly after 15:00 British Summer Time). During the time of this operation, it was found that animal carcasses were being actively butchered. A crucial aspect of the story is that two men were being questioned in relation to the case. One of the individuals is identified as being Irish, whereas the other is described as a foreign national. However, the report does not furnish any further details as to the identities of these individuals, their roles in the operation of this abattoir, or the nature of the questions they faced. The involvement of the Irish Department of Agriculture's special investigations unit underscores the seriousness of the finding. These officers normally have specialized knowledge in matters relating to animal health and food safety and would be deployed to deal with significant breaches of animal treatment, health, and hygiene regulations. Furthermore, the abattoir could be an unlicensed or illegally operated facility, given the fact that the special investigations unit was involved. The unit's presence raises questions about the origins of the animals being processed there, the sanitary conditions under which the animals were butchered, and the subsequent distribution of the meat products derived from them. Such illegal operations can pose significant public health risks. Unregulated slaughter houses may not uphold safety and health standards, thus risking the spread of diseases from animals to humans. Furthermore, the welfare of the animals can be put at risk if they are not slaughtered in line with regulations that ensure a humane process. Therefore, this article highlights the crucial role of the agricultural department's special investigations unit in enforcing regulations, ensuring animal welfare, and securing public health safety. It showcases the need for continued vigilance in the agriculture and food industry and more stringent accountability measures to prevent such illegal operations."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Modern Standard Hindi (Devanagari: , \\"Mnak Hind\\") or simply Hindi (Devanagari: , \\"Hind\\"), is an Indian language and a standardised and Sanskritised register of the Hindustani language.

Religious texts and scriptures based on his life have been a formative component in numerous cultures of South and Southeast Asia. Along with Krishna, Rama is considered to be one of the most important avatars of Vishnu. In Rama-centric sects, he is considered the Supreme Being, rather than an avatar. - Ramanand Sagar (29 December 1917 12 December 2005) (born Chandramauli Chopra) was an Indian film director.

The colloquial registers are mostly indistinguishable, and even though the official standards are nearly identical in grammar, they differ in literary conventions and in academic and technical vocabulary, with Urdu adopting stronger Persian, Turkic and Arabic influences, and Hindi relying more heavily on Sanskrit. Before the Partition of the British Indian Empire, the terms \\"Hindustani, Urdu,\\" and \\"Hindi\\" were synonymous; all covered what would be called Urdu and Hindi today.

He attended elementary school locally, and during his college years, he lived in Sunset Beach. Rohrabacher graduated from Palos Verdes High School in Palos Verdes Estates, California, attended Los Angeles Harbor College, and earned a bachelor's degree in history at California State University, Long Beach in 1969. He received his master's degree in American Studies at the University of Southern California. In terms of his positions, Rohrabacher voted to repeal Obamacare, disputes evidence of man-made global warming, is a staunch opponent of illegal immigration, and favors the legalization of marijuana. In foreign policy, he supported withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan, called for Trump to punish Turkish President Erdogan on embassy violence, sided with Russia in the Russia-Georgia war, gave a qualified defense of the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and supports cooperating with Russia in Syria. On May 17, 2017, the Washington Post reported that a month before Donald Trump clinched the Republican nomination, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy stated \\"There's two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump. Swear to God.\\" Brendan Buck, counselor to Paul Ryan, initially denied these reports but later, after being informed that the Post would cite a recording as evidence, said that McCarthy had been joking.

Following the ISIS terrorist attacks in Tehran on June 7, 2017, in which 17 innocent civilians were killed, he suggested that the attack could be viewed as 'a good thing', and surmised that President Trump might have been behind the coordination of this terrorist attack. An article in The Atlantic suggested that there was serious concern in the State Department of ties between Rohrabacher and the Russian government.

Rohrabacher has drawn public criticism for some of his positions. His controversial statements include the conspiracy theory claims, first promoted by the politically-biased conspiracy theory website Infowars, that Democrats secretly organized the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville to provoke the violence by the alt-right (which led to the murder of one anti-Nazi protester) in order to discredit President Trump.

Give her a bit more to eat,\\" he said in a low voice, without tearing his eyes from Brownie while his wife was busy packing Brownie's belongings, saying,\\"Brownie is not so cute as her younger brother, Spotty. Take care of the little thing when walking him.\\" It happened on the night of July 10th, 2013 before the Gausses took a trip to Hawaii. They entrusted their pet to me because they thought I was the first person they'd confide in. And another intention of theirs was that I had already trained Spotty into a wellknown pet in my community, which can act many tricks, such as \\"Sit down!\\" \\"Stand up!\\" \\"Give me your right hand!\\" \\"Turn around!\\" She can even sing, and, of course, that's just a strange sharp noise. Having seen them off, I took beautiful Brownie home in my arms, for fear that he would slip away. _ so I tried many ways to be his friend, which made Spotty rather unhappy. They often fought a battle, seemingly to break my roof loose. Soon, Brownie turned out to be an agreeable family member. He was an endearing pet, often begging for comforts in my arms. I seized the chance to train him and he achieved a lot, which I texted Mr.Gauss. They were so overjoyed and decided to fly home ahead of time to see Brownie's qualitative change. But,all this was thoroughly destroyed because of Brownie's death in a traffic accident.

The department, which has prompted suburban outrage by doubling rates in the past decade for its 4.3 million customers, plans to outsource billing, maintenance and other functions and hopes to save 900 million. Don't expect rebates or lower rates going forward, officials said Wednesday, but the plan aims to slow the rate hikes, which have averaged 8% annually in recent years. \\"These changes will not come without sacrifices,\\" Bing said Wednesday, adding that he felt for workers who are likely to lose their jobs. \\"We're working to limit the amount of increase in water rates for everyone.\\" Water board members used words such as \\"shock and awe\\" to describe their reaction to the consultant's report. Fred Barnes, who represents Macomb County on the board, said, \\"My jaw would still be on the floor\\" if board chairman James Fausone hadn't given him a heads up on the findings. Workers were immediately skeptical. \\"It's not possible. They don't have enough people as it is right now,\\" said John Riehl, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 207, which represents hundreds of water workers. \\"They are just dreaming to think they operate that plant with less.\\" Riehl said consultants and computers can't dig up a leaking pipe or fix a damaged machine -- those things only get done \\"by a worker with a wrench in his hand.\\" Riehl said his union will fight the job cuts. Bing brushed off accusations of union-busting, saying that's \\"the farthest thing from my mind.\\" \\"There are too many people who fight change, and the status quo got us where we are,\\" he said. The recommendation calls for the department to cut its work force 81% from 1,978 employees currently to about 374 over five years. An additional 361 outside employees would work for the department on contracts, bringing the total workforce to 735, about 63% below current levels. All job descriptions would be rewritten to be much broader than current ones to allow more flexibility. Brian Hurding, vice president of EMA, the firm that did the study, said the department had 257 job classifications, including \\"horseshoer.\\" \\"We didn't find any horses,\\" Hurding said. \\"That's the strangest job classification I've ever seen.\\" He noted later that the person in the job also was classified as a welder, which was his main job. Under the reorganization plan, the number of job classifications would fall to 31. Hurding said employees are hungry for changes. He said he interviewed a plumber who was sent to fix a broken pipe. \\"He had to wait half a day for an operator to come to shut off the valve so he could fix the pipe,\\" Hurding said. Under new job classifications, the plumber would be trained to close the valve himself so he could fix the pipe immediately, Hurding said. Although the water board was positive about the recommendations, several members said they wanted to verify the potential savings and the workability of the plan. \\"I think we have to have sensitivity, not only from a business standpoint, but also from a humanitarian standpoint,\\" said James Thrower, vice chairman of the board. Thrower stopped short of asking for a second firm to confirm the findings, but said he wants to verify the results in other places that have gone through similar reorganizations. Other board members agreed that they want to validate the results. Detroit City Council President Pro-Tem Gary Brown said the kinds of changes the department is pursuing could work in other areas of city government. \\"I think\\" the water department \\"is going to be a model for how every department in the city should be operating,\\" he said. Water department director Sue McCormick said she hoped to make most of the reductions through attrition, though she wouldn't rule out layoffs. She couldn't say when the reductions might begin. She said about 200 workers leave the department each year for other jobs and retirement. Workers don't appear to have many chances to fight the plan. The department's authority to make wholesale changes stems from a federal court order issued in a long-running pollution lawsuit. Last fall, U.S. District Judge Sean Cox told city officials they could ignore the city charter, local laws and even union contracts to meet requirements of the Clean Water Act. The order lifted limits on outsourcing and eased work rules to allow managers more flexibility. Cox made it clear that he viewed a more efficient department as necessary to meet pollution rules. Detroit Chief Operating Officer Chris Brown said Cox hasn't been briefed on the report and probably won't be. The judge sets the goal and the department must find a way to meet it, Brown said. The department awarded EMA a 175,000 contract to conduct the study, and consultants interviewed more than 200 employees as part of it. The report found that the department spends about 44% of its income paying down almost 6 billion in outstanding debt for things such as pipes and treatment plants. Because those costs are set for the long-term, any savings must come from operations. \\"We found the organization is siloed, with inflexible job descriptions, multiple reporting levels and a lack of training,\\" Hurding said. The study found the average cost per employee was 86,135, which includes wages and benefits. Hurding noted that savings can only be achieved by upgrading technology, outsourcing and retraining employees for new skills. McCormick said the department will expect employees to have higher, more diverse skills and it will likely pay them more. Cox's order exempts the water department from many of the pay grades and other work regulations that other city employees fall under. \\"We have to be competitive to attract the kind of people we need,\\" McCormick said. Oakland County Water Resources Commissioner John McCulloch said the report confirms what past studies have found: a bloated, inefficient department. \\"The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department was the quote, unquote, dumping ground for city employees for decades,\\" McCulloch said. \\"Given the cumbersome nature of city ordinances and contracts, it was very difficult to run this very efficiently.\\" McCulloch sat through the presentation and later said he was cautiously optimistic. Like several board members, he wants confirmation of the savings before proceeding. \\"You need a second opinion because of the magnitude of the dollars involved,\\" he said.

Yet even with a department so bloated that it has a horseshoer and no horses, the local union president said it is \\"not possible\\" to eliminate positions. Union rules have turned the department into a government jobs program, some critics say. The horseshoer’s job description is \\"to shoe horses and to do general blacksmith work … and to perform related work as required.\\" The description was last updated in 1967. The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) has a large debt, rising water prices and inefficient services — using almost twice the number of employees per gallon as other cities like Chicago. A recent independent report about the DWSD recommends that the city trim more than 80 percent of the department’s workforce. The consultant who wrote the report found 257 job descriptions, including a horseshoer. Capitol Confidential sent a Freedom of Information Act request to the department for the salary, benefits and job description of the horseshoer position. In response to the report, John Riehl, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 207, which represents many of the DWSD employees, told the Detroit Free Press that the department needs more workers. \\"They don't have enough people as it is right now,\\" Riehl said. \\"They are just dreaming to think they can operate that plant with less.\\" But critics say this is just another example of city departments operating as a jobs program for union employees. \\"They have said for years that they don't have enough people,\\" said Roi Chinn, a former city administrator and 2013 mayoral candidate for Detroit. \\"As the bureaucracy thickens and union power grows, there is always a built in reflex … to want more. \\"Whenever you think you’ve heard the bad about the city of Detroit, it gets worse.\\" Chinn said if he was mayor he would sell the water department. Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor for the Detroit Free Press, wrote last week about the \\"intolerable waste\\" in the water department. \\"For unions and the whole idea of collective bargaining, this is the kind of report that just makes any sort of future very, very hard to negotiate,\\" Henderson wrote. \\"It suggests that collective bargaining turns government into a provider of jobs instead of public services.\\" Daniel Edwards, a construction contracts manager with the DWSD, said the employee was transferred from the Detroit Police Department five years ago. The police department has horses, though the DWSD horseshoer no longer works with animals. \\"DWSD has a blacksmith shop in our Central Services Facility,\\" Edwards said. The shop \\"also ... repairs equipment and works with various metals and welding for the department when needed.\\" The horseshoer now works at the Central Services Facility. The city pays 29,245 in salary and about 27,000 in benefits for the horseshoer position. ~~~~~ See also: Detroit Water and Sewerage Department Shows Problem With Government Unions Detroit Tries To Salvage Water Department The Public Employee Union Problem ||||| Summary:","output":"A big city called Detroit has a Water and Sewerage Department, which is in charge of giving water to the people who live there.

To better analyze this situation, let's break down the events that occurred. At the cookout, the kids were playing with an old toy on the lawn. Joe, who is 22 years older than his wife and presumably older than the other adults present, decides to yell at the kids and take the toy away. The reactions of the sisters to Joe's actions are that they were \\"not amused.\\" There is no direct information provided about the kids' feelings toward Joe. The actions described in the sentence, specifically Joe yelling at the kids and taking the toy away, might lead some to believe that the kids do not like Joe. It's possible that the children may view Joe negatively due to his seemingly harsh actions. However, it's also possible that the children understand Joe's perspective and continue to like him despite this particular incident. Additionally, the sisters' reactions to Joe's actions do not directly indicate the kids' feelings toward him. While it is apparent that the sisters were unhappy with his behavior, this information cannot be used to conclude the children's sentiments. Furthermore, it's essential to consider that people's feelings and opinions about others are complex and influenced by multiple factors. An isolated incident, such as the one described, might not entirely define the kids' opinion of Joe.

While redecorating her home, Sarah took out the linoleum and replaced it with tile floors. The","output":"transformation was remarkable; the once dull and outdated kitchen now had a fresh, modern aesthetic that showcased Sarah's flair for design. She carefully selected soft, earthy-toned tiles that not only blended harmoniously with the existing cabinetry and countertops but also brightened the room with their smooth reflective finish. This home improvement project was not only for aesthetics; it also served the practical purpose of making the space low-maintenance and more comfortable to live in. Over the next few weeks, Sarah made further changes to her home. She replaced her tired, worn-out furniture with chic, contemporary pieces that both enhanced the decor and offered greater comfort. First, she focused on the living room, adding a plush, velvet sectional sofa that invited relaxation. The soft, warm fabric offered a welcoming contrast to the cool tile floors, creating a cozy environment perfect for cozying up with a good book or movie. A sleek coffee table with a tempered glass top and intersecting chrome legs added a touch of elegance and sophistication while neatly complementing the modern aesthetic of the room. The dining area was next to undergo a transformation. An elegant, dark wood dining table replaced the previous glass table, which had become scratched and chipped over time. The new dining set accommodated eight guests comfortably, giving Sarah the ideal space for hosting dinner parties and sharing home-cooked meals with her friends and family. To harmonize the dining area with the living room, she added a matching dark wood sideboard for extra storage and adorned the wall with a few carefully selected pieces of minimalist art that spoke to her love for modern simplicity. Sarah didn't stop at the interior of her home – she also decided to tackle her backyard. As an avid gardener, she wanted to create an outdoor sanctuary that was not only beautiful but also functional and suited her love for growing plants and flowers. She hired a landscape designer, who expertly transformed her backyard into a personal paradise. A traditional pergola covered in a delicate lace of ivy served as the focal point of the area, with lush gardens surrounding it and creating a sense of seclusion and tranquility. A meandering cobblestone walkway connected different areas of the garden, inviting visitors to explore its various nooks and surprises. The scent of blooming flowers wafted through the air as Sarah admired the magical space that had come to life right outside her home. She couldn't wait to spend her mornings and evenings tending to the various plants, pruning roses, and cultivating the soil. Perhaps even more exciting was the idea of hosting garden parties, with string lights illuminating the pergola and the soft sounds of laughter and conversation filling the air. As Sarah stepped back into her home and surveyed the incredible transformation it had undergone, she felt a deep sense of pride and accomplishment. What was once a mediocre, uninspiring living space had become a true reflection of her personality and style – a comfortable, vibrant, and strikingly modern home that she could be proud to show off to her friends and family. And Sarah knew this was only the beginning. As she eyed the staircase leading to the second floor, she couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation about the potential changes she could make to her bedrooms and bathrooms. As her passion for design and her penchant for nurturing plants had proven, Sarah's creativity and determination knew no bounds. The future of her home seemed full of possibilities, offering the promise of an ever-evolving canvas that continued to reflect her unique sensibilities, aesthetic tastes, and love for creating nurturing, inviting spaces."},{"instruction":"You need to create a question containing a blank (_), based on the given context word.

But in Iran, Valentine's Day has come to mark another occasion as well—the anniversary of the house arrest of Iran's leading opposition figures Mir Hossein Mousavi, Mehdi Karroubi and Zahra Rahnavard. On February 14, 2011, Iranian authorities placed Mousavi, Karroubi and Rahnavard under house arrest for calling on Iranians to demonstrate in support of the popular Arab uprisings across the region. According to Reuters, earlier this month Karroubi was moved from a Ministry of Intelligence-controlled safe house to his own home. The transfer shined new light on the plight of Iran's \\"prisoners of rights\\"— those imprisoned for seeking to exercise commonly recognized political, social, religious, economic, and cultural rights, denied to them by the Iranian government. In addition to opposition politicians like Mousavi, Karroubi and Rahnavard, Iran's prisoners of rights include lawyers, journalists, professors, students, labor union workers, poets, musicians, artists, dissident clerics, bloggers, ethnic and religious minorities, LGBT persons and even humanitarian aid workers. Civil rights and human rights activists are also a primary target. Some prisoners of rights, like women's rights and student activist Bahareh Hedayat, have been arrested for holding gatherings to protest laws that discriminate against women. Others, like the \\"Yaran\\"—the seven leaders of the Bahá'í religious minority in Iran—are imprisoned for teaching a faith the Iranian government does not recognize. Still others, like lawyer Abdolfattah Soltani, are imprisoned for their efforts to assist or seek justice for prisoners of rights. Ironically, before his arrest, Soltani had been preparing a case in defense of the seven Bahá'í leaders. Answer this series of questions: 1. Who are the leaders of the religious minority? 2. How many are there? 3. Where are they? 4. Are they in prison? 5. What were they helping people learn about? 6. Why did that get them jailed? 7. Who was their lawyer? 8. Is he also in prison? 9.

Because yesterday 's olympics was so good that I stayed up until pretty late . I was enjoying the badminton doubles yesterday . Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Did it really shut down or were you just lazy to post ?","output":"Based on the information provided in the passage, it appears that the individual genuinely intended to post something before going to sleep, but encountered difficulty due to the computer being \\"hogged\\" and subsequently shutting down. The person's intention to post seems sincere, as they expressed frustration with the situation using the emoticon \\"> _ <\\". Additionally, the mention of staying up late to enjoy the Olympic badminton doubles event supports their claim that they had been engaged in other activities and were not simply being lazy in regard to posting. It is important to consider that the information provided does not give any direct indication of laziness. The issue at hand seemed to be more of an accessibility problem, with the computer being occupied or in use by someone or something else. The individual's inability to use the computer—combined with the shutdown event—created barriers to posting.

On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy.

He believed that terms such as \\"tonal\\", \\"modal\\" and \\"serial\\" are misleading analytical conveniences. For him there were no modal, tonal or serial compositions, only music with or without colour. He said that Claudio Monteverdi, Mozart, Chopin, Richard Wagner, Mussorgsky and Stravinsky all wrote strongly coloured music.In some of Messiaen's scores, he notated the colours in the music (notably in Couleurs de la cité céleste and Des canyons aux étoiles...)—the purpose being to aid the conductor in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience. The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen's synaesthesia, which he said caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music (he said that he did not perceive the colours visually). In his multi-volume music theory treatise Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d'ornithologie (\\"Treatise of Rhythm, Colour and Birdsong\\"), Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords. His descriptions range from the simple (\\"gold and brown\\") to the highly detailed (\\"blue-violet rocks, speckled with little grey cubes, cobalt blue, deep Prussian blue, highlighted by a bit of violet-purple, gold, red, ruby, and stars of mauve, black and white.

Pam studied more about high latitudes (70 to 50°N), while Alice studied about lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S). But I can use this background: Alpine tundra occurs at high enough altitude at any latitude. Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft).

The range extends from about 10°N latitude to around 50°S latitude. Step 2: Determine which person's study area includes the Andes of South America Since the Andes mountain range lies within the latitudes of 10°N to 50°S, we can see that Alice's study area (30°N to 20°S) includes portions of the Andes. Pam's study area, on the other hand, focuses on higher latitudes (70 to 50°N) and does not include the Andes range. Step 3: Answer the question Considering the study areas, Pam studied less about the Andes of South America than Alice since her focus was on higher latitudes and her study area did not include the Andes range."},{"instruction":"- Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood - The blood sugar levels are restored.

Kevin, on the other hand, recently moved to Toronto which just finished a several month long tree planting initiative that has drastically lowered the amount of air pollutants in the city. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who is less at risk for having a heart attack? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Kevin is less at risk for having a heart attack compared to Michael. This is due to several factors, including the air quality, urban environment, and public health initiatives in their respective cities. Firstly, it is important to understand the role of air pollution in heart attacks. Numerous studies have shown that air pollution, particularly from particulate matter and traffic-related pollutants, can have significant adverse effects on cardiovascular health. Exposure to high levels of pollutants can cause inflammation, increase blood pressure, and lead to the buildup of plaque in arteries, all of which contribute to the risk of having a heart attack. In Michael's case, he recently moved to Xin Jiang, where there is a high concentration of air pollutants due to the chemical manufacturing industry there. In such an environment, Michael is likely to be exposed to harmful pollutants, including particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds, on a daily basis. This constant exposure to polluted air can put a strain on his cardiovascular system, increasing his risk for a heart attack. On the other hand, Kevin has recently moved to Toronto, which has recently completed a massive tree planting initiative. Trees play a crucial role in filtering pollutants from the air, absorbing carbon dioxide, and releasing oxygen. By doing so, they help to purify the air and contribute to a healthier environment for humans. The presence of a large number of newly planted trees in Toronto suggests that the city's air quality has improved significantly, resulting in lower levels of pollutants. The improved air quality in Toronto translates into a reduced risk of heart attack for its residents, including Kevin. Living in an environment with cleaner air means that Kevin is less likely to experience the negative health effects associated with exposure to air pollutants, such as inflammation and increased blood pressure. By lowering his exposure to air pollution, Kevin's risk for having a heart attack is lower than Michael's. In conclusion, given the urban environments and air quality in Xin Jiang and Toronto, Kevin is less at risk for having a heart attack as compared to Michael. This is mainly due to the fact that Toronto's tree planting initiative has drastically reduced air pollutants in the city, providing its residents with cleaner air and a healthier environment, ultimately benefitting their cardiovascular health."},{"instruction":"I know that the answer to the question \\"What was the basis of the beef that the NAACP had?\\" is in \\"On August 18, 1970, the NAACP filed suit against Michigan state officials, including Governor William Milliken, charging de facto public school segregation. The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area. The U.S. Supreme Court took up the case February 27, 1974. The subsequent Milliken v. Bradley decision had wide national influence. In a narrow decision, the Court found that schools were a subject of local control and that suburbs could not be forced to solve problems in the city's school district.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The basis of the beef that the NAACP had was the issue of de facto public school segregation in Michigan, particularly in the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties. Although schools were not legally segregated, the NAACP claimed that local and state governments had enacted policies that maintained racial segregation in public schools. They argued that there was a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, as segregated neighborhoods led to segregated schools. Due to this situation, the NAACP filed a lawsuit against Michigan state officials, including Governor William Milliken, on August 18, 1970, in order to address the problem of de facto segregation and demand integration. This case, Milliken v. Bradley, had a significant national impact when it reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court's decision was narrow, emphasizing that schools were subject to local control and suburbs could not be compelled to resolve problems within the city's school district. This ruling emphasized the limitations of the federal government in enforcing desegregation beyond official policymaking and highlighted the complexities of addressing racial inequality in American public schools. The NAACP's beef, therefore, was rooted in the pursuit of equal education opportunities and an end to the racial segregation prevalent in public schools."},{"instruction":"In 1961, writer-editor Stan Lee revolutionized superhero comics by introducing superheroes designed to appeal to more all-ages readers than the predominantly child audiences of the medium.

He is currently special assistant to the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association. Over his 22-year career, he played for six teams: the San Diego Padres, New York Yankees, California Angels, Toronto Blue Jays, Minnesota Twins, and Cleveland Indians. He had the winning hit in the 1992 World Series with the Blue Jays over the Atlanta Braves. Winfield was born the same day Bobby Thomson hit his pennant-winning home run for the New York Giants, known as \\"the shot heard 'round the world\\". He grew up in St. Paul, Minnesota. His parents divorced when he was three years old, leaving him and his older brother Stephen to be raised by their mother, Arline, and a large extended family of aunts, uncles, grandparents and cousins. The Winfield brothers honed their athletic skills in St. Paul's Oxford playground, where coach Bill Peterson was one of the first to take the young Winfield under his wing. Winfield did not become a formidable 6'6\\" athlete until his senior year of high school. He earned a full baseball scholarship to the University of Minnesota in 1969, where he starred in baseball and basketball for the Golden Gophers. His college baseball coach was former MLB player Dick Siebert. His basketball coach was Bill Musselman, who was later a head coach in the American Basketball Association and National Basketball Association and who later referred to Winfield as the best rebounder he ever coached. Winfield's 1972 Minnesota team won a Big Ten basketball championship, the school's first in 53 years. During the 1972 season, he also was involved in a brawl when Minnesota played Ohio State. Winfield also played for the Alaska Goldpanners for two seasons (1971-72) and was the MVP in 1972. In 1973, he was named All-American and voted MVP of the College World Series--as a pitcher. Following college, Winfield was drafted by four teams in three different sports. The San Diego Padres selected him as a pitcher with the fourth overall pick in the MLB draft and both the Atlanta Hawks (NBA) and the Utah Stars (ABA) drafted him. Though he never played college football, the Minnesota Vikings selected Winfield in the 17th round of the NFL draft.

Question: suppose more oxygen is produced happens, how will it affect MORE babies. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"C: No effect The process of human reproduction and development involves various stages, from mating to adulthood. While oxygen is essential for life and plays a critical role in the development and growth of a human being, an increase in oxygen production would not directly impact the number of babies being born. The question specified the following steps in the process: 1. A man and woman mate. 2. An embryo forms (C). 3. The embryo grows and develops into a fetus inside the woman's womb. 4. The fetus is born. 5. The child grows and develops through infancy and childhood. 6. The human experiences puberty during teenage years. 7. The human reaches sexual maturity. 8. At 18, the human is considered an adult. 9. The adult may procreate, continuing the cycle. Throughout these stages, oxygen is required for cellular respiration, growth, and overall development. Any changes in the oxygen concentration can affect the health of the individuals, but it would not directly determine the number of babies being produced. An increased production of oxygen would, in general, have its impact on the environment and perhaps on some living organisms. A higher atmospheric oxygen level might cause more rapid, intense fires or potentially affect some respiratory systems of species adapted to lower oxygen levels. However, this change would not directly influence the factors controlling human population growth or decline, such as the motivation to have children, socioeconomic conditions, availability of resources, overall health, and cultural norms. In the context of the reproduction process and considering the information given, the correct answer is C: No effect. An increase in oxygen production does not directly affect the number of babies born, as human reproduction is influenced by a variety of biological, social, and cultural factors that are not solely dependent on oxygen availability."},{"instruction":"Berkshire Hathaway’s Biggest Acquisitions Behind The Photo: Warren Buffett At J.P.

I can't find blue food--I can't find the flavor of blue! I mean yellow is lemon; orange is orange and red is cherry. Where is the blue food? \\" Well, Carlin pretty much has it right--there's not no blue food, but there's certainly not a lot of it. Fresh-picked blueberries are blue, though they become purple when they are turned into jam. The blue in blueberries--like the purple in grapes and the red in tomatoes--is found in nature. But it isn't a hot color for food. People don't seem to prefer blue food. Some diet programs even suggest that those determined to lose weight should make their food blue. Eating, in part, begins with our eyes. Charles Spence--an experimental psychologist from Oxford University--points out that color can change our taste experience. Commonly, we consider red-colored foods up to 20% sweeter than they actually are; and green foods as being more sour. Spence suggests: human expectations may be influenced by our long history of watching - green fruits can become sweet as they grow up and turn red. But what about blue? Except blueberries, much of the blue food we see these days _ blue artificially. Food producers argue that artificial color doesn't do much harm to health. A lot of research shows that some physical problems of kids are related to food dyes--while other studies show no effects at all.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"In the scenario where conditions are calm and rocks stay in one place, this perturbation can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. To better understand why, let's first review the steps of the rock formation process: 1. Wind or water breaks small pieces off of a rock. 2. The wind or water deposits tiny rocks. 3. The rocks become known as sediment. 4. The layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top. 5. Minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve. 6. Minerals glue the sediment together into a single rock. When conditions are calm, the transport and deposition of sediment (steps 2 and 3) are affected. Without wind or water currents to move the sediments, they may remain in their original location rather than being transported to new areas and deposited. Since the layers of sediment are crucial for the formation of sedimentary rocks, the absence of such layers would interrupt the normal rock formation process. However, the calm conditions do not directly alter any particular step. Instead, they create an environment where some steps might be less likely to occur, causing indirect effects on the overall process. It's important to remember that calm conditions may not completely halt rock formation; they may merely slow down or change the manner in which sediments accumulate and rocks form. For example, during calm conditions, sediment deposition may still occur due to gravity or other factors, such as chemical precipitation. These processes might take longer or lead to different rock characteristics than those formed through wind or water deposition. In summary, the perturbation of calm conditions and rocks staying in one place indirectly impacts a step of the process by affecting sediment transport and deposition. This may lead to a slower rock formation process or influence the characteristics of the sedimentary rock produced."},{"instruction":"Complete the following sentence.

Initially, the couple had thought that the peaceful and idyllic environment of the countryside would provide the perfect setting for their relationship to flourish. They had romanticized the idea of living close to nature, having more time to spend with each other, and the serenity that they believed would strengthen their bond. However, what they didn't anticipate was that the tranquil and unhurried lifestyle they thought would bring them closer together only served to create monotony and boredom in their lives. The lack of excitement, adventure, and stimulation in the country took a toll on their relationship. They began to drift apart, realizing that they had different interests, hobbies, and passions that weren't being fulfilled. The seclusion in the countryside didn't offer them enough opportunities to meet new people, explore various experiences, or engage in activities that were instrumental in enhancing their personal growth. When they moved to the city, their relationship found a fresh lease of life. The bustling, energetic, and vibrant atmosphere of the city introduced a tidal wave of excitement and novelty into their lives. The abundant options of cultural events, artistic performances, diverse group interests, and professional opportunities proved to be a catalyst for their personal growth and development. As they explored their individual interests, they each began to grow and evolve, which, in turn, positively affected their relationship. The city offered a rich canvas for them to develop shared experiences and create new memories together. They found motivation in pursuing their respective careers and passions, which were now within their reach. The cosmopolitan culture and diverse community in the city also exposed them to individuals from different walks of life. This allowed them to develop a broader perspective towards life and enabled them to appreciate and understand each other better. Therefore, it became evident that the city was the perfect breeding ground for their relationship to prosper and bloom. The country had been an unmotivating atmosphere for them, unable to cater to their personalities and aspirations, which caused their relationship to wither. In contrast, the city provided a nurturing environment in which they could rediscover each other and infuse their bond with fresh energy and enthusiasm to keep it thriving."},{"instruction":"Pick one category for the following text.

From subpar acting to a surprisingly hollow plot, \\"A\\" stands as a shining example of wasted potential. The plot kicks off in a disjointed manner, creating a confusing jumble of events and characters that makes it difficult for the audience to become invested in the story. Though one might hope for it to improve as the film progresses, unfortunately, the scattered storyline only becomes murkier with every passing minute. The character development or lack thereof, is easily the movie's biggest weakness. It is hard for audiences to root for, or even relate to, the remarkably one-dimensional characters that populate the film. The protagonist's emotional arc feels contrived and rushed, while the remaining cast seems to exist solely to fill out the runtime. Moreover, the cast's lackluster performances leave much to be desired. Stiff facial expressions and monotonous line deliveries contribute to the fact that the emotions projected onscreen are far from genuine or engaging. In fact, the film's primary antagonist could serve as a case study in wooden acting, coming off as more of an irritating distraction than a menacing presence. Visually, \\"A\\" does little to redeem itself, as subtlety and nuance seem to be foreign concepts to the director. Rather than utilizing the visual medium to effectively convey the story's themes or emotions, the film relies heavily on ham-fisted, on-the-nose imagery. As a result, it frequently feels like the movie is desperately shouting its intentions rather than artfully presenting them. In conclusion, the movie \\"A\\" is an unfortunate misfire, unable to deliver on its initial premise. It is a forgettable experience that squanders the potential of its narrative, quite possibly leaving viewers eager to exit the theater. Save your time and energy for a film that truly delves into the human experience, and skip this cinematic disappointment."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: The Bishop of Chester called for more curbs on what young people can access on the internet. And he warned that porn users can become addicted to it like people who are dependent on alcohol or drugs. The government has promised new laws forcing \\"adult\\" websites to introduce age restrictions. The Bishop of Chester cited a Bristol University study of 13 to 17-year-olds found that 40% had suffered sexual coercion \\"ranging from rape to being pressurised into unwanted sexual activity often with elements of physical violence\\". And a BBC survey of 700 children aged 12 and 13 suggested that 20% had seen porn that shocked or upset them, and more than 10% had made, or taken part in, a sexually explicit video, the Bishop told peers. He confessed to peers that he had \\"limited knowledge\\" of pornography - but said two of his clergy had been prosecuted for downloading illegal images of children. \\"I understand that the sheer volume of cases of down loading child pornography has overwhelmed the police to the point where prosecutions are no longer routinely brought,\\" the Bishop said. Quoting the author DH Lawrence, the Bishop said: \\"Pornography is the attempt to insult sex, to do dirt on it.\\" Labour's Lord Giddens, a well known social scientist, said more research on the impact of pornography was needed before \\"intrusive policy\\" of the kind being considered by the government was introduced. \\"We just don't know at this point how far regular exposure to pornography on the part of minors affects their actual sexual behaviour, how far it damages relationships, leads to addictive behaviour and so forth, or crucially, on what scale, we just don't know on what scale,\\" he told peers. He backed government efforts to protect vulnerable children but argued much of the data on the subject was \\"superficial\\". \\"There is a very fine line to tread. If children are shielded too much and for too long they may not be able to cope simply when plunged into the maelstrom that is sexuality today,\\" he added. Conservative peer Lord Farmer warned that the \\"premature sexualisation of young minds\\" was reinforcing outdated stereotypes that women were \\"primarily sex objects to provide men with sexual gratification\\". For the Liberal Democrats, Lord Scriven said the \\"underage\\" had to be protected but cautioned those who thought there was a technological solution alone through online filtering. \\"We need to be much cleverer,\\" he said. \\"It's about parents talking openly with children about sexuality and the issues around pornography.\\" If consenting adults wanted to watch porn \\"to spice up their sex lives\\", legislators had a \\"very limited\\" role to play in this, Lord Scriven said. Lord Collins of Highbury, for Labour, said \\"good quality, age appropriate, sex and relationship education is vital\\" to enable young people to understand what was appropriate and inappropriate behaviour and resist pressures. Prime Minister David Cameron has promised legislation to protect children from online pornography by forcing sites to introduce \\"age filters,\\" something several UK service providers have already done on a voluntary basis. Speaking earlier this month at prime minister's questions, he said the UK had secured an opt-out to an EU ruling which demanded all online traffic passes \\"without discrimination, restriction or interference\\".","output":"The Bishop of Chester, a religious leader, wants more rules on the internet to protect young people from seeing things meant for adults.

Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll.

Therefore, I will elaborate on the intricacies and importance of concise communication, touching on the power and effectiveness of clear, unambiguous language in various contexts, including writing, public speaking, and interpersonal communication. Concise communication is a fundamental aspect of effective expression, allowing individuals to convey their thoughts, ideas, and opinions in a manner that is easily understood and absorbed by their audience. This skill is especially important when considering the limited attention span of most individuals today, due in large part to the constant bombardment of information from various sources, such as social media, news outlets, and other digital platforms. In the realm of writing, a brief sentence is typically comprised of a subject, verb, and object, which together convey the main point or idea. This straightforward construction lends itself to greater comprehension, fostering a better understanding among readers. Additionally, concise writing often flows more smoothly and can be more engaging than lengthy, convoluted prose. Whether it's in an academic paper, a journalistic article, or a creative piece, an author who can express their thoughts concisely is more likely to maintain their reader's interest, ultimately leading to a stronger impact. Public speaking is another area in which a brief sentence can effectively convey meaning. In many instances, speeches may be subject to strict time constraints, requiring a speaker to craft a message that is both powerful and efficient. A concise statement can make a lasting impression on listeners by highlighting the key points, while still allowing time for the speaker to elaborate on specific ideas. This concept is particularly important in the case of professional presentations, political debates, and ceremonial speeches, where the time allotted to each participant is limited by design. In interpersonal communication, every conversation benefits from brevity and clarity. Individuals who are able to express their thoughts concisely and with precision tend to be perceived as more reliable and knowledgeable. A clear, focused message is also more likely to be well-received and effectively address the topic at hand. By utilizing brief sentences in everyday conversation, one can improve relationships, build credibility, and enhance the overall quality of communication.

Question: How do birds communicate indirectly? Context: Birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where \\"dances\\" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.

The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.

Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no A step-by-step solution is:","output":"1. Analyze the premise: The premise is \\"A dog leaping off a boat.\\" This statement describes a dog that is jumping off of some kind of boat. 2. Analyze the hypothesis: The hypothesis is \\"Dog jumping into the river.\\" This statement describes a dog jumping specifically into a river. 3. Compare the premise and the hypothesis: In order to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to compare the two statements and check if the premise necessarily implies that the hypothesis is true. 4. Identify differences: The main difference between the premise and the hypothesis is the specific location where the dog is jumping. In the premise, the dog is simply jumping off a boat, while in the hypothesis, the dog is jumping into a river. 5. Assess entailment: Since the premise only mentions the dog leaping off a boat and does not specifically mention a river, it is not possible to tell if the dog is actually jumping into a river or not. There could be other bodies of water or even land where the boat is located. 6. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, it is not possible to tell if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. The premise does not provide enough information to determine whether the dog is jumping into a river or another body of water or onto land."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Jordan started to feel better after taking some medication for their headache.

As frontman of the Boys Next Door (later renamed the Birthday Party), he became a central figure in Melbourne's burgeoning post-punk scene. Cave released his first book, King Ink, in 1988. It is a collection of lyrics and plays, including collaborations with Lydia Lunch. In 1997, he followed up with King Ink II, containing lyrics, poems, and the transcript of a radio essay he did for the BBC in July 1996, \\"The Flesh Made Word,\\" discussing in biographical format his relationship with Christianity. While he was based in West Berlin, Cave started working on what was to become his debut novel, And the Ass Saw the Angel (1989). Significant crossover is evident between the themes in the book and the lyrics Cave wrote in the late stages of the Birthday Party and the early stage of his solo career. \\"Swampland\\", from Mutiny, in particular, uses the same linguistic stylings ('mah' for 'my', for instance) and some of the same themes (the narrator being haunted by the memory of a girl called Lucy, being hunted like an animal, approaching death and execution). On 21 January 2008, a special edition of Cave's novel And the Ass Saw the Angel was released. Cave's second novel The Death of Bunny Munro was published on 8 September 2009 by Harper Collins books. Telling the story of a sex-addicted salesman, it was also released as a binaural audio-book produced by British Artists Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard and an iPhone app. The book originally started as a screenplay Cave was going to write for John Hillcoat. Aside from movie soundtracks, Cave also wrote the screenplays for Hillcoat's The Proposition in 2005, and Lawless (based on the novel by Matt Bondurant) in 2011. As proof of his interest in scripture, so evident in his lyrics and his prose writing, Cave wrote the foreword to a Canongate publication of the Gospel according to Mark, published in the UK in 1998. The American edition of the same book (published by Grove Press) contains a foreword by the noted American writer Barry Hannah. Cave is a contributor to a 2009 rock biography of the Triffids, Vagabond Holes: David McComb and the Triffids, edited by Australian academics Niall Lucy and Chris Coughran.

Article: HANGZHOU, China -- Millions of Chinese basketball fans who were upset about the retirement of Yao Ming, are excited to see another even more shining star, Jeremy Lin, rising from the N.B.A and becoming a household name all across China. \\"We are amazed by Lin Shuhao's magic performance and should cheer him on,\\" one Internet user wrote. \\"His sport shirts have sold out, even including the counterfeit ones,\\" said Zheng Xiaojun, a 24-year-old clerk. Lin's amazing success over the last month has caught the imagination of the Chinese. He has been particularly popular here in northern Zhejiang province, from which his grandmother went to Taiwan in the late 1940s. Cai Qi, a well-known micro blogger, posted a message on micro blog over the weekend stating that Lin's hometown is Jiaxing, a city near Hangzhou where Lin's grandmother grew up. Cai Qi's nephew Yu Guohua, a 56-year-old factory worker, is Lin's closest still living in northern Zhejiang. He said in a telephone interview that Lin had come to play basketball with the Jiaxing High School team last May and had been surrounded by admirers. Yu said he did not have a chance to meet Lin in the crowd, but managed to speak with his family. \\"His father was very supportive of Lin's playing basketball, but his grandmother was not, for fear he would be injured,\\" Yu said. Lin may owe his height, 6 feet 3 inches, to his grandmother's family, Yu said. Chen Weiji, the father of Lin's grandmother, was well over 6 feet and all of Chen's children were tall as well, he said. The N.B.A. believes that 300 million people in China play basketball. The retirement last year of Yao Ming took its main Asian draw away from the N.B.A. But Lin's appearance has helped the league remain a hot topic of Chinese online chatter. Question: Lin's success in N.B.A has _ . Answer: Answer:","output":"Lin's success in the NBA has excited millions of Chinese basketball fans, making him a household name across China, and helped the league remain a hot topic of Chinese online chatter.

Le: OK, so how can I answer with some explanation?","output":"To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, let's break down the information given in the premise and examine how it relates to the hypothesis. Premise: \\"A few soccer players intently watch the ball and the goalie.\\" This statement tells us that: 1. There are soccer players (more than one) present. 2. These players are actively observing the ball and the goalie. Hypothesis: \\"There are people playing soccer.\\" The hypothesis suggests that people are engaged in playing the sport of soccer. Now let's consider the connection between the premise and the hypothesis. The presence of soccer players watching the ball and the goalie indicates that they are engaged in an activity related to the game of soccer. The act of intently watching the elements of the game (ball and goalie) implies that these soccer players are involved in the soccer match or at least paying attention to the ongoing gameplay. Based on this information, it is reasonable to infer that the hypothesis \\"There are people playing soccer\\" is entailed by the premise, since the premise provides evidence of soccer players actively participating in or observing the components of a soccer game."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Arabic.

Step 2: Compare meanings - Both phrases refer to a person who was once married to Roxanne. However, \\"ex-husband\\" explicitly specifies that the person is male, while \\"former spouse\\" could refer to either a husband or wife.

Soon her shooting ability became well known. When she was sixteen, she was invited to a competition with a famous marksman , Frank Butler. Annie surprised everyone by winning the competition. Later that year she and Frank married. In 1882, Annie Oakley and Frank Butler started putting on shows together. Frank Butler was the star of the show and she was his assistant. The famous Native American leader, Sitting Bull, thought so highly of her shooting ability that he called her \\"Little Sure Shot\\".

Like post-punk, the term has been applied to a broad constellation of groups. The genre took shape in the mid to late 1980s with releases by bands from cities that had established hardcore scenes, such as Fugazi from Washington, D.C. as well as groups such as Big Black and Jawbox that stuck closer to post-hardcore's noise rock roots. - Q and Not U was a post-hardcore band from Washington, D.C., signed to Dischord Records. Members John Davis, Harris Klahr, Christopher Richards, and Matt Borlik formed the band in 1998. After Borlik's departure following the release of their first album, the band went on to record two more critically acclaimed LPs as a three-piece, exploring aspects of dance-punk, and other disparate musical styles. Q and Not U disbanded in September 2005 after completing their touring commitments and a short farewell stand at Washington, D.C. venue The Black Cat. - Dance-punk (also known as disco-punk or punk funk) is a music genre that emerged in the late 1970s, and is closely associated with the post-punk and new wave movements. - Power was the 3rd and final album by Q and Not U. It was released on October 5 , 2004 . After touring in support of the album , the group disbanded in September 2005 . The album was co-produced by Pete Cafarella and Rafael Cohen ( of Supersystem ) . All tracking was done at The Love Story in Brooklyn , NY . The album was mixed with Don Zientara at Inner Ear Studio and mastered by Chad Clark at Silver Sonya . - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - Dischord Records is a Washington, D.C.-based independent record label specializing in the independent punk rock music of the D.C.-area music scene. The label is co-owned by Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, who founded Dischord in 1980 to release \\"Minor Disturbance\\" by The Teen Idles. Along with other independent American labels such as Twin/Tone, Touch and Go Records, and SST Records, Dischord helped to spearhead the nationwide network of underground bands that formed the pre-Nirvana indie-rock scene. These labels presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging. - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums. - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices. - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan.

After a meal, Mr. Hussey notes his watch has stopped at the stroke of twelve, as has the watch of Miss McCraw. With permission from Mlle. de Poitiers, Miranda, Marion and Irma decide to explore Hanging Rock and take measurements, with Edith allowed to follow. The group is observed several minutes later by a young Englishman, Michael Fitzhubert (Dominic Guard), who is lunching at the Rock with his uncle Colonel Fitzhubert (Peter Collingwood), aunt Mrs. Fitzhubert (Olga Dickie), and valet Albert (John Jarratt).

The cubs were born in zoos in China and removed from their mothers when they were three months old.Their first home in South Africa was a one-acre camp where they stayed for a month.Their next home was a ten acre area,where they lived for three months to help them gradually get used to life outside a cage.

The claim states that \\"Waiting for Godot\\" expresses existential dread with a humorous style. Step 2: Understand the context of both existential dread and humorous style elements in \\"Waiting for Godot.\\" \\"Waiting for Godot\\" is a play written by Samuel Beckett. It's categorized as an absurdist play, known for its peculiar characters, seemingly meaningless dialogue, and lack of a clear plot. Existential dread refers to the anxiety or fear associated with the lack of purpose or meaning in life. A humorous style usually incorporates elements of comedy, wit, or irony to make the audience laugh or feel amused. Step 3: Analyze the play for elements of existential dread and humorous style. - Existential dread: \\"Waiting for Godot\\" features two main characters, Vladimir and Estragon, who constantly wait for a man called Godot, who never appears. This waiting and lack of purpose can represent existential dread. - Humorous style: Beckett uses wit, irony, and absurdity in the dialogue and actions of the characters to create a sense of humor and amusement. Step 4: Determine if the claim is valid based on the analysis. As we find elements of both existential dread and a humorous style in \\"Waiting for Godot,\\" we can conclude that the claim is true.

Kyle bought hamsters for the children, which annoyed Leslie because Choose your answer from: i. Kyle did not know how much work they are. ii. Leslie did not know how much work they are.","output":"ii. Leslie did not know how much work they are. The moment Kyle arrived home with the furry little creatures, the children's eyes lit up with excitement. They had always wanted pets, and Kyle thought that hamsters would be the perfect choice. However, Leslie was less than thrilled. Unaware of just how much work hamsters entailed, she assumed they would be low-maintenance pets that the kids could essentially look after themselves—a fatal flaw in her reasoning. Step 1: Introducing the hamsters: Kyle came up with a plan to show Leslie and the children the proper care for the hamsters by giving them each a handbook on hamster care he had bought at the pet store. He hoped that the extra information would make the transition to being hamster owners go smoothly. Step 2: Acquiring the right habitat: Next, Kyle showed them how to set up the hamster cage with everything the little creatures needed—a wheel for exercise, tunnels for hiding, a house for sleeping, a water bottle, and a food dish. Additionally, he taught them about the importance of keeping the cage clean and changing out the bedding regularly. Step 3: Establishing a feeding schedule: Leslie had no idea that hamsters required a consistent diet of pellets, fruits, and vegetables. To ensure the hamsters would receive proper nutrition, Kyle got the family together to create a feeding schedule that everyone could stick to. Each family member would take turns feeding the hamsters and ensuring they always had fresh water. Step 4: Teaching the children how to handle the hamsters: Hamsters can be quite skittish, so Kyle had to instruct the kids on how to approach and handle them gently. He emphasized that these were living creatures that needed to be treated with respect and care. Step 5: Ensuring the hamsters had social interaction: Kyle also explained the necessity for the hamsters to have some social interaction with their human caretakers. He planned activities like allowing the hamsters to explore their environment, making sure they were safe and supervised during these activities. Step 6: Setting up boundaries: Although the children were eager to play with their new pets as much as possible, Kyle made it very clear that there were times when the hamsters needed to be left alone. They needed adequate rest and shouldn't be over-stressed by too much human interaction. As Leslie and the children learned more about the responsibilities involved in caring for the hamsters, they started to grasp the amount of work that came with being pet owners. Gradually, they were able to create a routine that revolved around the hamsters' needs, balancing their own life with that of their new pets. Leslie's initial annoyance slowly faded away, replaced by the joy of watching her children bond with and care for the furry additions to their family. In the end, the hamsters became a beloved part of the family, providing countless moments of entertainment, education, and responsibility for all."},{"instruction":"Question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Each block of candy produces 30 pieces, so for 3 blocks, Jan will have: 3 blocks × 30 pieces/block = 90 pieces. Since each candy necklace has 10 pieces of candies, the total number of candy necklaces that can be made from the 90 pieces is: 90 pieces ÷ 10 pieces/necklace = 9 candy necklaces. If Jan makes one candy necklace for herself, she would have: 9 candy necklaces - 1 (for Jan) = 8 candy necklaces remaining. Thus, Jan can make candy necklaces for 8 of her friends."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - Lyon or (more archaically) Lyons (or ) is a city in east-central France, in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, about from Paris and from Marseille.

Each week, they take to the field to compete against their opponents, in the quest to become the best in the league. In this article, we will review the Ravens' last week's matchup, exploring the strengths and weaknesses displayed by both teams during the captivating game. The Opponent: The Week Before In the previous week, the Baltimore Ravens went head-to-head with the Cincinnati Bengals in a highly anticipated face-off. The Bengals are a fellow AFC North team, and their games against the Ravens have always generated lively interest and great competitive spirit. History shows that matches between these two teams have provided no shortage of thrilling moments and exhilarating plays over the years. Pre-Game Analysis: Before the game began, both teams were keenly aware of the high stakes involved, as a victory could significantly improve their standings in the competitive AFC North division. The Ravens, led by their dynamic young quarterback Lamar Jackson, were focused on showcasing their potent offensive capabilities, while the Cincinnati Bengals, under the guidance of their head coach Zac Taylor, were prepared to counter with a strong defensive strategy in an effort to neutralize the Ravens' attack. The Key Players: For the Baltimore Ravens, Lamar Jackson took center stage as the team's most valuable player, thanks to his abilities to elude defenders and make big plays through both the passing game and his legs as a rusher. In addition to Jackson, the Ravens' formidable offensive arsenal includes running back J.K. Dobbins, tight end Mark Andrews, and wide receiver Marquise Brown. All of these players were expected to play key roles in the team's efforts to overcome their opponents. On the other hand, the Cincinnati Bengals were not without their own share of outstanding talent. Their offensive unit features quarterback Joe Burrow, the first overall pick of the 2020 NFL Draft, along with an impressive set of pass-catchers like wide receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, and running back Joe Mixon. Their defense, led by pass-rusher Trey Hendrickson and safety Jessie Bates III, was ready to ensure the Ravens did not have a walk in the park. Game Highlights: As the game unfolded, the Baltimore Ravens showcased their impressive offensive prowess with a strong ground game, complementing the acrobatics of Lamar Jackson. The Ravens' relentless attack managed to crack the Bengals defense, leading the team to score multiple touchdowns. On the defense, the Ravens were equally relentless, putting pressure on Joe Burrow, and disrupting the Bengals' passing game. Conversely, the Cincinnati Bengals struggled to find their footing, especially during the first half of the game. Their defense, though initially fierce, became noticeably weakened as the game progressed, ceding ground to the Ravens' unrelenting offense. On the offensive side, Burrow and his unit worked diligently yet faced substantial difficulty in breaking through the Ravens' wall-like defense. Post-Game Analysis: In the end, the Baltimore Ravens emerged victorious against the Cincinnati Bengals, adding another win to their ongoing quest for dominance in the AFC North. The Ravens' well-rounded performance truly showcased their resilience, discipline, and ingenuity as one of the NFL's elite franchises. In contrast, though the Bengals displayed moments of brilliance, their inability to capitalize on the few weaknesses presented by the Ravens ultimately led to their downfall. Nevertheless, they remain a formidable adversary that is likely to grow and improve with each passing week. Conclusion: The matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and the Cincinnati Bengals ended with the Ravens claiming victory, setting the stage for an exciting season ahead. As Lamar Jackson and his offensive unit continue to entertain and impress, fans eagerly await their next challenge."},{"instruction":"Write a positive movie review.","output":"Step 1: Watch the movie As an AI, I don't have the ability to watch the movie.

Honeybees play a crucial role in the pollination of a wide variety of plants, many of which are important food sources for humans and other animals. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), approximately 75% of the world's leading food crops depend on pollinators such as honeybees. The primary causes of this alarming decline include habitat loss, pesticide exposure, climate change, and the spread of diseases and pests. However, despite these factors, some regions have reported stable or even increasing bee populations. Researchers across various disciplines are working to better understand the reasons for the decline and how to effectively prevent it. Hypothesis: One possible explanation for the observed stability or increase in bee populations in certain regions is the implementation of effective bee conservation strategies tailored to local conditions. These strategies may include the restoration of habitats, reduced use of pesticides, the development of climate-resilient plant varieties, and the targeted control of pests and diseases. By studying and comparing regions with stable or increasing bee populations against those with declining populations, researchers can identify specific factors that contribute to the success of local conservation efforts. This information can then be used to develop more effective global conservation strategies for honeybees, ultimately helping to safeguard our food supply and ecosystem."},{"instruction":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

Robert visits the Ferris wheel and his Geiger counter clicks slowly. Thomas visits the merry go round and his Geiger counter begins to click rapidly. and a hint : One reason radiation is dangerous is that it can’t be detected with the senses. You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. You can see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below. Please answer this question : Which person's Geiger count has less current running through it? Answer:","output":"Robert's Geiger counter has less current running through it. In the given situation, Robert and Thomas are visiting an abandoned amusement park in Russia that is rumored to emit radiation. They both have Geiger counters to detect the radiation levels around them as it is not detectable by human senses. When Robert visits the Ferris wheel, his Geiger counter clicks slowly, while Thomas's Geiger counter clicks rapidly when he visits the merry go round. The clicking speed of a Geiger counter is an indication of the level of radiation. A faster clicking speed corresponds to higher radiation levels, which means more ions are produced, and hence a higher electric current is generated. Conversely, a slower clicking speed indicates lower radiation levels, with fewer ions produced and a lower electric current. Since Robert's Geiger counter clicks slowly, it indicates that the Ferris wheel area has lower radiation levels compared to the merry go round area where Thomas is. Therefore, Robert's Geiger counter has less current running through it compared to Thomas's Geiger counter.

His stammering speech visibly unsettles the thousands of listeners in the audience. The prince tries several unsuccessful treatments and gives up, until the Duchess persuades him to see Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an Australian speech therapist.In their first session, Logue requests that they address each other by their Christian names, a breach of royal etiquette: Logue tells the prince that he will be calling him Bertie from now on. At first, Bertie is reluctant to receive treatment, but Logue bets Bertie a shilling that he can read perfectly at that very moment, and gives him Hamlet's \\"To be, or not to be\\" soliloquy to read aloud, with music blaring so that he can't hear himself.

Instead of just letting life happen to you, goals allow you to make your life happen. Successful and happy people have an idea of how their life should be and they set lots of goals to help them succeed. By setting goals you are taking control of your life. It's like having a map to show you where you want to go. Think of it this way. There are two drivers. One has a destination in mind which is laid out for her on a map. She can drive straight there without any wasted time or wrong turns. The other driver has no goal or destination or map. She starts off at the same time from the same place as the first driver, but she drives without an aim around, never getting anywhere, just using up gas and oil. Which driver do you want to be? Winners in life set goals and follow through on them. Winners decide what they want in life and then get there by making plans and setting goals. Unsuccessful people just let life happen by accident. Goals aren't difficult to set--and they aren't difficult to reach. It's up to you to find out what your goals and ideals really are. Research tells us that when we write a goal down, we are more likely to achieve. Written goals can be reviewed regularly,and have more power.

He stumbles onto the set of a World War I movie and isn't sure if he has accidentally caused the death of one of the film's stunt men. The eccentric and autocratic director, Eli Cross (Peter O'Toole), agrees to hide Cameron from the police if he will take the dead man's place. Cameron soon begins to suspect that Cross is putting him in excessive danger. At a bar one night, another member of the production gets drunk and tells Cameron that Eli almost killed the helicopter pilot during the fatal accident Cameron caused, because he insisted he keep flying in order to get the shot. Cameron falls in love with Nina Franklin (Barbara Hershey), the film's star, and is devastated to find out that she and Eli slept together before he met her. The boundaries between reality and fiction become increasingly blurred as Cross exercises godlike control over the production. During a screening of some footage for Nina's parents who are visiting the production, a nude sex scene with Nina is shown. Eli appears to be mortified, but allows the footage to play anyway. He waits until Nina is just about to shoot a traumatic scene the next day to tell her that her parents have seen the footage of her naked. It causes her to cry with humiliation, which seems to be the exact emotion Eli needs from her in the scene. The final day of filming involves a complicated stunt where Cameron has to drive a vintage Duesenberg off a bridge. Nina has two other scenes to shoot as well, but Cameron is convinced Eli will rig the stunt so he will die. He persuades Nina to run away with him, but they are unable to leave the set, which is kept sealed from the neighboring town by the police on Eli's orders. Nina hides in the trunk of the Duesenberg, promising to slip away with Cameron during the stunt.

What can a certain protein affect in meat? Options: - (A) health - (B) piousness - (C) stamina - (D) retina - (E) toughness - (F) liveliness - (G) saltiness - (H) Energy What is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: (E)?","output":"To arrive at the answer (E) toughness, we can go through a step-by-step reasoning process by analyzing each option and its relation to proteins in meat: 1. (A) Health: Proteins are essential nutrients that contribute to overall health. However, since the question specifically asks about what a certain protein can affect in meat, this option doesn't address this query directly. 2. (B) Piousness: Piousness is a measure of religious devotion. It has no connection with proteins in meat or any biological processes. This option can be eliminated. 3. (C) Stamina: Stamina refers to physical endurance. Although consuming protein from meat can affect an individual's stamina as part of a balanced diet, it doesn't directly involve the effects of proteins within the meat itself. This option can be eliminated. 4. (D) Retina: The retina is part of the eye and is involved in vision. There is no direct relationship between proteins in meat and the retina. This option can be eliminated. 5. (E) Toughness: Proteins in meat, such as collagen and myofibrillar proteins, contribute directly to the meat's texture. Higher protein content, especially collagen, can increase the toughness of the meat. This option seems plausible, so we'll keep it for now. 6. (F) Liveliness: Liveliness is a general term describing the state of being active or energetic. It isn't directly connected to proteins in meat and doesn't reflect the impact of proteins on meat's characteristics. This option can be eliminated. 7. (G) Saltiness: Saltiness is a taste related to the presence of salts such as sodium chloride. Proteins can influence the flavor of meat but would not directly affect the saltiness. This option can be eliminated. 8. (H) Energy: Proteins in meat do provide energy when consumed, similar to option (A), so although it plays a role in energy, it doesn't answer the question about the direct impact of a certain protein within the meat. This option can be eliminated. Conclusion: After analyzing all the options, we can conclude that option (E) toughness is the correct choice as it describes the direct effect of proteins, such as collagen, on the texture and characteristics of meat."},{"instruction":"încurajarea unei creşteri a vârstei la care poate fi pretinsă pensia.

A child prodigy, he began drawing at age two; by the time he was ten, his work was displayed in local art shows. His first efforts in animation included a series of flip books that he produced in his school text books. As a child, Povenmire considered animator Chuck Jones his hero; in a 2009 interview, he stated that \\"every drawing he [Jones] did was beautiful to look at and had so much energy in it\\". Povenmire later became a director on Family Guy, starting with the season two episode, \\"Road to Rhode Island\\". Creator Seth MacFarlane granted Povenmire substantial creative freedom. Povenmire recalled that MacFarlane would tell him \\"We've got two minutes to fill. Give me some visual gags. Do whatever you want. I trust you.\\" Povenmire praised MacFarlane's management style for letting him \\"have [...] fun.\\" Povenmire brought realism and material from his own experiences to the visual direction of Family Guy. For \\"One if By Clam, Two if By Sea\\" (August 1, 2001), several characters demonstrate Fosse-like moves in prison. To correctly depict the moves, Povenmire asked color artist Cynthia MacIntosh, who had been a professional dancer, to strike poses so he could properly illustrate the sequence. In the episode \\"To Love and Die in Dixie\\" (November 15, 2001), Povenmire drew on his childhood in the Deep South to create and sequence a background scene in which the redneck character nonchalantly kicks a corpse into the nearby river. \\"Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows\\" (January 17, 2002), a Family Guy episode which Povenmire directed, won the Emmy Award for Best Song. Creator MacFarlane, the recipient of the award, noted that Povenmire deserved to have received the award for the contribution the visuals made to the episode's win. Povenmire jokingly responded \\"That's a nice sentiment and all, but did he offer to give me his? No! And it's not like he doesn't already have two of his own just sitting in his house!\\" Povenmire was nominated for an Annie Award for Directing in an Animated Television Production for the episode \\"PTV\\" (November 6, 2005) but lost out to a fellow Family Guy director Peter Shin, who had directed the episode \\"North by North Quahog\\". Povenmire and several others were also nominated for their work on \\"PTV\\" in the Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour) category at the Primetime Emmy Awards. Povenmire also received the same nomination for \\"Road to Rhode Island.\\" During Family Guy's brief cancellation, Povenmire was offered a job as storyboard director of the series SpongeBob SquarePants.

His father was a railway signalman of Irish extraction, and his mother worked as a weaver at Harrowby Mill. His father left the family 18 months after Lawton was born, and Elizabeth moved back into her parents' home in Bolton. Elizabeth's father, James Hugh \\"Jim\\" Riley, became Lawton's surrogate father. Lawton played his first game for Burnley Reserves against Manchester City Reserves in September 1935, and though he struggled in this game he went on to become a regular Reserve team player by the age of 16. After a poor run of form from Cecil Smith, Lawton was selected ahead of Smith for the Second Division game against Doncaster Rovers at Turf Moor on 28 March 1936; aged 16 years and 174 days, this made him the youngest centre-forward ever to play in the Football League. Rovers centre-half Syd Bycroft, also making his league debut, marked Lawton out of the game, which ended in a 1-1 draw. Burnley had played poorly, though Lawton was praised for his \\"keen and fearless\\" performance by the Express & News newspaper. He retained his place for the following game, and scored two goals in a 3-1 victory over Swansea Town at Vetch Field. He picked up a groin strain in his third appearance which caused him to miss two fixtures, before he returned to the first team for the final four games of the 1935-36 season; he claimed three more goals to take his season tally to five goals from seven games. Lawton continued to train his heading skills intensely in the summer of 1936, and also played cricket for Burnley Cricket Club as a batsman in the Lancashire League. He scored a six against both Learie Constantine and Amar Singh. He scored 369 runs in 15 completed innings for an average of 24.06. He turned professional at Burnley at the age of 17 on wages of PS7 a week. His grandfather attempted to negotiate a PS500 signing-on fee on his behalf but was rebuffed after the club alerted Charles Sutcliffe, Secretary of the Football League, who informed them that any attempt to circumvent the league's maximum wage was illegal. Lawton scored in his first appearance since signing the contract after just 30 seconds, before going on to record a hat-trick in a 3-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur, scoring a goal with either foot and one with his head. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did anything else happen to him?","output":"Yes, numerous events occurred in Thomas Lawton's life, such as playing for Burnley Reserves, becoming a regular Reserve team player at age 16, making his league debut, scoring goals in various matches, training his heading skills, playing cricket for Burnley Cricket Club, and turning professional at Burnley at the age of 17.

As most electronics use more fragile, thinner wires, anything too corrosive may risk damaging them and shorting your circuit. Find a rosin-based solder at your local hardware store when working with electronics. If you're working with something bigger than electrical wiring, such as copper piping, you'll need something more corrosive. Acid flux or tinning flux will remove larger areas of oxidization and give you a much stronger soldering job. Tinning flux has small amounts of a powdered metal alloy mixed into the paste. The powder will melt with the flux and help fill the inside of the pipe you are soldering, making it more waterproof and longer-lasting. Leaded solder will melt at a lower temperature than other types, which makes it better for delicate electrical wiring. Ask at your local hardware or electronics store for leaded or electrical solder and you should have a small variety of types to choose from. Here are a few key differences in types of solder that may come up: Lead-free electrical solder will also work for small wiring projects. It is more environmentally-friendly as it doesn't contain lead, but also will not hold quite as strong. Some leaded solders will come with a rosin core. This means that they are slightly hollow and will have a thin line of rosin flux running through the middle. It will only be a small amount, so it shouldn't replace other flux, but it will increase the flux coating of your wires. Leaded solders that are solid all the way through and don't have a rosin core are also a solid choice. These may oxidize slightly more, but as long as you are using soldering flux they should still hold strongly for a long time. If you are using leaded solder, make sure to wash your hands once you have finished working with it as the lead is toxic. Silver has a much higher melting point than lead, so it works much better for larger soldering projects. Ask for pipe or silvered solder at your local hardware store when working with pipes. You should never use lead-based solder when working with piping that will carry water, as the lead is toxic and will make the water unsafe to drink. While lead-free solder may work when soldering pipes, it won't be as strong or as durable as silvered solder. Plug in or turn on your soldering iron to start heating it up. Once it is hot, use a damp sponge to clean away any solder left on the tip of the iron, making sure to never touch the hot end of the iron while it is on. Always keep your soldering iron in a stand while it is on. The tip will get very hot, so it shouldn't be allowed to rest on any surfaces as this may start a fire. Don't leave your soldering iron unattended while you are using it. Apply a small amount of solder to the end of your soldering iron once it has heated up and been cleaned. Once the tip is covered and has a shiny appearance, you can wipe away any excess on the same damp sponge. This is called \\"tinning\\" your iron and will stop it from oxidizing as you work with it. As pipes are much bigger and more solid than intricate wiring, a soldering iron may take a long time to heat a pipe up to the right temperature. Use a propane torch or something similar when soldering with pipes. For the best results, adjust the torch until you have a blue flame around 2 inches (5.1 cm) long, and hold the tip of the flame to the pipes. Make sure you always light your blowtorch away from yourself and use proper safety precautions when working with it. Wear protective, tinted glasses, fire-proof leather gloves and flame-retardant clothing for extra safety. Getting the perfect temperature with a blowtorch may take more practice than when working with a soldering iron. If the flux you are working with begins smoldering and turns black, it's a sign you are using too much heat. If the solder doesn't melt when touched to pipes, you might not be using enough. Keep practicing until you get a sense of the right way to work.","output":"To clean wires, use a rosin-based solder that you can find in a store. For bigger things like pipes, use stronger stuff like acid flux or tinning flux. There are different kinds of solder, like lead-free and leaded, and some with rosin inside. For pipes, use silver solder instead of lead solder, because lead is not safe for water. When using a soldering iron, be careful because it's hot. Clean and tin the iron to protect it. For pipes, use a propane torch instead of a soldering iron, and be very safe while using it. Practice to find the right temperature when soldering."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: - nationalyears is 2000 - youthclubs is al-karkh al-zawraa - ntupdate is n/a - birth date is 22 december 1983 - clubs is al-karkh al-zawraa sanat naft al-zawraa al-talaba - nationalcaps is 3 - currentclub is al-zawraa - height is 1.83 0 - nationalgoals is ? - nationalteam is iraq - birth place is iraq - position is midfielder - fullname is ghaith abdul-ghani - years is 1994-1996 1996-2000 2005-2007 2007-2009 2009 - - clubnumber is 15 - youthyears is 1994-1996 1996-2000 - pcupdate is n/a Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Article: How to deal successfully with a child who shows outstanding musical ability?It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage his gift.Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their children's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour.And while most schools are equipped to deal with children who are specially able in academic subjects,the musically gifted require special understanding which may not always be available in an ordinary school--especially one where music is regarded as a secondary activity.Such children may well benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. The five music schools in Britain are a relatively recent introduction.They aim to provide an environment in which gifted children aged between seven and eighteen can develop their skills to the full under the guidance of professional musicians. Children at specialist music schools spend between one third and one half of an average day on musical activities,for example,individual lessons,orchestras,chamber groups,voice training,conducting and theory.They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms,sometimes with a teacher.The rest of their time is taken up with the subjects:English,maths,basic sciences and languages.All five British specialist schools are independent,classes are small by normal school standards,with a high teacher/pupil ratio .Most children attending specialist schools tend to be boarders,leaving home to live,eat and sleep fulltime at school. What are the disadvantages?An obvious problem is the cost;the fees are high(PS12,000PS17,000 a year for boarders).However,each school will make every effort with scholarships and other forms of financial assistance,to help parents of outstandingly gifted children to find the necessary fees.Secondly,not all parents want to send their children to boarding school,especially at a very early age.Almost all the directors of the specialist schools express doubts about the wisdom of admitting...

Also, my door doesn’t lock, or even latch the door handle, so you can just push it open. So I was laying down, maybe at 60% in terms of how close I was to falling asleep, so I just had to lay down for like 5 more minutes. But there are a lot of noises, and they freak me out even though I just sorta pretend that they’re definitely a cat or my dog or something. So, I’m already slightly spooked, but I’m ignoring it and going to sleep anyway. But then, I hear my door open. That isn’t too weird, I do have cats, so even though by this point my fear is intense, I just sorta blow it off and keep trying to sleep.

School district officials said the principal at Beaver Ridge Elementary School will personally work with teachers to come up with more appropriate lessons and will offer more opportunities for staff development following the uproar created by the worksheet that included questions such as the following: “Each tree had 56 oranges. If 8 slaves pick them equally, then how much would each slave pick?” and “If Frederick got two beatings per day, how many beatings did he get in 1 week?” That didn’t go far enough for some parents at the school, where a majority of the students are minorities. They called for an apology and diversity training for the teachers and district officials. “That’s how people learn from one another and that’s how we all grow,” said Jennifer Falk, a community activist who recently had two children graduate from Gwinnett high schools. “Intentionally or not, this was inappropriate.” School district officials said teachers were attempting to incorporate history into their third-grade math lessons. “Clearly, they did not do as good of a job as they should have done,” district spokeswoman Sloan Roach said. Roach said the school’s principal, Jose DeJesus, was collecting the assignments so they wouldn’t be circulated. She said the teachers were not intentionally trying to offend the students with the questions. “It was just a poorly written question,” Roach said. Under district policy, the worksheet should have been reviewed before being handed out to students, but that process was not followed in this situation. District officials said they would work with math teachers to come up with more appropriate questions. Roach said she wasn’t sure whether Beaver Ridge teachers and staffers had diversity training recently, but she said DeJesus would be open to meeting with parents who had any further questions about the assignments. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the school or district would issue an apology. Falk said the district needed to do much more to make things right. “I think the teachers should be reprimanded for using that poor judgment, and an apology should be made,” she said. “But the bigger question is how could something like this happen?” Parents told Channel 2 Action News, a reporting partner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, that they were shocked that the assignment was dispersed to their children. “It kind of blew me away,” Christopher Braxton, the father of a Beaver Ridge student, told Channel 2. “I was furious. ... Something like this shouldn’t be embedded into a kid of the third, fourth, fifth, any grade.” The most recent accountability report for Beaver Ridge, which has an enrollment of about 1,200 students, shows that 62 percent of the students are Hispanic or Latino, 24 percent are black or African-American, and 5 percent are white, with 87 percent of the students qualifying for free or reduced lunch. The school was recently recognized as a Georgia Title I Distinguished School for achieving adequate yearly progress for six straight years. ||||| By Kerry Kavanaugh Several Gwinnett parents contacted Channel 2 Action News in outrage after their children brought home a math assignment that referenced slavery and beatings. Christopher Braxton talked with Channel 2's Kerry Kavanaugh and said he couldn't believe it when he read his 8-year-old son's math homework Wednesday. \\"It kind of blew me away,\\" Braxton said. \\"Do you see what I see? Do you really see what I see? He's not answering this question.\\" The question was a word problem that said, \\"Each tree had 56 oranges. If eight slaves pick them equally, then how much would each slave pick?\\" Another math problem said, \\"If Frederick got two beatings per day, how many beatings did he get in one week?\\" \\"I was furious at that point in time,\\" Braxton said. \\"Something like that shouldn't be imbedded into a kid of the third, fourth, fifth, any grade,\\" parent Terrance Barnett said. \\"I'm having to explain to my 8-year-old why slavery or slaves or beatings are in a math problem. That hurts.\\" Both fathers said they contacted the principal of Beaver Ridge Elementary school in Norcross. They wanted to know what the third-grade math teachers were thinking. Kavanaugh brought that question to Gwinnett County School District officials. \\"In this one, the teachers were trying to do a cross-curricular activity,\\" district spokeswoman Sloan Roach said. Roach explained the teachers were trying to incorporate social studies lessons into the math problems, which is something the school district encourages. But the problem with the questions is there is no historical context. http://bcove.me/d6f46bpp \\"We understand that there are concerns about these questions and we agree that these questions were not appropriate,\\" Roach said. \\"Whoever put together this paperwork and everything else, the schools and everything else, shouldn't teach it this way,\\" said Braxton. The parents were told the school vice principal had collected the assignment to shred them so that they didn't resurface. Roach said there is a process in place to review questions before they are handed out to students, which didn't happen here. Roach said the administration will work with teachers on how to develop better questions that are \\"meaningful and appropriate.\\" ||||| Summary:","output":"Parents and activists in Gwinnett County criticized a school district over a reported math worksheet given to students at a Norcross elementary school that used slavery examples in word problems.

Movie title: The Entity Context: The movie begins as single mother Carla Moran (Barbara Hershey) is violently raped in her home by an invisible assailant. A subsequent episode of poltergeist activity causes her to flee with her children to the home of her friend Cindy (Margaret Blye). They return to Carla's home and the following day, Carla is nearly killed when her car mysteriously goes out of control in traffic. Urged by Cindy to see a psychiatrist, Carla meets with Dr. Sneiderman (Ron Silver) and tentatively agrees to undergo therapy. A subsequent attack in her bathroom leaves bite marks and bruises, which Carla shows to Dr. Sneiderman, who believes she has inflicted them on herself (despite the marks showing up in places impossible for her to reach). We learn that Carla suffered a variety of traumas in her childhood and adolescence, including sexual and physical abuse, teenage pregnancy and the violent death of her first husband. Dr. Sneiderman believes her apparent paranormal experiences are delusions resulting from her past psychological trauma. Carla is attacked again, this time in front of her children. Her son tries to intervene but he is hit by electrical discharges and his wrist is broken. Dr. Sneiderman urges her to commit herself to a psychiatric hospital for observation, but she refuses. After Cindy witnesses an attack, the two discuss possible supernatural causes. While visiting a local bookstore, Carla happens to meet two parapsychologists, whom she convinces to visit her home. Initially skeptical, they witness several paranormal events and agree to study the home. During their study, Dr. Sneiderman arrives and confronts Carla, trying to convince her that the manifestation is in her mind, but she dismisses him.

Article: My conscience was pricked again on a tour of Venice in 2010. I had taken refuge from the crowds in a quiet canal-side cafe. Outside the cafe was an old woman kneeling on the ancient cobbled stones, begging. Steady streams of tourists were walking past her. A lone young back-packer stood away from the throng drinking something, but I noticed he was also observing the woman. A tourist group glanced at the woman and walked on. Another group of tourists arrived and, again, walked past her. The backpacker watched. Then, as I prepared to leave, I stopped at the sight of the backpacker stepping forward and placing some money in the woman's cup. He did this rather ostentatiously , just before the arrival of another tourist group. I watched as the leader of the group stopped and put some money in the cup. Having been shown the way, other tourists followed suit and added more coins to the woman's cup. The young backpacker repeated this process in front of the next tour party going past. Once again, the subtle peer pressure worked on the tourists, who all added coins to the cup. His work done, the young man walked over to the old beggar woman, patted her shoulder and said, \\"I hope that helps a bit.\\" I don't know if the woman understood his English or realized what had just happened, but I did.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"Film is inextricably linked with the locations of its production and reception. The translation of \\"Film ist untrennbar mit den Orten seiner Herstellung und Rezeption verbunden\\" from German to English is: \\"Film is inextricably linked with the locations of its production and reception.\\" The sentence conveys the idea that the process of producing and showcasing films is fundamentally interconnected with the places where they are created and exhibited. This relationship between film and its locations underlines the importance of understanding local culture, trends, and socio-political contexts for a comprehensive appreciation of the art form. Additionally, the role of specific landscapes and environments in shaping a movie's atmosphere and themes cannot be overstated. In terms of production, the locations chosen for shooting films often have a significant impact on a film's visuals, narrative, and cultural resonance. Filmmakers often select settings that possess a unique atmosphere, provide a sense of authenticity, or evoke specific emotions in the audience. Shooting on location offers opportunities for films to convey a genuine understanding of a particular region's culture and incorporate regional themes or aesthetic elements into the storytelling. The history and cultural associations of specific locations also contribute to this process and can be harnessed to imbue a film with a distinctive visual identity, emotional depth, or social resonance. Aside from establishing a strong aesthetic identity, the relationship between film and its production locations extends to the local industries and professionals who contribute their skills, talent, and labor to filmmaking. A healthy film industry within a region is an important source of skilled technicians, actors, and other creative professionals, ensuring that production proceeds efficiently and meets artistic goals. Furthermore, local production facilities such as sound stages, post-production studios, and equipment rental companies are crucial components for a successful film industry. In terms of reception, movie theaters and other exhibition venues play an essential role in connecting the film to its audience. These locations serve as spaces of social interaction, where viewers gather to see films and participate in a shared cultural experience. The ways in which films are presented and consumed can be significantly influenced by regional movie-going traditions, preferred genres or styles, and local audience preferences. Understanding these cultural differences and how they affect film reception can provide valuable insights for filmmakers, distributers, and critics, as well as contribute to the ongoing cultural exchange across nations and communities. Overall, this interconnected relationship between film and its production and reception locations is a fundamental aspect of the filmic experience. Considering the role of these locations in shaping both the creation and consumption of films can lead to a richer understanding of the medium and provide valuable insights for industry professionals and audiences alike."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information: - Magma (from Ancient Greek (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock. - A canyon (Spanish: cañón) or gorge is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from the erosive activity of a river over geologic timescales. Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces so will eventually wear away rock layers to lessen their own pitch slowing their waters; given enough time, their bottoms will gradually reach a baseline elevationwhich is the same elevation as the body of water it will eventually drain into. This action, when the river source and mouth are at much different base elevations will form a canyon, particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering. - A landform is a natural feature of the solid surface of the Earth or other planetary body. Landforms together make up a given terrain, and their arrangement in the landscape is known as topography. Typical landforms include hills, mountains, plateaus, canyons, valleys, as well as shoreline features such as bays, peninsulas, and seas, including submerged features such as mid-ocean ridges, volcanoes, and the great ocean basins. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - Volcanic gases include a variety of substances given off by active (or, at times, by dormant) volcanoes. These include gases trapped in cavities (vesicles) in volcanic rocks, dissolved or dissociated gases in magma and lava, or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action. - A planetary body or planetary object is any secondary body in the Solar System that is geologically differentiated or in hydrostatic equilibrium and thus has a planet-like geology: a planet, dwarf planet, or the larger moons and asteroids. - In hillslope geomorphology, a rill is a shallow channel (no more than a few tens of centimetres deep) cut into soil by the erosive action of flowing water. Similar but smaller incised channels are known as microrills; larger incised channels are known as gullies. - A valley is a low area between hills, often with a river running through it. - A bay is a body of water connected to an ocean or lake, formed by an indentation of the shoreline. A large bay may be called a \\"gulf\\", a \\"sea\\", a \\"sound\\", or a \\"bight\\". A \\"cove\\" is a smaller circular or oval coastal inlet with a narrow entrance; some coves may be referred to as bays. A \\"fjord\\" is a particularly steep bay shaped by glacial activity. - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - A LAND (Local Area Network Denial) attack is a DoS (Denial of Service) attack that consists of sending a special poison spoofed packet to a computer, causing it to lock up. The security flaw was first discovered in 1997 by someone using the alias \\"m3lt\\", and has resurfaced many years later in operating systems such as Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP SP2. - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area , usually in the form of a peak . A mountain is generally steeper than a hill . Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism . These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth . Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers , weather conditions , and glaciers . A few mountains are isolated summits , but most occur in huge mountain ranges . High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level . These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains : different elevations have different plants and animals . Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate , mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction and recreation , such as mountain climbing . The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia , whose summit is 8,850 m ( 29,035 ft ) above mean sea level . The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m ( 69,459 ft ) . - Terrain or relief (also topographical relief) is the vertical and horizontal dimension of the land surface. When relief is described underwater, the term bathymetry is used. The Latin Word \\"Terra (The root word of terrain),\\" is \\"Earth.\\" - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - Volcanic rock (often shortened to volcanics in scientific contexts) is a rock formed from magma erupted from a volcano. In other words, it differs from other igneous rock by being of volcanic origin. Like all rock types, the concept of volcanic rock is artificial, and in nature volcanic rocks grade into hypabyssal and metamorphic rocks and constitute an important element of some sediments and sedimentary rocks. For these reasons, in geology, volcanics and shallow hypabyssal rocks are not always treated as distinct. In the context of Precambrian shield geology, the term \\"volcanic\\" is often applied to what are strictly metavolcanic rocks. - In geology and earth science, a plateau (or ; plural plateaus or plateaux), also called a high plain or tableland, is an area of highland, usually consisting of relatively flat terrain that is raised significantly above the surrounding area, often with one or more sides with steep slopes. - A mid-ocean ridge is an underwater mountain system formed by plate tectonics. It consists of various mountains linked in chains, typically having a valley known as a rift running along its spine. This type of oceanic mountain ridge is characteristic of what is known as an oceanic spreading center, which is responsible for seafloor spreading. The production of new seafloor results from mantle upwelling in response to plate spreading; this isentropic upwelling solid mantle material eventually exceeds the solidus and melts. The buoyant melt rises as magma at a linear weakness in the oceanic crust, and emerges as lava, creating new crust upon cooling. A mid-ocean ridge demarcates the boundary between two tectonic plates, and consequently is termed a divergent plate boundary. - Volcanism is the phenomenon of eruption of molten rock (magma) onto the surface of the Earth or a solid-surface planet or moon, where lava, pyroclastics and volcanic gases erupt through a break in the surface called a vent. It includes all phenomena resulting from and causing magma within the crust or mantle of the body, to rise through the crust and form volcanic rocks on the surface. - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from . - Topography is the study of the shape and features of the surface of the Earth and other observable astronomical objects including planets, moons, and asteroids. The topography of an area could refer to the surface shapes and features themselves, or a description (especially their depiction in maps). What object entity has the relation of 'part of' with the subject 'mountain'? Choices: - alias - bay - body - center - computer - earth - geology - geomorphology - life - liquid - local area network - lock - may - mixture - mouth - nature - ocean - phenomenon - production - river - rock - sea - solar system - solid - sun - universe - variety - volcano - weather - windows xp - word The answer is:","output":"\\"rock\\"."},{"instruction":"Student: Given the sentence \\"A man is making an inspirational protest speech.\\" is it true that \\"A man is speaking his mind during a speech.\\"?. Teacher: Let's think:","output":"In the given sentence, \\"A man is making an inspirational protest speech,\\" we can infer that a man is speaking about something he believes in, likely addressing an issue or advocating for a cause. The term \\"inspirational\\" indicates that the man's speech is intended to motivate and encourage his audience, while \\"protest\\" implies he is speaking out against something he disagrees with or wants to change. Now, let's analyze the second sentence - \\"A man is speaking his mind during a speech.\\" In this sentence, the phrase \\"speaking his mind\\" suggests that the man is openly expressing his thoughts, feelings, and opinions. The context of the speech, however, is not specified here. Comparing the two statements, it's evident that there is a similarity between them, as both sentences describe a man expressing his thoughts and opinions in a speech. But there is a slight difference as well. The first sentence specifies that the speech is inspirational and related to protest, whereas the second sentence does not mention what the speech is about. Despite this difference, we can still say that given the context of the first sentence, it would be true that \\"A man is speaking his mind during a speech.\\" since he is openly addressing an issue or advocating for a cause."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

According to our premise (which is like a grounding fact or a rule), the GAO (the Government Accountability Office - it's like a really big group that checks if other groups are doing what they should) doesn't usually have what they call an 'entrance conference' (which is like a meeting to talk about what they're going to do) in three certain cases. You got it spot on! These cases are when they have to respond to Congress really quickly, when they have a small piece of work that is closely related to something they are already doing, or when they are just checking on actions taken based on their earlier suggestions. So, you're correct with your hypothesis (which is like a guess you make based on the rule)."},{"instruction":"Solve 0 = 21*f - 16*f + 20 for f.","output":"To solve the equation 0 = 21f - 16f + 20 for f, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. On the left side of the equation, we have two terms with the variable f, 21f and -16f. We will combine these terms by adding them together: 0 = (21f - 16f) + 20 By combining the like terms, we get: 0 = 5f + 20 Step 2: Isolate the variable f. Now we have an equation with f as the only variable. To isolate f, we will first move the constant term (20) to the other side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides: 0 - 20 = 5f + 20 - 20 This simplifies to: -20 = 5f Step 3: Solve for f. Now we have a simple equation with f as the only variable. To solve for f, we will divide both sides by the coefficient of f, which is 5: (-20) / 5 = (5f) / 5 This simplifies to: -4 = f The solution to the equation 0 = 21f - 16f + 20 is f = -4."},{"instruction":"Title: You Read to me I'll Read to You Review: My husband and I have read this to our grandchildren and read together.

Translate to English","output":"On Tuesday, June 5th, in Warsaw, Croatian Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks announced that Polish officials had assured him of their support for Croatia's European Union (EU) membership ambitions. Croatian Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks was in Warsaw, Poland, on June 5th, where he reportedly received backing from Polish authorities for Croatia's goal to become a member of the European Union. According to Seks, Polish officials have expressed their commitment to supporting Croatia's accession to the EU, demonstrating the close relationship between the two countries and their shared vision for a united and prosperous Europe. As part of his visit to Warsaw, Seks likely engaged in meetings and discussions with key Polish stakeholders, such as government representatives, policymakers, and business leaders, to strengthen ties and foster cooperation between Croatia and Poland. This support from Poland, an influential member of the EU, is an important step for Croatia in its quest for EU membership. Croatia's journey towards EU membership began in 2003 when it applied for accession, and it has since been working on fulfilling various criteria and implementing necessary reforms to align with the broader requirements of the EU. Some of these reforms include the strengthening of democratic institutions, protection of human rights, establishing a functioning market economy, and ensuring the rule of law. The endorsement from Polish officials serves as a significant vote of confidence in Croatia's progress and commitment towards meeting these EU standards. If successful, Croatia's accession to the EU would help solidify its position as a stable and integrated European nation, enabling it to benefit from the political, economic, and social opportunities that come with being part of such a large regional bloc. In conclusion, the announcement by Croatian Parliament Speaker Vladimir Seks about the support received from Polish officials for Croatia's EU membership aspirations is a noteworthy development for the country. This endorsement adds to the existing momentum for Croatia's accession into the union and strengthens the ties between the two nations. It also highlights the importance of collaboration and mutual support among European countries in achieving shared goals and fostering a united and prosperous continent."},{"instruction":"Your task is to generate the next utterance in a given dialogue.

Find the number of cats Carmen had after giving 3 up for adoption. 2. Calculate the difference between the number of cats and dogs Carmen has now. Step 1: Carmen had 28 cats and gave 3 away for adoption. So the number of cats she has now is 28 - 3 = 25 cats. Step 2: To find the difference between the number of cats and dogs, we'll subtract the number of dogs from the number of cats. Carmen has 25 cats and 18 dogs. So, the difference is 25 - 18 = 7.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump has...

The Gaither Vocal Band is an American southern gospel vocal group, named after its founder and leader Bill Gaither. On March 1, 2017, it was announced that the Gaither Vocal Band lineup consisted of Reggie Smith, Wes Hampton, Adam Crabb, Todd Suttles, and Bill Gaither, as of April 1. Although the group started out recording contemporary Christian music in the 1980s, it became known for southern gospel after the popularity of the Gaither Homecoming videos. The lineup of the band changes often, with artists leaving to work on solo careers, and new and old ones coming to replace them. Michael English was hired as the new lead singer, so McSpadden was moved down to baritone, and Gaither dropped to the lowest part. At this point the group dropped the \\"new\\" part of their name. Although the previous album (New Point of View) had been more contemporary than its predecessors, the album with this version of the group (One X 1) took it even further. After this album, Larnelle left and was replaced by Lemuel Miller. The group did not record an album with Lemuel before he too left. He was replaced by Imperials alumnus, Jim Murray. This line up cut one album (Wings) before Gary McSpadden left to start his solo career. Mark Lowry was convinced to replace him. Along with a great voice, Lowry added comedy to the mix. Their Gospel roots project Homecoming in 1991 caused most Southern Gospel fans to welcome the Vocal Band with open arms. Jim Murray left and was replaced by Terry Franklin. The album Southern Classics was released in 1993 with the hit \\"I Bowed On My Knees\\". Later Michael English left. He was replaced by Buddy Mullins. Mullins was only a temporary fill-in, but he was included on the album Testify. Terry Franklin soon left and was replaced by yet another Imperials alumnus, Jonathan Pierce (formerly known as Jonathan Hildreth, his first and last name--then changed to his first and middle name). Strengthened by the popularity of the Homecoming video series, the Vocal Band added Guy Penrod at lead. After Pierce's departure, Gaither hired David Phelps at tenor. After Lowry's departure, Imperials alumnus Russ Taff sang baritone for a couple of years. Marshall Hall was his replacement. Wes Hampton succeeded Phelps in 2005. The group has had three number one songs on the Singing News chart. \\"Yes, I Know\\" held the top position from July to October 1997, as did \\"I Will Go On\\" in November 2006. \\"Greatly Blessed\\" was their third number one single.

The Old Dessauer with part of his 20,000,--aided by Boy Dietrich (KNABE, \\"Knave Dietrich,\\" as one might fondly call him) and the Moravian Meal-wagons,--accomplished his Troppau-Jablunka Problem perfectly well; cleaning the Mountains, and keeping them clean, of that Pandour rabble, as he was the man to do. Nor would his Expedition require mentioning farther,--were it not for some slight passages of a purely Biographical character; first of all, for certain rubs which befell between his Majesty and him. For example, once, before that Interview at Chrudim, just on entering Bohemia thitherward, Old Leopold had seen good to alter his march-route; and--on better information, as he thought it, which proved to be worse--had taken a road not prescribed to him. Hearing of which, Friedrich reins him up into the right course, in this sharp manner:-- \\"CHRUDIM, 21st APRIL. I am greatly surprised that your Serenity, as an old Officer, does not more accurately follow my orders which I give you.

It incorporates various factors, including soil structure, porosity, organic matter content, nutrient availability, and biodiversity. EU Soil Thematic Strategy: The European Union's Soil Thematic Strategy is a comprehensive framework designed to preserve and improve soil quality across Europe. This strategy aims to prevent soil degradation and promote sustainable use of soil resources by addressing key threats, enhancing soil monitoring systems, and fostering the integration of soil protection measures into relevant policy areas. Threats to Soil Quality: Several factors threaten soil quality, and these can be both natural and anthropogenic. Some of the most significant threats include soil erosion, organic matter decline, soil compaction, salinization, landslides, desertification, contamination, and loss of soil biodiversity. These threats can result from unsustainable agricultural practices, deforestation, industrial activities, and urban sprawl. Role of Science in Soil Quality: Science plays a crucial role in understanding and improving soil quality. Advances in soil research help in the identification of factors affecting soil health, assessment of soil threats, and development of sustainable soil management practices. This encompasses various fields such as soil biology, chemistry, physics and ecology. Scientists develop technology and methods for soil monitoring, assessment, and remediation, and provide knowledge necessary for policy and decision-makers to implement effective soil protection measures. Furthermore, the role of science in education and awareness is also important; it helps disseminate information to the public, farmers, and industries about the significance of soil quality and the need for preserving and improving it."},{"instruction":"How is \\"The hotel is situated 250 meters from the beach and 2 km from Renesse.

KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca.

But a lot of my friends did very little work. Some did just enough to pass exams. Others didn't do quite enough. Fred Baines was one of them. He spent more time drinking in the Students' Union than working in the library. Once, at the end of the term, we had to take an important test in chemistry. The test had a hundred questions. Beside each question we had to write \\"True\\" or \\"False\\". While I was studying in my room the night before the test, Fred was watching television. Fred usually worried a lot the night before a test. But that night he looked perfectly calm. Then he told me of his plan. \\"It's very simple. There are a hundred questions and I have to get fifty correct to pass the test. I'll take a coin into the examination room. I haven't studied a chemistry book for months, so I'll just toss the coin. In that way, I'm sure I'll get half the questions right.\\" The next day, Fred came cheerfully into the examination room. As he sat tossing a coin for half an hour he marked down his answers. Then he left half an hour before the rest of us. The next day, he saw the chemistry professor in the corridor. \\"Oh good,\\" he said, \\"Have you got the results of the test?\\" The professor looked at him and smiled. \\"Ah, it's you, Baines, just a minute.\\" Then he reached into his pocket and took out a coin.

Solve 0 = -47*v + 30*v + 136 for v.","output":"To solve the given equation, we need to find the value of 'v' that makes the equation equal to 0. Here's the given equation: 0 = -47*v + 30*v + 136 First, we need to combine the terms with 'v'. This can be done by adding the coefficients of 'v': (-47*v + 30*v) = -17*v Now, the equation looks like this: 0 = -17*v + 136 Next, let's isolate 'v' by moving the other terms to the other side of the equation. In this case, we'll move '136' to the left side by subtracting it from both sides: 136 = 17*v Now, to get the value of 'v', we need to divide both sides of the equation by -17: v = 136 / 17 After performing the division: v = 8 So, the solution for the given equation 0 = -47*v + 30*v + 136 is: v = 8"},{"instruction":"Imagine a question and stream-of-consciousness explanation for which this is the answer: it is not possible to tell","output":"Question: Can we predict the exact thought process someone goes through while experiencing stream-of-consciousness? Stream-of-consciousness is a narrative technique used in literature and psychology that represents the continuous flow of a character's thoughts, feelings, and perceptions without any filter or structure. This way of thinking is said to resemble the natural course of human thought, similar to how we experience our own consciousness throughout the day. The act of experiencing stream-of-consciousness is highly subjective, as it depends on an individual's unique cognitive patterns, emotions, personal experiences, and memories. People's thoughts can jump in various, seemingly unrelated directions in a matter of seconds, making it extremely challenging to predict or trace the exact pathway that their consciousness has taken. Some factors that contribute to this unpredictability include external influences, such as the individual's surroundings, people they interact with, the sounds they hear, and their overall emotional state. Internal factors can also significantly impact the course their thought process will take. These include their physical well-being, their beliefs and values, and the vast collection of information and memories stored in their brain. Moreover, the complex nature of the human mind involves countless, simultaneous neuronal connections occurring at any given moment; these combinations of neurons firing create intricate neural pathways. With neuroscience still emerging as a field, our understanding of these circuits and the inner workings of the brain is not yet comprehensive enough for us to accurately predict something as variable and personal as stream-of-consciousness thinking. In summary, due to the highly subjective and ever-changing nature of human consciousness, coupled with the limitations in our understanding of the brain's functions and neuronal interactions, it is not possible to tell or predict the exact thought process someone goes through while experiencing stream-of-consciousness."},{"instruction":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

A right-handed batsman known for his back foot strokeplay, O'Neill made his state debut aged 18, before progressing to Test selection aged 21 in late 1958. Early in his career, O'Neill was one of the foremost batsmen in the Australian team, scoring three Test centuries and topping the run scoring aggregates on a 1959-60 tour of the Indian subcontinent which helped Australia win its last Test and series on Pakistani soil for 39 years, as well as another series in India. His career peaked in 1960-61 when he scored 181 in the Tied Test against the West Indies, and at the end of the series, had a career average of 58.25. Standing six feet tall, O'Neill was compared to Don Bradman upon his entry into Test cricket. At his best, he was a dynamic stroke maker who was a crowd favourite because of his ability to score at a high pace, in particular with his power off the back foot. He was noted for his nimble footwork, which he used to negate spin bowling; however this slowed in his later career as he put on weight. O'Neill particularly liked to sweep the slower bowlers. He often put too much emphasis on his right hand, allowing a large space between his hands on the bat handle, and then turning his right shoulder too square towards the bowler. The renowned English batsman and captain Wally Hammond said that O'Neill was the best all-round batsman he had seen since World War II. O'Neill's tall build, strength and good looks also drew comparison to his boyhood idol Keith Miller. Despite the comparisons to Bradman, O'Neill was much taller and broader, and was often impetuous whereas Bradman was known for his patience and lack of rashness. O'Neill was also criticised for hitting across the line early in his innings. O'Neill was highly regarded for his style and entertainment values. Teammate Alan Davidson said \\"once set he was the most exhilarating player you'd ever want to see--he was dynamite. He'd play attacking shots off balls other people would only think of defending. He had wonderful skill and technique. His shots off the back foot down the ground off fast bowlers--you can't really describe how good they were.\\" His captain for Australia and New South Wales, Richie Benaud said that he was \\"one of the greatest entertainers we've had in Australian cricket\\". O'Neill's style led the British writer EW Swanton to say \\"the art of batting, he reminded us, was not dead, merely inexplicably dormant\\" Wisden opined that \\"A high innings by O'Neill is a thing of masterful beauty. His stroking is delectable, immense in its power.\\" Later in his career, O'Neill became a nervous and superstitious batsman, particular at the start of an innings. He wrote \\"batting is a lonely business\\" in his 1964 autobiography Ins and Outs, opining that he sometimes found first-class cricket to be \\"depressing and lonely\\". He was regarded as an excellent fieldsman at cover, with a powerful and accurate throw, described by Wisden as a \\"dream throw\\" honed from a junior career as a baseballer. He was named as utility player in the 1957 All Australian baseball team, and his ability was such that he was approached by Major League Baseball scouts. Before the retirement of Neil Harvey, he and O'Neill fielded in tandem in the covers and the pair were regarded as the finest fielding combination of the time. Did any of his teammates comment about his play style?","output":"Yes, Norman O'Neill's teammates did comment about his play style. One of his teammates, Alan Davidson, said: \\"Once set, he was the most exhilarating player you'd ever want to see - he was dynamite. He'd play attacking shots off balls other people would only think of defending. He had wonderful skill and technique. His shots off the back foot down the ground off fast bowlers - you can't really describe how good they were.\\" Another teammate, Richie Benaud, who was also his captain for Australia and New South Wales, said that O'Neill was \\"one of the greatest entertainers we've had in Australian cricket.\\" Their appreciation of his style and skills shows that his teammates admired O'Neill's batting abilities and the way he played the game."},{"instruction":"Mufti Sarfraz Ahmed Naeemi Shaheed, (Urdu: ‎ ), (16 February 1948 – 12 June 2009) was a leading Sunni Islamic cleric from Pakistan who was well known for his moderate and anti-terrorist views.

Questions: The cocky lead character beat the odds again, he then made a quip about ever rule having its what? Options: - capsulize idea - train - suck - exception - anarchy Answer:","output":"The appropriate answer in line with common sense for the given question is \\"exception\\". Question: The cocky lead character beat the odds again, he then made a quip about every rule having its what? Answer: Exception. This answer makes the most sense because it fits the context of the question and is a well-known phrase. The idiom \\"every rule has its exception\\" means that there are always cases that don't follow the general rule. This phrase is often used when someone or something defies the expectations set by a specific rule, just like the cocky lead character who managed to beat the odds again. The other options provided do not align with the common sense approach to answering the question: 1. Capsulize idea: This term refers to the process of summarizing or compressing a complex idea into a more concise and simpler form. It doesn't fit the context of a character making a quip about beating the odds. 2. Train: This word is a noun that refers to a locomotive vehicle for transporting passengers or goods, or a verb meaning to teach skills or knowledge. Neither of its meanings is relevant to the context of the question. 3. Suck: This slang term might be used to express disapproval, that something is not enjoyable or of poor quality. Although it can be used in an informal context, it does not fit the intention behind the character's quip about beating the odds. 4. Anarchy: Anarchy is a condition of society where there is an absence of government, law, or order. While it can represent the idea of defying rules or order, it is not a suitable choice for completing the phrase in the question. In summary, the concept of every rule having its exception best represents the intention of the character's quip. It signifies that despite conforming to established rules or norms, there are always instances where they can be defied, and extraordinary outcomes can be achieved."},{"instruction":"Information: - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - The Iron Cross (abbreviated EK) was a military decoration in the Kingdom of Prussia, and later in the German Empire (18711918) and Nazi Germany (19331945). It was established by King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia in March 1813 backdated to the birthday of his late wife Queen Louise on 10 March 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars (EK 1813). Louise was the first person to receive this decoration (posthumous). The recommissioned Iron Cross was also awarded during the Franco-Prussian War (EK 1870), World War I (EK 1914), and World War II (EK 1939, re-introduced with a swastika added in the center). The Iron Cross was normally a military decoration only, though there were instances of it being awarded to civilians for performing military functions. Two examples of this were civilian test pilots Hanna Reitsch who was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class and 1st Class and Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, who was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class, for their actions as pilots during World War II. - Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, born Melitta Schiller (9 January 1903 8 April 1945), was a German Aviator who served as a test pilot in the Luftwaffe before and during World War II. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Erich Walther ( 5 August 1903 -- 26 December 1947 ) was a German general of the Fallschirmjäger who served during World War II. He was also a recipient of the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords . The Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grade Oak Leaves and Swords was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership . - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.

It is the capital and largest city of the East Flanders province and after Antwerp the largest municipality of Belgium. The city started as a settlement at the confluence of the Rivers Scheldt and Leie and in the Late Middle Ages became one of the largest and richest cities of northern Europe, with some 50,000 people in 1300. It is a port and university city. - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\". - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany. - The Flemish Parliament (Dutch: , and formerly called Flemish Council or \\"Vlaamse Raad\\") constitutes the legislative power in Flanders, for matters which fall within the competence of Flanders, both as a geographic region and a cultural community of Belgium (unlike the French-speaking community and Wallonia, which each have separate legislatures - the Parliament of the French Community and the Walloon Parliament). - Belgians are the citizens and natives of the Kingdom of Belgium, a federal state in Western Europe. - The Leie (Dutch and German) or Lys (French) is a river in France and Belgium, and a left tributary of the Scheldt.

The Late Middle Ages followed the High Middle Ages and preceded the onset of the early modern era (and, in much of Europe, the Renaissance). - In geography, a confluence is the meeting of two or more bodies of water. Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River. - Vlaamse Vervoersmaatschappij De Lijn ( English : Flemish transport company De Lijn ) , usually known as De Lijn ( \`\` The Line '' ) , is a company run by the Flemish government in Belgium to provide public transportation with about 3650 buses and 359 trams . De Lijn was founded in 1991 after the public transportation companies of Antwerp and Ghent fused with the Flemish part of the NMVB ( Nationale Maatschappij van Buurtspoorwegen , or the \`\` National Company of Neighborhood Railways '' ) . Socialist politician Steve Stevaert of Hasselt implemented a policy allowing registered residents in Flanders aged 65 + to ride anywhere in Flanders free . Other incentives exist for people under age 25 . De Lijn is being viewed as an integral part to reduce heavily congested traffic , together with the NMBS ( Belgium 's national rail operator ) . In 2008 , it transported more than 508 million passengers in an area with a population of approximately 6.5 million . De Lijn operates : Antwerp Tramway , with both street running and underground light rail ( Antwerp Pre-metro ) . Ghent Tramway , mostly street running with some reserved track . Belgian coast tram , interurban line along the whole Belgian coast , between De Panne and Knokke . All urban , suburban and intercity buses in Flanders . Because of the dense rail network , intercity buses serve as local transport between big cities and smaller communities . Time to travel from one city to another by bus is most often longer than for the same journey on the train because bus lines are less straight , as they pass through many small towns that are not served by railway . The buses are more city - style ( no coach buses are used ) . In the Limburg province with few railways buses are the main mode of intercity travel . There are also express intercity buses there .

The CFL follows slightly different rules than the National Football League (NFL) in the United States, which has 11 players on the field per team. The additional player on the field is one of the unique aspects of the Canadian game. The Canadian football field is also different from the American field, as it is wider and longer. A CFL field measures 150 yards in length, including two 20-yard end zones, and 65 yards in width, which allows for more room for the extra player to be utilized strategically. However, in terms of player positions, the Canadian and American games have much in common. The players are divided into two main groups: the offense and the defense. The offense is responsible for scoring points, while the defense's primary goal is to stop the opposing team from scoring. Additionally, special teams units handle kicking plays, such as punts, field goals, and kickoffs, but special teams players are generally drawn from the offensive and defensive units. 1. Offensive players: The offensive unit typically includes the following player positions: - Quarterback (QB): Responsible for leading the team, distributing the ball to other players, and making decisions regarding play-calling. - Running Backs (RB): Responsible for running with the ball, catching passes, and pass blocking. - Wide Receivers (WR) and Slotbacks (SB): Responsible for catching passes thrown by the quarterback and potentially running with the ball after a catch. - Offensive Linemen (OL): Composed of Center (C), Offensive Guards (OG), and Offensive Tackles (OT), they are responsible for protecting the quarterback and creating openings for running backs. 2. Defensive players: The defensive unit typically includes the following player positions: - Defensive Linemen (DL): Composed of Defensive Tackles (DT) and Defensive Ends (DE), they are responsible for stopping the offense's running game and pressuring the quarterback. - Linebackers (LB): Positioned behind the defensive linemen, they are tasked with stopping the run, covering pass plays, and potentially rushing the quarterback. - Defensive Backs (DB): Composed of Cornerbacks (CB) and Safeties (S), they are primarily responsible for defending against pass plays and providing support in stopping the run. The additional player in the CFL mainly serves an adaptable role, often taking the position of a receiver, running back, or defensive back, depending on the team's strategy and needs in a given play. In summary, the Canadian Football League differs from its American counterpart by having 12 players on the field per team during a game. These players fill various roles on offense, defense, and special teams to compete for victory."},{"instruction":"Problem: Solve 23 + 55 - 42 = 9*h for h.

A down-on-his-luck illusionist (known by his stage name, \\"Tatischeff\\") watches his popularity and employment in Paris dry up. He packs his meager belongings and props, including an ill-tempered white rabbit, and moves to London. There he finds himself as the irrelevant act following a popular rock band. Despite his wounded pride, he adopts a nothing-to-lose attitude and continues plying his trade at yet smaller gatherings in bars, cafÃ©s, and private parties. He accepts the invitation of a drunken party patron, taking a long, slow journey to a remote Scottish island (Iona in the Inner Hebrides). The small village's pub has only recently been wired for electricity, and he and his rabbit are appreciated for a time. Living modestly in a room above the pub, the illusionist encounters a young girl named Alice who is captivated by his otherworldly abilities and kind gestures, including a gift of new red shoes. Competition from more modern forms of entertainment follow the illusionist even to this idyll, and he soon moves on. Alice believes the downtrodden performer possesses genuine supernatural powers, and follows him to Edinburgh, where he performs at a modest, out-of-the-way theater. They book a room in a rundown guest house favored by other fading performers (a trio of acrobats, a clown, and a ventriloquist). The illusionist sleeps on a small couch and the girl keeps busy by cleaning and cooking food that she shares with the neighbors. The girl's affections even tame the rabbit, but the illusionist's increasingly meager wages, lavished on a series of gifts for Alice, lead him to pawn off his magic kit and secretly take on more demeaning jobs. The other traditional performers become similarly depressed and destitute. Unable to muster the courage to tell his starry-eyed admirer the truth about his fading trade, the illusionist continues giving until he has nothing more to offer. Alice meanwhile discovers the...

Its main target, among a range of geographical and scientific objectives, was to be first to the South Pole. This was not attained, but the expedition's southern march reached a Farthest South latitude of 88° 23' S, just from the pole. This was by far the longest southern polar journey to that date and a record convergence on either Pole. A separate group led by Welsh Australian geology professor Edgeworth David reached the estimated location of the South Magnetic Pole, and the expedition also achieved the first ascent of Mount Erebus, Antarctica's second highest volcano. - Dumfries (; possibly from ) is a market town and former royal burgh within the Dumfries and Galloway council area of Scotland.

He has two sisters and four brothers. He later adopted the name Anna, which in Marathi means \\"elder person\\" or \\"father\\". Hazare was drafted in the Indian Army in April 1960, where he initially worked as an army truck driver and was later attested as a soldier. He undertook army training at Aurangabad. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Hazare was posted at the border in the Khem Karan sector. He was the sole survivor of an enemy attack--variously claimed to have been a bomb, an aerial assault and an exchange of fire at the border--while he was driving a truck. The experiences of wartime, coupled with the poverty from which he had come, affected him. He considered suicide at one point but turned instead to pondering the meaning of life and death. He said of the truck attack, \\"[It] sent me thinking. I felt that God wanted me to stay alive for some reason. I was reborn in the battlefield of Khem Karan. And I decided to dedicate my new life to serving people.\\" At a book stand in New Delhi railway station, he came across Swami Vivekananda's booklet \\"Call to the youth for nation building\\" which inspired him to think deeper. He spent his spare time reading the works of Swami Vivekananda, Gandhi, and Vinoba Bhave. In a blog post, Hazare expressed his views on Kashmir by saying that it was his \\"active conviction that Kashmir is an integral part of India\\" and that if required once again for service, he would remain \\"ready to take part in war against Pakistan.\\" During his fifteen-year career in the army (1960-75), Anna Hazare was posted at several locations, including Punjab (Indo Pak war 1965), Nagaland, Bombay (1971) and Jammu (1974) During the Indo pak war, Hazare survived a road crash while driving for the army. He interpreted his survival as a further sign that his life was intended to be dedicated to service. He had another escape in Nagaland, where one night, underground Naga rebels attacked his post and killed all the inmates. He had a miraculous escape as he had gone out to return nature's call and hence turned out to be the lone survivor.

Try to arrange sofas and chairs in a square around a circular table. Avoid an L-shaped arrangement as this leaves a missing corner. The centre of the living room should be left clear. Make sure there is a lot of light, which will promote good energy. Put plants in the corners of the room, as they attract good energy and will energize your health, but not ones with sharp leaves such as yuccas or cactus. Fresh flowers also bring good energy, but throw them away as soon as they begin to die, and don't have dried flowers. Mirrors are vital because they reflect energy. Round or oval ones are best, but they should not be opposite each other, nor should they reflect a door, otherwise your good fortune will go out of it. To promote harmony between the members of your family, have photos of them around the room, preferably smiling. If you want to find a partner, energize the south-west corner of your living room or bedroom by placing a floor light at least 1.75m high there, and turn it on every evening. Surround yourself with decorations and objects in pairs, such as ducks or birds. To avoid blocking the positive energy in the room, keep everything tidy. Don't accumulate too many unnecessary things.

Today, we're going to talk about an important person who plays for a football team called the Texans! The football team is from a big place called Houston in Texas, and they play a game called American Football. You must have seen people throwing and catching a ball, right? That's what they do, but there's more to it! Now, have you ever heard of the word \\"quarterback\\"? A quarterback is a super cool and important player on a football team. It's their job to make sure the ball gets thrown to the right person and help their team score points. They must be really good at throwing and making quick decisions! Now, you asked who the quarterback of the Texans is, didn't you? As of my last update in 2021, their quarterback is a guy named Deshaun Watson. Watson is really talented, and he's so good at his job that he's famous! He wears the number 4 on his jersey, so watch out for that! Deshaun Watson was born on September 14, 1995, which makes him 26 years old in 2021. Can you believe that? That's a lot older than you, right? He began playing football when he was very young, maybe not much older than you are now. His hard work and skills led him to play in college, where he got even better at playing football. Finally, in 2017, Watson joined the big Houston Texans team and became their starting quarterback! So, the next time you watch football or hear about the Houston Texans, remember to look for the quarterback with the number 4 on his jersey, Deshaun Watson! He's the one who makes sure the ball gets thrown to the right person and helps his team win games. And who knows, maybe one day, you could become a great quarterback too! But for now, let's keep learning and having fun together."},{"instruction":"“Please remember me to myself!” When sliding toward mania in 2016, I begged this of my therapist. He cocked his head. “What do you mean?” I had no idea—on a conscious level—what I was asking for, just that I felt in a desperate sense that the self I knew was slipping away. An inability to recognize myself either in my writing or in reflecting upon my own actions was taking over. And then…? I didn't care. I wanted to kiss girls. Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew. Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it. This was a rather foolish assumption—especially since she's an educator, not a psychiatrist, especially with how skilled I am at wearing the mask of calm, the face of sanity. “You seem great, Julie. Cheery. Professional as always.” I let her reassurance placate me. Wanted to be placated. Yet, within months I lost my job. And not only that, but a chance at a scholarship, two really important long term friendships—relationships I'd enjoyed since high school. I was hospitalized three times between September and February. I lost my ability to trust myself, lost my mind. It is now a little over two years since I first felt that sliding. Twenty-six months since I knew that somewhere in the deepest parts of who I am, I was slipping. Nine seasons since I begged Dr. Poe, “Remember me to myself!” I'm still recuperating. Yes.

Six unruly prep school students are forced to serve Saturday detention for eight hours at Crestview Academy, where psychologist Dr. Day (Jeffrey Schmidt) conducts psychological testing on the students to examine their personalities and trigger their demeanors, recording each session in the process. Despite receiving an expulsion notice from Headmaster Nash (Judd Nelson), a new low-income student Matt Clark (Cameron Deane Stewart) plans to compensate for his poor behavior by joining the awkward Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato), the jock Craig Cook (Roger Edwards), the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke), the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst (Amanda Alch), and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes (Ali Faulkner) in detention. After giving them the task to complete a school history assignment, Dr. Day restricts their internet reach and takes away many of their phones, leaving the students imprisoned alone in the library, remodeled by the janitor, Max (Ben Browder), with Native American portraits and an Apache statue.

A:","output":"Matt Clark is placed in Crestview Academy, a preparatory school with a twisted past, where he is forced to serve a Saturday detention with five other students due to their unruly behavior. The movie is titled \\"Bad Kids Go to Hell\\" and centers around the mysterious events that unfold during the detention period. The plot revolves around six students with different personalities and backgrounds being detained and left alone in a newly remodeled library, which features Native American portraits and an Apache statue. Over the course of their detention, the students begin to believe that the library is haunted, causing tensions to rise. They slowly discover that they all have troubled family lives, but this realization doesn't prevent them from clashing due to prior encounters. As time passes, the students begin to uncover the dark history of the land on which the school was built. The land was originally owned by an Apache tribe member, Jacob Rainwater, in the 1870s before being taken over by General Andrew Winston Clarke. The land was then subsequently taken by the city of Crestview and used to build the school. This history suggests a possible link between the school's haunting and the mistreatment of the Native American tribe. As they investigate further into the school's past and try to escape the library, the students experience a series of dangerous and life-threatening situations, leading to the initial SWAT team scene in which Matt is found holding an axe, surrounded by the bodies of his fellow classmates. In this intriguing and suspenseful movie, Matt Clark's character represents the new, low-income student attempting to make amends for his past behavior in the midst of a group of trouble-making peers and a haunted library. His presence and experiences during the eight-hour detention will influence not only his fate, but also the fates of the other students.

Such disparities in experience can have a rippling effect on their ability to navigate the challenges that they may face while working at the company. Given that Randy is a worker at the company, he is likely to have a deep understanding of the company's culture, its mission, and its values. He may have developed a strong relationship with other team members and gained invaluable insights into how the company operates. With this experience, Randy is better equipped to handle the complexities of the job and can adapt more easily to any new changes or unexpected situations. On the other hand, Christopher, who is not a worker at the company, lacks these crucial experiences. He might find it challenging to navigate the company's hierarchy and may not understand the subtle nuances that come with the company culture. This can make it harder for him to know which steps to take when faced with a problem or even when making decisions that impact the company. Furthermore, he might find it difficult to connect and communicate with other employees, which can lead to miscommunication and misunderstandings. Additionally, Randy's tenure at the company also means that he has accumulated industry-specific knowledge and has developed his expertise in the company's field of operation. This accumulated knowledge and experience allow him to make informed decisions, providing a vital advantage over someone like Christopher, who has less knowledge about the company's operations and industry. It is essential for companies to recognize the value of experienced employees like Randy. Seasoned employees play a crucial role in training and mentoring less experienced staff like Christopher, who can eventually grow to become valuable team members. Strengthening the bond between experienced and inexperienced workers can help develop a deeper sense of job ownership, creating a more cohesive and successful team. In conclusion, it is clear that Christopher has a lot less experience in the situation than Randy because Randy is a worker at the company. Christopher may struggle to adapt to the company culture, understand the industry deeply, and communicate effectively with coworkers, which can negatively impact his performance. However, with the support and guidance from experienced workers like Randy, Christopher can learn and grow in his role, eventually gaining the necessary experience and expertise to contribute positively to the company."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: The Great Raid Movie plot: In 1944, American forces were closing in on the Japanese-occupied Philippines. The Japanese held around 500 American prisoners who had survived the Bataan Death March in a notorious POW camp at Cabanatuan and subjected them to brutal treatment and summary execution, as the Japanese view surrender as a disgrace. Many prisoners were also stricken with malaria. The film opens with the massacre of prisoners of war on Palawan by the Kempeitai, the Imperial Japanese military's secret police (though factually, it was committed by the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army). Meanwhile, at Lingayen Gulf, the 6th Ranger Battalion under Lt. Col Mucci is ordered by Lt. Gen. Walter Krueger to liberate all of the POWs at Cabanatuan prison camp before they are killed by the Japanese. The film chronicles the efforts of the Rangers, Alamo Scouts from the 6th Army and Filipino guerrillas as they undertake the Raid at Cabanatuan. Throughout the film, the viewpoint switches between the POWs at Cabanatuan, the Rangers, the Filipino resistance and the Japanese. In particular, the film covers the resistance work undertaken by nurse Margaret Utinsky, who smuggled medicine into the POW camps. The Kempeitai arrested her and sent her to Fort Santiago prison. She was eventually released, but spent six weeks recovering from gangrene as a result of injuries sustained from beatings. A:","output":"The movie \\"The Great Raid\\" portrays Margaret Utinsky as a courageous nurse who contributed significantly to the resistance efforts by smuggling medicine into the POW camps. Her actions did not go unnoticed, and she was arrested by the Kempeitai, the Imperial Japanese military's secret police, and sent to Fort Santiago prison. However, the duration of her imprisonment is not explicitly stated in the plot provided.

It derived from Congolese rumba in the 1960s and gained popularity in the 1980s in France. Although often used by journalists as a synonym for Congolese rumba, both the music and dance currently associated with soukous differ from more traditional rumba, especially in its higher tempo, longer dance sequences. Notable performers of the genre include African Fiesta, Papa Wemba and Pépé Kallé. - Canción (\\"song\\") is a popular genre of Latin American music, particularly in Cuba, where many of the compositions originate. Its roots lie in Spanish popular song forms, including tiranas, polos and boleros; also in Italian light operetta, French romanza, and the slow waltz. Initially, even when written by the creole population of Cuba, who opposed the ruling hierarchy, the music retained its European style of \\"intricate melodies, and dark, enigmatic and elaborate lyrics\\" (Orovio). - The term Afro-Cuban refers to Cubans who mostly have West African ancestry, and to historical or cultural elements in Cuba thought to emanate from this community. The term can refer to the combining of African and other cultural elements found in Cuban society such as race, religion, music, language, the arts, and class culture. - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet. It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants. - Antoine Wendo Kolosoy ( April 25 , 1925 -- July 28 , 2008 ) , known as Papa Wendo , was a Congolese musician . He is considered the \`\` Father '' of Congolese rumba , also known as soukous , a musical style blending son cubano , beguine , waltz , tango and cha - cha . - Pépé Kallé, sometimes written as Pepe Kalle (November 15 November 30 1998) was a soukous singer, musician and bandleader from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Pépé Kallé was born Kabasele Yampanya in Kinshasa (then Léopoldville) in the Belgian Congo, but later assumed his pseudonym in hommage to his mentor, Le Grand Kallé. - Son cubano is a style of music and dance that originated in Cuba and gained worldwide popularity during the 1930s. Son combines the structure and feel of the Spanish canción with Afro-Cuban traits and percussion. The Cuban son is one of the most influential and widespread forms of Latin-American music: its derivatives and fusions, including salsa, have spread across the world.

Justification: It is not possible to tell the exact emotions a person is experiencing just by looking at their facial expressions. While facial expressions can provide valuable insights into an individual's emotional state, they often do not convey the full depth of a person's feelings. Many emotions have overlapping facial expressions, which can make it challenging to distinguish one emotion from another with complete certainty. Additionally, there are various cultural differences and personal idiosyncrasies that can influence the way people express emotions on their faces. Furthermore, some people may have the ability to control or mask their facial expressions. This can make it even more difficult to discern a person's true emotional state based only on their facial cues. Emotional experiences are complex and multifaceted, so relying solely on facial expressions to determine someone's internal state can be quite limited and unreliable."},{"instruction":"Process: - Two birds meet each other - Egg is produced after fertilziation - Mother sits on egg until it hatches - Bird Hatches - Grows up - Flee the next - Starts family - Dies. Question: suppose Baby bird stays with parnets happens, how will it affect LESS birds. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"To assess the impact of a baby bird staying with its parents on the populations of birds, we need to evaluate each step of the process and then determine the cumulative effect. Step 1: Two birds meet each other - Staying with parents will not affect this step. Step 2: Egg is produced after fertilization - If baby birds stay with their parents for a longer period, it might lead to parents producing fewer offspring during that time due to increased resource investment in the existing chick. This could result in less reproduction opportunities, leading to fewer birds overall. Step 3: Mother sits on egg until it hatches - This step is not influenced by the baby bird staying with its parents. Step 4: Bird hatches - If baby birds learn valuable survival skills by staying with their parents, they might have a better chance of survival and contribute to fewer birds' deaths. Step 5: Grows up - A longer nurturing period may improve the overall health and condition of the growing bird and thus increase its chances of survival, leading to fewer deaths. Step 6: Flee the nest - Delaying this step will not directly affect the populations of birds. Step 7: Starts family - A bird raised with prolonged parental care might have a better understanding of how to care for its own offspring, improving the survival rates of the next generations. Step 8: Dies - This step is not directly affected by the baby bird staying with its parents. Considering all the steps and their interrelations, the supposition of a baby bird staying with its parents could lead to a mixture of effects - fewer birds due to reduced reproduction opportunities, but potentially improving survival rates due to better upbringing. Overall, we can conclude that the supposed perturbation may result in less birds, but the survival rates of the existing bird population could be better."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate label \\"True\\" if abstract is structured, otherwise generate \\"False\\".

This structure is key to keeping your abstract focused on the main idea and creating a clear and concise image. Q: BACKGROUND Sequence similarity searching is a very important bioinformatics task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications. RESULTS We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site. CONCLUSION The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.

In order to evaluate whether the premise entails the hypothesis, one must first understand the context and information presented in the two statements. The first statement, \\"And then?\\" is a phrase used to prompt further explanation, often indicating that the speaker is interested in what happens next in a given scenario. This phrase typically follows a story, chronology of events, or description of actions. However, the context of the scenario or event in question is not given. As a result, it's difficult to identify The second statement, \\"And before that?\\" serves as another question, this time asking for information regarding events or actions that took place before the ones previously mentioned. Similar to the first statement, this phrase is used to request more context or background within a story or series of events. Unfortunately, once again, there is no provided context or known story to which this question pertains. The crux of the issue with these statements is their lack of context. Without any information about the events, actions, or timeline that they refer to, it's impossible to determine whether the premise (the first statement) entails the hypothesis (the second statement). Both statements serve as questions inquiring about the context or events relevant to their specific location within a narrative.

It is no secret that our actions, both big and small, can have crucial consequences on the ecosystem and the creatures that inhabit it. Making a conscious effort to improve your environmental habits is a valuable and achievable goal. In this article, we will explore several simple yet effective ways that you can make a positive impact on bird conservation and contribute to a healthier planet. 1. Switch to cloth grocery bags and reusable bottles One of the easiest and most immediate changes you can make is to eliminate single-use plastic from your daily routine. Birds often mistake plastic waste for food, which can lead to negative health effects or even death. By using cloth grocery bags and reusable bottles, you can significantly reduce your plastic consumption and minimize its environmental impact on bird populations. 2. Drive the speed limit Driving at moderate and consistent speeds improves fuel efficiency, consequently reducing pollution. When you reduce air pollution, you help protect bird habitats and promote healthier ecosystems. Driving the speed limit also reduces the risk of collisions with birds and other wildlife. 3. Donate to organizations that conserve bird populations Making a financial contribution to a reputable organization focused on bird conservation can significantly assist their efforts. These organizations work tirelessly to protect bird habitats, conduct vital research, and raise public awareness about the importance of birds in our ecosystem. Donating to such organizations ensures the continuation of their work and progress achieved in bird conservation. 4. Volunteer with bird conservation programs For a more hands-on approach, consider joining a local or national bird conservation program as a volunteer. Participating in activities like bird surveys, habitat restoration, or community outreach will allow you to play an active role in preserving avian populations. Additionally, volunteering offers the opportunity to learn more about the challenges faced by birds and ways to contribute to their well-being. 5. Become a citizen scientist by tracking bird data yourself Citizen science is a valuable tool that allows anyone to participate in scientific research and data collection. By reporting your bird sightings to online databases such as eBird or the Christmas Bird Count, you can provide crucial information that helps scientists track bird population trends and assess the effectiveness of conservation efforts. 6. Purchase shade-grown coffee and chocolate When shopping for coffee and chocolate, look for brands labelled as \\"shade-grown\\" or \\"bird-friendly.\\" Shade-grown farming methods promote a diverse ecosystem, providing essential habitat for birds and other wildlife. Supporting these products is an effective way to promote sustainable agriculture and help protect bird populations. Conclusion Bird conservation might seem like an overwhelming task at first glance, but every small step taken collectively contributes to a healthier planet for all living beings. By making informed decisions and participating in conservation efforts, you can make a significant positive impact on protecting bird populations and preserving their habitats for future generations."},{"instruction":"Now that the celebrating has died down, lets decide whether to seek rehearing or clarification of the order.

Somalia, Djibouti, Comoros and Mauritania are geographically in Sub-Saharan Africa, but are likewise Arab states and part of the Arab world. - The Bantu languages, technically the Narrow Bantu languages (as opposed to \\"Wide Bantu\\", a loosely defined categorization which includes other Bantoid languages), constitute a traditional branch of the NigerCongo languages. There are about 250 Bantu languages by the criterion of mutual intelligibility, though the distinction between language and dialect is often unclear, and \\"Ethnologue\\" counts 535 languages. Bantu languages are spoken largely east and south of present-day Cameroon, that is, in the regions commonly known as Central Africa, Southeast Africa, and Southern Africa. Parts of the Bantu area include languages from other language families (see map). - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi. - Mark Dornford - May ( born 29 September 1955 ) is an English theatre and film director , now based in South Africa . - Lesotho, officially the Kingdom of Lesotho, is an enclaved, landlocked country in southern Africa completely surrounded by South Africa. It is just over in size and has a population slightly over two million. Its capital and largest city is Maseru. - Multiracial is defined as made up of or relating to people of many races. Many terms exist for people of various multiracial backgrounds. While some of the terms used in the past are considered insulting and offensive, there are many socially acceptable modern terms that multiracial people identify with. These include \\"mixed-race\\" (or simply \\"mixed\\"), \\"biracial\\", \\"multiracial\\", \\"métis\\", \\"mestizo\\", \\"mulatto\\", \\"dougla\\", and \\"pardo\\". - The Eastern Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the earth that is east of the prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, England) and west of the antimeridian. It is also used to refer to Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, in contrast with the Western Hemisphere, which includes North and South America. This hemisphere may also be called the \\"Oriental Hemisphere\\". In addition, it may be used in a cultural or geopolitical sense as a synonym for the \\"Old World\\". - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.

It features two octaves of double melody strings in the key of C major ( middle C to C '' ) , and four sets of chord strings ( C major , G major , F major , and D7 ) . Sounding somewhat like a mandolin , the Marxophone 's timbre is also reminiscent of various types of hammered dulcimers . The player typically strums the chords with the left hand . The right hand plays the melody strings by depressing spring steel strips that hold small lead hammers over the strings . A brief stab on a metal strip bounces the hammer off a string pair to produce a single note . Holding the strip down makes the hammer bounce on the double strings , which produces a mandolin - like tremolo . The bounce rate is somewhat fixed , as it is based on the spring steel strip length , hammer weight , and string tension -- but a player can increase the rate slightly by pressing higher on the strip , effectively moving its pivot point closer to the lead hammer . Numerically coded sheet music prepared specifically for the Marxophone indicates when and in what order to play melody and chord strings . This type of music , similar to tablature , was produced for those who could not read standard notation . A rectangular piece of metal provides a backstop for the spring steel hammers , displays the name Marxophone and the patent number , and has clips that hold sheet music . It also marks the 15 keys by letter ( C , D , etc. ) , by number ( 1 - 15 ) and in standard musical notation . When the instrument is moved or stored , the metal rectangle bends down , holding the keys against the strings , so the Marxophone can fit into its case -- which is the size of a large briefcase . - A plectrum is a small flat tool used to pluck or strum a stringed instrument. For hand-held instruments such as guitars and mandolins, the plectrum is often called a pick, and is a separate tool held in the player's hand. In harpsichords, the plectra are attached to the jack mechanism. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - F major (or the key of F) is a major scale based on F, with the pitches F, G, A, B, C, D, and E. Its key signature has one flat, B. - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody. The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice. - Mandobass is the largest (and least common) member of the mandolin family, sometimes used as the bass instrument in mandolin orchestras. It is so large that it usually isn't held in the lap, but supported on a spike which rests on the floor. The neck-scale length on a full-size mando-bass is similar to that of a standard orchestral double bass viol: about 43\\" (110 cm). The instrument is otherwise similar to the smaller, higher-pitched members of the mandolin family, having a fretted neck, a headstock with geared tuning machines, and a large resonating body oftenbut not alwaysshaped like that of other mandolins. - Lute can refer generally to any string instrument having the strings running in a plane parallel to the sound table (in the HornbostelSachs system), more specifically to any plucked string instrument with a neck (either fretted or unfretted) and a deep round back, or more specifically to an instrument from the family of European lutes. - In music, unison is two or more musical parts sounding the same pitch or at an octave interval, usually at the same time. - C major (or the key of C) is a major scale based on C, with the pitches C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. Its key signature has no flats and no sharps. - The harp is a stringed musical instrument which has a number of individual strings running at an angle to its soundboard, which are plucked with the fingers. Harps have been known since antiquity in Asia, Africa, and Europe, dating back at least as early as 3500 BC. The instrument had great popularity in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, where it evolved into a wide range of variants with new technologies, and was disseminated to Europe's colonies, finding particular popularity in Latin America. While some ancient members of the harp family died out in the Near East and South Asia, descendants of early harps are still played in Burma and in Sub-Saharan Africa, while other defunct variants in Europe and Asia have been revived by musicians in the modern era. - The mandocello is a plucked string instrument of the mandolin family. It has eight strings in four paired courses, tuned in fifths like a mandolin, but is larger, and tuned CC-GG-dd-aa (low to high in pitch). It can be described as being to the mandolin what the cello is to the violin. - G major (or the key of G) is a major scale based on G, with the pitches G, A, B, C, D, E, and F. Its key signature has one sharp, F. - The mandola (US and Canada) or tenor mandola (Ireland and UK) is a fretted, stringed musical instrument. It is to the mandolin what the viola is to the violin: the four double courses of strings tuned in fifths to the same pitches as the viola (C-G-D-A low-to-high), a fifth lower than a mandolin. The mandola, although now rarer, is the ancestor of the mandolin, the name of which means simply \\"little mandola\\". - The major scale or Ionian scale is one of the most commonly used musical scales, especially in Western music. It is one of the diatonic scales. Like many musical scales it is made up of seven notes: the eighth duplicates the first at double its frequency so that it is called a higher octave of the same note (from Latin \\"octavus\\", the eighth). - In musical notation, a key signature is a set of sharp, flat, and rarely, natural symbols placed together on the staff. Key signatures are generally written immediately after the clef at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a score, notably after a double barline. - The cello (; plural cellos or celli) or violoncello is a bowed string instrument with four strings tuned in perfect fifths. The strings from low to high are generally tuned to C, G, D and A, an octave lower than the viola. It is a member of the violin family of musical instruments, which also includes the violin and viola. - A mandolin (; literally \\"small mandola\\") is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or \\"pick\\". It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths. It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass. - The octave mandolin is a fretted string instrument with four pairs of strings tuned in fifths, G, D, A, E (low to high), an octave below a mandolin. It has a 20 to 23-inch scale length and its construction is similar to other instruments in the mandolin family. Usually the courses are all unison pairs but the lower two may sometimes be strung as octave pairs with the higher-pitched octave string on top so that it is hit before the thicker lower-pitched string. Alternate tunings of G, D, A, D and A, D, A, D are often employed by Celtic musicians.

Thirty congregations were founded, and during 1879 and 1880, Russell visited each to provide the format he recommended for conducting meetings. As congregations continued to form during Russell's ministry, they each remained self-administrative, functioning under the congregationalist style of church governance. In 1881, Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society was presided over by William Henry Conley, and in 1884, Charles Taze Russell incorporated the society as a non-profit business to distribute tracts and Bibles. By about 1900, Russell had organized thousands of part- and full-time colporteurs, and was appointing foreign missionaries and establishing branch offices. By the 1910s, Russell's organization maintained nearly a hundred \\"pilgrims,\\" or traveling preachers.

To better understand and break down this sentiment, let's analyze the structure and the words used in the sentence. First, the verb \\"hold up\\" is an idiomatic expression used to describe how something bears up or maintains its value, quality, or effectiveness over time. In this context, it refers to how the movie continues to be enjoyable or praiseworthy. The fact that the reviewer chose this phrasing suggests that they believe the movie remains relevant and appealing, possibly defying expectations due to factors such as its age, time of release, or other factors. Second, the adverb \\"pretty\\" is employed as a modifier to the expression \\"hold up.\\" Used colloquially to mean \\"to a moderately high degree,\\" \\"pretty\\" serves to reinforce the notion that the movie not only holds up but does so to a significant extent. It underscores the reviewer's conviction that the movie remains more than just acceptable—it is relatively solid and respectable in quality. Third, the adverb \\"well\\" denotes the manner in which the movie holds up and provides an overall positive characterization. It implies that the movie's ability to endure is not only notable but also commendable. Combined with the other elements of the sentence, \\"well\\" contributes to the generally positive sentiment expressed by the reviewer. To sum up, the sentiment of the movie review sentence— \\"does hold up pretty well\\"— is mainly positive. The choice of language used by the reviewer conveys their assertion that the film retains its quality and appeal over time, succeeding in doing so to a noteworthy degree."},{"instruction":"Nochlezhka Swiss Solidarity, or NSS, was founded one year ago, in August 2008 in Geneva.

Context: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles.

Options: - garage - sidewalk - schoolyard - toy store - street. Explanation:","output":"A garage is the correct answer to \\"Where is a bicycle likely to be safe?\\" when compared to the other options (sidewalk, schoolyard, toy store, street) because it typically provides the most security, protection, and controlled environment. 1. Security: In a garage, a bicycle can be stored away from public view and access. This reduces the risk of theft and vandalization that could occur on a sidewalk, schoolyard, or in the street. In addition, a garage can be locked and secured, providing an extra layer of protection. 2. Protection: Garages generally protect bicycles from weather elements such as rain, snow, and direct sunlight. This helps prevent wear and tear, rusting, and damage that could occur if the bicycle was left outside on the sidewalk, schoolyard, or street. 3. Controlled environment: A garage is a private, enclosed space where a bicycle can be stored alongside other personal belongings, allowing the owner to control the environment in which the bicycle is kept. This ensures that the bicycle is not exposed to potential harm from passersby, animals, or laws governing public spaces (such as street cleaning or parking regulations that could result in a bicycle being moved or impounded). In contrast, the other options offer less security and protection: - Sidewalk, schoolyard, and street: These public spaces are exposed to weather elements and potential theft or vandalism. They also lack the ability to secure and control the environment surrounding your bicycle. - Toy store: Although a toy store may have some security measures in place, it is not designed for long-term storage of a bicycle, and protection from weather and other potential harm may be limited. Therefore, a garage is the safest option among the choices presented for securely storing a bicycle."},{"instruction":"The development of quadraphonic records was announced in 1971. These recorded four separate sound signals. This was achieved on the two stereo channels by electronic matrixing, where the additional channels were combined into the main signal. When the records were played, phase-detection circuits in the amplifiers were able to decode the signals into four separate channels. There were two main systems of matrixed quadraphonic records produced, confusingly named SQ (by CBS) and QS (by Sansui). They proved commercially unsuccessful, but were an important precursor to later surround-sound systems, as seen in SACD and home cinema today.

During their 2013 divorce proceedings, Elson entered into evidence an e-mail White had sent her that included disparaging remarks about The Black Keys. When asked about the email in a 2014 Rolling Stone magazine interview, White stood by the remarks saying, \\"I'll hear TV commercials where the music's ripping off sounds of mine, to the point I think it's me. Half the time, it's the Black Keys.\\" He later apologized for the comments. However, in September 2015, Patrick Carney of the band posted a series of tweets alleging that White tried to fight him in a bar. White denied the claim in a statement to the online magazine Pitchfork, saying that Carney should talk to him directly, and not on the internet. The following day, Carney posted a tweet saying, \\"Talked to jack for an hour he's cool. All good.\\" White tweeted on the Third Man Twitter account, \\"From one musician to another, you have my respect Patrick Carney.\\" On February 1, 2015, the University of Oklahoma's newspaper OU Daily ran a story regarding White's February 2 show at McCasland Field House that included the publication of White's tour rider. The rider, especially the guacamole recipe it included and White's ban of bananas backstage, received significant media coverage. It was later reported that in response to the rider's publication White's booking agency, William Morris Endeavor Entertainment, had banned its acts from playing shows at the University of Oklahoma. On February 15 White released an open letter addressed to \\"journalists and other people looking for drama or a diva\\" in which he referred to the guacamole recipe as his tour manager's \\"inside joke with local promoters\\" and \\"just something to break up the boredom\\" while criticizing journalists who wrote about the rider as \\"out of their element.\\" In the same letter he forgave OU Daily for publishing the story and reaffirmed his desire to perform in Oklahoma. In October 2016--upon learning that Donald Trump had used the White Stripes' song \\"Seven Nation Army\\" in video campaign materials--White denounced the presidential candidate, and began selling shirts reading \\"Icky Trump\\" through the Third Man Records website.

Emotional connection: After being away from their hometown for years, it is natural for a person to feel a strong emotional connection with the people they left behind, particularly their friends. Reconnecting with friends can help in reviving cherished memories and strengthening existing bonds. 2. Social nature: Humans are social creatures by nature and typically seek companionship and belongingness. Meeting with friends fulfills this basic human need for social interaction and connection, which is essential for overall well-being. 3. Changes and growth: Over the years, both the person returning and their friends would have experienced individual growth and changes in their lives. By meeting with old friends, one can catch up on the various events that took place during their absence and learn how their friends have evolved over time. 4. Support network: Friends often form part of a person's support network, offering emotional and practical support in times of need. Reconnecting with friends can help to re-establish this support system, which can be particularly valuable if the individual is returning to their hometown after a long time away and may not have a current network in place. 5.

Input: Uncontrolled intra-abdominal bleeding is a common cause of death in trauma patients in the prehospital and perioperative settings. The detrimental effects of abdominal hypertension are well studied, but the potential therapeutic use of abdominal insufflation for hemostasis has not been fully explored. We measured the effect of abdominal insufflation on blood loss and physiologic outcomes in a swine model of blunt liver injury.', 'Twenty-one anticoagulated swine (32 +/- 3 kg) were anesthesized; laparotomy was performed to localize liver anatomy and to place loose tourniquettes isolating the porta hepatis and supra/infrahepatic vena cava. A captive bolt gun was used to create a grade V hepatic laceration, producing massive parenchymal injury as well as complex tears of the middle and right hepatic veins. Animals were randomized into either control (n = 10) or abdominal insufflation at 20 cm H(2)O pressure (n = 11) groups. Crystalloid was used to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 30 mm Hg. Arterial pressure and other physiologic variables were recorded for 20 minutes.

Is there any proof of Google looking at private documents stored in Google Drive? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"Storing your photos in Google Drive offers a certain level of security and privacy, but it is essential to understand the mechanisms in place and potential risks for a more comprehensive view. Let's break down the factors impacting the security and privacy of your photos on Google Drive: 1. Encryption & Data Protection: Google Drive uses encryption to secure your photos both at rest and in transit. It uses SSL/TLS encryption when your photos are uploaded and downloaded between your device and Google Drive. Additionally, once your photos are stored on the Google servers, they are encrypted using AES128 or AES256 algorithms. Encryption helps protect your data from unauthorized access. However, given the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, no encryption method can guarantee complete protection. 2. Access Control: You have control over how you share your Google Drive files, including your photos. By default, your files are private, and only you can access them. Sharing settings allow you to grant specific individuals access to your files by specifying their email addresses. Additionally, you can generate shareable links giving anyone with the link access to the file. It is crucial always to review these settings and understand them before sharing your photos. 3. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Google offers two-factor authentication, an added layer of security requiring users to provide two proofs of identity before accessing their accounts. This can significantly decrease the risk of unauthorized access to your photos if your password is compromised. It is highly recommended to enable this feature on your account. 4. Google Privacy Policy & Access to Data: Google's privacy policy states that they may \\"collect, store, and process information in the United States and any other country where Google or its service providers operate.\\" While Google maintains that their employees do not have direct access to your content, the policy also states that Google can access your information under specific situations such as complying with legal requirements, detecting and preventing fraud, addressing security issues, or technical issues. This means that in rare circumstances, Google might access your private photos as per their privacy policy. 5. Potential Threats: Storing photos on Google Drive, like any other online storage, exposes them to potential threats such as hackers and data breaches. Although Google has robust security measures in place, the risk of unauthorized access cannot be completely eliminated. Regarding the question of whether there is any proof of Google looking at private documents stored in Google Drive, Google itself claims that they do not access or scan your Google Drive files for advertising purposes. However, as mentioned earlier, they might access your files in specific situations, as dictated by their privacy policy. In conclusion, while the questions are related, they are not the same. The first question concerns the security and privacy of storing photos on Google Drive, which depends on various factors, including encryption, access control, and Google's privacy policy. The second question focuses on whether there is any evidence that Google actively looks at private documents stored on its platform. While Google Drive offers notable security measures, it is always crucial to stay vigilant and take additional precautions to protect your photos, such as enabling two-factor authentication, regularly reviewing sharing settings, and having a strong, unique password. Finally, diversifying your data storage and having local backups can also help prevent data loss and enhance your privacy."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a set of context paragraph and some supporting facts to answer a question.

Context_10 : Suraiya Jamaal Sheikh (15 June 1929 – 31 January 2004), popularly known as Suraiya, was an Indian Muslim Hindi/Hindustani film actress and playback singer in Bollywood from the 1940s to the early 1960s, who remained unmarried throughout her life, after her love affair with actor Dev Anand was aborted by her maternal grandmother. She was the most popular singing star of the Indian sub-continent of her generation. Until 1943, as a child singer, Suraiya did playback singing for one actress, namely Mehtab, in three films, and also in some of her own films for her roles as a child artiste. After this, she only sang for her own films as an actress, and acted as a heroine from 1946 until the end of her career in 1963. From 1948 to 1951, she became the singing superstar of Bollywood, earning more for her performances than all the performing actors of the times, male or female, including Dev Anand, Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar, Nargis and Madhubala. She received 1.5–2 lakhs rupees for her role per film, when top male actors were getting 50 thousand to 1 lakh rs. For a song, she commanded rs. 1000, while Lata Mangeshkar was getting rs. 100–200 per song. She was the only child of her parents. She had a natural talent for singing, acting and dancing from childhood.

This style 'endowed modernity with an aura of tradition' and brought nostalgic feudal tinge to the scenes. Her performance 'expertly integrated gestures, music and speech'. Suraiya in her heyday was known as 'Malika-e-Husn' (queen of beauty), 'Malika-e-Tarannum' (queen of melody) and 'Malika-e-Adakaari' (queen of acting), all rolled into one.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which snake had more segments, the first or the second snake Dan found? Hint: At birth, a rattlesnake hatchling has only a small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached to the tip of the tail.[13] The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its skin for the first time.[14] A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.[15] Answer:","output":"The second snake Dan found had more segments. According to the information provided, a rattlesnake is born with a primordial rattle or a \\"button,\\" and it gains its first rattle segment when it sheds its skin for the first time. A new segment is added with every subsequent shedding. Although the rattle's length is not a reliable age indicator due to segments breaking off, we can still compare the rattles of the two snakes in question. The first snake had only one rattle, meaning it had shed its skin once after birth and gained its first segment. The second snake, on the other hand, had four rattles, which indicates it had shed its skin four times and gained four segments.

Blend the ingredients: Use an immersion blender or a countertop blender to process the cooked ingredients until they achieve a smooth consistency. This step is crucial as it ensures that the cat food mixture is easy for your feline friend to digest and absorb all the essential nutrients. 2. Check for the right consistency: The cat food mixture should be thick but not too dry. If the consistency seems too thick, add some water or low-sodium chicken broth to adjust. On the other hand, if it is too watery, you can simmer the mixture for a longer time to help reduce the excess liquid. 3. Taste and adjust seasoning: Although cats are primarily carnivorous, they can still detect certain flavors. To ensure that the cat food recipe is both nutritious and tasty, it's essential to taste the mixture and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Since many commercial cat foods contain artificial flavorings, using natural herbs and spices in small amounts can benefit your cat's health. However, it's important to research which herbs and spices are safe for cats before adding them to the mixture. 4. Mix in the supplements: Before portioning out the cat food, make sure to add any essential supplements that the recipe calls for or that you feel would benefit your cat's health. Common supplements include taurine, an essential amino acid for cats, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, and a balanced blend of essential vitamins and minerals. Consult your veterinarian to determine your cat's specific needs and dosage amounts. 5. Portion and store: Divide the cat food mixture into appropriate serving sizes based on your cat's age, size, and dietary needs. Store the portions in airtight containers in the refrigerator for up to five days, or in the freezer for up to three months. 6. Gradual introduction: Introduce the new holistic cat food recipe into your cat's diet gradually, starting with small amounts mixed in with their current food. Over the course of a week or two, you can increase the proportion of the new food while reducing the amount of the old food until you have completely transitioned your cat to the new recipe. 7. Monitor your cat's health: Even though this holistic cat food recipe is designed to promote whole health, it's important to keep a close eye on your cat's overall health, weight, and eating habits. If you notice any unusual changes, consult your veterinarian. 8. Make adjustments when necessary: The nutritional needs of your cat may change over time or in response to certain factors such as age, medical conditions, or changes in physical activity. Be prepared to adjust the recipe as needed to meet your cat's needs and seek advice from a veterinarian when in doubt. By following these steps and taking the time to create a balanced and nutritious cat food recipe, you are taking a proactive approach to your cat's health and well-being. Embracing a holistic approach to cat food can help you avoid common health issues associated with commercial pet foods and promote a healthier lifestyle for your feline friend. Remember, it is always a good idea to consult with your veterinarian before making significant changes to your pet's diet."},{"instruction":"WENTWORTH, England : Ernie Els proved himself the master of the World Match Play championship on Sunday when he won a record breaking sixth title - beating England #39;s Lee Westwood 2 and 1 in the 36-hole final.

They wound up leading one of the most violent Islamist groups fighting in Syria's civil war. Their story serves as a cautionary tale days... ||||| Story highlights About 17% of Gitmo detainees return to terrorist activities, report says As of last month, the Guantanamo Bay detention facility had 154 detainees Not everyone at Guantanamo Bay has been found guilty of terrorism Guantanamo Bay detainees have long been considered America's most dangerous enemies. Do they return to terror activities or transition to quiet, private lives away from the mayhem? Well, it's a mixture of both. How dangerous is this latest swap?

But President Barack Obama's administration maintains it's not a risky move for the United States. JUST WATCHED Video released of Bergdahl's transfer Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Video released of Bergdahl's transfer 04:12 The five detainees have been at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba for years, and out of commission for a long time. They probably don't have extensive networks to tap into, according to two senior U.S. officials. Additionally, there will be fewer U.S. forces to target in Afghanistan since under a new agreement, most troops will be out of the nation next year. Qatar has also reassured the United States that it will aggressively monitor the detainees, who will be under a travel ban for one year. How many freed detainees have returned to terrorism? At its peak, Guantanamo Bay had 770 men believed by the U.S. government to be involved in terrorist activity or military attacks. That number has dwindled significantly. As of last month, the facility had 154 detainees. A September 2013 report from the director of national intelligence reflected on what happened to the roughly 600 people who left Gitmo between its opening in 2002 and July 2013. Of those, 100 -- or 16.6% of the released prisoners -- were \\"confirmed\\" to have returned \\"to terrorist activities.\\" Seventeen of those died, while 27 ended up in custody, according to the DNI report. An additional 70 are \\"suspected of reengaging,\\" it said. \\"Based on trends identified during the past 10 years, we assess that if additional detainees are transferred without conditions ... some will reengage in terrorist or insurgent activities,\\" the report said. Does the U.S. keep an eye on freed detainees? While the former prisoners are no longer under its control, Washington says it keeps track of them, which is the basis of the DNI report. During President George W. Bush's administration, some were handed over to authorities in other countries. Dozens more were released under Obama. Are American interests more at risk when they get out? There are a lot of variables, making this a debatable question. Except for those accused or convicted of the most heinous crimes such as murder, most people are not detained indefinitely. And studies show the recidivism rate for those in the U.S. legal system typically top 50% or even 60%, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics . Armed with that knowledge, the idea of a Gitmo detainee returning to his previous ways may not be surprising. It also depends on where they go from there. The DNI report notes the dangers of transferring prisoners to nations with conflicts, instability and active recruitment by terror groups. In other words, a detainee who returns to a place beset by violence -- where terrorist groups and attacks are common -- is more likely to return to the fold. Does this mean the U.S. got a raw deal in Bergdahl's release? Depends on whom you ask. Sen. John McCain , a former prisoner of war, is not popping the Champagne just yet. He knows a thing or two about life in enemy hands after spending more than five years in captivity in North Vietnam. Since then, he has emerged as one of the nation's loudest, boldest voices on military matters. And he feels strongly that the United States did not think this through. \\"Don't trade one person for five (of) the hardest of the hard-core, murdering war criminals who will clearly re-enter the fight and send them to Qatar, of all places,\\" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday night. But White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice defended the Obama administration's decision. The \\"acute urgency\\" of Bergdahl's health condition justified the President not notifying Congress beforehand that he was being swapped for the five detainees, she said. Why are terror suspects held at Guantanamo Bay? The U.S. naval base there was transformed after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks . Existing migrant detention facilities were revamped to house detainees of the so-called war on terror. JUST WATCHED What happened when Bergdahl disappeared? Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH 'It matters a lot if he was a deserter' 05:03 These were men, who though captured in the battlefield, didn't fit any detention category. U.S. authorities said they didn't have the same rights as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions. Nor did they have the same rights as those detained within the United States. The Bush administration argued that since the detainees were not on U.S. soil, they were not covered by the U.S. Constitution. It used that rationale to justify the lack of legal protections for those detained. That made the base sometimes referred to as Gitmo a sort of no man's land. How much does it cost to keep it running? Shortly after his inauguration in 2009, Obama signed an executive order to close the detention facility within one year. It has not happened. Has everyone at Gitmo been found guilty of terrorism? No. Peter Bergen, a CNN national security analyst, and Bailey Cahall, a research associate at the New America Foundation, wrote in an op-ed last year that said dozens of detainees cleared for release years ago \\"remain in seemingly perpetual custody.\\" \\"They have found to be guilty of nothing, yet they are being held indefinitely,\\" Bergen and Cahall wrote. \\"Indefinite detention without charge is a policy that we usually associate with dictatorships, not democracies.\\" Bergen also heads the New America Foundation's International Security Program. Others, though, view the situation differently. They say terrorists don't play by any recognized rules of warfare or justice; their mission is to kill, with U.S. forces and citizens as their targets. McCain says that the five men released as part of the Bergdahl deal could be among those attacking U.S. citizens both at home and overseas. The five \\"were judged time after time as unworthy ... that needed to be kept in detention because they posed a risk and a threat to the United States of America,\\" the Arizona Republican said. Who were the detainees swapped for Bergdahl? Two senior Obama administration officials identified them as Khair Ulla Said Wali Khairkhwa, Mullah Mohammad Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori, Abdul Haq Wasiq and Mohammad Nabi Omari. They were mostly mid- to high-level officials in the Taliban regime who were detained early in the war in Afghanistan because of their positions within the Taliban, not because of ties to al Qaeda. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Three Moroccan militants, previously released from Guantanamo by the U.S. and turned over to the Moroccan government, ended up leading one of the most violent Islamist groups in Syria's civil war. A report indicates that about 17% of Guantanamo detainees return to terrorist activities. As of last month, Guantanamo Bay housed 154 detainees. A concern is raised over how dangerous the latest swap of detainees might be. However, the Obama administration refutes these concerns as the detention facility has not been a recruiting ground for extended terror networks. Nevertheless, an intelligence report from September 2013 shared that of about 600 detainees who left Guantanamo between 2002 and 2013, 100 were confirmed to have returned to terrorist activities. The report also forecasted a likelihood of some transferred detainees reengaging in terrorist activities. The U.S. maintains surveillance on freed detainees and many of them were handed over to foreign authorities or released under President Obama's administration. The continuous release of detainees poses a debatable risk to American interests. The recidivism rate amidst former Guantanamo detainees could be influenced by the conflict level in the areas they returned to. Critics such as Sen. John McCain express concerns about these practices. McCain believes that swapping detainees like the notorious case of Bergdahl's release lacks thorough consideration for potential adversarial consequences. Guantanamo Bay was repurposed after the 9/11 terrorist attacks to house terror suspects due to their undefined detention category under either the Geneva Conventions or the U.S. Constitution. The closure of the facility has been attempted but has not been achieved. Despite the notorious reputation of the Bay, not all detainees found there have been guilty of terrorism, with some being kept in seemingly perpetual time of custody.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose money is needed for other things happens, how will it affect MORE aluminum cans being recycled. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis states that if money is needed for other things, it may have an effect on the process of recycling aluminum cans. Let's analyze this step-by-step: 1. The consumer throws aluminum cans and foil into a recycle bin - If money is needed for other things, this may lead to cutbacks in public services, potentially including recycling programs. This could make it more difficult for consumers to access recycling bins, potentially reducing the amount of aluminum recycled. 2. The aluminum is collected - If budgets are tight, waste management companies may face financial constraints. This could lead to less frequent collection services, reducing the volume of aluminum recycled. 3. Taken to a treatment plant - If money is needed elsewhere, treatment plants may face budget cuts or scaled-back operations, potentially limiting the amount of aluminum they can process. 4. The aluminum is sorted and cleaned, ready for reprocessing - Reduced funding may lead to less efficient sorting and cleaning processes, potentially reducing the quality of the recycled aluminum or the overall volume. 5. The aluminum is re-melted and turned into molten aluminum - On this step, the perturbation might not have a significant direct impact as the process is largely dependent on the proper functioning of the melting furnaces. 6. The aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots - If resources are scarce, there may be fewer facilities available to process ingots or lower-capacity machinery, potentially slowing down the ingot production process. 7. The ingots are sent to mills to be rolled out - Budget cuts might lead to delays in transportation or higher costs, which could affect how ingots are rolled out and converted into usable materials. 8. The rolled-out product is made into new aluminum products - Limited funding could translate to reduced research or investments in new production technologies, potentially decreasing the efficiency of manufacturing new aluminum products. In conclusion, the perturbation that money is needed for other things could have both direct and indirect effects on the process of recycling aluminum cans. It may lead to reductions in waste management and recycling services, potential inefficiencies in the treatment and reprocessing facilities, and potential impacts on the production of new aluminum products. All these factors could potentially contribute to a decrease in the overall volume of aluminum cans being recycled."},{"instruction":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Domingo Jesús Ramón Menargues, a retired long-distance runner from Spain, was born in Crevillente, in which city and port in Spain on the Costa Blanca, the capital of the province of the same name, and of the comarca of Alacantí, in the south of the Valencian Community, both the Spanish and Valencian being official names?","output":"Domingo Jesús Ramón Menargues, the retired long-distance runner from Spain, was born in Crevillente.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"In 2008 the Government of Canada made efforts, through the Canada First Defence Strategy, to modernize the Canadian Armed Forces, through the purchase of new equipment, improved training and readiness, as well as the establishment of the Canadian Special Operations Regiment. More funds were also put towards recruitment, which had been dwindling throughout the 1980s and '90s, possibly because the Canadian populace had come to perceive the CAF as peacekeepers rather than as soldiers, as shown in a 2008 survey conducted for the Department of National Defence. The poll found that nearly two thirds of Canadians agreed with the country's participation in the invasion of Afghanistan, and that the military should be stronger, but also that the purpose of the forces should be different, such as more focused on responding to natural disasters. Then CDS, Walter Natynczyk, said later that year that while recruiting has become more successful, the CF was facing a problem with its rate of loss of existing members, which increased between 2006 and 2008 from 6% to 9.2% annually.\\"?

Both just received their blood test results and were told that they need to improve their cholesterol levels. They were each recommended to make changes to their diets. Michael took this advice to heart, and reduced the levels of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol he consumed. Robert, on the other hand, continued to consume high levels of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will be at lower risk for atherosclerosis in the future? Hint: Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol.

I will discuss each step in this four part series. ————————————————— EAT WHAT YOU WANT DOES YOUR FOOD SING TO YOU? Have a look in your fridge and cupboards. Does the food in there sing to you, does it call your name, and are you looking forward to eating it? Do you eat it because you enjoy it or because you think you should? By choosing only to eat what sings to me, I have discovered (again!) that I am not a big fan of meat and would rather eat a predominantly vegetarian diet. Occasionally I’ll eat chicken leg and I love bacon but beyond that I’m not fussed. FOOD DOES NOT HAVE A VALUE There are no good and bad foods. There are no trigger foods or forbidden foods. There is nosuch thing as junk. There is a place in your diet for your favourite indulgences in moderation.

Which language is this?","output":"The phrase \\"Roztočíme to jak na Prvního máje\\" is in Czech, a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic. This language belongs to the larger Indo-European family, and it is closely related to other Slavic languages such as Slovak, Polish, and Russian. In this specific phrase, \\"Roztočíme to jak na Prvního máje\\" can be translated to \\"Let's spin it like on the May 1st.\\" Here, \\"roztočíme\\" means \\"let's spin,\\" \\"to\\" means \\"it,\\" \\"jak\\" means \\"like,\\" \\"na\\" means \\"on,\\" \\"Prvního\\" means \\"first,\\" and \\"máje\\" refers to the month of \\"May.\\" The context of this phrase is likely related to the celebrations and events associated with the International Workers' Day, known as \\"První máj\\" in Czech. The International Workers' Day is a day of political demonstrations, parades, and celebrations organized by labor unions, socialist, and communist political groups, held on May 1st each year. The phrase seems to convey a sense of excitement and liveliness, encouraging the listener to join in the festive activities and enjoy themselves. Czech is an inflected language with a complex system of declensions and conjugations. It uses the Latin alphabet with several special characters, including diacritics such as the háček (ˇ) and the acute accent (´), which helps to distinguish between the various consonants and vowels, as well as marking stress, length, and intonation. Some examples of special characters in the Czech alphabet are: \\"č,\\" \\"ř,\\" \\"š,\\" \\"ž,\\" \\"ě,\\" and \\"ů.\\" The Czech language has a rich history that can be traced back to the 9th-10th century when it evolved from the West Slavic dialects spoken by the Slavs living within the Great Moravian Empire. The written form of Czech was initially based on the Glagolitic script while later adopting the Latin script under the influence of Christianity and the missionary work of Saints Cyril and Methodius. Throughout history, the Czech language has been influenced by Latin, German, and other Slavic languages, especially Slovak due to the historical connection between these two nations, as seen in the former Czechoslovakia. Today, the Czech language is not only an important part of the linguistic landscape of Central Europe, but it is also a source of pride and cultural identity for the Czech people."},{"instruction":"Question: Sonia has a sports collection.

The East China Sea is a part of the Pacific Ocean and covers an area of roughly . To the east lies the Japanese islands of Kyushu and the Ryukyu Islands, to the south lies the South China Sea, and to the west by the Asian continent. The sea connects with the Sea of Japan through the Korea Strait and opens to the north into the Yellow Sea. The sovereign states which border the sea include South Korea, Japan, the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - Iejima ( Iejima ) , previously romanized in English as Ie Shima , is an island in Okinawa Prefecture , Japan , lying a few kilometers off the Motobu Peninsula on Okinawa Island . The island measures 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) in circumference and covers 23 square kilometres ( 8.9 sq mi ) . As of December 2012 the island had a population of 4,610 . Most islanders live in Ie Village , which has a ferry connection with the town Motobu on Okinawa Island . Iejima is generally flat . The most notable geographic feature is a peak called Mount Gusuku ( or locally \`\` Tacchu '' ) at a height of 172 meters . The mountain resembles a volcano but is actually an erosion artifact . U.S. journalist Ernie Pyle died there during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. There is a monument dedicated to his memory on the southern part of the island . Every year on the weekend closest to his April 18 death there is a memorial service . Alternately called \`\` Peanut Island , '' for its general shape and peanut crop , or \`\` Flower Island , '' for its abundant flora and more sizeable crop , Iejima draws tourists by ferry , especially during late April when the Ie Lily Festival begins . The Youth Excursion Village accommodates campers for 400 Yen a person and includes access to a good beach . The YYY Resort and Hotel located just east of the ferry port is available for those who do not wish to camp . - Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a state in East Asia. Neighbors include China (officially the People's Republic of China, abbreviated as PRC) to the west, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations, and the one with the largest economy. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - The Korean War (in South Korean , \\"Korean War\\"; in North Korean , \\"Fatherland Liberation War\\"; 25 June 1950 27 July 1953) began when North Korea invaded South Korea. The United Nations, with the United States as the principal force, came to the aid of South Korea. China came to the aid of North Korea, and the Soviet Union gave some assistance. - Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\") and South Korea (officially the \\"Republic of Korea\\"). Located on the Korean Peninsula, Korea is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the East Sea. - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest. - The Vietnam War, also known as the Second Indochina War, and known in Vietnam as Resistance War Against America or simply the American War, was a war that occurred in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975. It was the second of the Indochina Wars and was officially fought between North Vietnam and the government of South Vietnam. The North Vietnamese army was supported by the Soviet Union, China and other communist allies and the South Vietnamese army was supported by the United States, South Korea, Australia, Thailand and other anti-communist allies and the war is therefore considered a Cold War-era proxy war. - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - A magma chamber is a large underground pool of liquid rock found beneath the surface of the Earth. The molten rock in such a chamber is under great pressure, and given enough time, that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it creating outlets for the magma. If it finds a way to the surface, then the result will be a volcanic eruption; consequently many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers. Magma chambers are hard to detect, and most of the known ones are therefore close to the surface of the Earth, commonly between 1 km and 10 km under the surface. In geological terms, this is extremely close to the surface, although in human terms, it is considerably deep underground. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - It rises above east of the island and is clearly visible from the main island of Okinawa and in the East China Sea. The outline of Mount Gusuku can be clearly seen from the Motobu Peninsula on Okinawa Island and Sesoko Island. The mountain has historically served as a nautical landmark and appears in Japanese nautical charts from the medieval period. - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from . - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - The Iraq War was a protracted armed conflict that began in 2003 with the invasion of Iraq by a United States-led coalition that toppled the government of Saddam Hussein. The conflict continued for much of the next decade as an insurgency emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government. An estimated 151,000 to 600,000 or more Iraqis were killed in the first 34 years of conflict. The United States officially withdrew from the country in 2011 but left private security contractors in its place to continue the war. It again became re-involved in 2014 at the head of a new coalition; the insurgency and many dimensions of the civil armed conflict continue. - A cay (or ), also spelled caye or key, is a small, low-elevation, sandy island on the surface of a coral reef. Cays occur in tropical environments throughout the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans (including in the Caribbean and on the Great Barrier Reef and Belize Barrier Reef). - Okinawa has been a critical strategic location for the United States Armed Forces since the end of World War II. The island hosts around 26,000 US military personnel, about half of the total complement of the United States Forces Japan, spread among 32 bases and 48 training sites. US bases in Okinawa played critical roles in the Korean War, Vietnam War, War in Afghanistan and Iraq War. The presence of the US military in Okinawa has caused political controversy both on the island and elsewhere in Japan. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - The Sea of Okhotsk is a marginal sea of the western Pacific Ocean, lying between the Kamchatka Peninsula on the east, the Kuril Islands on the southeast, the island of Hokkaido to the south, the island of Sakhalin along the west, and a long stretch of eastern Siberian coast (the Shantar Sea) along the west and north. The northeast corner is the Shelikhov Gulf. The sea is named after Okhotsk, the first Russian settlement in the Far East. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - Lake Island is an island on the coast of the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is located between Mathieson Channel and Lady Trutch Passage, and is flanked by Dowager Island (to the northwest), Lady Douglas Island (to the west), and a long finger shaped peninsula of the Canadian mainland to the east. Ironically, Lake Island is not a lake island, as it is in an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, and lies only some 6 kilometres from the open sea. - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines. - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south. - Magma (from Ancient Greek (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock.

Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"No, the statement is not entirely factual. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. Sustainability is a broad concept that generally refers to meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This encompasses various aspects, including economic, social, and environmental factors. 2. Although growing potatoes year-round could be a component of a sustainable lifestyle, it is not a comprehensive approach towards sustainability. Focusing solely on growing potatoes may help in achieving some sustainable goals, such as reducing food miles, waste, and improving food security, but it doesn't cover the other important aspects of sustainability. 3. Households may not be able to grow potatoes year-round due to various factors, such as climate, space, soil, and resources. In some regions, the weather may not be conducive for year-round potato farming, and households might lack the space or proper conditions for growing potatoes. 4. True sustainability involves a more extensive and well-rounded approach, which would include not only local food production but also efficient resource management, reducing energy consumption, promoting social equity, and preserving biodiversity, among other things.

If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.

Plot title: Zulu Dawn Movie plot: The film is set in British South Africa, in the province of Natal, in January 1879. The first act of the film revolves around the administrators and officials of Cape Colony, notably the supremely arrogant Lord Chelmsford and the scheming Sir Henry Bartle Frere, who both wish to crush the neighbouring Zulu Empire, which is perceived as a threat to Cape Colony's emerging industrial economy. Bartle Frere issues an impossible ultimatum to the Zulu king, Cetshwayo, demanding that he dissolve the Zulu Empire. Cetshwayo refuses, providing Cape Colony with a pretext to invade Zululand. Despite objections from leading members of Cape Colony's high society and from Great Britain itself, Bartle Frere authorises Lord Chelmsford to lead a British invasion force into Zululand. The rest of the film focuses on the British invasion of Zululand and the lead-up to the Battle of Isandlwana. The invading British army, laden with an immense network of supply wagons, invades Zululand and marches in the direction of Ulundi, the Zulu capital. British forces, eager to fight a large battle in which they can unleash their cutting-edge military technology against the vast Zulu army, become increasingly frustrated as the main Zulu army refuses to attack the British, and fighting is restricted to a few small skirmishes between British and Zulu scouts. Concerned that their supply lines are becoming overstretched and that the main Zulu army is still at large, British troops begin torturing captive Zulu warriors in an effort to learn the location and tactics of the Zulu army. Halfway to Ulundi, Chelmsford halts his army at the base of Mount Isandhlwana, ignoring the advice of Boer attendants to entrench the camp and laager the supply wagons, leaving the camp dangerously exposed. During the night, Colonel Durnford and an escort of fifty mounted Basutos approach the camp.

Step-by-step explanation and justification: 1. Start translating the sentence chunk by chunk. I voted -> Am votat Justification: I used the proper pronoun \\"Eu\\" (I) and the Romanian verb for \\"voted\\" (votat), making \\"Eu am votat\\". In Romanian, the pronoun can be omitted, so I shortened it to \\"Am votat\\". 2. Translate \\"to strengthen the OSCE\\" into Romanian. to strengthen -> pentru consolidarea the OSCE -> OSCE (no need to translate the acronym) Justification: \\"to strengthen\\" is translated to \\"pentru consolidarea\\", and OSCE is a well-known international organization and its acronym remains the same in Romanian. 3. Translate \\"which must be based on harmony between\\" into Romanian. which must be -> care trebuie să fie based on -> bazat pe harmony between -> armonia dintre Justification: \\"which must be\\" as \\"care trebuie să fie\\" is a relative clause, \\"based on\\" is translated to \\"bazat pe\\", and \\"harmony between\\" to \\"armonia dintre\\". 4. Translate \\"the three main pillars\\" into Romanian. the three -> cele trei main pillars -> piloni principali Justification: \\"the three\\" is translated to \\"cele trei\\" and \\"main pillars\\" to \\"piloni principali\\". 5. Translate \\"that the organisation is founded on\\" into Romanian. that -> pe care the organisation is founded on -> organizația este fondată Justification: \\"that\\" is translated to \\"pe care\\", and \\"the organisation is founded on\\" to \\"organizația este fondată\\". 6.

This marks the completion of one respiratory cycle, after which the process starts over again. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the entire respiratory process, let's break it down into its individual steps: 1. Inhalation: The primary muscles involved in inhalation are the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles. As these muscles contract, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, leading to a decrease in pressure within the cavity in comparison to the external environment. This pressure difference causes air to flow into the lungs through the nose or mouth. 2. Air enters the respiratory tract: Once the air is inhaled, it passes through the nasal cavity, where it is filtered, warmed, and humidified. It then proceeds through the pharynx, larynx, and trachea before finally reaching the bronchi. 3. Gas exchange in the lungs: The bronchi branch into smaller tubes called bronchioles, which continue to narrow until they end in clusters of microscopic air sacs called alveoli. These alveoli are where the actual gas exchange takes place. They have an extensive network of capillaries, tiny blood vessels that transport oxygen and carbon dioxide between the alveoli and the bloodstream. 4. Oxygenation of blood: Once in the alveoli, the oxygen molecules from the inhaled air diffuse across the thin walls of the alveoli and into the surrounding capillaries. The oxygen molecules then bind to hemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cells, which transports the oxygen to the various tissues and organs throughout the body. 5. Carbon dioxide removal: Simultaneously, carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, diffuses out of the bloodstream and into the alveoli. This process is driven by the higher concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood compared to the air in the alveoli. 6. Exhalation: As the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, the volume of the thoracic cavity decreases, and the pressure within it rises above the external atmospheric pressure. This pressure difference forces the air, which now contains waste gases like carbon dioxide and any unused oxygen, to flow out of the lungs and exit the body through the mouth. So, the final step in the outlined process is the exhalation of waste gases, mainly carbon dioxide, along with any unused oxygen through the mouth, marking the end of one respiratory cycle and the beginning of the next. This ongoing process of inhalation and exhalation allows for continuous and efficient exchange of gases, ensuring that the body's tissues receive a constant supply of oxygen while simultaneously eliminating waste products."},{"instruction":"Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Remy gave Cameron the benefit of the doubt. And I was wondering What does Remy need to do before this? Answer:","output":"Before giving Cameron the benefit of the doubt, Remy should follow a series of steps to better understand the situation and make an informed decision. Here is a detailed breakdown of these steps: 1. Observation and documentation: The first thing Remy needs to do is observe Cameron closely and document any unusual or unresponsive behaviors they notice. This will help Remy create a clear picture of what is happening and establish a baseline for comparing Cameron's behavior over time. 2. Gather information: Next, Remy should gather information from multiple sources such as friends, family, and co-workers, who may have observed similar behaviors in Cameron. Gathering information from multiple sources will give Remy a comprehensive understanding of the situation and help identify any patterns in Cameron's behavior. 3. Open conversation: Remy should have an open and honest conversation with Cameron about the behaviors they've observed. It's essential to approach this conversation with empathy, understanding, and a genuine willingness to listen to Cameron's perspective. It may be a difficult conversation, but it's crucial for understanding the reasons behind Cameron's actions and finding possible solutions. 4. Assess for external factors: Remy should consider any external factors that might have contributed to Cameron's unusual behavior. This could include stress at work or home, health issues, or changes in personal relationships. Understanding the context in which the behavior has occurred can provide valuable insight and help identify potential solutions. 5. Reflect on past experiences: Remy should reflect on any past experiences they may have had with Cameron that could help them better understand the current situation. Were there previous instances where Cameron acted unresponsive, and if so, can Remy draw parallels between those situations and the present one? Understanding the dynamics of past interactions can help shed light on current issues. 6. Seek professional help if necessary: In cases where the situation becomes too challenging to handle independently, Remy should not hesitate to seek professional help. This may include involving a counselor, therapist, or other mental health professionals who can offer guidance and support for both Remy and Cameron. 7. Make a decision: Based on the observations, information gathered, conversations with Cameron, and consideration of external factors, Remy should have a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. It is at this point that Remy can decide whether to give Cameron the benefit of the doubt or take a different course of action. By following these steps before giving Cameron the benefit of the doubt, Remy can ensure that they've made a thoughtful and well-informed decision based on a thorough understanding of the situation. Ultimately, this will help Remy support Cameron through their unusual behavior and find appropriate strategies to manage and address any concerns that arise."},{"instruction":"Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Their union had settled and they would go off strike and what? Possible A: demands were met, complaints had been addressed, be satisfied, get back to work, more money Why is \\"get back to work\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","output":"\\"Get back to work\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it reflects a natural progression and resolution of the situation described in the question. When examining the context given, we can see that the union had settled, meaning an agreement must have been reached and the primary issues that led to the strike have been addressed or resolved. In this case, the probable issues include demands being met or complaints being addressed. When a strike ends, it is logical and in alignment with human common sense that the workers would return to their jobs. The main reason for the strike was to bring attention to their concerns and negotiate for better working conditions, wages, or other benefits. It is reasonable to assume that once those issues have been resolved, the workers would no longer feel the need to strike and instead would resume their normal activities. Returning to work after a strike serves several purposes. First, it allows workers and the employer to resume operations, which benefits the business and helps to maintain goodwill between both parties. Second, it demonstrates that the union and employer were able to find a mutually beneficial solution, which could encourage collaboration and cooperation in the future.

When a judge takes the bench, they carry the responsibility of fairly interpreting the law and administering justice without prejudice. However, the recent indictment of a former Arkansas judge on federal fraud and bribery charges casts a glaring light on the corruption that quietly lurks within the halls of our justice system. Background of the Case: The former Arkansas judge in question is accused of an egregious abuse of power, allegedly offering leniency to male defendants in exchange for explicit photos and sexual acts. The indictment includes several federal charges, ranging from fraud to bribery, painting a startling picture of a judicial figure who purportedly manipulated the legal system for personal gain and sexual favors. This shameful revelation is not only a blow to the American judicial system, but also a sobering reminder of the consequences of unchecked power. Details of the Alleged Crimes: The crux of the accusation leveled against the indicted judge revolves around a systematic misuse of his position with sinister intent. According to investigators, the former judge allegedly sought out young, male defendants with pending cases, offering them reduced sentences or dismissals in exchange for explicit photographs or participation in sexual acts. His illicit conduct allegedly spanned several years and victimized numerous individuals, many of whom felt they had no recourse but to comply with the judge's demands to avoid harsher punishment. The Implications of the Indictment: The federal indictment of a judge on charges of fraud and bribery represents a severe breach of trust in the legal system. It is essential for those in positions of authority, especially within the judiciary, to maintain the highest level of integrity and moral conduct. Corruption in the courts not only undermines the pursuit of justice but also erodes public trust in the institutions that govern our society. As the case unfolds, it is expected to bring increased scrutiny to courtrooms across the nation. It could potentially prompt further investigations into potential misconduct by other judicial figures. At the same time, it may drive court systems to address and implement better oversight measures to prevent future exploitation and protect defendants' rights. The Role of AI and Oversight in the Judicial System: In recent years, there has been growing interest in leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to augment and improve the decision-making process in the courts. AI-driven tools and technologies can potentially help eliminate human errors, unconscious biases, and reduce the chances of judicial misconduct and abuse of power. While the integration of AI into the judiciary might not be an immediate solution, it does call attention to the need for increased transparency and oversight in the courts. Providing better monitoring tools, performance assessments, and increased public access to court proceedings could dissuade corrupt practices and help identify dangerous patterns of behavior. Conclusion: The indictment of the former Arkansas judge shakes the core of our justice system, underscoring the need for a more accountable and transparent judiciary. As the consequences of such corruption reverberate through the legal community, it is crucial to use this case as a catalyst for positive change and building safeguards to prevent future misconduct. By holding those in power accountable and advocating for stronger oversight measures, society can work to ensure that justice is served fairly and impartially for all its citizens."},{"instruction":"Is the following statement true? \\"People use Joule to measure someone or something.\\" Chain of thought and solution for this question is:","output":"The statement is partially true. People use Joule as a unit of measurement, but not to measure someone or something directly. Joule is a unit of energy in the International System of Units (SI). It is used to measure the work done, heat transfer, or energy conversion in various physical, electrical, and mechanical systems. Joules help quantify the amount of energy required or produced in scientific, engineering, and technological contexts.

But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis.

Malaysian officials have created confusion by issuing contradictory statements on key aspects of the investigation.

Thorne goes with the group to their compound. Griswold stays with the boat, to come ashore later. The situation in the compound is less than safe. During evening cocktails, Thorne becomes aware of a life-threatening situation. Marlowe Cragis performs well-meaning research on serums and uses shrews as test animals. The doctor's purpose is to make humans half-size in order to reduce world hunger; smaller humans will eat less food on a planet with a limited food supply. Unfortunately, the doctor's experiments created mutant giant shrews that escaped and are reproducing outside the compound, growing larger by the day. The scientist and his staff barricade themselves inside their compound each evening. Thorne and Ann begin to fall in love, causing jealousy in Jerry.

The singer sighed heavily as District Judge Perkins said he would serve four weeks in prison and spend the remainder on licence. Michael was also banned from driving for five years and ordered to pay a £1,250 fine, £100 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. One fan sobbed in the public gallery as he was taken down from the dock by security guards. Michael's guilty plea and remorse allowed District Judge Perkins to reduce the sentence, he said, but not to offer the community sentence requested by the defence. Michael was arrested in Hampstead shortly before 4am on July 4 when two police officers found him apparently unconscious in his grey Range Rover in Rosslyn Hill. When told he had crashed into a shop, he added: \\"No I didn't. I didn't crash into anything.\\" At Hampstead police station he failed a test to find whether he was fit to drive. The musician admitted smoking a \\"small quantity\\" of cannabis about 10pm the previous evening and said he also took the anti-depressant Amitriptyline to help him sleep. He told police he decided to drive between his homes in Highgate and Hampstead to meet a friend and forgot he had taken the sedative. District Judge Perkins said: \\"You drove your motor vehicle about a mile while suffering from a severe impairment as a result of mixing not only a prescription treatment with which you were unfamiliar but also with cannabis. \\"That's a dangerous and unpredictable mix and something which for you is dangerous given your record. \\"It does not appear that you took proper steps to deal with what is clearly an addiction to cannabis. \\"That's a mistake which puts you and, on this occasion, the public at risk.\\" The district judge said he took into account that Michael had checked into a clinic after the crash to seek help for anxiety, depression and insomnia, which had led him to depend on prescription drugs and had noted he was dealing with bereavement issues. \\"I accept entirely that you have shown remorse for the offence, that you are ashamed of it, that you admitted it,\\" he said, but added that \\"with regret\\" a jail term was inevitable because of Michael's previous conviction. Michael's long-term partner Kenny Goss threw his head into his hands in despair at that point. Mukul Chawla QC, mitigating, said Michael personally repaid the cost of the damage to the shop owner and had asked that his \\"profound shame and horror of having repeated the conduct of 2006\\" was made clear to the court. \\"He acknowledges his actions of driving had the effect of causing other road users to be in danger and that stark fact is something about which he is greatly ashamed. \\"The prospect he could have put anyone else in danger is an appalling prospect to him.\\" He said Michael had tried to turn his life around. \\"For the first time in many years he has started writing again. His creativity, so long hampered by his drug dependence, is re-emerging.\\" Mr Chawla said Michael had tried to come off prescription drugs without professional help earlier this year but symptoms returned so he sought medical help and was given Amitriptyline. Michael remained an outpatient at the rehab clinic, he added. The singer, wearing a charcoal suit with a black tie, spoke only to confirm his name and address and to say he would prefer to be addressed by his stage name. The jail sentence is the culmination of a long line of clashes with the law for the singer, who has been open about his use of cannabis and claimed in the past that he was trying to cut down. Michael was banned from driving for two years and sentenced to 100 hours of community service after he was convicted of driving while unfit through drugs after he was found collapsed in his Mercedes in 2006. He was cautioned twice in 2006 for possession of cannabis and cautioned for possession for crack cocaine and cannabis two years later. He was fined for \\"engaging in a lewd act\\" in a California public toilet in 1998. Fans gathered outside the court to get a glimpse of the star, screaming his name and trying to break through a barrier of 12 police officers as he arrived at court this afternoon. One fan passed a good luck card for Michael to Mr Goss. Shelly Williams, 41, from east London, sobbed from the public gallery as Michael was sentenced. \\"I have been a fan for 26 years - that's longer than a marriage. \\"I hope he continues with the process of making himself better.\\" Summary:","output":"Singer George Michael has been jailed for eight weeks after being found unconscious in his car due to the influence of cannabis and a sedative. Blood tests showed chemicals linked to cannabis, and Michael admitted to using the drug as well as taking antidepressant Amitriptyline. The judge cited that mixing the two substances was dangerous and posed a risk to both Michael and the public. Michael was also banned from driving for five years, fined, and ordered to pay costs and a victim surcharge.

That day there was a tremendous sense of common determination to celebrate, triumphing over the elements.

The flame itself drew hundreds and thousands of people on its journey around the British Isles, and was carried by every kind of deserving individual, many nominated for their own extraordinary service.

Options: - smoke - hang out - volunteer - homework - go to a movie Explain why a human would choose \\"homework\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human might choose \\"homework\\" as the best thing teens can do right after school due to the following reasons: Step 1: Consider the importance of education A human would recognize that education plays a crucial role in personal development and future success. Completing homework helps a teen to reinforce the knowledge and skills they've learned during their classes. Step 2: Assess the value of time management skills By doing homework right after school, a teen is practicing effective time management skills. This helps them to prioritize tasks, balance activities, and prevent procrastination, which are valuable skills not only for school but also in their future professional lives. Step 3: Compare homework with other given options A human would likely deem that smoking, hanging out, or going to a movie might not be as beneficial or responsible as doing homework or volunteering after school. However, some might consider that volunteering is also a valuable option because it helps develop social skills and a sense of responsibility. Step 4: Identify the long-term benefits of completing homework Completing homework on time can lead to better grades, increased understanding of the material, and a more competitive academic profile. This may improve a teen's chances of getting into a good college or university and pursuing their desired career. Step 5: Weigh the balance of work and personal life While some recreational activities are essential for personal well-being and relaxation, a human could reason that completing homework right after school allows a teen to have more free time later in the evening, ensuring a healthy balance between work and personal life.

The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning that justifies this answer: Step 1: Analyze the premise. The premise provides a specific situation: \\"Two young ballerinas pose before a sign reading 'babys'.\\" In this situation, we have two young dancers posing near the mentioned sign. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis. The hypothesis states: \\"Two children are forced to dance by their insecure mothers who never accomplished anything.\\" This is a conjecture about the motivation behind the children dancing and makes assumptions about their mothers. Step 3: Compare the premise and the hypothesis. The premise only provides a description of the scene with the young ballerinas. However, the hypothesis introduces new information that is not present in the premise, such as the idea of the children being \\"forced\\" to dance and making assumptions about the character of their mothers. Step 4: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Since the hypothesis introduces new information and assumptions that are not present in the premise, it cannot be confirmed or denied based on the premise alone.

She was shocked, she says, that during the three-month free trial for new subscribers, Apple would not be paying musicians for the songs its users streamed. \\"We don't ask you for free iPhones,\\" she wrote. \\"So why should we give you free music?\\" Apple quickly caved. But by then, the spat had reignited an important debate: does streaming reward artists fairly? There are other concerns too. Does it affect the quality and variety of music that's made? And does it change the way we listen? In other words: is streaming good for music? Here, four experts give their views to the Inquiry programme. Lucy Rose is a 26-year-old British singer-songwriter. She started by recording songs in her parents' living room. \\"We put a video up and it was only from people sharing that YouTube video that actually anything happened with me. I was unsigned, playing small gigs, but that was a real big break for me.\\" After her videos and songs got millions of plays on streaming sites, a record company took her on, and began to promote her, even in countries where she didn't have a physical record out. \\"We got flown out to do some shows in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur and China, and that was only possible because these streaming services were exposing my music to people that probably wouldn't have heard it otherwise. \\"I feel like it's getting harder and harder to survive in the music industry and to get established in any way. Not as many people are buying records as they used to, which makes things a lot harder for us. Because if people don't buy my record... I will get dropped by my label.\\" \\"I was interested in the number of streams I got on Spotify and I think it was around five million plays of the entire album from start to finish, in America, which for me was really exciting. But at the same time I didn't see any money from that... so I don't think it's actually made a difference how the company sees me as an artist.\\" Spotify says that for five million individual plays, it pays 25,000. But they don't pay artists directly: instead they pay the artists' labels and publishers who own the music. Chris Carey works for Media Insight Consulting, a boutique consultancy focusing on data in the music industry. \\"The reality for music streaming is you are changing the business model. You're going from paying for all your consumption upfront to almost paying as you go, so you get much smaller payments but you get them much more often. So rather than getting paid once for your album you instead get remunerated every time someone listens. \\"There's a tightrope to be walked between valuing the artists appropriately for the work, but also then convincing consumers to pay. \\"There's an argument that says the free service and the premium service are too similar. I think the challenge is to make the premium service even better rather than simply making the free service worse. \\"The pricing would be different if we hadn't gone through the illegal downloading world but I think the fundamental challenge we've got is that music is undervalued as a result of that first step and what we're now doing is playing catch-up, that we're trying to compete with free. \\"If you look at the decline of the recorded music industry, we are a small fraction of where we were 10, 15 years ago. We're now arguing about how we get out of that hole. For people who are innovating in that space, I'd be very happy to defend them. \\"I think it's a giant opportunity if streaming can become a mass-market activity.\\" Carrie is a music fan and vinyl obsessive who got her first job in a record store aged 20. \\"I have streaming in my office and I can listen to music all day long and maybe not tell you the next day most of the artists I listen to. But if I'm purposely taking out a record that I own and putting it on, I'm choosing what that is and I'm connecting with it more. \\"I just really like the idea that I'm holding the physical artefact of what the musicians wanted you to have, what they created in their brain, you know. You can listen to it when you want and you can hold it. \\"I was obsessive, like a lot of people, about reading the liner notes and learning about, oh, what does this person do, oh, this person was on the other album too, this other band, they must know each other. \\"I think streaming has turned out to be, and will continue to be, an incredibly effective discovery tool. The fact that you can think of a song or read about an artist and you can go and listen to the music and have this giant listening station at your discretion is fantastic.\\" Lars Ulrich is the drummer with Metallica, the heavy metal band that's sold more than 100 million records. \\"I believe streaming is good for music. I mean the thing that I read a lot is that people sit there and go, 'I'm not getting paid very much for streaming.' But there's one major thing that gets overlooked in that argument and the whole thing is that streaming is a choice on all fronts. \\"It's a choice for the fan to be part of, it's a choice for the artists who are involved in making their music available on streaming services. It's a choice by the record companies that represent the artist. Fifteen years ago those choices didn't exist. \\"Streaming probably does benefit artists with higher profiles. And if you listen to the playlists a lot of these playlists that are being made available for people in the streaming service, they seem to feature higher profile artists and that just seems to be the way it's sort of playing out right now. \\"One of the main reasons I connect less with new music in my life now is because there's less great new music to connect with. A lot of the stuff that's been played is just regurgitated, this year's flavour, this thing, but it's not people on the leading edge like the Beatles or the Miles Davises or the Jimi Hendrixes taking us all by the hand into these completely unknown, uncharted musical territories. \\"When there's less people buying music, there's less money generated back and record companies take less chances and instead of promoting 500 records a year, they promote 50 records a year and they don't put the same amount of money into breaking new art. The saddest thing about all of this is that there's less and less money being put into younger artists and there is a danger of younger artists coming close to extinction. \\"Thirty, 40 years ago I would get on my bike, drive to the record store, spend time figuring out which record I could buy by listening to a bunch of them. By the time I got home I would end up spending every minute of my free time for the next week just acting with this particular record. \\"Nowadays music, to an extent, for some people it's become kind of background noise.\\" The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 12:05 GMT/13:05 BST.

(LSC), a quasi-governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor, would receive 329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001. Sent 2: If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy. Sent 3: Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take. Sent 4: (1996 Almanac, p. Sent 5: 5-36) Republicans cut the organization's budget deeply in 1996, but its funding has recovered slowly. Sent 6: Last month, in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003, the Senate added a onetime increase of 19 million, which, if approved in the final version, would bring the LSC budget to 348 million. Sent 7: The money would go to help states, such as Michigan and Ohio, that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households. Sent 8: If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president's desk, LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization's fiscal 2004 funding. Sent 9: The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 (PL 93-355). Sent 10: LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies, which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - 11,075 a year for an individual and 22,625 for a family of four. Sent 11: Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases, custody cases and other such matters, according to LSC. Sent 12: Since 1996, lawyers who receive money from Legal Services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying legislatures, filing class-action suits, participating in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, or defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When we think about the animal kingdom, it's often fascinating to consider the various classifications and groups that exist. One of the most interesting and engaging classifications is that of mammals, which make up a large portion of the animals we see in our daily lives, including humans. Now, when it comes to defining what makes an animal a mammal, there are several key characteristics that come into play. First and foremost, mammals are unique in that they give birth to live young, as opposed to laying eggs. Animals like reptiles, amphibians, and birds typically lay eggs, which must be incubated until the offspring hatch. However, mammals like humans, dogs, cats, and many others all carry their developing young internally and give birth to live offspring. This allows for a greater level of protection and care during the early stages of an organism's life. Another key characteristic of a mammal is the presence of hair or fur on its body. While different species of mammals have varying amounts and types of body hair, having some sort of hair is almost universally found in mammals. This hair serves to provide insulation from temperature extremes and helps regulate body heat, which is particularly important for mammals since they are known as warm-blooded animals, maintaining a constant body temperature. Lastly, one major attribute that sets mammals apart from other animal classes is their ability to produce milk for their offspring. Mammalian mothers have specialized mammary glands that secrete milk, a nutrient-rich liquid that provides essential nutrients for the growth and development of their young. This lactation process ensures that newborn mammals receive a high-quality source of nourishment, which is both required and unique to their particular species. Together, these characteristics – giving birth to live young, having hair or fur, and producing milk for their offspring – are at the core of what defines an animal as a mammal. Various species of mammals may display other unique traits, but all share these fundamental features, solidifying their place in the diverse and intricate world of the animal kingdom."},{"instruction":"You are presented with the question \\"Meiosis is the type of _ that produces ova and spermatozoa.\\" and the following answer choices: - permineralization - an organism's body - animals - Plant reproduction - Most plants - Chemical energy - rapid expansion - cell division Now knowing that meiosis is the type of cell division that produces gametes and examples of gametes are ova and spermatozoa, choose the best answer.

At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers. At his sentencing he pleads guilty to the same judge Nelson IV had, and asks for the same sentence (3-5) at the same prison. After negotiating with the judge and bribing a few guards, he ends up as Nelsons cellmate, and here he pretends to be his friend, all in an attempt to give him the wrong advice on surviving life in prison.Somehow, Nelson gets himself out of a numerous array of jams, even discovering that he's gay and meeting the love of his life, gang leader Barry (Chi McBride), a hulking, burly gay caballero with the heart of a dashing romantic hero beating within his massive, hairy...

PUBLISHED:. 17:44 EST, 13 December 2013. |. UPDATED:. 17:47 EST, 13 December 2013. A giggle, a chuckle or a full-blown guffaw, we’re told laughter is the best way to deal with the stress and strain life throws at you. But according to researchers, laughter might not be the best medicine – and could even lead to serious health complications. Scientists from Oxford University said a woman with racing heart syndrome collapsed and died after getting the giggles. According to researchers, laughter might not be the best medicine - and could even lead to serious health complications. And laughing 'fit to burst' has been found to cause possible heart rupture, a torn gullet and epileptic seizures. A quick intake of breath during laughing can provoke an asthma attack, while some people have suffered from incontinence and even hernias. Clowns were sent into a hospital as part of the research. The paper added: ‘It remains to be seen whether sick jokes make you ill and dry wit causes dehydration.’ During one test clowns were sent into hospitals to entertain patients. And the results showed a dose of 'genuine laughter' for a whole day could help shed the pounds by burning 2000 calories. And 36 per cent of would-be mums undergoing IVF treatment got pregnant after a visit from the red-nosed jokers compared to just 20 per cent in a control group. Tittering was also linked with lowering blood sugar in diabetic patients and reducing arterial wall stiffness, which helps relieve tension. The researchers say their findings challenge the view that laughter can only be beneficial but do add that humour in any form carries a \\"low risk of harm and may be beneficial\\". The paper was published in the Christmas edition of The British Medical Journal.","output":"So, there's this article that says laughter may not always be good for us, and sometimes it can cause health problems. You know, like when you laugh so hard, it's difficult to breathe? The people who study things at a big school called Oxford University found that laughing too hard might cause heart problems, or even make a person fall down when their heart races really fast. But, don't be sad! Laughter can also be helpful. When clowns came into a hospital to make people laugh, it actually helped some of them feel better. The researchers, who are like super smart grown-ups, said that humor, or things that make us laugh, usually don't hurt us and can be good for us most of the time. So, laughing can be both good and bad sometimes, but it's important to remember that having fun and being happy is still important!"},{"instruction":"Summarize this article in one sentence.

Question: Which would be easier to break through (A) a thin wall or (B) a thick wall. A:","output":"A thin wall (Option A) would be easier to break through compared to a thick wall (Option B). This is due to several reasons: 1. Material thickness: A thin wall has less material than a thick wall. This means there's less resistance against external forces. Therefore, it would require less effort to penetrate or break through a thin wall. 2. Structural strength: Generally, a thin wall has lower structural strength than a thick wall. A thicker wall can distribute stress and pressure more evenly across its surface, enabling it to withstand greater impact or force. 3. Insulation properties: Thicker walls usually insulate better than thin walls, protecting the interior from external elements such as temperature, sound, or impact. A thin wall is likely to transmit these energies more easily and may break under excessive external pressure. Overall, a thin wall is generally easier to break through as it offers less resistance and has lower structural strength compared to a thick wall."},{"instruction":"Review: drama , conflict , tears and surprise Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?

Step 1: Examine the words and their connotations - Drama: can have both positive and negative connotations, depending on how it is presented or received. - Conflict: tends to have a negative connotation, as it implies disagreement or discord. - Tears: can have a negative connotation, as they often represent sadness or pain, but can also indicate a strong emotional response, which can be positive. - Surprise: can have both positive and negative connotations but often is associated with an unexpected twist or turn in the movie. Step 2: Determine the overall tone Considering the mixture of potential positive and negative connotations in the sentence, it is difficult to definitively assign either a positive or negative label. However, because of the majority of the words having potentially negative connotations (conflict and tears), we can lean towards the movie review sentence being predominantly negative. The answer is: [-] negative"},{"instruction":"Which entity is this text about? Sir Richard Starkey (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, songwriter, singer, and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was twice afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. When Starr married Maureen Cox in 1965, Beatles manager Brian Epstein served as best man, with Starr's stepfather Harry Graves and fellow Beatle George Harrison as witnesses. Soon afterwards, the couple's matrimony became the subject of a US novelty song, \\"Treat Him Tender, Maureen\\", by the Chicklettes. Starr and Maureen had three children together: Zak (born 13 September 1965), Jason (born 19 August 1967) and Lee (born 11 November 1970). In 1971, Starr purchased Lennon's former home, Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire and moved his family there. Following Starr's repeated infidelities, the couple divorced in 1975. Maureen died from leukaemia at age 48 in 1994. In 1980, while on the set of the film Caveman, Starr met actress Barbara Bach; they were married on 27 April 1981. In 1985, he was the first of the Beatles to become a grandfather upon the birth of Zak's daughter, Tatia Jayne Starkey. Zak Starkey is also a drummer, and during his father's regular absences, he spent time with The Who's Keith Moon. Zak has performed with his father during some All-Starr Band tours. In total, Ringo Starr has eight grandchildren - one from Zak, four from Jason and three from Lee. In 2016, he was the first Beatle to become a great-grandfather. Starr and Bach split their time between homes in Cranleigh, Surrey; Los Angeles; and Monte Carlo. In the Sunday Times Rich List 2011, Starr was listed at number 56 in the UK with an estimated personal wealth of PS150 million. In 2012, Starr was estimated to be the wealthiest drummer in the world. In 2014 Starr announced that his 200-acre Surrey estate at Rydinghurst, with its Grade II-listed Jacobean house, was for sale. However, he retains a property in the London district of Chelsea off King's Road, and he and Bach continue to divide their time between London and Los Angeles. In December 2015, Starr and Bach auctioned some of their personal and professional items to the public via Julien's Auctions in Los Angeles. Highlights of the collection included Starr's first Ludwig Black Oyster Pearl drum kit; instruments given to him by Harrison, Lennon and Marc Bolan; and a first-pressing copy of the Beatles' White Album numbered \\"0000001\\". The auction raised over 9 million, a portion of which was set aside for the Lotus Foundation, a charity founded by Starr and Bach. In 2016, Starr expressed his support for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, explaining: \\"I thought the European Union was a great idea, but I didn't see it going anywhere lately.\\" In 2017 he described his impatience for Britain to \\"get on with\\" Brexit, declaring that \\"to be in control of your country is a good move.\\"","output":"The text is about Sir Richard Starkey, also known as Ringo Starr.

Article: It had been a long time since I had been to Jacksonville, Florida. I had driven to town hoping to see the old barber shop where my hair had been cut as a child. I parked my truck and decided to try and locate a telephone to see if the Florida Barber College had moved to a new location. After walking about a block I saw an open shoe store. I walked inside and asked if I could use their telephone book. Unable to find a listing for the Barber College, I picked out the number of a local beauty salon, hoping they might tell me if the barber college was still in business. The number was busy, so I decided to wait and try again in a few minutes. As the salesman and I stood talking the front door opened and a young man about twenty came into the store pushing himself in a wheelchair. \\"I need a new pair of shoes,\\" said the customer. As he turned the corner, there was a blanket across his lap. I was shocked to see that the young man had no legs. \\"A gift for a friend?\\" I asked the boy. \\"No,\\" he replied. They are for me,\\" he continued, with a smile on his face. I just smiled back and watched to see what would happen next. \\"What type of shoe would you like?\\" asked the clerk. \\"How about a pair of cowboy boots?\\" The man pointed to the back wall where three or four pairs of boots were displayed. The salesman, sharply turning, headed off to the backroom. \\"Isn't this fun?\\" the boy asked me. I moved my hand to let him know that I did not understand his question. \\"When I was a kid, my parents used to buy me a new pair of shoes every year. That was such a wonderful feeling.

In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it. Your job is to determine which sentence(s) from the passage can be used to search for further information needed to answer the question. Question: How long had Arista Records existed at the time of signing Uropa Lula? Passage:In 1980, Lloyd formed Uropa Lula with Hilde Swendgaard (manager) and Kevin Smith (drums), making two short films, \\"Here in the Sun\\" and \\"At Night Time\\" with Video Active. They were joined by Colin Prior (bass) and Peter Fromm (keyboards) in 1981 and began performing live in London, opening for John Cale, Alternative TV and Depeche Mode. American bass player Allan Dias replaced Prior in August of the same year. In September, the band recorded three songs, \\"Here's a Medal\\", \\"Timber Fall\\" I and \\"My Black Hour\\" for the Nicky Horne Capital Radio show. Leeds-born drummer Andrew Edge joined the group later that year. Uropa Lula signed to Arista Records in May 1982 and spent the rest of that year recording album tracks and their first two singles, \\"Our Love Has Just Begun\\" and \\"Fell Upon a Jewel\\" at Trident Studios, The Manor Studio, Townhouse Studios and RAK Studios. To tie in with the release of the first single, the band recorded a live session for the David Jensen show on Radio 1 for the BBC. The session was produced by Dale Griffin, the English drummer and founding member of 1970s rock band Mott the Hoople and featured two songs, \\"Here's a Medal\\" and \\"Timber Fall I\\". A month later, Uropa Lula returned to London's Capital Radio to record their second live session for the Nicky Horne show playing two songs, \\"I Am My Older Brother\\" and \\"Leather and Metal (Winter's Here)\\". In the fall of 1982, guitarist Chester Kamen and keyboard player Carol Isaacs joined the group in time for tours of the UK and US in 1983. The group's opening US show was at the Ritz in New York (1 February 1982). This was followed by dates at the Mudd Club (7 February 1982), the in Washington, D.C., the New Jersey City Gardens and a show at the Brooklyn Zoo (26 February 1982) where they shared the bill with Holly and the Italians. Upon their return to the UK, on 2 June 1982 the group played at the Camden Palace (now called Koko) and opened for Big Country at the Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool (19 June 1982) and John Cale at The Venue, Victoria, London (5 July 1982). With some irony, the band had by this point changed their name to Viva Lula and as part of the promotion of their third single, \\"Dad Sings the Blues\\"; they toured the UK with Big Country in June 1983. Lloyd disbanded the group in October 1983 and embarked on a solo career, albeit continuing to work with Uropa Lula members Kamen, Dias and Smith throughout the '80s.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"Strong, healthy lungs that function properly will have a direct impact on the process of oxygenation and ensuring plenty of oxygen in the blood. When the lungs are functioning well, they can efficiently extract oxygen from the air and transfer it into the bloodstream, as well as expel carbon dioxide. This has direct implications on various steps of the process. Let's break the process down and understand the impact of healthy lungs on each step: 1. Breathing in: Healthy lungs ensure smooth inhalation of air, which contains oxygen. Good lung capacity and functioning enable the lungs to take in more air, increasing the amount of oxygen available for transfer to the bloodstream. 2. Air passing through bronchi and bronchioles: When lungs are functioning well, the bronchi and bronchioles remain patent, allowing easy passage of air to the alveoli. Additionally, healthy lungs mean less likelihood of obstructions, such as mucus build-up or inflammation, which can impede the flow of air. 3. Filling up the alveoli: Healthy lungs have a good surface area and are highly elastic, allowing alveoli to expand as the air fills them. This enables maximum efficiency of gas exchange, increasing the amount of oxygen transferred to the capillaries. 4. Oxygen passing through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries: The walls of the alveoli are thin, with healthy lungs ensuring optimal membrane thickness and intact capillaries for quick and efficient diffusion of oxygen into the bloodstream. 5. Oxygen entering the bloodstream: With healthy lungs, there is a greater surface area for gas exchange, ensuring that the maximum amount of oxygen gets transferred to the blood. A higher concentration of oxygen in the blood translates to better oxygenation of tissues and organs throughout the body. 6. Carbon dioxide removal: Healthy lungs ensure efficient gas exchange, removing carbon dioxide, a waste product, from the blood and into the alveoli to be exhaled. 7. Breathing out: Lastly, strong and healthy lungs ensure efficient exhalation of carbon dioxide, purging it from the system. In conclusion, having strong, healthy lungs that function properly has a direct impact on the process of oxygenation, ensuring that plenty of oxygen reaches the bloodstream and vital organs. This increased oxygen capacity promotes overall health and well-being, and can improve physical performance and endurance."},{"instruction":"Veturinkuljettajien lupajärjestelmän alalla tavoitteenamme on luoda Euroopan laajuinen rautatiealue, ja siksi haluamme tietysti edistää rautatiehenkilöstön liikkuvuutta.

And I was wondering How would Others feel as a result? A:","output":"As an AI assistant, let me think about the possible feelings others might have if they know Kai has hired an assistant to help them with their daily chores. Step 1: Identify the key stakeholders. In this situation, the stakeholders include Kai, their family, friends, neighbours, and co-workers. Step 2: Consider the possible feelings of stakeholders. Family members might feel happy and relieved, knowing that the daily chores will be taken care of and that Kai will have more time to spend with them and focus on other important tasks. They might also be appreciative of the support provided by the assistant. Friends could feel curious about how the assistant works, and might even feel a little envious if they see the positive impact it has on Kai's life. They might ask Kai for recommendations or even consider hiring an assistant themselves. Neighbours might be indifferent if the assistant's work doesn't directly impact their lives. If, however, the assistant helps maintain the exterior appearance of Kai's home, they might appreciate the improved curb appeal in their neighbourhood. Co-workers might have mixed feelings. If the assistant mainly handles personal tasks and chores, they might not have any opinion at all. If the assistant is also helping with work-related tasks, co-workers might feel envious, curious or even threatened, depending on the nature of the tasks and how it impacts the workplace dynamic. Step 3: Evaluate the overall outcome. In general, the majority of stakeholders are likely to have positive reactions to Kai's hiring of an assistant, as they observe its benefits on Kai's life and well-being. However, it's important to note that feelings of envy and insecurity may arise, particularly in cases where the assistant's role transitions from personal tasks to work-related tasks."},{"instruction":"Translate to Finnish: Because the aim of this Fund is to demonstrate in practical terms the solidarity of Europe's citizens towards disaster victims, many Members of Parliament and I myself would like the intervention thresholds to be more generous and to take into account regional characteristics.

A: Possible answers: -water. -carbon. -sulfur. -oxygen. Answer:","output":"The last two stages of aerobic respiration require oxygen. Aerobic respiration is a process in which cells produce energy through the oxidation of organic compounds, such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, in the presence of oxygen. This energy-generating process consists of four sequential stages: glycolysis, the preparatory phase, the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. Among these, the final two stages - the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain - specifically require oxygen for their proper functioning. 1. Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle): This is the third stage of aerobic respiration that occurs within the mitochondrial matrix in eukaryotic cells and in the cytoplasm in prokaryotic cells. The primary purpose of the citric acid cycle is to generate high-energy electron carriers, such as NADH (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FADH2 (Flavin adenine dinucleotide), and a small amount of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate). While oxygen is not directly involved in any reaction of the citric acid cycle, it plays a critical role in the continuous regeneration of the oxidized forms of the electron carriers (NAD+ and FAD), which are necessary to maintain the cycle's ongoing processes. In the absence of oxygen, these electron carriers cannot be regenerated, and the citric acid cycle ceases to function effectively. 2. Electron Transport Chain and Oxidative Phosphorylation: This is the final stage of aerobic respiration, which takes place within the inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes and the plasma membrane in prokaryotes. The electron transport chain is a series of complex protein structures responsible for transferring electrons from the high-energy electron carriers, NADH and FADH2, generated in the previous stages, to molecular oxygen. The energy released during this electron transfer process is utilized to pump protons (H+) across the membrane, establishing a proton gradient. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor in this process, and its role is essential for the completion of the electron transport chain. In the oxidative phosphorylation step, the ATP synthase enzyme uses the potential energy from the proton gradient to catalyze the synthesis of ATP from ADP (Adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate. Molecular oxygen is reduced to water during this process. In summary, the last two stages of aerobic respiration, the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain, require oxygen for the regeneration of electron carriers and as the essential final electron acceptor, respectively. Oxygen's critical role in these processes highlights the reason why it is called \\"aerobic respiration.\\""},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Often, owls consume their prey right at the location of capture, swallowing smaller prey animals whole. They have a unique digestive system that allows them to digest flesh and break down bones, feathers and fur. The digestion process begins with a gland called the proventriculus, which secretes enzymes that break down food. This is then passed to the gizzard which filters out indigestible parts like bones, feathers, or fur, which are then formed into a tightly packed pellet that the owl later regurgitates. For larger prey, however, which cannot be swallowed whole, owls would use their strong beak to tear apart their caught prey into manageable portions. This is an especially common practice among larger species of owls that often target bigger prey, like hares or other birds. Alternatively, owls, being the diligent and watchful predators, may choose to take their catch back to their roost to ensure they are safe from other predators while they consume their meal. This is especially common during their breeding and nesting periods, where the need for food is higher due to the presence of owlets. The caught prey can also be shared with the partner or fed to the offspring. Keeping this in mind, it's clear that, while the owl's hunting process may seem finished at the moment of the prey's capture, it continues on to the eventual consumption, digestion, and even shared distribution among family members, which may be considered the final step or outcome of the entire process."},{"instruction":"Given a scientific question, generate an incorrect answer to the given question.

Question 2: How many people live in Greenland? Options are: [1]. no. [2]. yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"The answer to both questions would not be the same as they are asking for different types of information. Let me provide detailed answers to each question separately. Question 1: How do people in Greenland live? Greenland, the world's largest island, is located between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. It is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. The majority of its population are Inuit, who have adapted to the harsh Arctic climate. They practice a mix of traditional and modern ways of life. 1. Settlements and housing: Most people in Greenland live along the western coast, where the climate is milder than the rest of the island. The largest town is Nuuk, the capital, with a population of around 18,000. People live in single-family houses, apartments, or traditional sod-roofed houses known as \\"Inuit igloos.\\" 2. Economy and employment: Greenland's economy is mainly based on fishing, hunting, and tourism. Its primary export is fish, mainly Greenland halibut, shrimp, and crabs. A smaller part of the economy is based on the mining of minerals such as iron ore, gold, and rare earth elements. The public sector is also a significant employer, focusing on healthcare, education, and administration. 3. Food: Due to the extreme climate, traditional Greenlandic cuisine relies heavily on hunted marine mammals and fish, such as seal, walrus, narwhal, and various fish species. Imported goods, like vegetables and fruits, are often costlier. Today, many Greenlanders prefer a mix of traditional and Western foods, with supermarkets selling local and international products. 4. Culture and traditions: The people of Greenland have strong connections to their Inuit culture. They celebrate events like the National Day on June 21st, showcasing traditional songs, dances, and customs. The official language is Greenlandic, but Danish is widely spoken, and many Greenlanders learn English and other languages in school. 5. Transportation: Due to Greenland's remote location and harsh climate, transportation options are limited. There are no roads or railways between towns or settlements, so people travel by air (planes and helicopters), sea (boats and ferries), or overland (snowmobiles and dog sleds) depending on the time of year. Question 2: How many people live in Greenland? Greenland is sparsely populated. As of 2021, the population of Greenland is estimated to be around 56,000 people. The majority of them live along the western coast, in settlements ranging from small villages to the larger towns like Nuuk, Sisimiut, and Ilulissat. Although Greenland is vast, the population density is one of the lowest globally, with an average of 0.14 people per square kilometer.

On the left side, we can simplify by combining the constants -196 and +49. -196 + 49 = -147 So the simplified equation is: -124*t - 147 = -103*t Step 2: Isolate the variable t by getting all terms containing t on one side of the equation. To do this, we can add 103*t to both sides of the equation to move the -103*t term to the left side. -124*t - 147 + 103*t = -103*t + 103*t This simplifies to: -21*t - 147 = 0 Step 3: Now, isolate the t term further by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation. To do this, we can add 147 to both sides of the equation to move the -147 term to the right side. -21*t - 147 + 147 = 0 + 147 This simplifies to: -21*t = 147 Step 4: Solve for t by dividing both sides of the equation by -21. -21*t / -21 = 147 / -21 t = -7 So the solution to the equation is t = -7."},{"instruction":"Tea Scholarships currently stocked with Batik fabric Add punctuation.","output":"As a language model AI, I am given a task to add punctuation to the text given: \\"Tea Scholarships currently stocked with Batik fabric.\\" However, the text provided seems to be a properly punctuated sentence already.

The White House has said it has given Cuba lists of dissidents in the past. Mr Castro does not view the prisoners as dissidents, US officials said. That disagreement is central to the conflict between US and Cuban officials. More needs to be done to lift the US embargo on trade with Cuba, Mr Castro said, adding that the Guantanamo Bay detention camp must close. Mr Obama, the first serving US president to visit Cuba since 1959, said the trade embargo would be fully lifted. \\"Cuba's destiny will not be decided by the United States or any other nation... The future of Cuba will be decided by Cubans not by anybody else,\\" Mr Obama said. Mr Obama and first lady Michelle Obama were later welcomed at a state dinner, along with some members of US Congress and senior White House staff. The Failde Youth Band entertained the guests, who dined on shrimp mousse, cream soup flavoured with rum, and traditional pork with rice and plantain chips. Waiters passed round Cuban cigars after dinner. Earlier on Monday, Mr Castro defended Cuba's record on human rights and pointed to problems in the US. \\"We defend human rights, in our view civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights are indivisible, inter-dependent and universal,\\" Mr Castro said. Mr Castro is not usually subject to any aggressive questioning from reporters and called the prisoners question \\"not polite\\", later ending the news conference by saying \\"I think this is enough\\". \\"Actually we find it inconceivable that a government does not defend and ensure the right to healthcare, education, social security, food provision and development,\\" he said. Speaking to ABC News after the conference with Mr Castro, Mr Obama did not directly say he would be giving Mr Castro a list of political prisoners. \\"We have given them a lists in the past and they have responded intermittently to our engagement,\\" he said. \\"And this I think is an example of why it was my belief that this would be a more successful mechanism for us to advance the values that we care about than an embargo and silence and no communications.\\" President Obama and his aides hoped that the Cuban President, Raul Castro, would approach the news conference with an open mind. The White House officials also hoped that Mr Castro would be receptive to new ideas and to new ways of doing things. Specifically, the US officials hoped that he'd take questions from reporters. Surprisingly enough, he did, marking a departure from his past. The two men joked around during the question-and-answer period, and they worked out some of their differences. When one of Mr Castro's aides interrupted his boss during the conference, for example, Mr Obama looked annoyed. But he and Mr Castro moved on, talking about the future of Cuba. In a similar way, Mr Obama and his aides hope they can overcome other issues, including difficult ones such as human rights, as they forge a new relationship between the two countries. Mr Obama could not say exactly when the trade embargo would be lifted, but recognised it was necessary. \\"The reason is what we did for 50 years did not serve our interests or the interests of the Cuban people,\\" he said. His administration has done what it can on lifting trade restrictions, he said, but further action will require Congress which is \\"not as productive in an election year\\". He also said further easing of the trade embargo will depend on actions Cuba takes on human rights. Six sticking points to better relations - Guantanamo Bay, human rights and media freedoms are among the unresolved issues Cuba's DIY economy - A new generation of Cuban entrepreneurs are launching private businesses Internet access still restricted in Cuba - Only about 5% of Cubans have web access at home Mr Obama said it is not just Cuba that the US has \\"deep disagreements\\" about human rights with - it also has disagreements with China and Vietnam. \\"I believe if I engage frankly, clearly, stating our beliefs but I can't force change on any country - it ultimately has to come from within - that is a more useful strategy,\\" he said. \\"I have faith in people\\". Reporters described the press conference as \\"tense\\" and \\"remarkable\\". Karla Olivares, an independent journalist from Cuba, told the BBC that Mr Castro \\"talked more than usual\\" and the claim that Cuba does not have any political prisoners was \\"complicated\\". Before the speech, it was announced that Google was opening an online technology centre for free Internet access at much higher speeds than what is available on the island now. Google hopes the centre will be part of a larger effort to improve Internet access in Cuba.

The speed of sound (also known as Mach 1) is approximately 767 miles per hour (1,236 kilometers per hour) in dry air at sea level. Motorcycles, as of current technology, are not capable of achieving such speeds. The fastest production motorcycles can reach speeds of around 186 miles per hour (299 kilometers per hour), which is far below the speed of sound. Sentence B mentions a pilot exceeding the speed of sound with his plane. This scenario is possible and quite common in the context of military and some specialized aircraft, which are designed to reach supersonic speeds.

It is a truly loving, poignant and hilarious nod to the era, and every actor hits his/her notes with perfection. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I am glad his somewhat similar turn in 'Love Actually' brought him more attention.

A star burns in space - This refers to a star performing nuclear fusion in its core, turning hydrogen into helium and releasing energy in the process. 2. Eventually, it burns all its hydrogen - The star runs out of hydrogen fuel in its core. 3. Becomes a red giant - The star starts burning helium in its core, and the outer layers expand as the core contracts. This causes the star to become cooler and redder, forming a red giant. 4. Once the red giant burns itself out - The star runs out of helium fuel in its core. 5. The core of the star collapses - With no more fuel, the core collapses under its own gravity. 6. The gasses will start to disperse - The outer layers of the star are expelled into space, often forming a planetary nebula. 7. Only the core is left - The remaining core still has mass, but no active fusion is occurring. Now, considering these steps, the last step of the process would depend on the initial mass of the star: - For lower mass stars (like our Sun), the core becomes a white dwarf, which is a dense and hot remnant that slowly cools over time, eventually becoming a black dwarf when it no longer emits significant energy. - For higher mass stars, the core may undergo further compression, leading to a supernova explosion. This can result in the formation of a neutron star (a dense core made up mostly of neutrons) or, in some cases, a black hole if the mass is sufficient to form a gravitational singularity."},{"instruction":"Select the topic that this about: The new young guy for the Knicks, this season #39;s new young guy, fast and hungry and talented, is Jamal Crawford. He knows all about bad teams, because he has played his whole NBA career with the Bulls.","output":"Jamal Crawford: A Promising Addition to the New York Knicks Basketball fans have often witnessed an unexpected turn of events during a game. In the NBA, where talent and skill reign supreme, one player can make all the difference for a franchise. This season, all eyes are on the New York Knicks' newest addition, Jamal Crawford. As the latest young guy in town, wearing the number 39 jersey, Crawford's fast-paced playing style, hunger for victory, and remarkable talent promise a fresh start for the Knicks on their quest for dominance in the league. Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, Jamal Crawford has always been immersed in the world of basketball. Showing immense potential from an early age, Crawford led his high school team, Rainier Beach High School, to a state championship in 1998. This incredible feat earned him the prestigious title of being recognized as Washington state's 'Player of the Year.' After high school, Crawford attended the University of Michigan, where he continued to showcase his outstanding basketball skills by averaging 16.6 points per game. Following his freshman year, Crawford declared for the NBA draft, where he was chosen as the eighth overall pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers but was later traded to the Chicago Bulls on draft night. Throughout his NBA career, Jamal Crawford faced tough times as the Chicago Bulls struggled to find their footing in the post-Michael Jordan era. However, he did not let this deter him from making an impact on the court. Over a four-year tenure with the Bulls, Crawford's gameplay showed significant growth as he improved in various aspects such as shooting percentages, assists, and scoring average each year. Despite the team's overall struggles, Crawford’s talent on the court could not be denied even in a bad team situation. In 2004, Jamal Crawford made his way to the New York Knicks, seeking a new environment to showcase his skills. As one of the key players joining the Knicks, Crawford is set to make a substantial impact on the team’s overall performance. At the height of 6'5\\" and weighing approximately 200 pounds, Crawford possesses a unique combination of size, quickness, and shooting ability that will help to revitalize the Knicks' offensive strategy. Additionally, his capacity to create scoring opportunities for not only himself but teammates as well will be an invaluable asset to the team. Jamal Crawford's exciting capabilities easily complement the Knicks' existing roster, and his style mirrors the fast-paced, attacking gameplay that is characteristic of the team. His humble beginnings and persistent dedication to his craft also make him an excellent role model for younger players, displaying the value of hard work and determination in achieving success. In conclusion, Jamal Crawford's addition to the New York Knicks promises a significant shift in the team's performance this season. With his undeniable talent, unwavering determination, and affinity for thriving under pressure, Crawford brings new hope for New York Knicks fans and their pursuit of championship glory. As the #39 jersey becomes synonymous with speed, finesse, and outstanding athleticism, Jamal Crawford's journey with the Knicks may just signal the beginning of a new era for the franchise."},{"instruction":"What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Excellent resource\\"","output":"Based on the positive sentiment in the review \\"Excellent resource,\\" I would assign a ★★★★★ rating."},{"instruction":"The Landa Residence (built in between 1911-1913) is a designated Municipal Heritage Property located in the Riversdale neighborhood of Saskatoon Saskatchewan Canada.

He composed using scales of unequal intervals in just intonation, and was one of the first 20th-century composers in the West to work systematically with microtonal scales. He built custom-made instruments in these tunings on which to play his compositions, and described his theory and practice in his book Genesis of a Music (1947). Partch composed with scales dividing the octave into 43 unequal tones derived from the natural harmonic series; these scales allowed for more tones of smaller intervals than in standard Western tuning, which uses twelve equal intervals to the octave. Supported by Guggenheim and university grants, Partch took up residence at the University of Wisconsin from 1944 until 1947. This was a productive period, in which he lectured, trained an ensemble, staged performances, released his first recordings, and completed his book, now called Genesis of a Music. Genesis was completed in 1947 and published in 1949 by the University of Wisconsin Press. He left the university, as it never accepted him as a member of the permanent staff, and there was little space for his growing stock of instruments. In 1949, pianist Gunnar Johansen allowed Partch to convert a smithy on his ranch to a studio. Partch worked there with support from the Guggenheim Foundation, and did recordings, primarily of his Eleven Intrusions (1949-1950). He was assisted for six months by composer Ben Johnston, who performed on Partch's recordings. In spring 1951, Partch moved to Oakland for health reasons, and prepared for a production of King Oedipus at Mills College, with the support of designer Arch Lauterer. Performances of King Oedipus in March were extensively reviewed, but a planned recording was blocked by the Yeats estate, which refused to grant permission to use Yeats's translation. In February 1953, Partch founded the studio Gate 5 in an abandoned shipyard in Sausalito, California, where he composed, built instruments and staged performances. Subscriptions to raise money for recordings were organized by the Harry Partch Trust Fund, an organization put together by friends and supporters. The recordings were sold via mail order, as were later releases on the Gate 5 Records label. The money raised from these recordings became his main source of income. Partch's three Plectra and Percussion Dances, Ring Around the Moon (1949-1950), Castor and Pollux, and Even Wild Horses, premiered on Berkeley's KPFA radio in November 1953. After completing The Bewitched in January 1955, Partch tried to find the means to put on a production of it. Ben Johnston introduced Danlee Mitchell to Partch at the University of Illinois; Mitchell later became Partch's heir. In March 1957, with the help of Johnston and the Fromm Foundation, The Bewitched was performed at the University of Illinois, and later at Washington University in St. Louis, though Partch was displeased with choreographer Alwin Nikolais's interpretation. Later in 1957, Partch provided the music for Madeline Tourtelot's film Windsong, the first of six film collaborations between the two. From 1959 to 1962, Partch received further appointments from the University of Illinois, and staged productions of Revelation in the Courthouse Park in 1961 and Water! Water! in 1962. Though these two works were based, as King Oedipus had been, on Greek mythology, they modernized the settings and incorporated elements of popular music. Partch had support from several departments and organizations at the university, but continuing hostility from the music department convinced him to leave and return to California. Ask a question about this article.","output":"Harry Partch was an American composer who made unique and special music. He created different musical instruments and used a different way of tuning them, with more notes than usual. This made his music sound very different from other music. He wrote a book called \\"Genesis of a Music\\" to explain his ideas. Partch worked at the University of Wisconsin for a while, teaching and performing his music. Later, he moved to different places to continue his work, like California. He made money by selling recordings of his music. He did many performances and worked with other artists, like dancers and filmmakers. Some of his music was inspired by stories from Greek mythology, which are very old tales. Although Partch faced some challenges and people who didn't like his musical ideas, he continued to create his unique music until he passed away in 1974."},{"instruction":"What is a shorter version of this: albanian president sali berisha said his country welcomed the comprehensive peace agreement reached by bosnia 's three warring factions in dayton , the united states , earlier today .","output":"The Albanian president said his country is happy about the peace agreement made by Bosnia's fighting groups in Dayton, USA today."},{"instruction":"What was the question for this implicit rationale, and corresponding answer?

Question: what ancient cultures had marketplaces? Would \\"Most Roman towns and cities had a forum , temples and the same type of buildings, on a smaller scale, as found in Rome.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"Yes, the given statement \\"Most Roman towns and cities had a forum, temples, and the same type of buildings, on a smaller scale, as found in Rome\\" is a reasonable answer in reference to the existence of marketplaces in ancient cities. The forum, in particular, was a key component of marketplaces in ancient Roman culture. However, it is important to note that marketplaces in ancient societies were not limited to Roman culture. Several ancient cultures around the world developed marketplaces to facilitate trade and commerce. Here is a more comprehensive answer: Ancient marketplaces were central locations where goods were exchanged between producers, consumers, and traders. A diverse array of ancient cultures had marketplaces, such as: 1. Mesopotamians: One of the earliest known civilizations, the Mesopotamians, developed marketplaces to facilitate trade and commerce. The ancient Sumerian city of Ur, for instance, functioned as a significant trade hub, with people exchanging goods, services, and even cultural ideas. 2. Ancient Egyptians: The ancient Egyptians also had marketplaces where traders brought their products, such as pottery, textiles, and food items, for exchange or sale. Marketplaces were essential in Egyptian cities like Thebes and Memphis. Transactions were often made through bartering or using the Egyptian currency, deben. 3. Ancient Greeks: The Greeks had a marketplace called agora. The agora was typically a central spot located within city-states, surrounded by institutional buildings. Both local craftsmen and traders across the Mediterranean would gather in the agora to sell their goods, while people also met there to discuss politics, philosophy, and other aspects of daily life. 4. Romans: As mentioned in the initial statement, Roman towns and cities had the forum, which served as a centralized marketplace. The forum was not only a place for trade but also a venue for socializing, discussing politics, and attending public events. Traders and individuals would gather at this location to buy, sell, or barter a variety of goods like food, clothes, and utility items. 5. Mesoamerican civilizations: The ancient Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Maya, Zapotec, and Aztec also had marketplaces. One notable example is the ancient market in the city of Tlatelolco, which was a significant trading center within the Aztec Empire. This marketplace attracted traders from across the empire and beyond, where goods such as cloth, food, ceramics, and even people were traded. 6. Ancient China: The ancient Chinese had marketplaces known as \\"shi.\\" The marketplaces were essential for both rural and urban areas in supporting the economy. Goods like textiles, porcelain, and metalware, and various agricultural products were traded at these bustling marketplaces. The Silk Road, connecting China to the Mediterranean, was a major trade route that further facilitated cultural exchange and commerce. In conclusion, ancient cultures such as Mesopotamians, Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Mesoamerican civilizations, and Chinese all had marketplaces that served as centers of trade, commerce, and community interaction. These marketplaces were essential in sustaining the economy, distributing goods and services, and fostering cultural exchange in those societies."},{"instruction":"What is a question about this article?

(2) Pack the shirts in dozens, please., does the word dozen mean the same thing?","output":"Yes, in both sentences, the word \\"dozen\\" refers to the same concept, which is a group or unit consisting of 12 items. However, the context of the word \\"dozen\\" is different in each sentence, as it is being applied to different objects, and the usage of the word varies slightly based on the specific context. In the first sentence, \\"I ordered two dozen doughnuts,\\" the word \\"dozen\\" is used as a quantifier to indicate the quantity of doughnuts being ordered. In this context, it is a numerical expression that specifies the number of doughnuts. The speaker is saying that they ordered 24 doughnuts (2 groups of 12). In the second sentence, \\"Pack the shirts in dozens, please,\\" the word \\"dozen\\" is used as a unit of measurement for packing the shirts. Here, the context implies that the shirts should be grouped into sets of 12 while packing. The focus is on the organization and arrangement of the items rather than specifying the total number of items.

Follow the steps below: Step 1: Combine the terms with g: The equation is 26895 = 162g + 392g - 805. Add the coefficients of g (162 and 392) together: 162 + 392 = 554 So, the equation becomes: 26895 = 554g - 805 Step 2: Isolate g by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation: Add 805 to both sides of the equation to move the -805 to the left side. 26895 + 805 = 554g - 805 + 805 26700 = 554g Step 3: Divide both sides by the coefficient of g (554) to completely isolate g: 26700 ÷ 554 = 554g ÷ 554 g ≈ 48.1928 (rounded to four decimal places) So, the solution for g is approximately 48.1928."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

A gypsy woman in the group attempts to flee with her deformed baby, but Frollo chases and kills her outside Notre Dame. He tries to kill the baby as well, but the cathedral's archdeacon intervenes and accuses Frollo of murdering an innocent woman. To atone for his sin, Frollo reluctantly agrees to raise the deformed child in Notre Dame as his son, naming him Quasimodo. Twenty years later, Quasimodo develops into a kind yet isolated young man who has lived inside the cathedral his entire life. A trio of living stone gargoylesâVictor, Hugo, and Laverneâserve as Quasimodo's only company, and encourage him to attend the annually-held Festival of Fools. Despite Frollo's warnings that he would be shunned for his deformity, Quasimodo attends the festival and is celebrated for his awkward appearance, only to be humiliated by the crowd after Frollo's men start a riot. Frollo refuses to help Quasimodo, but Esmeralda, a kind gypsy, intervenes by freeing the hunchback, and uses a magic trick to evade arrest. Frollo confronts Quasimodo and sends him back inside the cathedral. Esmeralda follows Quasimodo inside, only to be followed herself by Captain Phoebus of Frollo's guard.

The shape of the wings causes air to flow more quickly — and air pressure to be lower — above the wings than below them. This allows the wings to lift the plane or bird above the ground against the pull of gravity. A spoiler on a race car, like the one in Figure below , works in the opposite way. Its shape causes air to flow more slowly — and air pressure to be greater — above the spoiler than below it. As a result, air pressure pushes the car downward, giving its wheels better traction on the track. Paragraph: Rob is experimenting with how air pressure works. To that end, he has designed two tests. In the first test the air flow works as it would in an airplane wing. He labels it as case A. In the second test the air flow works as it would in a race car spoiler. He labels it as case B. He is surprised to see that air flow behaves differently in different situations. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would case A have higher or lower air pressure above it than case B? The answer is:","output":"Case A would have lower air pressure above it than Case B. In the given paragraph, it is described that Rob is conducting two tests to understand how air pressure works. In Case A, the airflow resembles that of an airplane wing, and in Case B, the airflow is similar to a race car spoiler. According to Bernoulli's law, the shape of airplane wings causes air to flow more quickly above the wings, which in turn results in lower air pressure above the wings. This difference in air pressure generates lift, enabling the airplane to overcome gravity and achieve flight. On the other hand, a race car spoiler works in the opposite manner. Its shape causes air to flow more slowly above it, leading to greater air pressure above the spoiler compared to below it. Consequently, air pressure pushes the car downward, enhancing the traction of its wheels on the track. Based on this information, Case A (airflow like an airplane wing) would have lower air pressure above it, whereas Case B (airflow like a race car spoiler) would have higher air pressure above it."},{"instruction":"Alpine lake had low water levels this spring although the lake is usually at full level by late spring.

Britain's economy received a much-needed fillip yesterday after exports to countries beyond Europe surged to an all-time high. Official figures showed UK firms sold a record £13.2billion worth of goods to non-European Union markets in July - up 11 per cent on the previous month. Sales to the EU were also up 7.7 per cent to £12.4billion but the proportion of exports going to the 17-nation eurozone fell to 43.6 per cent - the lowest since records began in 1988. Exports to countries beyond Europe have surged to an all-time high, shrinking the UK's trade deficit with the rest of the world. The shift to growing markets in Asia and Latin America, hailed by economists as a revolution in British trade, will cheer ministers and businesses who have toured emerging economies to forge new trade links as the single currency bloc lurches from crisis to crisis. Office for National Statistics figures showed it helped shrink Britain’s trade deficit with the rest of the world - the shortfall between exports and imports - from £4.3billion in June to £1.5billion in July. It was the largest narrowing of the trade deficit on record and fuelled hopes that Britain may finally be pulling out of recession. ‘Tellingly, non-EU exports have now been greater than exports to the EU for three consecutive months,’ said Colin Edwards, an economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. ‘This is perhaps unsurprising given the economic malaise gripping much of the EU, driven by the sovereign debt crisis gripping the eurozone. ‘While the figures may demonstrate the weakness of the European export market more than the strength of UK exporters in non-EU markets, the change in export share may represent an important shift in the focus of UK exporters, as emerging economies become a more attractive proposition than struggling European economies.’ Number crunching: Balance of UK trade over past year (Source: ONS) The British economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the second quarter of the year and has now been in decline for nine months - marking the longest double-dip recession for more than 50 years. But hopes are rising that the economy will finally clock up growth again in the current third quarter as business bounces back from the disruption caused by the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘These figures are encouraging news on the UK economy and show that we are starting to earn our way in the world. The Government is working hard to deliver sustainable, export-led growth.’ The latest export figures followed the biggest surge in industrial production for 25 years. ‘It is looking ever more likely that growth in the third quarter will more than outweigh the 0.5 per cent contraction suffered in the second quarter,’ said Howard Archer, chief UK economist at research group IHS Global Insight. But with the crisis raging in the eurozone, and the global economy showing signs of slowing from the United States to China, the outlook is still uncertain. Mark Gregory, chief economist at accountant Ernst & Young, said: ‘The short-term outlook for exports remains fragile, with the eurozone on the brink of slipping back into recession and signs of a slowdown in the US and some of the main emerging markets like China and India. ‘But we are more optimistic about prospects further out, providing that the eurozone remains intact and drags itself out of recession.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"In July 2012, UK firms sold a record £13.2 billion worth of goods to non-European Union markets, an 11% increase from the previous month.

Given the circumstances, Uber Technologies appears to have done the right thing, at least for its investors. After losing 1 billion a year before the deal in a self-destructive price war with its Chinese rival, Didi Chuxing, the U.S. ride-hailing company finally decided to sell itself to the competition. What makes this transaction worth noting is not the business acumen of Uber’s senior management, but the perfect record Beijing has kept so far in preventing leading American technology firms from dominating China’s information sector. The saddest thing about this abysmal record is not that American firms did not try hard enough. On the contrary, they have done just about everything they were told to do by their advisers to befriend the Chinese government. For example, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally led a high-profile campaign to charm senior Chinese officials in an attempt to persuade them to unblock access to Facebook fb . In December 2014, Zuckerberg even hosted Lu Wei, China’s then Internet censor-in-chief, in his office, where a copy of a collection of speeches by Xi Jinping, the Chinese Communist Party chief, was prominently displayed. Unfortunately, no matter how hard Zuckerberg tried (he even jogged across Tiananmen Square last year amid heavy pollution), the Chinese government would not relent. What talented senior executives in leading American tech firms such as Zuckerberg have failed to grasp is that the Chinese government has made it a national policy not to allow any foreign tech firm dominate China’s information industry in an effort to build up Chinese companies. For the ruling Communist Party, its foremost concern is regime security. Ceding the control over the flow of information to American tech firms would seriously endanger its survival. Economically, the Chinese government’s mercantilist mindset would not allow American tech firms to dominate – and reap lucrative profits from – China’s fast-growing information sector. Finally, relying on American information technology also undermines Chinese national security because, as shown by the documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the former U.S. National Security Agency contractor, Washington has a backdoor into the systems operated by American tech firms. Obviously, governments in many other countries share the same concerns as Beijing (especially those over economic benefits and national security). But unlike China, no other country has the advantages of market size, the political will of the government, and the dynamism of private sector tech entrepreneurs to thwart the titans of Silicon Valley. Consequently, only China has succeeded where all other countries have failed: it is the only country where local Internet giants, such as Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei, and Baidu, can rival their American counterparts in scale, market capitalization and, in some instances, even profitability. While most Chinese industrial policies are abject failures (such as those on semi-conductors, software, automobile, and civil aviation), Beijing has achieved remarkable success in frustrating American tech firms and grooming domestic national champions. Because the information sector is so new and there were no entrenched state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to protect or support, the Chinese government had to rely on private tech start-ups run by dynamic entrepreneurs such as Jack Ma (founder of Alibaba) and Pony Ma (CEO of Tencent). Unlike moribund SOEs, these firms were quick to imitate, improve, and adapt technologies initially invented in the Silicon Valley to the Chinese market. More importantly, Beijing has also erected a wall of regulations to deny deep-pocketed American tech firms access to the Chinese market. To be sure, this two-pronged strategy has its costs, such as inferior technology and substandard service (for example, Google is a far superior search engine than Baidu, the dominant Chinese search engine). However, such costs are mainly borne by Chinese customers while the benefits flow to the Chinese government (greater regime security) and domestic firms (monopoly profits). As long as Beijing maintains this policy, even the most competitive American tech firms have only one of three options. The first option, which Google has adopted, is to stick to its principles, exit China, and focus on its core markets. So far it has been a winning strategy, at least for Google googl . The second option, which Facebook and Twitter have embraced, is to persevere despite repeated setbacks. Given Beijing’s determination to ensure the Communist Party’s regime security, this strategy seems pure wishful thinking. The third option, pioneered by Yahoo and now adopted by Uber, is to join local rivals if you cannot beat them. Yahoo turned its 1 billion investment in Alibaba into a stake now worth at least 30 billion. Uber could also see its 7 billion stake in Didi Chuxing grow in value if the combined ride-hailing behemoth dominates the Chinese market, as seems likely. For most American tech firms, the Google approach may be the best – it avoids unnecessary distractions and possible reputational losses. The strategy pursued by Yahoo and Uber may seem attractive, but such firms are minority investors and have no control. Its success is decided by luck, above anything else. But compared with Facebook, Uber seems to have learned its Chinese lesson – cut your losses before it is too late. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. Uber's decision to sell itself to its Chinese rival, Didi Chuxing, marking Beijing's continued success in preventing leading American technology firms from dominating China's information sector. 2. The Chinese government's national policy to prevent foreign tech firms from dominating China's information industry in an effort to build up local companies, protect regime security, and control the flow of information. 3.

He was wondering how the vehicles would fare in coming hot weather. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which vehicle would do worse in hot weather and hot engine, car or truck? A:","output":"Based on the given information, it is difficult to definitively say which vehicle would do worse in hot weather and with a hot engine - the car or the truck. The antifreeze that Rob added to the car radiator could potentially help regulate the temperature in the car's engine and prevent it from overheating. On the other hand, without additional information on the truck's cooling system, we cannot conclude that it would fare worse than the car. Antifreeze is a coolant that not only helps to prevent the engine from freezing in cold temperatures but also aids in heat transfer, preventing the engine from overheating in hot weather. Consequently, having antifreeze in the radiator would generally improve a vehicle's performance in hot weather conditions. However, there are additional factors that come into play when considering a vehicle's sensitivity to hot weather, such as the efficiency of the cooling system, and other mechanical conditions. The lack of antifreeze in the truck's radiator does potentially increase the risk of overheating in hot weather, but determining which vehicle would fare worse requires more information on the condition, make, and model of both the car and the truck's engines and cooling systems."},{"instruction":"Read the bio below and try to give details on young mutley 's: - weight - draws - losses - home - ko - style - nickname - realname - total - birth date - name - nationality - birth place - wins Bio: lee woodley -lrb- born 17 may 1976 in west bromwich -rrb- , better known by his boxing alias young mutley , is a british boxer . he is a former british welterweight champion . his professional record is 30 wins from 37 fights , 14 by knockout . he made his professional debut on 3 september 1999 . and also was trained in tipton at william perrys amateur boxing club . woodley was involved with gangs in his younger years , which led to him serving a prison sentence for assault . after being released from prison , woodley took up boxing . his breakthrough came on 28 january 2006 when he beat michael jennings the reigning british welterweight champion in a split decision at nottingham arena to claim his first british championship . woodley obtained his nickname from his father , who was said to laugh like muttley from the cartoon series wacky races . he uses his nickname as his name when boxing and has also won the midland area and english light-welterweight titles in his career . he lost his british title in an up-and-down classic with commonwealth champion kevin anderson at the aston villa events centre on 1 june 2006 . he had anderson down with a left hook in the first before tiring and stopped in the tenth . he has rebounded with two wins , one in the first round , and challenged british light-welterweight champion colin lynes in july 2007 , losing by ko in the 8th round . the vacant european boxing union 10 stone title was also on the line . he is trained and managed by errol johnson . away from boxing , woodley is a keen supporter of west bromwich albion f.c.

Let's explore these differences in detail. 1. Sunday as the start of the week: In many countries, particularly in the Americas, Sunday is considered the first day of the week. This practice has its roots in religious beliefs, as Sunday is often observed as the \\"Sabbath\\" or \\"Lord's Day\\" in Christianity, marking the day Jesus Christ resurrected after the crucifixion. The United States, Canada, Brazil, and Japan are some examples of countries where Sunday is commonly considered the beginning of the week. The most widely used calendar system, the Gregorian calendar, also designates Sunday as the first day of the week. This is evident in various calendar systems and software applications, as well as when examining international standards such as the ISO week date system. However, this standard does not dictate which day should be officially recognized as the first day of the week. 2. Monday as the start of the week: Many countries and cultures, especially in Europe and Asia, adopt Monday as the first day of the week. This can be attributed to multiple factors, such as the influence of the workweek, secularization, and cultural evolution. In many European languages, Monday is named after the Moon, which is often perceived to indicate the beginning of a new cycle. Countries like the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Russia, China, and India are some examples where Monday is recognized as the start of the week. International Organization for Standardization's ISO 8601 standard specifies Monday as the first day of the week. This is a widely recognized standard that promotes consistency in international trade, communication, and data processing. It is used by specialized organizations, institutions, and industries working across different countries, cultures, or languages to ensure a consistent understanding of dates and weeks. In conclusion, whether a week starts on Sunday or Monday depends on the regional, cultural, or individual preferences. Some countries and regions consider Sunday as the first day, while others adopt Monday as the start of the week. It is essential to understand and respect the diversity of these practices when interacting with people from different parts of the world or when interpreting international calendar standards."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: This article: Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent.

There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound.

Christopher grew up hunting while Kenneth lived in the city, so when they got lost in the woods OPT: I. Christopher helped them to survive. II. Kenneth helped them to survive.","output":"Christopher and Kenneth were an unlikely pair, brought together by chance and united by friendship. Christopher, who was raised in the countryside, was an expert hunter, well-versed in tracking animals and identifying edible plants. He had spent many a day trekking through dense forests, sharp grasslands, and sprawling valleys. On the other hand, Kenneth had lived his whole life in a bustling metropolis, surrounded by towering skyscrapers and the constant hum of traffic. His urban upbringing had given him a different set of skills - such as keen adaptability and resourcefulness - but he was largely a novice when it came to the wilderness. When they found themselves lost in the woods, they knew that the survival skills they each possessed would make all the difference. So, with their fates intertwined, a remarkable story unfolded. I. Christopher helped them to survive. As the more experienced outdoorsman, Christopher quickly took charge, guiding Kenneth on how to prioritize their needs in this unfamiliar and challenging environment. He began by instructing Kenneth on the basic principles of survival and the importance of maintaining a positive attitude. First and foremost, Christopher taught Kenneth how to identify which plants were safe to eat and which ones to avoid. He explained that consuming the wrong vegetation could lead to digestive issues or even poisoning, so it was crucial to have a sharp eye for detail. Meanwhile, Christopher shared his knowledge of hunting small game, showing Kenneth how to craft simple snares and traps using materials found in the forest. As the days went on, Christopher demonstrated to Kenneth how to build a basic, yet sturdy, shelter using fallen branches and leaves. He taught Kenneth how to start a fire using the friction method, as well as how to maintain the fire throughout the night. This gave them much-needed warmth and a means to cook the food they caught together. Above all, Christopher emphasized the value of conserving energy and using resources responsibly. He knew that their journey back to civilization would be a long and arduous one, so every action they took had to be well-considered. With Christopher's steady guidance, the two friends gradually became more confident and self-reliant in the face of adversity. II. Kenneth helped them to survive. Despite his city upbringing, Kenneth's adaptability and resourcefulness proved invaluable in the woods. He may not have had the same wilderness experience as Christopher, but he possessed a quick mind and a talent for creative problem-solving. Kenneth's ingenuity shone through when he suggested that they create a makeshift map to chart their progress through the woods. Using leaves as paper and charcoal from their fire as ink, he sketched out the terrain they had covered, making note of landmarks and water sources. This not only helped them keep track of where they had been, but also provided a record of their route, should they need to retrace their steps. Moreover, Kenneth's observational skills proved useful in identifying potentially hazardous terrain. He was quick to pick up on subtle changes in the ground or the presence of loose rocks, allowing the pair to mitigate any risks and navigate the forest more safely. In addition to these practical skills, Kenneth's unwavering optimism and determination proved to be the glue that kept the two friends moving forward. Despite the physical and emotional challenges they faced, Kenneth's lighthearted demeanor and constant encouragement ensured that their spirits remained high. Together, Christopher and Kenneth balanced each other's strengths and weaknesses, making them an unstoppable team. Through shared knowledge, resilience and camaraderie, the two friends were eventually able to find their way out of the woods and back to civilization. Their unique adventure would become a testament to the power of friendship and the boundless potential of human ingenuity."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a sentence or phrase in English.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Timon and Pumbaa watch the original film in a theater, Timon decides to fast-forward to his scenes. Pumbaa's protest over this eventually prompts Timon to share his backstory (going way back, to before the beginning of the first movie). Timon is a social outcast in his meerkat colony on the outskirts of the Pride Lands due to frequently messing things up by accident. Though he is unconditionally supported by his mother Ma, Timon dreams for more in life than his colony's bleak existence hiding from predators. One day, he is assigned as a sentry, but his daydreaming nearly leads to the near-death of his Uncle Max by hyenas Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. This becomes the last straw for the colony, prompting Timon to leave to find a better life. He meets Rafiki, who teaches him about \\"Hakuna Matata\\" and advises him to \\"look beyond what you see\\". Timon takes the advice literally and observes Pride Rock in the distance. Believing Pride Rock to be his paradise home, Timon ventures there and encounters Pumbaa on his way. The two quickly form a bond and Pumbaa accompanies Timon. The pair arrive at Pride Rock during the presentation of Simba to the Pride Lands' animals. As they make their way through the crowd of onlookers, Pumbaa explosively passes gas, causing nearby animals to faint but prompting animals further away to bow to Simba. Following this, Timon and Pumbaa make multiple attempts to set up homes throughout the Pride Lands, but wind up being forced away every time after witnessing several events from the original film, such as Simba singing \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\", Mufasa's fight with the Hyenas, and Scar's conspiring with the hyenas. Eventually, the pair are caught in the wildebeest stampede that killed Mufasa in the original film, and are thrown off a waterfall.

Answer:","output":"Rafiki advises Timon to \\"look beyond what you see\\"."},{"instruction":"Given the below context: In his personaggi listed in the 1609 score, Monteverdi unaccountably omits La messaggera (the Messenger), and indicates that the final chorus of shepherds who perform the moresca (Moorish dance) at the opera's end are a separate group (che fecero la moresca nel fine). Little information is available about who sang the various roles in the first performance. A letter published at Mantua in 1612 records that the distinguished tenor and composer Francesco Rasi took part, and it is generally assumed that he sang the title role. Rasi could sing in both the tenor and bass ranges \\"with exquisite style ... and extraordinary feeling\\". The involvement in the premiere of a Florentine castrato, Giovanni Gualberto Magli, is confirmed by correspondence between the Gonzaga princes. Magli sang the prologue, Proserpina and possibly one other role, either La messaggera or Speranza. The musicologist and historian Hans Redlich mistakenly allocates Magli to the role of Orfeo.A clue about who played Euridice is contained in a 1608 letter to Duke Vincenzo. It refers to \\"that little priest who performed the role of Euridice in the Most Serene Prince's Orfeo\\". This priest was possibly Padre Girolamo Bacchini, a castrato known to have had connections to the Mantuan court in the early 17th century. The Monteverdi scholar Tim Carter speculates that two prominent Mantuan tenors, Pandolfo Grande and Francesco Campagnola may have sung minor roles in the premiere.There are solo parts for four shepherds and three spirits. Carter calculates that through the doubling of roles that the text allows, a total of ten singers—three sopranos, two altos, three tenors and two basses—is required for a performance, with the soloists (except Orfeo) also forming the chorus. Carter's suggested role-doublings include La musica with Euridice, Ninfa with Proserpina and La messaggera with Speranza.

Jung Bong-ju, 51, one of the four hosts of the popular South Korean podcast “I’m a Weasel,” or \\"Naneun Ggomsuda,” was found guilty of spreading false rumors. The one-time legislator will also lose his eligibility for reelection for 10 years. Many here call the judge’s decision a political death sentence. Jung, a member of the opposition Democratic Unity Party, reportedly accused then-presidential candidate Lee Myung-bak in 2007 of being affiliated with BBK, a company that forged stock prices. “I’m a Weasel,” a free weekly audio podcast, which can be downloaded from Apple's iTunes store and Korea’s “Daily Tackle” website, ranks as the world's most popular political podcast, with 2 million weekly downloads and 6 million hits in average. The unscripted program features host Kim Ou-joon, a radio personality, and a supporting cast — former legislator Jung, an investigative reporter and a radio producer — in a format that is equal parts talk show, rant session and comedy skits. In November, the podcast was awarded the Democratic Media Award, a top honor in the South Korean media. Many are raising questions about the timing of the trial and Jung’s arrest. Postponed for three years after he was indicted, the verdict is seen as a push to stop the popular podcast. “I’ve been involved in both politics and law, so I knew that the Supreme Court is a very political place,” Choi Jae-cheon, a lawyer and former legislator who belongs to the same party as Jung, said in an interview with a news blogger after the verdict. “To be honest, internally we didn’t have much hope.” The Democratic Unity Party held a press conference at the National Assembly Thursday. “Finding Jung guilty is a political verdict and a political revenge where the judicial justice has been torn down,” a statement read. Jung Bong-ju, relatively unknown before the podcast rose to fame, played a character with endless self-bragging comments. He was given the nickname of \\"funnel,” because everything he says boils down to self-praise. But his barbs of South Korean politics, and often President Lee, were often seen as straight on.

His book on current issues, \\"Run, Jung Bong-joo,\\" came out a month ago and is still ranked among the top-selling books. On Thursday morning, in front of the South Korean Supreme Court where the trial was held, hundreds of citizens gathered to rally for Jung. After the verdict that found Jung guilty was made, the former legislator came out to make a short speech. “I had my hopes up, but now it looks like the rest of three hosts will have to carry on with the podcast,” Jung said. “I believe the three hosts will keep on doing the job of informing you on what you all must know.” Many broke into sobs as Jung added, “Maybe today or tomorrow I will be going to jail.” After he finished the speech, Jung took a deep bow on the ground, with his forehead resting on the gray asphalt. Through various social media platforms, the South Korean netizens voiced their anger over the verdict. “Where is justice in this country?” one blogger ranted. “I can’t believe that the government thinks its citizens are blind. If they can’t read that, they’ve done something that would ignite the built-up public discontent on them, they are in a big trouble.” The main host, Kim Ou-joon, said “the podcast will continue until President Lee’s term of office ends.” But now, with Jung’s arrest, the podcast faces uncertainty. \\"There are a lot of people inquiring about what's to happen to the podcast,\\" Kim told a South Korean newspaper. \\"But we will announce our position only through the podcast.\\" Right after the verdict, the team reportedly recorded the last episode that will feature Jung Bong-ju -- at least for now.

The game was the eleventh consecutive primetime game between the two and the sixth in Green Bay, with the Bears winning two of the last three. Entering week seven, the Bears led the all-time series 93-91-6. In the teams' last meetings since the turn of the decade, the Bears had lost all but three games, including the most recent game in 2015, a 17-13 victory in Green Bay. The Bears were struggling to score in 2016, averaging a league-worst 16.8 points per game. As such, Jeff Joniak wrote the Bears needed to score touchdowns, especially considering their struggles in the red zone (on 19 trips to the region, the Bears scored only nine times). Outside of the red zone, the Bears scored only 10 points; in comparison, the NFL average was 37. Chicago's rushing attack faced a Green Bay defense that allowed only eight runs of at least ten yards and 3.4 yards on first down, the third-lowest in the league. On defense, the Bears faced Aaron Rodgers; while the Packers offense was only 26th in yardage and at -3 in turnover ratio, the unit led the league in third down completion percentage. Rodgers also excelled in the first quarter of games, where he had thrown four touchdown passes, good for second in the league, and a 106 passer rating. However, the Packers struggled on drives starting within their own 20-yard line, failing to score on 14 such drives, the only team unable to do so. Joniak also wrote the team needed a \\"spark\\"; defeating the Packers at Lambeau for the second straight season would \\"do wonders for a young team trying to find its way.\\" After the Bears punted on the opening drive, the Packers took the lead first with Mason Crosby's 32-yard field goal. The Bears were forced to punt again on their next series and the Packers reached as far as the Bears' one-yard line before they were stopped on fourth down. On Chicago's resulting drive, Brian Hoyer was hit by Clay Matthews and Julius Peppers while throwing a pass, breaking his left arm. With Jay Cutler also inactive, third-string quarterback Matt Barkley took over for the next possession. With Barkley, the Bears were able to score points via Connor Barth's 39-yard field goal, which the Packers responded with Crosby's 40-yard kick. On Green Bay's first drive of the second half, Leonard Floyd strip-sacked Rodgers, recovering the fumble in the endzone to give the Bears the 10-6 lead. The score marked the Bears' first defensive touchdown since 2014. Rodgers overcame the play by throwing a five-yard touchdown pass to Davante Adams, followed by two more touchdown passes to Adams and Randall Cobb of four and two yards, respectively (though Crosby missed an extra point). Down 26-10, the Bears' next two series ended with interceptions, Barkley being intercepted by Blake Martinez and Nick Perry. The 1-6 start marked the first start with such a record since 2000.

They find a dead policeman nearby, as well as an abandoned infant. They take the infant to San Lorenzo and give it to friends of the child's now missing parents; they are welcomed by the village's priest, Father Delgado. In addition to the disappearances of locals and the destruction of their homes, there have been wholesale slaughters of livestock and strange roaring noises in the night. The villagers believe the culprit to be a demon bull and have been pestering Delgado for divine assistance.

Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: To calculate the sum of all even numbers between 20 and 120, we first should identify the starting point, which is 20, as it is an even number and the first one within the given range. Next, we need to determine the ending point, which is 120, as it is also an even number and the last one in the given range. Now that we have the boundaries defined, we need to figure out the total number of even numbers between 20 and 120. Since even numbers occur every 2 digits, we can calculate the number of even numbers by dividing the total range by 2. So, we subtract 20 from 120, resulting in 100, and then divide this by 2, which gives us 50. Therefore, we have a total of 50 even numbers between 20 and 120 inclusive. To compute the sum of these 50 even numbers, we will use the arithmetic series formula, which states that the sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula: Sum = (Number of terms * (First term + Last term)) / 2 In our case, the number of terms is 50, the first term is 20, and the last term is 120. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: Sum = (50 * (20 + 120)) / 2 Sum = (50 * 140) / 2 Sum = 7000 / 2 Sum = 3500 However, we must also consider that we are adding up only the even numbers, which means that we must divide this final sum by 2 one more time: Sum (even numbers only) = 3500 / 2 Sum (even numbers only) = 1750 So, the sum of all the even numbers between 20 and 120 inclusive is 1750. However, we made a mistake calculating the number of even numbers. Since both 20 and 120 are included in the range, we actually had 51 even numbers. So, the final answer should be recalculated: Sum = (51 * (20 + 120)) / 2 Sum = (51 * 140) / 2 Sum = 7140 / 2 Sum = 3570 The correct sum of all even numbers between 20 and 120 inclusive is 3570."},{"instruction":"Very disappointing.

Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils. The marriage was not a success. In the words of the..., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The person that George Grove helped is Camille Saint-Saëns. Saint-Saëns escaped to temporary exile in England during the Paris Commune, where he received help from George Grove and others to support himself by giving recitals."},{"instruction":"How does the sentence end? Our rights extend to voting but prohibited legislating, as the Options are: (1). voting right was removed from the constitution.; (2). legislating right was removed from the constitution.;","output":"To determine which option is the most suitable and logical conclusion for the given sentence, let's analyze each option: Option 1: \\"voting right was removed from the constitution.\\" The sentence says, \\"Our rights extend to voting but prohibited legislating,\\" which indicates that voting rights are still present. Therefore, stating that the voting right was removed from the constitution contradicts the first part of the sentence. This option is not suitable.

This option states that the legislating right was removed from the constitution, which is consistent with the information provided in the sentence.

A:","output":"A: The last step of the process is the production of glucose through the Calvin Cycle, which ultimately completes the process of photosynthesis in plants. After the water molecules are split into hydrogen and oxygen, and the oxygen is released as a byproduct, the remaining hydrogen ions and electrons are used in the light-dependent reactions to generate energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). These energy-rich molecules are then utilized in the light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin Cycle. The Calvin Cycle, which occurs in the chloroplasts, is a series of enzyme-mediated reactions that convert carbon dioxide into glucose, the plant's primary source of energy and structural component. In this cycle, carbon dioxide from the environment enters the leaf's stomata and combines with a five-carbon sugar called ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) to form a six-carbon compound. This compound quickly breaks down into two molecules of 3-PGA, a three-carbon molecule (3-phosphoglycerate). The 3-PGA molecules undergo a series of chemical transformations powered by ATP and NADPH that were generated during the light-dependent reactions. These transformations eventually lead to the production of G3P (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate), a precursor to glucose. Two G3P molecules combine to form one glucose molecule, which can be further synthesized into other organic compounds such as cellulose, starch, lipids, or proteins essential for the plant's growth and maintenance. In summary, the last step of the process in photosynthesis is the Calvin Cycle, where the energy obtained from the light-dependent reactions, in the form of ATP and NADPH, is used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose and other essential organic compounds. This process not only provides energy for the plant's growth and maintenance but also plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle and the ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Available choices: + Yes + No Given those answer options, answer the question: Kendall found their purpose in life after attending the workshop.

Television moved out of my life in 1981, so I never followed the series or any part of it - which means that I'm immune to the nostalgic charm that Moonlighting appears to have for most reviewers. (Possible spoiler warning) The pilot of Moonlighting is your basic \\"caveman meets fluffball\\" yarn, where a \\"charming\\" red-blooded he-man manipulates a misguided woman into realizing what she really wants and needs. The premises that the script's \\"wit\\" is based on must have already felt stale around 1950.

We don’t talk much about the experience of waiting for reviews, and it’s not something that appears to have been researched. Yet it’s something everyone doing academic work has to go through and it may be bad for our mental health. I’m finding it particularly difficult at the moment because a lot rides on these reviews. The sole-authored book, which is on a contentious topic, has already had one set of reviews. Reviewer 1 was utterly damning, saying “I couldn’t find anything to praise”. Luckily, Reviewers 2 and 3 were more measured, offering both praise and constructive criticism, and their input helped me to revise and strengthen the typescript. However, in the process, my editor and I realised that we needed further reviews from people with a particular kind of specialist knowledge. My editor approached around ten potential reviewers, but only one agreed to do the job. So I’m gibbering – what if that person agrees with Reviewer 1? The co-authored book is in a contentious format. My co-authors and I decided that I would be the person to liaise with publishers, as I have form in this process. The last time I liaised with academic publishers for a co-authored book was in the early 2000s, and I’d forgotten how heavily responsible it makes me feel. Fortunately, I’ve found a publisher that is interested and has sent the book out for reviews, to two professional academics and two students. This is great – and terrifying – but at least there are four reviewers. Even so, what if they all think it’s rubbish? In many ways I love the peer review system. I welcome feedback on my writing, and I’m not at all averse to constructive criticism. I am by no means arrogant enough to think I can write a good book without input from others. Yet peer review, as a process, is fraught with uncertainty. Comments may not be constructive, or may not come at all. They may be positive, or negative, or in between, or a mixture.

The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.\\"?

Article: A Nobel Prize is considered by most people one of the highest international honours a person can receive. As you know, the prizes were started by a Swede called Alfred Nobel. He was born in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. Alfred Nobel was a great scientist. He made two important inventions, and so he became very rich. Although he was rich, Nobel was not a happy man. He never married or had children. Also, he was a sick man during his large part of life. When he died at the age of 63, he left a fund of 9,000,000. The money was to be used in giving prizes to those who made great achievements in physics, chemistry , medicine and literature , and for world peace. The first Nobel Prizes were given on December 10, 1901, five years after Nobel's death. Since then many famous people from all over the world have been given Nobel Prizes for their achievements. Each prize has three parts. The first part is a gold medal. Second, a winner of a Nobel Prize is given a certificate saying that he has been given the prize. The third part of the prize is a large amount of money-about 40,000. Often a prize is given to just one person, but not always. Sometimes a prize is shared. It may be given to two or more people who have worked together. It is also sometimes true that a prize is not given at all if there is no great achievement. In 1972, for example, no Nobel Peace Prize was given. Question: What kind of person would you say Alfred Nobel was? Options: A: He was a rich, happy and lucky man.

It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources. The \\"continental shelf\\" is the natural prolongation of the land territory to the continental margin's outer edge, or 200 nautical miles from the coastal state's baseline, whichever is greater.

He was a wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles (1987-89), the Minnesota Vikings (1990-2001) and the Miami Dolphins (2002). After starting for the Ohio State University Buckeyes, Carter was drafted by the Eagles in the fourth round of the 1987 NFL supplemental draft. While in Philadelphia, head coach Buddy Ryan helped to coin one of ESPN's Chris Berman's famous quotes about Carter: \\"All he does is catch touchdowns.\\" Context: Carter was heavily recruited out of high school for both basketball and football. He accepted the offer from Ohio State head coach Earle Bruce. Carter became a consensus All-America selection after his junior season, Ohio State's first All American at wide receiver. Carter had intended to play both football and basketball at Ohio State, but decided to focus on football after making an immediate impact his freshman year. That year, he set a Rose Bowl record with nine receptions for 172 yards. Carter was known for great hands, running precise routes, and for acrobatic leaps. He had remarkable body control and footwork when making catches near the sidelines. At the Citrus Bowl at the end of the 1985 season, Carter caught a ball that quarterback Jim Karsatos was intending to throw away. Karsatos has claimed that catch by Carter was the greatest in the history of college football: \\"When I finally saw it on film, he was tiptoeing the sidelines and he jumped up and caught the ball left-handed by the point of the football at least a yard out of bounds. Then he somehow levitated back in bounds to get both his feet in bounds. I swear to this day he actually levitated to get back in bounds. When I saw it on film, it just blew me away.\\" Prior to Carter's senior season, he secretly signed with notorious sports agent Norby Walters. When the contract was discovered, Carter was ruled ineligible. The absence of Carter in the 1987 offense contributed to a disappointing 6-4-1 season and the firing of Coach Bruce. Missing this season also cost him a chance at evening his personal record against Michigan; Carter finished 1-2, his lone taste of victory in the series being his freshman year. Despite losing his senior year, Carter left Ohio State holding the school record for receptions (168). In 2000, he was selected as a member of the Ohio State Football All-Century Team. In 2003, he was inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame. Question: Where did Carter attend college?. Whats the answer?","output":"Carter attended college at Ohio State University.

A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th-most extensive and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. At nearly , Alabama has one of the nation's longest navigable inland waterways. - The Straits of Florida, Florida Straits, or Florida Strait is a strait located south-southeast of the North American mainland, generally accepted to be between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, and between the Florida Keys (U.S.) and Cuba. It is 150 km (93 mi) wide at the narrowest point between Key West and the Cuban shore, and has been sounded to a depth of 6,000 feet. The strait carries the Florida Current, the beginning of the Gulf Stream, from the Gulf of Mexico. - South Florida is a region of the U.S. state of Florida, comprising the southernmost part of the state. It is one of Florida's three most common \\"directional\\" regions, the others being Central Florida and North Florida.

South Florida is the only part of the continental United States with a tropical climate. - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet.

It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world. - The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \\"Third Coast\\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \\"south coast\\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \\"north coast.\\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin. - A skyscraper is a tall, continuously habitable building having multiple floors.

Ronstadt Co., and Ruth Mary (Copeman) Ronstadt (1914-1982), a homemaker. Ronstadt was raised on the family's 10-acre (4 ha) ranch with her siblings Peter (who served as Tucson's Chief of Police for 10 years, 1981-1991), Michael J., and Gretchen (Suzy). The family was featured in Family Circle magazine in 1953. Linda's father came from a pioneering Arizona ranching family and was of German, English, and Mexican ancestry. Ronstadt's early family life was filled with music and tradition, which influenced the stylistic and musical choices she later made in her career. Growing up, she listened to many types of music, including Mexican music, which was sung by her entire family and was a staple in her childhood. Ronstadt has remarked that everything she has recorded on her own records - rock 'n' roll, jazz, rhythm and blues, gospel, opera, country, choral, and mariachi - is all music she heard her family sing in their living room, or heard played on the radio, by the age of 10. She credits her mother for her appreciation of Gilbert and Sullivan and her father for introducing her to the traditional pop and Great American Songbook repertoire that she would, in turn, help reintroduce to an entire generation. Early on, her singing style had been influenced by singers such as Lola Beltran and Edith Piaf; she has called their singing and rhythms \\"more like Greek music ... It's sort of like 6/8 time signature ... very hard driving and very intense.\\" She also drew influence from country singer Hank Williams. She has said that \\"all girl singers\\" eventually \\"have to curtsy to Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday\\". Of Maria Callas, Ronstadt says, \\"There's no one in her league. That's it. Period. I learn more ... about singing rock n roll from listening to Maria Callas records than I ever would from listening to pop music for a month of Sundays. ... She's the greatest chick singer ever.\\" She admires Callas for her musicianship and her attempts to push 20th-century singing, particularly opera, back into the bel canto \\"natural style of singing\\".

A Chesapeake natural-gas rig near Kennendale, Texas. The deal means a lighter debt load for the company. Under the deal, Barclays will receive 390 billion cubic feet of proved reserves, and can then sell the gas produced in the east Texas fields in the market. The reserves are projected to produce 280 million cubic feet a day in 2011. Chesapeake's arrangement with Barclays is the gas company's eighth such agreement since the end of 2007, and involves the lowest price paid per thousand cubic feet as natural gas prices have slid near one-year lows, according to analysts with Ticonderoga Securities LLC. The eight deals amount to about 1 trillion cubic feet of gas sold for a total of about 4.7 billion. Chesapeake is attempting to reduce its debt in order to secure an investment-grade credit rating, while continuing to expand after a debt-fueled growth spurt was halted by the credit crunch and slumping natural-gas prices. The deal fits with Chesapeake's strategy of continuing to finance growth while gas prices remain depressed, said Daniel Pratt, an analyst with Ticonderoga. Chesapeake \\"is outspending their cash flow this year, and they're still actively exploring.

Barclays is paying about 2.95 per thousand cubic feet, about 20% below the current futures market price, but above the average price paid this year to acquire similar assets, analysts at Ticonderoga wrote. The bank stands to earn an even greater return should gas demand recover or if drillers reduce their activity, causing supplies to tighten and prices to rise. Gas prices have been been pressured this year as strong production from shale-gas formations like the Barnett and tepid demand led to high inventories. Natural gas for November delivery ended down 1.8% at 3.727 Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest price for this time of year since 2002. However, Barclays analysts forecast that gas in 2011 will average 4.10 a million British thermal units. Spokesmen for Barclays and Chesapeake declined to comment.

Barclays will get 390 billion cubic feet of proved reserves and can sell the gas produced in the east Texas fields. The reserves are expected to produce 280 million cubic feet of gas per day in 2011. 3. This deal is part of Chesapeake's plan to reduce debt and improve its credit rating while still growing as a company. It's the eighth similar agreement Chesapeake has made since 2007, totaling 1 trillion cubic feet of gas sold for about 4.7 billion. 4.

As recently as Tuesday, police said they had no evidence that foul play was involved in her disappearance. But now they say she has not made contact with friends or family, and hasn't turned on her cell phone, used an ATM or updated her social media sites since she disappeared. The FBI did a profile on the girl and found no reason she would run away, Guglielmi said. She is a good student with no emotional disturbances in her life, he said. \\"The fact set of this case is different than anything else we've seen,\\" he said. More than 100 Baltimore police, Maryland State Police troopers and FBI agents have been working around the clock to find out what happened to Barnes, Guglielmi said. Police have questioned a dozen people believed to have had contact with her in the hours before she disappeared, and have searched the homes and cars of some of those people, he said. They also have collected 40 hours of video from surveillance cameras at nearby businesses and apartment buildings, but neither those videos nor searches conducted in two locations have helped give investigators any leads, Guglielmi said. On Thursday, they turned to posting billboards along I-95 in hope of gathering information about the girl's fate. \\"What's going to break this thing wide open is that somebody, whether it's (in) Kansas or Canada, is going to say, wait a minute, I just saw her in a diner,\\" Guglielmi said Friday. \\"That's in the best case.\\" Although Guglielmi said there was no evidence of illegal drug use at the apartment, the girl's mother, Janice Sallis, said she has been told the girl may have been allowed to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana at her half-sister's apartment, according to CNN and CNN affiliate WSOC. Sallis said she had been told up to 20 men had come and gone while her daughter was there. \\"I pray to God that my daughter is fine and she'll be found safe,\\" Barnes' father, Russell Barnes, told CNN affiliate WBAL. \\"I hope people keep praying as high as they can and understand that this shouldn't happen to any child anywhere in this country.\\" Anyone with information on Barnes' disappearance can call 855-223-0033.

U Tirot Sing was a prominent leader who fiercely resisted the British attempts to establish their rule and influence in the Khasi Hills. U Tirot Sing Syiem came to power in 1820, succeeding his father Raps’ong Sing Syiem. He was known for his strategic thinking, military skills, and strong administrative capabilities. Under his rule, the Nongkhlaw Kingdom prospered, becoming one of the most powerful states in the Khasi Hills. The British, with their East India Company, had already established themselves in parts of India, including the neighboring Brahmaputra Valley, by the early 19th century. The British wished to extend their control over the Khasi Hills to secure trade routes, establish administrative dominance, and access valuable natural resources. Their efforts at conquering the region did not go unchallenged. When the British started constructing a road through the Khasi Hills to connect the Brahmaputra Valley with the plains of Sylhet (present-day Bangladesh), U Tirot Sing, sensing a threat to the local sovereignty and way of life, decided to mobilize the Khasi people against the foreign invaders. In 1829, the Khasi Revolt began with a series of guerrilla attacks led by U Tirot Sing against the British troops and their infrastructure projects. Using the region's hilly terrain and dense forests to their advantage, U Tirot Sing and his Khasi warriors inflicted severe blows to the British army. The Khasi resistance made use of traditional weapons such as bows, swords, and guns, and devised ingenious tactics to outmaneuver the better-equipped British forces. Their hit-and-run ambushes and the use of secret hideouts frustrated the British efforts to capture and defeat the Khasi rebels. However, the British retaliated with a larger force and systematically destroyed the Khasi strongholds. After a series of setbacks, U Tirot Sing was eventually captured in January 1833 near the present-day Bangladesh border. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and deported to Dhaka, where he died on 17 July 1835. Despite the ultimate defeat, U Tirot Sing's leadership during the Khasi Revolt symbolizes the spirit of resistance and unity against foreign oppression. He is revered as a national hero in Meghalaya and is remembered for his courage, valor, and commitment to protecting his people and their way of life from foreign domination. The Khasi Revolt serves as an important chapter in India's struggle for freedom, and U Tirot Sing's legacy continues to inspire generations."},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"To generate a context and a hypothesis, I will first think of a topic of interest, select a specific aspect of the topic, and then formulate a hypothesis based on existing knowledge and research.

Bayer Jr., said the lender had new board members and senior managers “strongly rededicated to accountability, efficiency and transparency at all levels of the organization.” Keith New, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania authority, said the company had adopted new policies on compensation and spending. But Chuck Ardo, a spokesman for Pennsylvania’s governor, Edward G. Rendell, said he was reserving judgment. “Unless they show him that students are their first priority, then he thinks that they need to be privatized,” Mr. Ardo said. State-affiliated student loan corporations came into existence when low-cost student loans were not widely available. Some guaranteed loans before the federally guaranteed student loan program was created in 1966. Others bought loans from banks, enabling them to lend more. Over the years these agencies evolved dramatically. They became so lucrative that a rash of them were acquired by private companies. Roughly 30 remain. Kathleen Smith, president of the Education Finance Council, which represents nonprofit and state-affiliated loan companies, said that the lenders performed a vital function and that the conduct of only a very few had drawn scrutiny. But in Pennsylvania, Missouri and Iowa, state officials have been asking whether the agencies have forgotten their purpose. State Senator Michael Connolly, a Democrat, said of Iowa Student Loan, “If they’re going to act like an aggressive profit-making corporation and pay their C.E.O. a quarter of a million dollars a year and pay their board members 1,000 a meeting, then maybe we should cut them loose.” The chief executive of Iowa Student Loan, Steve McCullough, strongly defended the corporation and said it had helped students go to college as federal and state aid stagnated. He has pledged to make the corporation more transparent by giving the state an annual report and formally opening board meetings to the public. He attributes debt burdens to rising tuition and relatively low family incomes in Iowa. “Iowa Student Loan does not control the factors that cause the need for students to borrow,” Mr. McCullough said. Part of what has drawn attention to Iowa Student Loan is its dominance. At Iowa State, more than 90 percent of students who take out private loans borrow from Iowa Student Loan; at the University of Northern Iowa, about 80 percent do. Originally set up to purchase loans made by banks, Iowa Student Loan in 1987 began to offer consolidation loans, which allow students to combine loans and simplify repayment. In 1992 Iowa authorized the corporation to work with a state agency to offer “Iowa Partnership Loans,” private loans not backed by the federal government. The sector is fast-growing and largely unregulated, and was the focus of recent state and federal investigations that turned up perks and rewards paid to college financial aid officers and universities to promote certain loan companies. Iowa Student Loan’s efforts echo such practices. The Des Moines Register, after a legal battle, obtained internal corporation e-mail messages dating back to 2003 through the state’s public disclosure law showing the lender’s zest for growth. The newspaper separately documented how the corporation had arrangements with colleges and universities to assume some of the costs of assisting students in taking out its private loans — an effort that appeared to pay off. For years, Iowa State University routinely included the corporation’s private loans in students’ financial aid packages although they are generally the most expensive way to pay for an education. State officials say that other Iowa colleges followed the same practice. Private loan volume has grown more than tenfold nationwide in the past decade, but in Iowa the increase is more than five times greater, according to the Iowa College Student Aid Commission, an agency that oversees the federal loan program in the state. Mr. McCullough said that statistic exaggerated growth because the company’s private loan program started out very small. Students who appeared at a legislative hearing this fall said they thought that the private loan was the only or the best option available. “The financial aid office never talked about anyone but Iowa Student Loan,” Taleen Brady, a senior at Iowa State, said in an interview after testifying. She took out a 5,000 loan, paying a 9 percent origination fee for her first year of college. The next year, after talking to the director of the university’s financial counseling clinic — which is outside the financial aid office — she switched lenders and got a loan with a much lower fee. Looking back, Ms. Brady was blunt in her assessment of the financial aid office. “It was very deceptive.” Roberta L. Johnson, director of financial aid at Iowa State, said she had ended the practice of including private loans in financial aid awards shortly after she took over in 2003. She said, “Since we changed it, we have seen our student debt levels start to drop slightly.” The average debt of student borrowers graduating in Iowa in 2006 was 23,680, compared with a national average that year of 18,918, according to Robert Shireman, executive director of the Project on Student Debt, a nonprofit organization financed largely by the Pew Charitable Trusts. Mr. McCullough said that the reimbursements to colleges did not cover all the costs of handling the Iowa Partnership loans and that the lender offered the payments because although the loan program was authorized by statute and required counseling and other services to students, the state provided no financing. “We are certain that the marketing of the Iowa Partnership loan program in no way influenced students or parents to increase their borrowing,” Mr. McCullough said. He said the company stopped making the payments this year. Iowa did not just authorize Iowa Student Loan to go into the private loan business, it cut its risk. The Iowa College Student Aid Commission for years bought defaulted private loans from the corporation. Mr. McCullough said the state proposed the arrangement to try to make money, by paying a small fraction of face value for the loans and then trying to collect. But a report by the Iowa College Student Aid Commission in November said the agency did not expect to recoup 6.2 million it had spent to buy the loans. The commission no longer buys such loans. Iowa Student Loan’s board members are appointed by the governor. Gov. Chet Culver, who took office in January, is waiting for the state attorney general to report on Iowa Student Loan’s structure before making appointments. The state’s auditor has recommended the removal of some board members because they also hold state regulatory positions, posing a conflict of interest.

Answer:","output":"As a boy grows into a man and his larynx grows larger, his voice typically gets deeper. This change in voice pitch is primarily due to the increase in size and thickness of the vocal cords within the larynx. When the vocal cords are larger, they vibrate at a slower rate, producing a lower-pitched sound. This natural process, which occurs during puberty, is called voice deepening or voice change, and it is a common sign of physical maturation in males."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"With regard to the language regime, of course this is simply a matter of consultation, since unanimity is required here.\\" to Romanian?","output":"În ceea ce privește regimul lingvistic, desigur că acesta este pur și simplu o chestiune de consultare, deoarece aici este necesară unanimitatea."},{"instruction":"Information: - The Pacific Northwest (in the United States, commonly abbreviated as PNW), sometimes referred to as Cascadia, is a geographic region in western North America bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and loosely, by the Rocky Mountains on the east. Though no agreed boundary exists, a common conception includes the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Broader conceptions reach north into Alaska and Yukon, south into far northern California and east to the Continental Divide, thus including Idaho, Western Montana, and western Wyoming. Narrower conceptions may be limited to the northwestern US or to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains. The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region's history, geography, society, and other factors. - In geography, a confluence is the meeting of two or more bodies of water. Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River. - Portland is a seaport and the largest city in the U.S. state of Oregon and the seat of Multnomah County. It is in the Willamette Valley region of the Pacific Northwest, at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers. The city covers and had an estimated population of 632,309 in 2015, making it the 26th most populous city in the United States. Approximately 2,389,228 people live in the Portland metropolitan statistical area (MSA), the 23rd most populous MSA in the United States. Its Combined Statistical Area (CSA) ranks 17th with a population of 3,022,178. Roughly 60% of Oregon's population resides within the Portland metropolitan area. - A combined statistical area (CSA) is composed of adjacent metropolitan (MSA) and micropolitan statistical areas (µSA) in the United States and Puerto Rico that can demonstrate economic or social linkage. The United States Office of Management and Budget defines a CSA as consisting of various combinations of adjacent metropolitan and micropolitan areas with economic ties measured by commuting patterns. These areas that combine retain their own designations as metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas within the larger combined statistical area. - Carson Friedman Ellis ( born October 5 , 1975 ) is an artist living in Portland , Oregon .

Options: (A) 1/4 (B) 1/2 (C) 3/5 (D) 9/10 (E) 16/20 If the answer is '(D)'; explain the reasoning:","output":"The answer is indeed (D) 9/10. To find the probability of drawing at least one golf ball when drawing two consecutive balls randomly from the jar, we can also approach it by finding the probability of NOT drawing any golf balls and then subtracting that from 1. When drawing two consecutive balls, there are a total of 5 balls initially and then 4 balls remaining after the first draw. So, there are a total of 5x4 = 20 possible outcomes. Now, let's find the probability of not drawing any golf balls (i.e., drawing two ping pong balls). There are 2 ping pong balls and 3 golf balls. On the first draw, the chance of getting a ping pong ball is 2/5. After drawing one ping pong ball, there is 1 ping pong ball and 3 golf balls left. The chance of getting a ping pong ball in the second draw is then 1/4. So, the probability of drawing two ping pong balls consecutively is: (2/5) x (1/4) = 2/20 = 1/10. Now, let's find the probability of drawing at least one golf ball by subtracting the probability of drawing two ping pong balls from 1: 1 - (1/10) = 9/10 Thus, the probability of drawing at least one golf ball when drawing two consecutive balls randomly is 9/10, which corresponds to option (D)."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary.

First, let's find the prime factors of 6 and 216. 6 = 2 x 3 Now, let's work on 216. 216 = 2^3 x 3^3 Next, we need to find the power of 216 raised to 10. (216^10) = ( 2^3 x 3^3 )^10 = 2^30 x 3^30 Now, return to our base number 6, which we can also write as: 6^x = (2 x 3)^x = 2^x x 3^x For 6^x to be a factor of 216^10, both the powers of 2 and 3 in 6^x must be equal to or less than their respective powers in 216^10. Now, let's compare the corresponding powers in both expressions: 2^x <= 2^30 and 3^x <= 3^30 Two critical points to be noted here are that x must be the same in both equations and that we're looking for the greatest possible x value. Our lower value comes from the power of 2, which is 2^30 in our 216^10 expression. To have 6^x as a factor, we need to distribute the powers of 2 and 3 equally in 6^x. Thus, we can divide the power of 2 (30) by 2, so that the remaining half is assigned to the power of 3 in 6^x. 30 ÷ 2 = 15 Therefore, the greatest positive integer x such that 6^x is a factor of 216^10 is 15.

Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - Antonio Vagnozzi is an amateur Italian astronomer . He is a prolific discoverer of asteroids . - Asteroids are minor planets, especially those of the inner Solar System. The larger ones have also been called planetoids. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not show the disc of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active comet. As minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered and found to have volatile-based surfaces that resemble those of comets, they were often distinguished from asteroids of the asteroid belt. In this article, the term \\"asteroid\\" refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System including those co-orbital with Jupiter. - A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to evolve gasses, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures. - An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole. - Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better.

Stephen Frost, head of inclusion at this summer’s Olympics, confessed that some targets were ‘written on the back of an envelope’ – but stressed that they had to be honoured. The comments are likely to infuriate those angry about the cost of attending the Games. They may also concern MPs, who last month expressed fears that the London Olympics will go way over its current budget of £9.3billion. The predicted cost of the Games when London won the bid in 2005 was £2.37billion. Addressing a diversity conference in Toronto, Mr Frost – formerly of gay equality organisation Stonewall – cited an Olympic ‘volunteer selection centre’ as an example of officials shunning the cheapest option. He said the successful bidder was a ‘little more expensive’ but had ‘guaranteed to do all the work we needed to make the venue more accessible’. Mr Frost said: ‘All this stuff we’d said in 2005 to get the Games . . . some of it was written on the back of an envelope, quite frankly. We then had to deliver it.’ The Oxford and Harvard graduate also claimed that East London was an ‘urban desert’ before London’s successful Olympics bid. ‘I think if any of you go to London, or have been to London, or know London well, the East End of London is transformed,’ he said. ‘And it’s been a real physical transformation. ‘An area that was an urban desert [with] burnt-out cars, wild cats, unexploded bombs from World War II, poisoned soil, dirty water . . . has now become a really really cleaned-up, thriving community with affordable housing, lifetime homes, medical centres, [and] new hospitals as well as venues built for legacy.’ Mr Frost said the privately-run London 2012 Organising Committee (Locog) had convinced more than 60 businesses to set up a guaranteed interview scheme for disabled people. ‘That for me is systemic change which has benefits, rather than token diversity.’ Politically correct: Volunteers at the 2012 Games are also being offered advice on how to deal with cross-dressing members of the public. He also revealed that car-makers that signed contracts with Locog must make vehicles adaptable for disabled drivers. ‘It’s going to be quite nice in London to see VIPs being driven around by disabled folks,’ he said. Other contract recipients include a minority-owned film company in East London; the Royal Association for Deaf People, which will offer interpretation services; a company run by visually impaired people that will provide cleaning products; and an Asian-owned bus company. In an interview with a Canadian newspaper, Mr Frost revealed he has consulted with gay former NBA player John Amaechi on the inclusion of gay and lesbian athletes at the Games, and worked with British Paralympic champion Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson on accessibility for disabled athletes and spectators. ‘The London vision will definitely empower change, enhancing the hiring of disabled people, including gays and lesbians and dealing with homophobia in sport, bringing cultural communities together,’ he said. ‘We’re not going to solve the world’s problems, but we are going to use the power of the Games for change.’ Last September, the Daily Mail revealed that volunteers at the 2012 Games are being offered advice on how to deal with cross-dressing members of the public. They have been told that if confronted by a man wearing a dress, they should direct him to both the men’s and women’s toilets to avoid causing offence. Volunteers have also been issued with a list of words or terms they should not use while on duty. Banned terms include carer or helper, to be replaced with personal assistant or support worker. Staff must also avoid ‘patronising’ young people, the guidelines state, adding that it would be wrong to say ‘young man’. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Stephen Frost, the head of inclusion at the summer Olympics, admitted that Olympics chiefs have paid over the odds for contracts to meet self-imposed diversity targets, with some targets written on the back of an envelope.

Macreedy (Spencer Tracy) gets off a passenger train at the isolated desert hamlet of Black Rock. It is the first time in four years that the train has stopped there. Macreedy is looking for a man named Komoko, but the few residents are inexplicably hostile. The young hotel desk clerk, Pete Wirth (John Ericson), claims he has no vacant rooms. Macreedy is threatened by Hector David (Lee Marvin). Later, Reno Smith (Robert Ryan) informs Macreedy that Komoko, a Japanese-American, was interned during World War II. Certain that something is wrong, Macreedy sees the local sheriff, Tim Horn (Dean Jagger), but the alcoholic lawman is clearly afraid of Smith and is impotent to help. The veterinarian and undertaker, Doc Velie (Walter Brennan), advises Macreedy to leave town immediately, but also lets slip that Komoko is dead. Pete's sister, Liz (Anne Francis), rents Macreedy a Jeep. He drives to nearby Adobe Flat, where he finds a homestead burned to the ground and wildflowers. On the way back, Coley Trimble (Ernest Borgnine) tries to run him off the road. When Smith asks, Macreedy reveals he lost his left arm fighting in Italy. Macreedy says the wildflowers at the Komoko place lead him to suspect that a body is buried there. Smith reveals that he is virulently anti-Japanese; he tried to enlist in the Marines the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, but failed the physical. Macreedy tries to telephone the state police, but Pete refuses to put the call through. Doc Velie admits that something terrible happened four years ago and that Smith has everyone too terrified to speak up. Velie offers Macreedy his hearse to leave town.

Later that day, when Sylvie's father (Tom Skeritt) picks her up, Ivy asks for a ride. At first Darrel, Sylvie's father, is reluctant, but grudgingly compromises. Ivy tells Sylvie she gets car sick and asks to ride in the front (a ruse to get near Darrel, Ivy has a bit of a fetish for older men). Ivy puts her bare feet on the dashboard and allows her mini-skirt to shrug back onto her hip revealing her legs. Darrel takes notice.A few weeks later, after Sylvie is no longer grounded, they meet again at the same hangout. They walk to Sylvie's house together, on the way Sylvie tells Ivy that Darrel is her adoptive father and that her biological father was black. She also says that she once tried to kill herself.

In my opinion, techno/electronica/house is the perfect music for a communist society... it's modern, progressive, intense, and a lot of fun, but it's not subversive or nasty like heavy metal or rap. Music should fulfill people's 'fun' need without making them want to hurt someone.Mike (mlferrini@sbcglobal.net) Answer:","output":"The following review would most likely decrease the chances of me buying the product for several reasons. 1. The reviewer states that the CD has nothing to do with communism, which may indicate that the product description or marketing for the CD was misleading. If I were specifically looking for music related to or inspired by communism, this review would immediately make me question the product's relevance to my interests. 2. The music itself is described as not sounding very good, which may indicate that the quality of the musical compositions is poor. 3. Despite the reviewer giving the CD 2 stars because of some enjoyable techno beats, they also express dissatisfaction with the absence of a communist message in the lyrics. This implies that the reviewer expected such a theme and was disappointed by not finding it in the music. If I were specifically looking for music with a communist message, this review would significantly decrease my chances of buying the product. 4. It is worth noting that the reviewer provides their email address, giving an impression of authenticity.

One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that.

Their planned route is ambitious, bringing them north across the Andes, along the coast of Chile, through the Atacama Desert and into the Peruvian Amazon in order to reach Venezuela just in time for Granado's 30th birthday on 2 April. However, due to La Poderosa's breakdown, they are forced to travel at a much slower pace, and don't make it to Caracas until July.

Brevity in communication refers to the practice of expressing thoughts, ideas, or information with clarity and conciseness, using the least amount of words necessary to convey the intended message. This approach allows for the efficient exchange of information, enabling the recipient to quickly digest and comprehend the content. By eliminating excessive verbiage and focusing on the essential details, brief sentences and statements are often more impactful, easier to remember, and facilitate better understanding. However, it is crucial to strike a balance between conciseness and informativeness, as truncating valuable information adversely affects interpretation and context.

He uses Pittsburg city as a reference which has 2000 stores, 500 hospitals, 200 schools, and 20 police stations. If the new city should have half the number of stores, twice as many hospitals, 50 fewer schools, and 5 more police stations, what is the total number of buildings required for this project? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"To determine the total number of buildings required for this project, we'll follow these steps: 1. Calculate the number of stores needed for the new city. 2. Calculate the number of hospitals needed for the new city. 3. Calculate the number of schools needed for the new city. 4. Calculate the number of police stations needed for the new city. 5. Add the number of stores, hospitals, schools, and police stations together to find the total number of buildings. Step 1: Calculate the number of stores The new city should have half the number of stores as Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh has 2,000 stores. Half of 2,000 stores = 2,000 / 2 = 1,000 stores Step 2: Calculate the number of hospitals The new city should have twice as many hospitals as Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh has 500 hospitals. Twice the number of 500 hospitals = 500 * 2 = 1,000 hospitals Step 3: Calculate the number of schools The new city should have 50 fewer schools than Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh has 200 schools. 50 fewer schools than 200 schools = 200 - 50 = 150 schools Step 4: Calculate the number of police stations The new city should have 5 more police stations than Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh has 20 police stations. 5 more police stations than 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 police stations Step 5: Add the number of stores, hospitals, schools, and police stations together to find the total number of buildings.

Our lunch ascends to Star Trek nirvana when we are barely into the 15th minute of our almost two-hour conversation. We are musing about the surprising linguistic affinities between Treknobabble and Shakespearean iambic pentameter – both of which Stewart is fluent in, having spent sizeable chunks of his five decades in acting immersed in them. \\"There are lots of similarities,\\" he says. Then, with a mischievous glint in his eye, Stewart leans his famously bald pate towards me, over our dishes of Cobb salad, and says: \\"Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise, its continuing mission to seek out new life and new civilisations. To boldly go where no one has gone before.\\" \\"You see!

Stewart sweeps in precisely at the allotted hour, dressed all in black and disguised only by a working man's flat cap. He shakes my hand firmly and looks me straight in the eye. Not for the only time in our encounter he makes me think of a military officer.The other possible explanation for Stewart's revival of Picard in front of an audience of one is that he seems to be in right royal good spirits. And why wouldn't he be? As he approaches his 74th birthday, he is firing on all cylinders. Far from showing any signs of engine fatigue, for the lad from Mirfield, West Yorkshire, life and work just seem to get better and better. In September he married his third wife, singer-songwriter Sunny Ozell, and they live in a converted carriage house in the heart of Park Slope, one of Brooklyn's most fashionable neighbourhoods. And he's just come off a critically acclaimed double run on Broadway of No Man's Land and Waiting for Godot with his bestie Ian McKellen, who officiated at their wedding. The two actors are reunited this month in the new X-Men movie, Days of Future Past; and Stewart also appears in an indie film called Match which premiered at the Tribeca film festival. If that's not enough, just as we're finishing up our salads, the news breaks that he is to star in a 20-episode series of half-hour TV comedies conceived by Family Guy's Seth MacFarlane. Did I omit to say that in the past 18 months he's erupted into a global Twitter phenomenon, with 1.2m followers? (A halloween Twitpic of him dressed as a red lobster lying in the bath was retweeted 40,000 times.) With all that to go at, it's hard to know where to begin. Might as well launch straight in with the unlikely parallels between Star Trek, the vehicle that propelled him to fame, and his ongoing love affair with Shakespeare. A few weeks into shooting Star Trek: Next Generation Stewart had a eureka moment. He was sitting in the captain's chair in the bridge of the starship Enterprise when he suddenly saw himself back in his old milieu: \\"I realised that the set actually represented very much an Elizabethan stage, with the main acting area in the centre front, a raised area at the back, two vomitoria entrances low down. It was classic.\\" At 47, Stewart already had an accomplished career behind him with the Royal Shakespeare Company, but was unknown in Hollywood when one of the Star Trek producers saw him at a Shakespeare workshop at UCLA. \\"I'd never seen myself especially as a film or television actor, let alone sci-fi,\\" says Stewart. \\"I went to LA to do it after I was assured the six-year contract I signed would never be called upon to be met; I was convinced we wouldn't even make it through the first season.\\" Seven seasons, 178 episodes, four feature films and plenty of Spandex later, Stewart emerged, to his own astonishment, as a Hollywood superstar. The exceptional quality about Stewart's work is that he has managed to keep his profile high in the film firmament while at the same time growing and deepening a distinguished theatrical career. Few other actors come to mind who have pulled off such a juggling act. Yes, the Ethan Hawkes and Denzel Washingtons may dabble with Broadway, but Patrick Stewart is one of a rare breed that can neither be called a film star or a stage actor – because he is both. I wonder aloud whether it's more than coincidental, that perhaps there's something to the classical British thespian training that he enjoyed that produces actors peculiarly equipped to excel across stage and screen. Stewart eagerly concurs. \\"I absolutely believe that's what it is. It's a feeling for language, a feeling for drama that is something a little more than totally naturalistic. I use this word a lot: 'heightened'.\\" He expresses his gratitude to the retired Old Vic actor who trained him between the ages of 12 and 17, and to Peter Hall, John Barton and Trevor Nunn at whose feet he sat when he joined the RSC, in awe at \\"their immense knowledge and experience of Shakespearean language. I never knew you could speak Shakespeare in a way that was totally spontaneous and poetic at the same time.\\" He likens himself to a Leeds United football player in Don Revie's day. \\"He had trained those buggers so intensely throughout the week that at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon those 11 players would run on to the pitch totally liberated, free to do what they wanted to do, having done the work.\\" As further evidence that none of this is coincidental, the other great straddler between theatre and franchise films is none other than Stewart's best friend, Ian McKellen. That the two knighted British actors have forged a deep friendship is abundantly clear from Stewart's effervescent Twitter feed. To mark their Broadway double-act last autumn they instigated the Twitter equivalent of a riot, taking selfies in iconic NYC places – the top of the Empire State Building, on the boardwalk in Coney Island – wearing Godot-esque bowler hats and looking more than a little deranged. What booms out of the photos is how much fun they are having in each other's company. The bromance returns with X-Men: Days of Future Past. This time, the two thespian lions are allies both on and off the camera. In previous X-Men films, Stewart's character, Professor Charles Xavier, has been at loggerheads with McKellen's Magneto. The two characters are both mutants, but they occupy opposing political extremes. Xavier is the moderate negotiator who prefers talk over battle; Magneto is a fighter and revolutionary. But in Days of Future Past the two are thrown on to the same side by the common threat of enemy machines. \\"When the film begins we are in a situation where Xavier has had to decide that force is the only way forward,\\" Stewart says. \\"He is pushed into Magneto's camp and they become collaborators. We are dealing with machines and not human beings, so argument, persuasion, is no longer an option.\\" We are at a disadvantage to dig much deeper with X-Men, given that the 11th-hour final production work on the film means neither of us has yet seen it. But we can stick with the theme of persuasion versus force as it also runs through Stewart's second new film this spring, Match – an intimate, touching portrait set in Manhattan of a gay, dope-smoking, knitting, TV soap-watching and rather lonely classical ballet teacher called Tobi, who has an encounter with a married couple, strangers who as the narrative unfolds require him to confront the choices of his past. Stewart is stupendous, displaying a breathtaking range of emotional shades and dramatic tones. He is funny one minute, enraged the next, then cathartic and profoundly moving. I ask him how he managed to capture so convincingly the historic conflicts Tobi wrestles with – such as the character's decision to devote his life to career and as a result forego having a child. \\"For many years I was making choices like that every day,\\" he says, referring to his relationship with his children, Daniel and Sophia, by his first wife Sheila Falconer. \\"As my responsibilities in the theatre grew, I was gone from nine in the morning until midnight. I was an absentee father, largely, and there was a price to be paid for that down the road.\\" He actively channelled such emotional conflicts into conjuring up Tobi. \\"Actors, we have this thing called a 'sense memory' which we draw on for particularly emotional moments. We have these things stored away in a vault and we can draw them out when we need to.\\" Like a filing cabinet of emotions, I suggest. \\"That's right. That was part of my training at Bristol Old Vic theatre school. We were taught how to store emotions. It means no experience is ever wasted.\\" If the regret of being an absentee dad has provided him with a valuable emotional file or two, then his relationship with his own father must have filled the sense memory equivalent of the NSA's mass surveillance database in Utah. Alfred Stewart, a regimental sergeant major in the British army, was a troubled soul who, after retiring from the armed forces, suffered post traumatic stress disorder. At weekends it came bursting out in drunken assaults on his wife, Gladys. The sense memory is all too viscerally visible here. At one of the pivotal moments in Match, Tobi places himself physically between the married strangers, played by Matthew Lillard and Carla Gugino, acting as a human shield. \\"Don't take another step! Not another step!\\" Tobi bellows at the husband, who is poised to strike his wife. It's an astonishing moment. Stewart unleashes himself with such explosive charge that the whole cinema feels as though it is quaking. I remind Stewart of that point in the film, and of the haunting piece he wrote for the Guardian in 2009 in which he describes his father's domestic violence through his then child's eyes. \\"I knew exactly when the shouting was done and a hand was about to be raised – I also knew exactly when to insert a small body between the fist and her face, a skill no child should ever learn.\\" It's the same incident, I remark. He pauses for a second, and then says only this: \\"You reach a choice moment where you say, 'That's enough. I'm not going to be a spectator in this any more.'\\" The paradox about Stewart's fraught relationship with his father, who used to mock his son's fondness for theatre remorselessly, is that he's come to appreciate over the years how much he is in his father's debt in terms of his acting career. Take Picard and Xavier. Both of them stand for non-violence and peace and, as such, are arguably polar opposites to Alfred. But both of them are leaders, commanders –very much in Alfred's military mould. \\"It's a source of sadness to me that my father never lived to see me do Star Trek,\\" he says. \\"Because he would have approved of what I was doing and how I used the role. I mean, books have been written about Picard's command style. It's taught in the military academy!\\" It sounds like there will be more than a sprinkling of Alfred Stewart in Patrick's new adventure, Blunt Talk – the upcoming Seth MacFarlane comedy series that will be broadcast on Starz next year. Stewart will play Walter Blunt, a working-class lad from the north of England with a military background and a career in TV news who gets shipped off to LA to front a cable news programme called Blunt Talk. \\"You are going to think right away about Piers Morgan, but you mustn't!\\" Stewart says emphatically. \\"When we meet Blunt his show is no longer doing well, the numbers are dreadful and his career is in crisis.\\" OK, now I am thinking Piers Morgan. Can't help it. \\"He just keeps falling into these tailspins. One after another. It's completely realistic and truthful. This is not a gag show, it's not one-liners. It's single camera on film – we'll be making a half-hour movie every six days.\\" With all that ahead, I say, he's not coming home to the UK any time soon. Stewart responds that he has a lovely house in Britain that he adores, and that he intends to spend as much time as possible in the mother country. But on this point he is resolute: \\"I am a resident of the United States.\\" He has even, he says, started for the first time thinking seriously about taking up American citizenship. It's partly the recent marriage to Ozell and how embraced he feels by her family. And it's partly a sense of political frustration at not having a vote in America. \\"It's long overdue,\\" he says. \\"There's only so much I can do, only so much I can comment on.\\" Before we polish off the salads, I ask Stewart whether he ever fears, in those dark hours, that all the cornucopia, the largesse, the riches of his life that seem to just keep on giving will one day dry up. \\"I don't have those kind of dark hours, except where health is concerned,\\" he says. \\"I've had two major scares in the past 10 years – one with heart, one with cancer – both of them taken care of.\\" We both, in unison, start knocking on wood. And then, as the waiter clears away our plates, Patrick Stewart launches into one final tale, this one about McKellen and how, as they waited for the curtain to go up for No Man's Land, they would moan and moan about their ailments. \\"Nobody would believe it. Here were Magneto and Charles Xavier, these power-houses, griping about their aches and pains.\\" He recalls one particular performance when Sir Ian and Sir Patrick, giants of the English stage, were sitting behind the curtain just before the start. \\"Ian was telling me about his experience with catheters. The call came: \\"We're going up!\\" The curtain rose, the lights went on, and we were both chuckling about catheters. That made for a slightly different show.\\" X-Men: Days of Future Past is released on 22 May What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article is an interview with actor Patrick Stewart, who discusses his acting career, experiences in roles such as Star Trek's Captain Picard, and his relationships with other actors like Ian McKellen.

The bride was taken to Royal Hobart Hospital with alcohol poisoning. Six police cars were needed to quell the violent and disorderly party. The groom and the best man were charged after throwing punches. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Wild Wedding Party in South Hobart Ends with Paramedics, Police, and Charges Once upon a time, there was a big party at a place in South Hobart. The party was for a wedding where the bride and groom were celebrating the start of their life together. But things didn't go as planned, and the party became wild and a little dangerous. It was late at night, just past the time when the clock's little hand is pointing to 12. The bride had accidentally drunk too much of a special grown-up drink called alcohol. When people drink too much alcohol, they can get really sick. So, some very kind and skilled helpers called paramedics were called to come and help the bride feel better. The paramedics took her to a special place called Royal Hobart Hospital, where doctors could make sure she was safe and healthy. This wedding party was not like the other peaceful and happy ones. People were being loud, fighting, and causing trouble. That's when the police, who help keep people safe and make sure everyone follows the rules, came in to calm things down and make sure nobody got hurt. Six police cars arrived at the party, which is a lot! They had their work cut out for them to bring peace back to the celebration. Sadly, the groom and the best man – a close friend who helps the groom on his special day – got too carried away with their emotions and started throwing punches at each other. This not only made the wedding party less fun but also broke some important rules. So, the police had to step in and charge the groom and the best man for what they did. And so, this wedding party turned from a joyful celebration to a lesson on the importance of keeping our emotions and actions in check. The story's lesson is that we must always remember to be kind and make wise choices, especially when it's a special event like a wedding. That way, nobody gets hurt, and everyone can have a great time!"},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given books product reviews in Japanese language.

Hold your breath for ten seconds, and then breathe out. When you take a deep breath, your diaphragm pushes down on your stomach. When pushed on, the stomach acts like a water balloon and protrudes in the opposite direction. This may help with digestion by mobilizing the stomach contents and also helping air move through to the small intestine. If you are nervous because of a meeting at work or a test at school, you might want to take a trip to the bathroom before the big event. Nervousness and anxiety increases the activity in your gut, so you may have to use the bathroom a little sooner than usual. Your stomach may be telling you that you need to eat. Although eating isn't always the answer to a growling stomach, it will sometimes solve the problem. Since the squeezing of your intestinal tract gets louder when your small intestine is empty, you could turn the volume down by giving it some food to digest.

But while we can count on this semiotic orgy coming around every year, we cannot be so sure that the way we use punctuation will be the same from one to the next—even if the ostensible reason for this holiday is to celebrate “the importance of proper punctuation.” After all, the proper among us once wrote today as to-day; they once referred to the 1920s as the 1920’s; and they once marked quotations with diples (>) rather than these guys: (“”). Here are five modern examples of how punctuation is evolving, with no certain conclusion and whether the traditionalists like it or not. Emoji are being wielded as punctuation. Especially on platforms like Twitter, emoji are being used to serve the same key purpose of punctuation: aiding understanding by providing clues to how the surrounding words should be interpreted. Take the text of this real tweet, randomly selected from emojitracker.com: “Who tf put cheese in my bag today ” Just as exclamation points can convey excitement or question marks can suggest a lack of certainty, the angry face helps the reader understand that writer was angry about discovering their bag contained cheese of uncertain origin. There is more freedom from conventions. Look back at the above tweet. While an English teacher might whip out her red pen and put a question mark at the end of the sentence, we can easily discern the writer’s uncertainty about the cheese-smuggler’s identity by the word who. We don’t need the mark, and space-constrained platforms like Twitter and text messages have made us more apt to drop unnecessary characters—as well as less likely to make the assumption that character-dropping equals ignorance. Meanwhile, the same marks missing from the ends of sentences or middle of words are settling into non-traditional roles. “Now you have Twitter and email taking older marks and giving them new life as emoticons,” says Keith Houston, author of Shady Characters, a history of punctuation marks. “People are punctuating in unstandard ways, and they are freed from convention because these messages are ephemeral.” The apostrophe is losing steam in some circles. Social media analytics firm Brandwatch scoured Twitter for trends in 2013 and found that the top five “grammatical errors” were: im, wont, cant, dont and id. Meanwhile, corporations like British super-bookstore Waterstones (neé Waterstone’s) have seen fit to erase those marks from their names. Cities are dropping them from street signs. And while some grammarians may cry most foul, others are calling for the apostrophe’s dumb round head. The advocates behind the “Kill the Apostrophe” website have been joined by author James Harbeck in asserting that, in most cases, rules about apostrophe usage only serve to irritate those people who know the rules and confuse those who do not. “The great question with a lot of punctuation is, Do you really need it?” says Ammon Shea, author of hilarious grammar-police-takedown Bad English. And, he says, there’s often little risk of confusion when theyre absent. Exclamation marks are becoming harder to avoid, for those who would like to avoid them. As many have noted, the period that used to innocuously signal the end of a thought—like an orchestra conductor pinching his hand—has taken on a brusque aura these days, leaving the reader of any declarative sentence open to detect apathy or annoyance. This has led to a rise in exclamation marks, because people need something to fill the gaps left by informative cues we get only in face-to-face communication—the raised brows, the wide eyes, the smile. Fearing that we could come across as unfriendly, we tack on an exclamation mark (“Thanks!”) to make sure our fine disposition comes across. The data supporting this shift is largely anecdotal, but the anecdotes are abundant. “The exclamation mark, once reserved for expressing joy or excitement, now simply marks baseline politeness,” writes New York Magazine’s Melissa Dahl, who goes on to quote a grammarian who describes them as nearly “mandatory” in email. “Dealing with such bare bones language,” says Shea, “you use whatever help you can get.” (If you don’t want this kind of help, there is a handy TIME guide on alternatives.) Hyphens are being retired, perhaps faster than ever. Hyphens have, of course, been chucked for centuries, as in the previous example of to-day becoming today. But that shift, Houston says, took about a century and wasn’t finalized until the 1900s. Today, at least some of the hyphen-tossing is happening faster. Take electronic mail, which started as the crazy notion of “E-mail” in the 1970s and became the un-hyphenated, ho-hum “email” among prevailing American media outlets in about 40 years.“The migration to ebook, ecommerce and email is not unexpected,” Merriam-Webster President John Morse previously told TIME. “This transition may come more readily in today’s technological environment.” We can only wonder what tricksy technology is going to do to punctuation between now and next year’s National Punctuation Day. In the meantime, I need to get back to my em-dash bath.

But my other children will never have the chance to know her and experience how loving and gracious she was. We often speak of \\"Mommy's mommy,\\" and I find myself trying to explain the illness that took her away from us. They have asked if the same could happen to me. I have always told them not to worry, but the truth is that I carry a \\"faulty\\" gene, BRCA1, which sharply increases my risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer. My doctors estimated that I had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman. Once I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much as I could. I started with the breasts, as my risk of breast cancer is higher than my risk of ovarian cancer, and the surgery is more complex. On April 27, I finished the three months of medical procedures. During that time I have been able to keep this private and to carry on with my work. But I am writing about it now because I hope that other women can benefit from my experience.

Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - Party discipline is the ability of a parliamentary group of a political party to get its members to support the policies of their party leadership. In liberal democracies, it usually refers to the control that party leaders have over their caucus members in the legislature. Party discipline is important for all systems of government that allow parties to hold political power because it determines the degree to which the governmental infrastructure will be affected by legitimate political processes. - The Bundestag (\\"Federal Diet\\") is a constitutional and legislative body at the federal level in Germany.

The pair met at the age of 15 at the Alabama School of Fine Arts. They fronted a band called Little Red Rocket, often compared to Veruca Salt, in their hometown of Birmingham, Alabama in the mid and late 1990s and released two albums with the band on Tim/Kerr records. - Art in Manila (formerly Art Bell) is an indie rock band consisting of Adrianne Verhoeven (The Anniversary), Dan McCarthy (McCarthy Trenching), Steve Bartolomei (Mal Madrigal), Ryan Fox (The Good Life), Corey Broman (Dance Me Pregnant), and Stefanie Drootin (The Good Life) led by a former member of Azure Ray, Orenda Fink. They are currently signed to Saddle Creek Records. - The Anniversary is an American band formed in Lawrence, Kansas in 1997 by Josh Berwanger, James David, Christian Jankowski, Adrianne Verhoeven and Justin Roelofs. The Anniversary was the solidification of a line-up that had been in flux for a year. After two years of playing shows across with the Midwest with bands that included The Get Up Kids, Braid and Superchunk, The Anniversary signed to Vagrant Records. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Britpop is a UK based music and culture movement in the mid 1990s which emphasised \\"Britishness\\", and produced bright, catchy pop music partly in reaction to the US led grunge music and the UK's own shoegazing music scene. The most successful bands associated with the movement are Oasis, Blur, Suede and Pulp; those groups would come to be known as its \\"big four\\". The timespan of Britpop is generally considered to be 1993-1997, with 1994-1995, and a chart battle between Blur and Oasis dubbed \\"The Battle of Britpop\\", being the epicentre of activity. While music was the main focus, fashion, art, and politics also got involved, with artists such as Damien Hirst being involved in creating videos for Blur, and being labelled as Britart or Britpop artists, and Tony Blair and New Labour aligning themselves with the movement. - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - Set the Woods on Fire is the first full - length studio album from indie rock band Art in Manila . - Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged during the in the American state of Washington, particularly in Seattle. The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop, but by the early 1990s its popularity had spread, with grunge acts in California and other parts of the U.S. building strong followings and signing major record deals. - Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. Its substyles include chamber pop and twee pop. - Orenda Fink (born September 18, 1975) is an American musician on Saddle Creek Records.

That’s the promise of virtual reality (VR) headsets, like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. As impressive as the technology already is, many believe it’s still in its early days. That’s because previous virtual reality-style efforts have flopped in the past. (Nintendo’s Virtual Boy comes to mind.) But the latest crop of gadgets are seen as more promising, thanks to their much-improved graphics, head-tracking abilities and more. Few have watched virtual reality evolve as closely as the companies building the hardware that powers it. TIME sat down with Frank Azor, general manager of the Dell-owned gaming PC manufacturer Alienware, and Nelson Gonzalez, Alienware’s cofounder and former CEO, to discuss what they have learned about VR and where they believe it’s headed. Below are the key highlights from our conversation. Read more: Virtual Reality Buyers Guide: Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive vs. Samsung Gear VR Virtual reality will get more physical Anyone who’s seen or tried the HTC Vive knows that some physical activity is involved. The Vive and its two controllers are equipped with sensors that allow players to swing a virtual golf club or wield an imaginary paintbrush. But what systems like the Vive or PlayStation VR currently lack is a sense of touch. Although it may look like you’re swinging a golf club, the device in your hand still feels like a video game controller. (The Oculus Rift doesn’t yet support any motion controllers, although the company plans to launch such devices later in 2016.) This is going to be one of the first areas in which virtual reality will improve, says Gonzalez. “The next evolution of VR would be where you participate physically in that VR world,” Gonzalez said. “And not just sitting down; if you’re a quarterback, you actually get to throw a football, and you can interface with the team. So that kind of stuff, it’s there, it’s going to happen.” Incorporating better touch controls will only be the start. Azor believes future VR devices could refine concepts first introduced as far back as 1962 with the Sensorama, which incorporated elements like wind and smells. “Headsets today are doing an excellent job at catering to your visual senses, and a little bit of audio as well,” said Azor, also Alienware’s fourth employee. “Well that’s just two of the senses . . . Once you begin catering to the rest of the senses, like what we feel body-wise, temperature-wise, and smell, the reality factor of virtual reality [becomes] stronger and the virtual piece begins to fade.” It’s unclear exactly how — and if — technologies like those Azor described will ever take shape. But some companies are certainly trying. Leap Motion, a startup which launched a motion-sensing camera for computers in 2013, is now building technology for interacting with VR environments without a controller. Startup Thalmic Labs also makes an armband capable of controlling electronic devices through gestures that works with the Rift. Read more: Review: Oculus Rift is expensive, complicated, and totally wonderful VR is an industry-wide effort The Oculus Rift will likely be remembered as the first modern virtual reality headset. But it takes more than just one device to impact the industry in a meaningful way, says Azor. Azor draws comparisons to the way the gaming industry developed over the past decade. PCs became better equipped to deliver high-end gaming experiences as companies like Intel, AMD, and Nvidia developed more powerful chips and graphics processors. Games became more accessible on PCs as companies like Steam created platforms for easily buying and browsing content. “Everyone rallied around [the PC gaming] industry and now we have what we have today,” he said. “VR is the same type of thing; no one company can solve all of the problems.” A wireless Rift or Vive won’t happen soon There are two classes of virtual reality devices available today: cheaper, portable devices like the Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard, and beefier, expensive systems that offer more immersive experiences like the Rift and the Vive. The former plug into your smartphone to deliver VR that’s wireless and convenient, while the latter must be tethered to a PC to power their higher-end performance. It’s unlikely that we’ll see a high-performance device like the Rift go wireless anytime soon, mostly because wireless technology isn’t advancing at the same pace as VR hardware. “By the time we solve that, as an industry we’re going to want to give you version two of the product, which is going to become the new benchmark,” Azor said. “Wireless technology is on a different schedule, that’s where the issue comes in . . . The latest and greatest will be wired for a fair amount of time moving forward.” What was this article about?","output":"This article is about Alienware, a gaming PC manufacturer, and its thoughts on the future of virtual reality (VR). They believe that virtual reality will become more physical, requiring users to engage more with their whole bodies. The company also thinks that VR technology will eventually be developed to cater to more senses, such as touch, temperature, and smell, to make the experience more immersive. Furthermore, Alienware states that the advancement of VR will require collaboration from various companies, as it did in the PC gaming industry. The article also mentions that high-performance VR devices, like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, are unlikely to be wireless any time soon due to the slower progress in wireless technology compared to VR hardware."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given the title of a five-sentence story, the first four sentences, and two options for the fifth sentence as a and b.

Options: - cruise ship - coming together - restaurant - mall - home Please answer and provide answer explanation.","output":"A dining area is likely to be most extravagant in a cruise ship. Explanation: A dining area on a cruise ship often provides an extravagant and luxurious dining experience for guests who prefer fine dining. These dining areas typically offer elegant settings, world-class cuisine, impeccable service, and a wide variety of culinary choices. Cruise ship restaurants are also known for their opulent designs and decor, such as stylish furniture, impressive chandeliers, and lavish dining utensils, which contribute to the overall extravagant ambiance. Other options: 1. Coming together: This term usually refers to a casual gathering of people, such as a potluck or cookout. While these events can be enjoyable, they generally don't involve extravagant dining experiences. 2. Restaurant: Although some high-end or luxury restaurants can also provide an extravagant dining experience, they often can't match the upscale atmosphere and unique dining options found onboard cruise ships. 3. Mall: Mall food courts usually offer quick-service, casual dining options, and while they might be convenient, they aren't known for extravagance. 4. Home: A home dining area's level of luxury and extravagance depends on the individual's tastes and preferences. While some may design their dining area extravagantly, it typically wouldn't be considered extravagant when compared to a cruise ship or a high-end restaurant."},{"instruction":"Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Mao Asada (Qian Tian Zhen Yang , Asada Mao, born September 25, 1990) is a former Japanese competitive figure skater. She is the 2010 Olympic silver medalist, a three-time World champion (2008, 2010, 2014), a three-time Four Continents champion (2008, 2010, 2013), and a four-time Grand Prix Final champion (2005-06, 2008-09, 2012-13, 2013-14). She is the only female figure skater who has landed three triple Axel jumps in one competition, which she achieved at the 2010 Winter Olympics. During the summer of 2007, Asada received additional training in Russia from Tatiana Tarasova, while Arutyunyan remained her primary coach. At the 2007 Skate Canada International, Asada was third in the short program and first in the long, finishing with the gold medal ahead of silver medalist Yukari Nakano. Asada won her second gold at the 2007 Trophee Eric Bompard with over 21 points ahead of silver medalist Kimmie Meissner. Asada advanced to the 2007-08 Grand Prix Final in Turin, Italy. In the short program, Asada did not do the jump out of footwork required element and placed 6th with a score of 59.04 points. But the next day, she rebounded in the free skating to win the free skating with 132.55 points. She executed a triple axel, a triple flip-triple toe loop combination, a triple loop, a triple flip-triple loop, a double axel-double loop-double loop combination, and a double axel, but had a change-of-edge error in triple lutz. She won the silver medal with 191.59 points, 5.24 behind gold medalist Yuna Kim, who repeated as champion. As in the previous year, Asada won the 2007-08 Japan Championships. Her final score was 1.15 points ahead of silver medalist and reigning World champion Miki Ando. Asada was placed on the Japanese team for both the World and Four Continents Championships. Before Four Continents, she split with Arutyunyan and returned to Japan to practice on the new Aurora Rink at Chukyo University, where she had no problems obtaining ice time. Asada competed at both ISU Championships without a coach but an official from the Japan Skating Federation accompanied her as needed. Competing for the first time at Four Continents Championships, Asada won both segments and finished 13.71 points ahead of silver medalist Joannie Rochette. In March 2008, at the Worlds Championships, Asada won her first World title. She was second in the short program, 0.18 behind Carolina Kostner. In the free skating, she was second to bronze medalist Yuna Kim by 1.92 points but 0.88 ahead of silver medalist Carolina Kostner.

What is the answer??","output":"Okay, little buddy! Let's solve this step by step together: 1. First, we need to find out how many 'd's we have in total on both sides of the equation: The left side has -173*d and -161*d together. When we add them, (-173 - 161) * d = -334 * d. So, the left side looks like -334*d - 238. The right side has -342*d + 154. Now our equation looks like: -334*d - 238 = -342*d + 154 2. The second step is to make all the 'd's together on one side. Let's move -342*d from the right side to the left side to join -334*d. We'll add 342*d to both sides. On the left side, (-334 + 342) * d = 8*d, and on the right side, -342*d + 342*d becomes 0. Now our equation looks like this: 8*d - 238 = 154 3. The last step is to find the value of 'd'. To do this, we need to move -238 from the left side to the right side. We'll add 238 to both sides. On the left side, -238 + 238 is 0, so we're left with 8*d on the left side. On the right side, 154 + 238 = 392. Now our equation looks like: 8*d = 392 To find the value of 'd', we need to divide both sides by 8: d = 392 / 8 4. Now we just need to find the result of 392 / 8: 392 divided by 8 is 49. So the answer is: d = 49 Great job! We found 'd' together! It's equal to 49."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: The Hunchback of Notre Dame Movie plot: On a street in Paris, during the Middle Ages, a Gypsy named Clopin performs puppet shows for children. Before starting his next show, he draws attention to the bells ringing in the nearby Cathedral of Notre Dame. He offers to tell the tale of the mysterious bell-ringer--who he is, and how he came to the cathedral:Twenty years ago, on a cold winter night, four Gypsies sneaked into Paris on a hired riverboat; the Gypsies were persecuted in Paris (and possibly all over France), so the only way to enter the city without being arrested was to sneak in. These particular Gypsies consisted of two men, one woman, and her child (it is implied that one of the men was the husband and father to the last two mentioned). Upon landing, however, the group was ambushed and arrested.The man leading the arrest was Judge Claude Frollo, the Minister of Justice. He is the primary instigator of the persecution and oppression against the Gypsies in Paris, claiming that their ways will corrupt the other citizens. He arrested the men, but when he ordered his troops to take the bundle in the woman's arms (mistakenly assuming them to be stolen goods), she ran. Though he was on horseback, she outmaneuvered him by using shortcuts too small for his horse. She made it to the doors of the Cathedral of Notre Dame to claim sanctuary, but because it was nighttime the doors were locked. Before they could be opened, Frollo caught up with her. He wrested the bundle from her grasp, kicking her while doing so; she fell back and hit her head on the stone steps, which killed her.The baby started to cry. When Frollo pulled back the cloth surrounding him, he gasped in horror, proclaiming the baby to be a monster (the baby is never shown). He nearly dropped the infant down a well, but he was stopped by the Archdeacon of the cathedral, who condemned his killing of the woman and his attempt to kill the baby. Though Frollo tried to justify his actions, deceiving himself, the Archdeacon reminded him that God, the angels, etc, are fully aware of what he had...

(A). yes; (B). no; Does \\"In 1807, Thomas Young was possibly the first to use the term \\"energy\\" instead of vis viva, in its modern sense.\\" correctly answer the question of When was the law of conservation of energy first postulated?","output":"No, the statement \\"In 1807, Thomas Young was possibly the first to use the term 'energy' instead of vis viva, in its modern sense\\" does not correctly answer the question of when the law of conservation of energy was first postulated. The statement only addresses the introduction of the term \\"energy\\" in its modern sense by Thomas Young. The law of conservation of energy, also known as the first law of thermodynamics, states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. To fully address this question, we need to discuss the various figures, concepts, and historical events that led to the development and understanding of the law of conservation of energy. The evolution of this law can be traced back to the works of several scientists and thinkers through history. 1. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716): Leibniz was a German mathematician and philosopher who introduced the concept of vis viva, or living force, arguing that the true measure of the mechanical force of a system is the product of its mass and the square of its velocity (mv^2). This concept laid the groundwork for the understanding of kinetic energy. 2. Émilie du Châtelet (1706-1749): A French mathematician and physicist, du Châtelet recognized that the concept of vis viva also applied to the conservation of energy in a mechanical system. She translated Newton's Principia Mathematica and expanded on Leibniz's work, further establishing the connection between vis viva and energy conservation. 3. Julius Robert von Mayer (1814-1878): A German physician and physicist, Mayer proposed the idea that heat and mechanical work are interconvertible forms of energy. In 1842, he published a paper stating that \\"Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, but merely changed from one form to another.\\" This statement can be considered the first clear articulation of the law of conservation of energy. 4. James Prescott Joule (1818-1889) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894): Joule, a British physicist, and Helmholtz, a German physicist, conducted independent experiments and developed mathematical descriptions of the energy conservation principle. Joule demonstrated the mechanical equivalent of heat through his famous \\"Joule's apparatus\\" experiment, while Helmholtz's work focused on the broader concept of energy conservation in various physical systems. 5. William Thomson (1824-1907), later known as Lord Kelvin: A British physicist who helped unify the different concepts of energy conservation into a coherent theory. Thomson contributed significantly to establishing thermodynamics and its laws, including his formulation of the second law of thermodynamics. Considering these historical milestones and contributions, the law of conservation of energy was developed and refined over several centuries through the work of many individuals. It does not have a specific date of postulation but evolved through continuous research and progress in the scientific community. However, if one needs to credit a specific scientist for stating the principle, Julius Robert von Mayer's work in 1842 stating that \\"Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, but merely changed from one form to another\\" could be considered the first clear articulation of the law of conservation of energy."},{"instruction":"Question: Information: - Archon apollinus, the false Apollo, is a species of butterfly belonging to the Parnassinae subfamily. - Archon apollinaris is a species of butterfly in the family Papilionidae.

At the same time, prosecutions and other sanctions have reached their highest rate. There has been a Welsh Government drive to cut abuse, and it says the rise is due to more incidents being reported. Last year 300 incidents resulted in prosecution or other action. The Welsh Government said that improved safety measures are in place to protect staff and it is making progress. Data shows that much of the abuse is carried out by patients with mental health problems like dementia and is unintentional. The figures were obtained by BBC Wales using the Freedom of Information Act and show that the reported violence has remained fairly static over six years despite targeted measures to tackle the problem. However, it was down this year, from 8,343 last year to 7,558. More than 9,000 incidents in the past four years resulted in injury to staff and led to thousands of days of work lost. The most serious assaults included more than 80 sexual assaults of staff at hospitals across Wales. A further 50 involved weapons. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board even had figures showing that since 2007, 258 members of staff had suffered abuse - either verbal or physical - at the hands of their co-workers. They said that around 60 were reported each year with most relating to claims of verbal abuse or perceived disruptive behaviour. A spokesman said: \\"While occasional disagreements will inevitably occur between colleagues, especially working in an environment that at times can be pressured and stressful, the fact that the number of incidents that are reported formally is so low shows that most of these are resolved at a local level.\\" Neil Evans, 40, is an A&E nurse at Bridgend's Princess of Wales Hospital. He says violence and aggression is a fact of life for most staff. \\"We do have a zero tolerance policy and there is a lot of support at our hospital. \\"The police do intervene but it would be good to have more feedback on how these people are being dealt with and if they are being prosecuted.\\" He says he has been threatened and almost punched a few times and colleagues do experience regular threats from drunken patients. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) applauded the work being done but questioned why some health boards are still referring so few cases to the police. Tina Donnelly, director of the RCN in Wales, said: \\"It is pleasing to see an increase in the number of prosecutions and the number of reported cases has increased due to a zero tolerance policy. \\"Our anecdotal evidence is that nurses in Wales are delighted things are changing as four years ago eight out of 10 reported being a victim of violence,\\" she added. In 2009 a cross-party group of AMs said aggression against NHS workers in Wales had been tackled with a \\"lack of urgency\\". CCTV was installed at four hospital A&E departments and in five ambulances, while thousands of lone workers were given panic buttons. Last December then Health Minister Edwina Hart launched a new drive with the NHS, the police, and the Crown Prosecution Service. But Dr Charles Allanby, a Cardiff GP who was been a victim of violence and once foiled a knife-wielding patient in his surgery, said more needs to be done to tackle the root cause - alcohol. He told BBC Wales: \\"Attacks on doctors or nurses are indefensible. \\"One does have to accept it's something you come across and is sometimes the result of people having mental health problems. \\"In A&E departments there is a clear association with alcohol and it is directly to do with the longer licensing hours. \\"People should be lobbying their councillors and local MPs to see this problem tackled.\\" His view was shared by the Welsh Ambulance Service, which saw attacks rise to 257 in 2010. A spokesman said the causes of violence are \\"societal\\". \\"Incidents experienced by ambulance crews are often associated with excessive alcohol consumption by the assailants. \\"We uphold a zero tolerance policy against this form of abuse and do our utmost to report this behaviour to the police to pursue prosecution against offenders.\\" The Welsh Government said that when the programme started in 2008, prosecutions were in single figures. In 2010-11 there were 126 successful prosecutions with some leading to custodial sentences. In addition, there were 143 other sanctions, such as fixed penalties and anti-social behaviour orders. A spokesperson said: \\"Case management is a key component of the Welsh Government's approach to protecting staff against violence and aggression, while supporting those who have been affected by it. \\"There is still much to do, but the early indicators are that, working together, we are making progress. \\"Pressure to reduce the risks of violence and aggression towards NHS staff will continue.\\" Reassurance Encouraging staff to report incidents is a key priority, the spokesperson said. In future hospitals in Wales are to try to reduce the levels of crime in their A&E departments through the use of better design. Cwm Taf Health Board said: \\"Whilst no prosecutions have been made, there has been a noticeable rise in reassurance and a reduction in the fear of crime in all staff groups.\\" It said there have been 75 incidents in which the police were involved and in the period April 2010 to March 2011 there were 13 Asbo referrals while there are two incidents currently under investigation by the police. Powys, which does not have any A&E units, said most incidents were connected with patients with mental health issues or elderly patients. \\"It should be noted that the number of incidents has fallen considerably in the last year or so despite an increased awareness amongst staff in terms of reporting.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"This article talks about a problem in Wales where hospital staff are facing violence and abuse. Many incidents have been reported, such as people using weapons or causing harm to the workers. The government is trying to make things better by having new safety rules and getting more people to tell about bad things happening. They are also trying to understand the reasons behind this problem, like patients with mental health issues or the role of alcohol. It is important to protect hospital staff and make them feel safe while they take care of the patients."},{"instruction":"Does the following sentence make sense? \\"Red vs. Blue lasted for several seasons.\\" Options: - yes - no Chain of thought and solution for this question is:","output":"Option: yes Chain of thought and solution for this question is: 1.

Here's a step by step breakdown: 1. Premise: \\"Toddler sitting in a swing at the park with a yellow sippy cup.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A young child is drinking milk on the swing.\\" 2. Compare components: a. Toddler vs. young child: Both terms refer to a child in a similar age group, so they are compatible. b. Swing at the park: Both the premise and hypothesis mention being on a swing; therefore, they are compatible. c. Yellow sippy cup vs. drinking milk: The premise mentions a \\"yellow sippy cup,\\" which suggests that the toddler has a beverage container, but it doesn't specify the contents. The hypothesis states that the child is \\"drinking milk.\\" 3. Analyze compatibility and entailment: The components related to the toddler's age and the swing location are compatible between the premise and the hypothesis. However, the premise does not explicitly mention the contents of the sippy cup, and therefore, we cannot determine for certain that the young child is drinking milk on the swing based solely on the information provided in the premise.

Set a good example. Be a guide for certain, and a friend if possible. Article:","output":"Title: Embracing the Journey of Continuous Improvement: A Simple Guide to Personal and Professional Success Introduction In the pursuit of personal and professional success, the mantra 'Do your best and ask for help when needed' serves as an empowering guiding principle that can not only harness individual growth, but also nurture the relationships that contribute to a supportive community. Together with other foundational elements—such as commitment to excellence, open-mindedness, and emotional intelligence—embracing this mindset can lead to transformative results, both for oneself and the world at large. 1. Do Your Best, at All Times Striving for excellence is the cornerstone of self-improvement. Doing your best at all times calls for dedication, persistence, and the desire to be the best version of oneself. It is important to set high standards while also being realistic about our current strengths, weaknesses, and circumstances. Aspire to push boundaries, challenge limiting beliefs, and break new ground. By developing a growth mindset, learning from past experiences, and capitalizing on opportunities while mitigating risks, one can truly unlock their full potential. 2. Ask for Help, and Be Willing to Receive It Despite our best intentions and efforts, there will always be instances when help is needed. Recognize that asking for help is not a sign of weakness—it is an essential part of learning and growth. Oftentimes, seeking advice or assistance from others can bridge gaps in skills, knowledge, and experience. It can also lead to new connections and collaborations, as well as enhance existing relationships. Reach out to mentors, peers, and experts, and embrace the collective wisdom that an inclusive, supportive community has to offer. 3. Keep Calm and Carry On Challenges and setbacks are inevitable. In the face of obstacles, it is essential to maintain a composed and clear-headed approach. Do not allow fear or panic to derail your progress or cloud your judgment. Instead, tap into your inner resilience, and draw upon lessons learned from previous adversities. Adopt constructive problem-solving strategies, and seek innovative solutions. Moreover, acknowledge when it is time to regroup and change course, as a flexible and adaptable mindset is vital for navigating the ever-changing landscape of life. 4. Set a Good Example, Inside and Out As we embark on our journey to self-actualization, it is crucial to both walk the talk and lead by example. Be a role model for others by demonstrating integrity, professionalism, and a genuine desire to uplift those around you. Magnetize your personal values and principles by actively engaging in meaningful activities, volunteering, or mentoring others. By embodying the qualities we aspire to cultivate, we not only foster our personal growth, but also positively impact the world around us. 5. Be a Guide for Certain, and a Friend if Possible Before transitioning from being a guide to a friend, establish trust and rapport with those you wish to uplift. Reach out, listen actively, and empathize without judgment. Encourage, challenge, and nurture personal growth by sharing insights and experiences. As a guide, maintain objectivity and focus on the greater good for all involved. Recognize the power of friendship as an added bonus—a valuable asset that can greatly impact both personal growth and professional advancement. Conclusion In conclusion, personal and professional success encompasses a multitude of interconnected elements—including dedication, humility, resilience, and compassion. By embracing a mindset that emphasizes continuous improvement and cherishes the support of others, individuals can embark on a journey of transformation that ultimately leads to personal fulfillment and far-reaching, positive consequences.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Entailment in linguistics refers to the relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence (the conclusion) is necessarily implied by the other (the premise). Meaning, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true. Looking at the provided sentences: Sentence 1: \\"uh-huh yeah oh um and how a five year old can grasp something like that is beyond is just a uh\\" Sentence 2: \\"I cannot understand how a five-year-old can understand that.\\" Sentence 1 seems to suggest that there might be some difficulty in understanding how a five-year-old could grasp a particular concept, implied by the phrase \\"is beyond.\\" However, the sentence doesn't clearly state that the speaker cannot understand how a five-year-old can understand a given concept. Furthermore, the speaker's thought is unfinished, as evidenced by the trailing \\"uh,\\" so we don't know the full extent of their view. Sentence 2, on the other hand, explicitly says that the speaker cannot understand how a five-year-old can understand something. This is not necessarily implied within Sentence 1. While Sentence 1 suggests that there might be some difficulty in understanding how a five-year-old could comprehend a certain concept, it doesn't firmly convey that the speaker is incapable of understanding it. Hence, the first sentence doesn't necessarily mean the speaker can't understand how a five-year-old can understand a concept, so it doesn't entail the second sentence. The two sentences may be related or could be part of the same conversation, but they don't have a relationship of entailment."},{"instruction":"One day after a mass shooting killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reiterated his support for a plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.

Hypothesis: A short man is on a horse that is jumping on a course. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"Step 1: Break down and analyze the premise and hypothesis. Premise: \\"A male jockey riding a horse as it vaults over an obstacle.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A short man is on a horse that is jumping on a course.\\" Step 2: Identify the common elements. - Both the premise and hypothesis involve a man riding a horse. - Both the premise and hypothesis involve the horse jumping/vaulting. Step 3: Analyze the differences. - The premise includes a \\"male jockey\\" while the hypothesis includes a \\"short man.\\" - The premise refers to an \\"obstacle,\\" while the hypothesis refers to a \\"course.\\" Step 4: Compare the differences to determine if the hypothesis follows from the premise. - Jockeys are typically short, so it's reasonable to assume that a male jockey could be a short man. However, the premise doesn't specifically state that the jockey is short. Therefore, while it's possible, it's not guaranteed based solely on the premise. - The premise mentions an obstacle, while the hypothesis refers to a course. In equestrian events, horses often jump over obstacles on a course. So, it's reasonable to assume that the obstacle mentioned in the premise is part of a course. Therefore, this element of the hypothesis is supported by the premise. Step 5: Make a conclusion. In conclusion, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true because the premise does not explicitly state that the male jockey is short. However, there is some overlap between the premise and hypothesis, meaning it's possible that the hypothesis could be true in the context of the premise."},{"instruction":"Is the premise \\"Men and women with matching suits and dresses standing behind a young man singing.\\" true if \\"There is a choir behind the singer.\\"?","output":"Yes, sweetie, the premise can be true if \\"there is a choir behind the singer.\\" Just imagine this: The men and women in matching suits and dresses are the choir members, and they're all standing behind the young man who is singing.
