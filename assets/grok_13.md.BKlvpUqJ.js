Jeff Flake's seat, made the suggestion in response to a Facebook post by a campaign aide.      According to screenshots of the conversation posted on Twitter by Arizona political reporters, the aide, Jonathan Williams, wondered if it was \\"just a coincidence\\" that the announcement of McCain ending medical treatment came the day Ward was launching a statewide bus tour, her big push before Tuesday's primary.      Ward replied: \\"I think they wanted to have a particular narrative that is negative to me.\\"      After her response was Tweeted out, Ward deleted the post and replaced it with one claiming the media was concocting a story.      \\"I've said again and again to pray for Senator McCain & his family,\\" Ward wrote. \\"These decisions are terrible to have to make.

Imagine you want to tell a computer what to do, like draw a picture or solve a math problem. A programming language helps you give those instructions in a way that the computer can understand. Just like people speak different languages, computers can understand different programming languages too. Now, let's answer your questions. First question: Since it is 2021 now, I will answer for this year. Right now, some popular programming languages are Python, JavaScript, and Java. The best one to learn can depend on what you want to do with it. For example, if you like making websites, JavaScript might be best, but if you like math or science, Python could be a better choice. Second question: For a beginner, Python is often the best programming language to learn because it is easy to understand and can be used for many different things. It's like a simple language you can learn before trying harder languages. Your last question asks if the first two questions are the same. The answer is \\"no\\" because: - The first question asks, \\"What is the best programming language for 2016?\\", which could vary based on popular languages and demand in 2016. - The second question asks, \\"What is the best programming language for a beginner?\\", which focuses on easy-to-learn languages that are good for someone new to programming.

The reason Michael did not cook noodles is that he was preparing a lasagna dish, which typically consists of layers of pasta, ricotta cheese, and a mixture of ground meat and tomato sauce, all baked together in the oven. In this case, Michael chose to use no-boil lasagna noodles, which are designed to soften and cook as the lasagna bakes, eliminating the need to pre-cook them. In contrast, Randy was cooking a different recipe that required cooked noodles as part of the dish's preparation. This could be anything from a simple pasta dish with sauce, vegetables, and protein to a more complex recipe such as baked ziti or stuffed shells. The process involved cooking the noodles first before combining them with the rest of the ingredients, ensuring a balanced and consistent texture throughout the dish. It is essential to follow a recipe's instructions when it comes to pre-cooking pasta, as the outcome and final texture of the dish can be greatly affected by this step. Undercooked pasta can result in a chewy, unappetizing texture, while overcooked pasta might become mushy and easily broken during the assembly and final cooking process. This scenario highlights the importance of understanding the ingredients and the appropriate preparation techniques required for different dishes. While both Randy and Michael were utilizing noodles as a primary component in their respective recipes, the difference in their final output and cooking methods demonstrates how versatile pasta can be in creating a wide variety of delicious meals. In summary, Randy cooked noodles for his recipe, while Michael chose not to because of the specific requirements of the lasagna dish he was preparing. This exemplifies the significance of carefully following a recipe and being aware of the distinct ways pasta may be used as the cornerstone of a meal."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: In the US, the most popular way to welcome the new year is with a big party.

My husband and I are staying at Plaza Hotel for 2 days and figured we'd try Zaba's for breakfast. 5.99 seemed a pretty reasonable price for a breakfast burrito, however the grumpy girl behind the glass partition assembling our burritos informed us, after she'd started our food, that meat was an additional 1.99.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).  - A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as web comics. There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes.  - Guy Berkeley \`\` Berke '' Breathed ( / brðd / BREDH - d ; born June 21 , 1957 ) is an American cartoonist , children 's book author / illustrator , director and screenwriter , best known for Bloom County , a 1980s cartoon - comic strip that dealt with sociopolitical issues as understood by fanciful characters ( e.g. , Bill the Cat and Opus the Penguin ) and through humorous analogies . Bloom County earned Breathed the Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning in 1987 .  - The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia.  - The Pulitzer Prize is an award for achievements in newspaper, magazine and online journalism, literature, and musical composition in the United States. It was established in 1917 by provisions in the will of American (Hungarian-born) Joseph Pulitzer who had made his fortune as a newspaper publisher, and is administered by Columbia University in New York City. Prizes are awarded yearly in twenty-one categories. In twenty of the categories, each winner receives a certificate and a US15,000 cash award (raised from 10,000 starting in 2017). The winner in the public service category of the journalism competition is awarded a gold medal.  - The Daily Texan is the student newspaper of the University of Texas at Austin. It is entirely student-run and independent from the university (although its operations are overseen by an entity with faculty, student, and newspaper industry representatives). It is one of the largest college newspapers in the United States, with a daily circulation of roughly 30,000 during the fall and spring semesters, and it is among the oldest student newspapers in the South. The \\"Texan\\" has won more national, regional and state awards than any other college newspaper in America and counts 10 Pulitzer Prize winners among its former staff.  - A newspaper is a serial publication containing news about current events, other informative articles (listed below) about politics, sports, arts, and so on, and advertising. A newspaper is usually, but not exclusively, printed on relatively inexpensive, low-grade paper such as newsprint. The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers. As of 2017, most newspapers are now published online as well as in print. The online versions are called online newspapers or news websites. Newspapers are typically published daily or weekly. News magazines are also weekly, but they have a magazine format. General-interest newspapers typically publish news articles and feature articles on national and international news as well as local news. The news includes political events and personalities, business and finance, crime, weather, and natural disasters; health and medicine, science, and computers and technology; sports; and entertainment, society, food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and the arts.   - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.

It was established in 1754 as King's College by royal charter of George II of Great Britain. Columbia is the oldest college in the state of New York and the fifth chartered institution of higher learning in the country, making it one of nine colonial colleges founded before the Declaration of Independence. After the American Revolutionary War, King's College briefly became a state entity, and was renamed Columbia College in 1784. A 1787 charter placed the institution under a private board of trustees before it was renamed Columbia University in 1896 when the campus was moved from Madison Avenue to its current location in Morningside Heights occupying of land. Columbia is one of the fourteen founding members of the Association of American Universities, and was the first school in the United States to grant the M.D. degree.  - A cartoonist (also comic strip creator) is a visual artist who specializes in drawing cartoons. This work is often created for entertainment, political commentary, or advertising. Cartoonists may work in many formats, such as animation, booklets, comic strips, comic books, editorial cartoons, graphic novels, manuals, gag cartoons, graphic design, illustrations, storyboards, posters, shirts, books, advertisements, greeting cards, magazines, newspapers, and video game packaging.  - The Academia Waltz was Berkeley Breathed's first cartoon, published daily from 1978 to 1979 in \\"The Daily Texan\\" at The University of Texas at Austin, where he was a student. The strip focused primarily on college life, although it sometimes made references to big news stories of the time (such as the Three Mile Island accident in 1979).  - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts  such as songwriter  but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition.  - Bloom County is an American comic strip by Berkeley Breathed which originally ran from December 8, 1980, until August 6, 1989. It examined events in politics and culture through the viewpoint of a fanciful small town in Middle America, where children often have adult personalities and vocabularies and where animals can talk. It originated from a comic strip known as \\"The Academia Waltz\\", which Breathed produced for the student newspaper, \\"The Daily Texan\\", while attending the University of Texas.  - Joseph Pulitzer (born József Pulitzer; April 10, 1847  October 29, 1911) was a Hungarian-American newspaper publisher of the \\"St. Louis Post Dispatch\\" and the \\"New York World\\".

Question: how does an earthworm eat & digests food.? Would \\"At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis , which are waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall.\\" be a reasonable answer? Select from:  A). No  B). Yes Answer:","output":"A). No An earthworm's digestive process is different from the process described in the statement. While peristalsis does play a role in the movement of food through the earthworm's body, there are more specific steps involved in their eating and digestion process that should be included in any explanation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the earthworm's digestive process: 1. Ingestion: The earthworm ingests organic matter, soil, and microorganisms through its mouth. 2. Pharynx: The ingested material is passed into the pharynx, which generates suction to help pull the material into the digestive tract. 3. Esophagus: The food enters the esophagus, which secretes calcium carbonate to regulate pH levels inside the earthworm's gut. This helps with digestion. 4. Crop: Next, the food moves into the crop, where it is temporarily stored. 5. Gizzard: The material then enters the gizzard, where strong muscular contractions grind the soil and organic material into smaller particles. 6. Intestine: The food now enters the intestine where digestive enzymes break down the organic matter, making nutrients available for absorption. 7. Absorption: Nutrients are absorbed into the earthworm's bloodstream through the intestinal walls. 8. Excretion: The undigested material, such as small pieces of soil, is excreted through the anus as castings. In summary, while peristalsis aids in the movement of food through an earthworm's body, the actual processes, stages, and functions of digestion are more complex than what is described in the given statement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These stories included tales of monsters and other incredible creatures. What type of creature do you know that could inspire such stories? Of course, dinosaur fossils were once mistaken for dragons bones. Two thousand years ago, people discovered fossils in China. At the time, they were thought to be dragon bones.

Question: \\"What did these stories consist of?\\" Answer: \\"Earth\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer provided is not correct. The correct answer would be something like this: These stories often consisted of myths and legends about giant creatures or monsters that were believed to have once roamed the Earth. The discovery of unusual fossil remains sparked the imagination of ancient people, leading to the creation of tales about dragons, griffins, and other fantastical creatures. The awe-inspiring size and appearance of these fossils fueled these stories, with many ancient cultures attempting to interpret the meaning behind these findings within the context of their beliefs and understanding of the world. In some cases, these stories served as cautionary tales or allegorical lessons, while in other instances, they were integrated into the belief systems and folklore of the civilizations that encountered the fossils. As our modern understanding of paleontology has developed, we can now appreciate that these stories were early attempts to comprehend the vast and diverse history of life on Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which ocean is probably connected to less oceans with higher salinities?  The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean. This isn't much information, but it's progress and the scientists are not going to stop their studies until they learn all that they can about these waters.  Hint: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, the Madrigal Ocean is probably connected to less oceans with higher salinities. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that the Madrigal Ocean has a much lower salinity than the Listy Ocean, similar to the Arctic Ocean on Earth. The Arctic Ocean's lower salinity is attributed to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. It is reasonable to assume that a similar situation might apply to the Madrigal Ocean, causing its salinity to be lower as well."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When people cheat, it's not fair to other people, like the kids who studiedfor the test or who were the true winners of a game. Many people like the action of cheating. It makes difficult things seem easy, like getting all the right answers on the test. But it doesn't solve the problem of not knowing the material and it won't help on the next test --- unless the person cheats again. Some people lose respect for cheaters and think less of them. The cheaters themselves may feel bad because they know they are not really earning that good grade. And, if they get caught cheating, they will be in trouble at school, and maybe at home, too. Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating. Even when there seems to be a \\"good reason\\" for cheating, cheating isn't a good idea. If you were sick or upset about something the night before and couldn't study, it would be better to talk with the teacher about this. And if you don't have enough time to study for a test because of swim practice, you need to talk with your parents about how to balance swimming and school.

I've heard nothing but great things about the 2006 television mini-series, \\"Planet Earth,\\" narrated by my childhood idol David Attenborough. Nevertheless, whether it was screened down here in Australia or not, I never caught up with it, and when I happened upon the opportunity to see 'Earth (2007)'  a feature-length compilation of the same nature footage  on the big screen, I jumped at the chance. The theatre was basically empty; just one other patron sat in the row ahead of me, and it was as though I had, not only the big screen to myself, but, indeed, the entire planet Earth. For 90 minutes, I was lowered into the beauty and perils of the isolated wilderness, amongst some of the most beautiful living creatures ever captured on film. Awesome in its scope, and yet painfully intimate at times, 'Earth' is a heartfelt plea from the filmmakers to recognise the delicate balance of life on our planet, and how the intrusion of humans has placed countless glorious animal and plant species on the brink of extinction. Though the film, directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield, obviously argues for the conservation of the wilderness, it refrains from beating us over the head with propaganda, and the puzzle that is politics is ignored altogether; indeed, there is not a human in sight. Instead, we are simply taken on a breathtaking journey into the majesty of the natural world, to experience the resilience, and also the fragility, of life on Earth. I hear that the original mini-series, which ran for eleven episodes, delves a lot deeper into the scientific background of world ecosystems, but I think that, here, the filmmakers made a wise decision to replace information with emotional impact: I can't remember the last time that I felt so inspired, and yet utterly heartbroken at the same time. By establishing an emotional link between the audience and a select few individual animals, anthropomorphising them to an extent, we are suddenly able to appreciate the \\"human side\\" of each species, and their hopeless plight for survival becomes less a statistic and more an unacceptable tragedy. 'Earth' is basically comprised of a selection of dramatic episodes, whether it be the struggles of a female polar bear to lead her young cubs to the Arctic ice, or the tramp of an elephant herd towards the life-saving seasonal floodwaters of the Okavango Delta. The documentary demonstrates the delicate balance between life and death, most heartbreakingly exhibited in the desperate ballet of predator-prey interactions. Though occasionally, perhaps to cater towards a younger audience, the footage cuts itself short at the crucial moment, I regularly shed at tear at the inevitability of death in nature, and the raw instinct that fuels these animals' final, hopeless efforts at survival. There's even a haunting beauty to be found in the hunt, both in the slow-motion footage of a cheetah bringing down its prey {the result of a single fateful misstep}, or the majestic mid-air leap of a Great White Shark as it engulfs a hapless sea lion. It is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own species. Aside from these main stories, we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world, including the birds of paradise of Papua New Guinea, and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes. Of course, entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone, and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly. By choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear, elephant and humpback whale  tracing their lifestyles, via some astonishing high-definition time-lapse photography, throughout a calender year  the filmmakers were able to avoid any structural problems that might arise from having so much to show, and only 90 minutes to show it. Consequently, 'Earth' left me thirsting for more, and, fortunately, I now have approximately eleven hours more, as soon as I can track down a copy of the DVD box-set for \\"Planet Earth.\\" Uplifting and tear-jerking, awe-inspiring and heartrending, 'Earth' is a truly magnificent documentary experience, and it might just be my favourite film of 2007.

We need to find the value of \\"y.\\" To do this, we need to put all the terms with \\"y\\" on one side of the equation and all the numbers on the other side. Let's start by simplifying the numbers: We got -8555 + 2155, which are different signs. To add them, we subtract the smaller number from the larger one like this: 8555 - 2155 = 6400. Since -8555 is negative, our answer is -6400. Now, we have -191*y - 6400 - 13970 = 100*y Next, add the numbers on the left side: -6400 - 13970 = -20370 So now we have -191*y - 20370 = 100*y Now, we need to move the \\"100*y\\" from the right side to the left side. To do that, we'll subtract \\"100*y\\" from both sides: -191*y - 100*y = 20370 This combines to: -291*y = 20370 Almost there! Now we need to solve for \\"y.\\" To do this, we'll divide both sides by -291: y = 20370 / -291 Now, when we divide 20370 by 291, we get -70. So, y = -70. That's the answer!

Here is a news article: President Donald Trump walks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi at the White House in Washington, Monday, April 3, 2017. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Associated Press) President Donald Trump walks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi at the White House in Washington, Monday, April 3, 2017. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Archives and Records Administration has told the White House to keep each of President Donald Trump's tweets, even those he deletes or corrects, and the White House has agreed.      The head of the archives, David S. Ferriero, told two Democratic senators in a letter last week that the White House has assured him it's saving all Trump's Twitter blasts.      The archives contacted the White House about the matter because the Presidential Records Act requires such correspondence to be preserved for history. Ferriero did not say when the agency contacted White House officials to remind them about the records requirement, but officials briefed the White House counsel's office about the law on Feb. 2, according to the archivist's letter to Sens. Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Tom Carper of Delaware.      The archivist's letter, dated March 30, doesn't describe precisely how the White House is saving Trump's tweets. The Obama administration used an automated system to isolate and preserve copies of President Barack Obama's tweets.      McCaskill and Carper raised the issue of Trump's tweets in early March following a spate of instances in which the president had deleted or altered earlier tweets. The two senators had previously raised concerns about Trump's tweets in a letter to White House counsel Don McGahn.      The two senators also pressed the archives for information about reports that some White House staffers had been ordered to avoid emails or use smartphone apps that do not preserve emails because of Trump administration concerns about leaks to the media.      Ferriero told them he was aware of those press reports but said that White House guidance \\"to all employees expressly forbids the use of such apps.\\" Ferriero also said he was not aware of government officials who have been instructed to avoid using email as a method of work-related communication.      Trump's almost-daily use of his official White House Twitter account and his separate private Twitter account has been heavily scrutinized by the media and by political friends and foes since his November election and even more so since his inauguration.      Three minutes before he took the oath of office in January, Trump tweeted from his private account that he was \\"honered to serve you, the great American people, as your 45th President of the United States.\\" The misspelled word in the tweet was later altered to \\"honored\\" and then the tweet was deleted entirely.      Unlike the archives' clear guidance on saving Trump's tweets, the agency has not provided any guidance to government agencies about preserving communications to and from Trump's smartphones and agencies have not requested guidance, Ferriero said.      The two senators raised concerns with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis about whether communications from Trump's old smartphone were being preserved. Trump reportedly replaced his old unsecured Android smartphone with a secured iPhone but continued using the unsecured phone for tweeting through late March.      The senators had also written to McGahn in February, asking about reports that at least four senior Trump White House officials \\"maintained active email accounts on a private email system.\\" Newsweek had reported in January that senior adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, chief strategist Steve Bannon, counselor Kellyanne Conway and press secretary Sean Spicer all were using private email accounts on a Republican National Committee system.      Trump repeatedly criticized Democratic president opponent Hillary Clinton for her extensive use of private emails when she was secretary of state in the Obama administration.      According to an agenda of the Feb. 2 briefing with White House officials, archives general counsel Gary M. Stern and John Laster, director of the agency's presidential materials division, explained that the president and White House counsel were \\"solely responsible for managing presidential records.\\"      The role of the archives, they added, is mostly advisory, but presidential records can only be disposed of after the White House consults the archivist in writing. ||||| The National Archives has advised the White House to save all of President Trump's tweets, even the ones he deletes, according to a letter the agency sent to two Democratic senators.      \\"[The National Archives and Records Administration] has advised the White House that it should capture and preserve all tweets that the president posts in the course of his official duties, including those that are subsequently deleted, as presidential records,\\" Archivist of the United States David S. Ferriero wrote in a letter to Sens. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Tom Carper, D-Del.      Ferriero also wrote that White House officials have informed the National Archives that they \\"are, in fact, doing so,\\" but did not detail the process for doing so.      McCaskill and Carper, who sit on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, sent a letter to the National Archives March 7 over concerns about whether the Trump administration was complying with the Presidential Records Act of 1978, which requires the United States to preserve presidential records.      The National Archives briefed the White House counsel's office on the records act in February, and has since been in communication with the office on a \\"regular basis,\\" the letter states.      The Presidential Records Act \\"places the responsibility for the custody and management\\" of records with the president. The National Archives can only advise the Office of the Counsel in collecting presidential records.      If President Trump wants to dispose of any of his records that \\"no longer have administrative, historical, informational or evidentiary value,\\" he would have to first consult with Ferriero and obtain his written views.      President Trump has two Twitter accounts -- @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS – from which he posts regularly. McCaskill, Carper and other critics are concerned that Trump may be violating the Presidential Records Act when he deletes tweets.      One such example came on Inauguration Day when Trump tweeted and deleted, \\"I am honered to serve you, the great American People, as your 45th President of the United States!\\"      He then posted another tweet immediately after with the same wording, but correctly spelling \\"honored.\\"      House Oversight Committee leaders also sent a letter March 9 to the White House counsel's office, asking for more details on how it's conducting the records preservation.      The White House did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has instructed the White House to keep all of President Donald Trump's tweets, including those he deletes or corrects. In response to a letter from two Democratic senators, NARA confirmed that the White House has agreed to save all of Trump's Twitter messages.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"To analyze the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"Pat cured of pneumonia,\\" I'll go through the following steps: 1. Identify the components of the sentence: In this sentence, we have a subject \\"Pat,\\" a verb \\"cured,\\" and a prepositional phrase \\"of pneumonia.\\" 2. Examine the subject: The subject \\"Pat\\" is clear and functions correctly as a person's name. 3. Examine the verb: The verb \\"cured\\" suggests that someone's condition has been treated or resolved. However, based on the given information, we cannot determine who cured Pat. There might be a passive voice mismatch. 4. Examine the prepositional phrase: The preposition \\"of\\" alongside the noun \\"pneumonia\\" indicates the condition Pat had. However, it should be connected to the verb more clearly in a passive voice construction or rephrased to show the action being performed on the subject. 5. Assess clarity and coherence: The intended meaning of the sentence is somewhat understandable. Pat had pneumonia, and now they are cured. However, the sentence is not grammatically correct, and it could be restructured for better clarity. Considering these steps, the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"Pat cured of pneumonia\\" is not strong. A better alternative would be \\"Pat was cured of pneumonia\\" or \\"Pat has been cured of pneumonia.\\" Both alternatives provide a clear passive voice construction by adding \\"was\\" and \\"has been\\" before the verb \\"cured,\\" specifying that an action was performed on Pat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So, you want to know how to prepare the fruit for a traditional sangria and which method is more reasonable. First, let me explain what sangria is. Sangria is a yummy drink that comes from Spain. It has wine, fruit, and some other sweet ingredients mixed together. Now, here's how you prepare the fruit for sangria: 1. Pick some yummy fruits like oranges, lemons, apples, and berries. 2. Ask an adult to help you wash the fruits so they are clean and safe to eat. 3. The adult can also help you cut the fruits into small pieces, so they can fit in a glass. Now, let's look at the two methods you mentioned, and we'll see which one is more reasonable. Method A: 1. Squeeze the juice from the fruits and mix it into the wine. Method B: 1. Chop the fruit into small pieces and add them to the wine. For a traditional sangria, Method B is more reasonable. Little pieces of fruit make the drink look more colorful and fun, and they also help add extra flavor to the sangria. When you drink it, you'll also get some yummy fruit in your glass to eat! Remember to ask an adult for help when making sangria since it has alcohol (wine) in it, which is not for kids.

Computer systems in the county's GP surgeries are currently switched off so the virus can be dealt with. Kieran Sharrock, medical director of the Lincolnshire Local Medical Committee (LMC), said patients should only visit their GP in an emergency. Some hospital appointments have also been suspended. More on this and other local stories in Lincolnshire Lincolnshire LMC represents about 450 GPs at 100 practices across the county. Dr Sharrock, a GP in Spilsby, said: \\"We don't have access to any medical records, prescriptions, blood test or X-ray results, so if people are coming for routine appointments, for follow-ups or for a new problem which isn't urgent or an emergency, we're asking for them to postpone that.\\" The NHS has issued advice about the possibility of further cyber-attacks at GP surgeries if computers are switched on before updates are applied. Lincolnshire is one of seven NHS trusts, out of the 47 that were hit, that is still facing serious issues. Routine hospital appointments in Lincoln, Boston and Grantham have also been suspended. However, chemotherapy treatments and antenatal appointments are going ahead as planned. One patient affected by the attack is Steve Helmer, from Nettleham, near Lincoln, who is awaiting test results to see if he has lung cancer. He said: \\"If I've got cancer and I've got to have chemotherapy my life is going to be cocked-up until either the chemotherapy ends, or the inevitable,\\" he said. However, he said the worst part was not knowing.

The two cities had a similar population and vehicle numbers.  But I can use this background: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products.  What is an answer for this question: Which city had more problems with carbon monoxide? The answer is:","output":"Berg city had more problems with carbon monoxide due to the exclusive use of gasoline-powered vehicles in the city. To provide a thorough explanation for this answer, let's break down the components of the situation and the background information given. We'll then analyze why Berg city faced more issues with carbon monoxide compared to Hill city. 1. Berg city utilized only gas-powered vehicles, while Hill city used electric vehicles. Gasoline-powered vehicles rely on internal combustion engines, which burn gasoline or petrol to generate power. During this process, a number of harmful materials, such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and volatile hydrocarbons, are emitted as by-products. These substances pose various environmental and health concerns, including air pollution, smog formation, and respiratory problems. Conversely, electric vehicles use electricity stored in batteries to power electric motors. While electric vehicles still contribute to pollution indirectly (through the production of electricity, which might involve burning fossil fuels), they emit no tailpipe emissions, meaning they do not produce the same harmful by-products as gasoline-powered vehicles. 2. Both cities had similar population sizes and vehicle numbers. With an equal population size and a similar number of vehicles in each city, we can infer that the total emissions generated by the vehicles will be relatively proportional to the type of vehicles being used exclusively in each city. 3. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons in gasoline-powered vehicles. As mentioned in the background information, carbon monoxide is produced when hydrocarbons in gasoline are not fully combusted within a vehicle's engine. The catalytic converter in the exhaust system helps minimize the release of some of these harmful substances by converting them into less harmful products. However, despite the presence of catalytic converters, gas-powered vehicles still emit a considerable amount of carbon monoxide, which leads to various environmental and health issues. Conversely, electric vehicles do not emit any carbon monoxide from their tailpipes since they do not use an internal combustion engine. Conclusion: Given that Berg city exclusively used gas-powered vehicles, which are known for producing carbon monoxide as a by-product of combustion, it is highly likely that Berg city faced more problems with carbon monoxide in comparison to Hill city, where electric vehicles were predominantly used. The lack of tailpipe emissions from electric vehicles in Hill city attributes to a significant reduction in carbon monoxide pollution, leading to a cleaner and healthier environment for its residents."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Fact 1: An electric stove transforms electrical energy to heat energy.  Fact 2: For example, it takes energy to boil water on the stove.  Given the two facts above, how do electric stoves boil water?","output":"To explain how electric stoves boil water, I will provide a step-by-step breakdown: 1. Connect to a power source: When an electric stove is plugged into an electrical outlet or connected to the home's electrical system, it is supplied with electrical energy. 2. Electrical energy is converted to heat energy: Electric stoves have heating elements, usually made of metal coils, that transform electrical energy into heat energy. This conversion occurs through a process called Joule heating. When electric current flows through the resistance of the metal coil, it generates heat. 3. Heat transfer through conduction: The heat produced by the metal coil is transferred to the surface of the stove. This transfer is achieved through a process called conduction, where the heat flows from the high-temperature metal coil to the cooler stove surface, equalizing the temperature difference. 4. Heating the cookware: When you place a pot or a pan containing water on the heated stove surface, the cookware absorbs the heat energy via conduction. It is essential to use cookware that is compatible with electric stoves, as the materials and design of the cookware can impact the efficiency of heat transfer. 5. Water temperature increases: As the cookware heats up, it transfers the heat energy to the water inside through conduction. The water molecules absorb this heat, causing them to move faster and increase the temperature of the water. 6. Boiling water: When the water reaches its boiling point (100°C or 212°F at sea level), it starts to vaporize. This means that the water molecules gain enough energy to break free from their liquid state and form steam. When you see bubbles forming and rising in the water, it indicates that the water has reached or is nearing its boiling point. In conclusion, electric stoves boil water by converting electrical energy into heat energy, which is transferred through conduction to the cookware and eventually to the water, raising its temperature until it boils."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: While success is surely sweeter than failure, it seems failure is a far better teacher, and organizations that fail spectacularly often flourish more in the long run, according to a new study by Vinit Desai, assistant professor of management at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. Researchers have found that people missing their goals perform much better in the long run. That is because they gain more knowledge from their failures than their successes and the lessons are more likely to stay longer in their minds. \\"We found that the knowledge gained from success was often fleeting while knowledge from failure stuck around for years,\\" said professor Desai, who led the study. \\"But companies often ignore failure. Managers may fire people or turn over the whole workforce while they should treat the failure as a learning opportunity.\\" Prof Desai compared the flights of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Challenger. During the 2002 Atlantis flight, a piece of insulation   broke off and damaged the left solid rocket booster   but didn't influence the program. There was little investigation. The Challenger was launched next and another piece of insulation broke off. This time the shuttle and its seven-person crew were destroyed. The disaster led to a major investigation resulting in 29 changes to prevent future disasters. The difference in response in the two cases came down to this: Atlantis was considered a success and the Challenger a failure. \\"Despite crowded skies, airlines are extremely reliable,\\" he said. \\"The number of failures is extremely small. And past researches have shown that older airlines, those with more experience in failure, have a lower number of accidents.\\" Prof Desai doesn't recommend finding out failure in order to learn. Instead, he advises organizations to analyze small failures to collect useful information rather than wait for major failures.

The Simba pack was ambushing wounded individual prey animals, while the Mobutu pack followed large groups of zebras and other grazers.  and a hint : Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator.

April 1, 2006 Walter died today. Found out this morning over breakfast. Suicide. Walter. I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it. Suicide. Walter wasn't suicidal. I know that, know it for a fact. But he is dead. Why? I am not foolish enough to suspect \\"foul play\\" as they say in the mystery stories. No one cares enough about a community college art teacher to murder him. But suicide? Something is wrong here. Very wrong. April 2, 2006 I didn't realize until this morning that yesterday was April Fools day. Some kind of sick joke? But that's not like Walter either.

Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life. It must be something with women to be able to make that kind of spontaneous connection. I just shook her hand, and told her I was sorry. I don't make a habit of crying in public, but seeing her so shaken up brought tears to the edges of my eyes, and I did nothing to wipe them away.

Sentence from a movie review: in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness  Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"Based on the given sentence from the movie review, it is evident that the movie was seen negatively by the reviewer. The negative aspects mentioned in the sentence, such as \\"failed jokes,\\" \\"twitchy acting,\\" and \\"general boorishness,\\" all indicate that the reviewer found the film to be unsuccessful in various aspects of its execution. The phrase \\"failed jokes\\" implies that the movie might have attempted to be funny or witty, but the humor did not come across effectively or was simply not amusing. This could be due to weak writing, poor direction, or ineffective timing, any of which can make the comedic elements fail to generate the intended laughter or amusement. In addition to the comedic issues, the mention of \\"twitchy acting\\" in the review suggests that the performances from the actors were subpar. It implies that the actors might have been overly expressive or unconvincing in their roles. This may have tarnished the movie's credibility or prevented the audience from connecting with the characters emotionally. If the acting appears forced or unnatural, it can significantly detract from the quality of the film and make it hard for the viewer to engage with the story. Lastly, the reviewer's mention of \\"general boorishness\\" is a broad critique of the movie's overall tone, indicating that it likely came across as rude, crude, or unpleasant. If the movie displayed an excessive crudeness in its content, tone, or presentation, it might have alienated viewers who expected a more enjoyable or thought-provoking experience. This could be a result of vulgar language, offensive themes, or objectionable behavior from the characters. General boorishness, as a criticism, can often overshadow other aspects of the film such as plot or character development, further contributing to a negative viewing experience. In conclusion, the sentence from the movie review paints a clear picture of a film that was negatively perceived by the reviewer. The combination of failed jokes, twitchy acting, and general boorishness indicates that the movie failed to engage the viewer effectively or offer an enjoyable experience. These critiques highlight the movie's main drawbacks in terms of its humor, acting, and overall tone, suggesting that it was not a well-received piece of cinema by the reviewer who penned this statement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Modern criticism of Pope focuses on the man, his circumstances and motivations, prompted by theoretical perspectives such as Marxism, feminism and other forms of post-structuralism. Brean Hammond focuses on Pope's singular achievement in making an independent living solely from his writing. Laura Brown (1985) adopts a Marxist approach and accuses Pope of being an apologist for the oppressive upper classes. Hammond (1986) has studied Pope's work from the perspectives of cultural materialism and new historicism. Along Hammond's lines, Raymond Williams explains art as a set of practices influenced by broad cultural factors rather than simply the vague ideas of genius alone. Hayden Carruth, wrote that it was \\"Pope's rationalism and pandeism with which he wrote the greatest mock-epic in English literature.\\" In Politics and Poetics of Transgression (1985) Peter Stallybrass and Allon White charge that Pope drew upon the low culture which he despised in order to produce his own \\"high art\\". They assert Pope was implicated in the very material he was attempting to exclude, not dissimilar to observations made in Pope's time. Colin Nicholson reads the poetry in terms of the Financial Revolution, showing how Pope responded to the corruption of the traditional 'landed interest' by the newly dominant 'moneyed interest'. Feminists have also criticised Pope's works. Ellen Pollak's The Poetics of Sexual Myth (1985) argues that Pope followed an anti-feminist tradition, that regarded women as inferior to men both intellectually and physically. Carolyn Williams contends that a crisis in the male role during the 18th century in Britain impacted Pope and his writing.  After reading the above, is \\"Laura Brown and Ellen Pollak,\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who are Pope's critics?\\"?","output":"Yes, Laura Brown and Ellen Pollak are two of Pope's critics mentioned in the passage.

If they’ve been opened, place the hot dogs into a plastic food storage bag that has a zipper. Make sure the hot dogs are airtight so that the cool water doesn’t touch the food. You don’t want the water to touch the hot dogs for food safety purposes. The hot dogs or the water could become contaminated, so it’s best to avoid this risk. You don’t need to be precise about temperature, but the water should feel cool to the touch. It’s generally safe to use the coolest setting on your tap. Add enough water to the bowl or dish to cover the hot dogs you want to defrost. If you're thawing multiple packs of hot dogs, it's best to place them in separate dishes so they defrost faster. Place the hot dogs into the bowl or dish and push them beneath the cool water. Make sure they’re totally covered. Leave them to sit on the counter at room temperature. Set a timer for 30 minutes so you can check on them. The hot dogs should stay at the bottom of the bowl or dish because they are heavy. However, they may float if there is air in your bag. If this happens, squeeze out the air and put your hot dogs back in the water. Pour the used water down the sink. Then, feel the hot dogs through the packaging to see if they feel thawed. If they don’t, add more cool water back to the bowl or dish. Set the timer for another 30 minutes.  Thawed hot dogs should feel squishy and a little flexible. Additionally, they’ll feel cool and not cold. Your hot dogs may thaw in 30 minutes, but it’s likely that they’ll take an hour if you’re thawing a whole pack or multiple packs. After another 30 minutes, pour the used water down the sink and check your hot dogs to see if they’re thawed. When they feel thaw, start cooking them. If they still feel frozen, cover them with cool water again. Then, set your timer for 30 minutes. You can do this safely for up to 2 hours or until your hot dogs are thawed. Typically, hot dogs will defrost within 1 hour. immediately after thawing them in cool water. While this is a safer method than using your microwave, you still need to cook your hot dogs immediately. Cool water doesn’t keep the hot dogs below 40 °F (4 °C), which means that bacteria may start growing. Cook your hot dogs immediately to kill the bacteria. For instance, grill, boil, roast, or microwave your hot dogs.","output":"The text provides a detailed process of thawing hot dogs safely and efficiently. If the hot dogs are still in their factory-sealed package, they can remain there throughout the process. However, if opened, they should be sealed in a zip-lock plastic food storage bag. The bag should be airtight to prevent cool water from coming into direct contact with the hot dogs, which could lead to contamination.   The temperature of the water used isn't critical, but it should be cool to the touch. The text advises using the coolest setting on your tap. The plastic bag-enclosed hot dogs should be submerged in a bowl or dish filled with enough water to cover them completely. If defrosting multiple packs, they should be placed in separate bowls or dishes for faster defrosting.   The hot dogs should be left in the water to thaw on a kitchen counter at room temperature. They must be checked after 30 minutes with the help of a timer. If the hot dogs float due to air in the bag, you should squeeze out the air and re-submerge them. After the 30 minutes, the water should be discarded.   The hot dogs should then be checked to see if they have thawed. This can be done by feeling their packaging to determine if the hot dogs have become squishy and slightly flexible, while also remaining cool. If they are not thawed, you should repeat the process in another 30-minute interval. This process can be carried out safely for up to two hours or until the hot dogs are completely thawed. However, hot dogs typically defrost within an hour.   Once thawed, it is important to cook the hot dogs immediately, as the water used for defrosting does not keep them below 40 °F (4 °C), a temperature at which bacteria may start to grow.

No;","output":"b. No While it is true that the Phylum Platyhelminthes belongs to the kingdom Animalia, making them animals, the question \\"Phylum Platyhelminthes are mostly what?\\" is specifically asking about their lifestyle or ecological role. In this context, the correct answer would be \\"parasitic.\\" Phylum Platyhelminthes, commonly known as flatworms, are a group of soft-bodied invertebrate animals that includes various species, such as tapeworms, flukes, and planarians. The majority of these species are parasitic, meaning they derive their nutrients by living off the resources of their host organism. This lifestyle adaptation allows them to maintain a simple body structure and often exhibit complex adaptations for finding, attaching, and exploiting their host. These adaptations can be seen in numerous specialized structures, such as hooks and suckers, which facilitate attachment to the host. Some of the best-known examples of parasitic flatworms are tapeworms (Class Cestoda), which infest vertebrates, including humans, and flukes (Class Trematoda), which infect various animals, including fish, mammals, and birds. These parasites can cause a wide range of diseases affecting their host's overall health. However, it should be noted that while most flatworms are indeed parasitic, not all of them are. Some members of the Phylum Platyhelminthes, such as planarians (Class Turbellaria), are free-living organisms that primarily inhabit freshwater environments. Planarians are primarily detritivores or predators, feeding on decomposing organic material or small organisms, respectively.

We begin by combining like terms on the left side of the equation, which are -193*h and 139*h. Then we move on to solve the linear equation. The equation is -193*h + 139*h + 216 = 0. First, add the coefficients of 'h' together which gives us: (-193*h + 139*h) + 216 = 0 -54*h + 216 = 0 Next, we can find 'h' by isolating it on one side of the equation.  To do this, subtract 216 from both sides of the equation: -54*h + 216 - 216 = 0 - 216 -54*h = -216 Lastly, to solve for 'h', divide both sides of the equation by -54: h = -216 / -54 So, h equals 4. Therefore, the solution to the problem \\"-193*h + 139*h + 216 = 0\\" is h = 4."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in English.

The couple have a serious argument that ends with Quint leaving.Meanwhile, in the basement of his own home, Quint's best friend, Brodie, is woken by his girlfriend, Rene. Brodie is largely indifferent to her presence & the two have a heated conversation where she finally dumps him for many reasons, mostly his lazy & shiftless attitude & his ignorance about how much she cares about him. Brodie has never introduced Rene to his mother and she resents having to climb in his basement window to spend the night with him. She throws him a break-up letter and climbs out the window over his protests.Quint goes to Brodie's house after leaving Brandi & the two try to figure out what to do with the rest of the day.

He stumbles to the home of Nicole Devon, and collapses.  She calls an ambulance, the authorities are alerted, and soon Welles is operated on, given plastic surgery and interrogated by a hard-boiled government official named Tuxan.  But Welles claims to have no memory of his crime.  In fact, he claims no memory of his life at all, save for brief glimpses of a woman and small boy frolicking on a beach. Despite Tuxan's brutal interrogation techniques (electro-shock and water submersion), Welles still maintains his story of total amnesia.  Tuxan allows Welles to escape, hoping he will lead them to the people behind the attempted theft.  Welles goes to Nicole's home and begs her to help him remember.  But she knows nothing. Eventually the inside conspirators behind the attempted theft are found, and Tuxan reveals the truth to Welles, who still cannot remember any details of the crime.  John David Welles actually died en route to the hospital on the night of the explosion.

Given the background: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  and the situation: Two neighboring towns used different approaches to agriculture. Big town used pesticides and fertilizers, while Small town applied permaculture principles and organic farming methods.  Answer the following question: Which town had more growth of algae because of fertilizer? The answer to this question is:","output":"Big town had more growth of algae because of fertilizer. The background information provided indicates that the high application of chemicals, including fertilizers and pesticides, onto farm fields can cause significant environmental problems in nearby water bodies. When it rains, these chemicals can be picked up by water and carried by runoff into rivers or lakes. The nutrients found in fertilizers, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, can lead to excessive growth of water plants and algae, ultimately creating dead zones where nothing can live. In the given situation, Big town used pesticides and fertilizers in their agricultural practices, while Small town chose to implement permaculture principles and organic farming methods. Permaculture emphasizes the use of natural processes and organic techniques to maintain soil fertility and minimize external inputs, such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Organic farming practices also avoid synthetic chemicals, relying instead on environmentally friendly soil management practices that promote healthy ecosystems and conserve biodiversity. Given these differences in agricultural approaches, it is reasonable to conclude that Big town, which used chemical fertilizers in its farming practices, experienced a higher degree of algae growth in its local water bodies. The excessive nutrients from the chemical fertilizers are more likely to find their way into rivers and lakes, thus promoting excessive algae growth, which can negatively impact water quality and aquatic ecosystems. In contrast, Small town practiced permaculture principles and organic farming methods, significantly reducing the likelihood of chemical fertilizers causing excessive algae growth in their local water bodies. Their sustainable agricultural approach likely contributed to maintaining a more balanced and healthier ecosystem, with less risk of creating dead zones in the local water bodies."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This article: Michael Williams is a drifter living out of his car after being discharged from the Marine Corps. A job on an oilfield falls through due to his unwillingness to conceal a war injury on his job application, so Michael wanders into rural Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for other work. A local bar owner named Wayne mistakes him for a hit man, \\"Lyle from Dallas\\", whom Wayne has hired to kill his wife. Wayne offers him a stack of cash—\\"half now, half later\\"—and Michael plays along by taking the money. Michael visits Wayne's wife, Suzanne and attempts to warn her that her life is in danger instead of killing her. She offers him more money to kill Wayne. Michael tries to leave town but a car accident leads him to encounter the local sheriff, who turns out to be Wayne. Michael manages to escape from Wayne but runs into the real Lyle from Dallas. Lyle and Wayne quickly figure out what has transpired, while Michael desperately tries to warn Suzanne before Lyle finds her. The next morning, when Lyle comes to get money from Wayne, he kidnaps both Suzanne and Michael, who are trying to retrieve hidden cash from Wayne's office. Wayne and Suzanne are revealed to be wanted for embezzlement and Wayne is arrested by his own deputies. Lyle returns with Michael and Suzanne hostage and gets Wayne out of jail to retrieve their stash of money. At a remote graveyard, Wayne pulls a gun from the case of money and holds Lyle at gunpoint before Lyle throws a knife into Wayne's neck. Michael and Lyle fight, with Lyle ending up being impaled on a grave marker. When Lyle rises to attack Michael, Suzanne shoots him dead. Michael and Suzanne escape onto a nearby train, but when Suzanne tries to betray Michael, he throws the money out of the speeding train and then throws Suzanne off to be arrested by the police accompanied by a wounded Wayne.

Sam Hemming, a law school graduate of North Wales' Bangor University, was being driven home to Hereford by her boyfriend, Tom Curtis, in July when they got into an accident, per the Mirror: The car flipped, and while Curtis wasn't badly hurt, Hemming was left with broken neck bones, a fractured arm, and severe head injuries, leading doctors to place her in a medically induced coma, the Sun notes. After 19 days, the doctors said hope was gone, and Hemming's family gathered to say their goodbyes. Doctors said they'd switch her life support off and on three times before turning it off for good, just to make sure there was no brain activity—and as they prepared to switch it off for the final time, a medic brushed against her big toe with an icy-cold wipe and her toe wiggled. Doctors gave her a tracheotomy, and a few days later when they turned the life support off again, she could breathe on her own. The second part of Hemming's story: Doctors didn't think she'd ever walk or talk again, though now she's doing both as she recuperates at her parents' home. Even though Hemming suffers from PTSD and has memory loss, doctors are hopeful they can keep boosting her brain function, per the Hereford Times. \\"When I look at the pictures of me in the coma, it seems unreal,\\" Hemming says. \\"And when I hear that my toe saved me, it's amazing.\\" (A college student in a coma gave his mom a Christmas \\"miracle.\\") Expand this summary.","output":"Sure kiddo, let me explain this to you. So, there was a girl named Sam Hemming. She was really smart and had just finished law school in a place called North Wales, which is in the United Kingdom. She was going home with her boyfriend, Tom Curtis. But, oh no, they had an accident! The car they were in flipped over. Tom was okay, but Sam was badly hurt. She had broken bones in her neck and her arm. She also hurt her head very badly. Because she was so hurt, the doctors had to make her sleep for a while. This is called a medically induced coma. After 19 days, the doctors told Sam's family to come and say goodbye. This was because they thought Sam was not going to wake up again. They had a machine helping her to breathe, but they didn’t see any signs that her brain was still working.  Before turning off the machine for good, the doctors switched it off and on three times to double-check. Just as they were about to turn it off for the final time, something amazing happened. A doctor was touching her big toe with a really cold cloth when her toe moved! This showed that there was still some life left in Sam. The doctors then made a small hole in her throat to help her breathe. This is called a tracheotomy. When they turned off the breathing machine a few days later, she could breathe by herself! But the story didn't end there. The doctors thought Sam would never be able to walk or talk again, but guess what? She proved them wrong! She's back in her parents' house now, walking and talking while she gets better. Even though she still gets scared because of what happened (that's called PTSD) and sometimes forgets things, the doctors think they can continue to help her brain get better. Sam said it's really amazing to think how her big toe saved her life! Just like a superhero toe!

Q:Dara and Jody sat on the sun-scorched concrete with their backs against the bus shelter. They were sharing an apple, one of those tart green ones, and as Dara took her turn gnashing into it, Jody gagged and vomited up some peel. 'Shit, are you okay?' Dara asked, rubbing Jody's back. 'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour. The bus droning into the stop enabled them some composure, but once on board just looking at each other was enough to start it up again. This was the coolest day Dara had had in forever. Jody and her had decided to wag school just that morning before rollcall, and despite her anxiety -- this was actually the first time Dara had ever wagged -- she was so, so glad she did. They were both in Year 11, and had only become friends three months earlier. They were from totally different scenes at school, but one maths lesson had changed all that. Jody had borrowed someone's correction fluid -- in fact it was Mr Dickinson, the teacher's correction fluid -- but it was borrowed from someone who'd borrowed it from him. At the end of the lesson Jody was packing her stuff up and didn't know what to do with the bottle of white-out, so she tossed it out the window of the classroom. Dara had seen her do it, and thought it was just so cool.

Paragraph: Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

The Chaser is an Australian satirical comedy group. They are known for their television programmes on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation channel. The group take their name from their production of satirical newspaper, a publication known to challenge conventions of taste. The group's motto is \\"Striving for Mediocrity in a World of Excellence\\". In July 2006, Licciardello faced charges of \\"offensive conduct\\" from the New South Wales Police Force, after turning up at a rugby league football match between the Canterbury Bulldogs and the St George Illawarra Dragons on 14 July 2006 dressed up as a Bulldogs fan and attempting to sell fake knives, knuckledusters and balaclavas for a War on Everything sketch.  In April 2007, a 15-year-old boy duped YouTube into deleting all clips posted from The Chaser's War On Everything by claiming to be a representative of the ABC. They were later reinstated.  At the 2007 Logie Awards some of the Chaser team were \\"manhandled\\" by Crown Casino security staff on the red carpet before being closely supervised for the rest of the evening.  During Dick Cheney's visit to Australia in 2007, members of The Chaser team were included on the official list of terrorists, anarchists, and protesters deemed to pose a threat to the US Vice-President.  The Chaser team gained notoriety and considerable media attention over \\"The Eulogy Song\\", written by Chris Taylor and performed by Andrew Hansen on 17 October 2007 episode of The Chaser's War On Everything. The song satirised the media's posthumous praise of deceased celebrities, regardless of their behaviour in life, and mentioned among others John Lennon, Peter Brock, Stan Zemanek, Princess Diana, Steve Irwin, Donald Bradman, and Kerry Packer.

Summarize this article: It may soon be possible to obtain a highly accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by analyzing a sample of spinal fluid. A study released Monday found that a constellation of three substances in the cerebrospinal fluid was present in 90% of people who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.The test also showed the same markers were found in 72% of people with mild cognitive impairment, considered an early stage of the disease, and in one-third of adults who had no cognitive problems.Many experts believe that biomarkers in spinal fluid may emerge as the most accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. At present, the disease is diagnosed using pencil-and-paper cognitive tests, which are subjective and may be inaccurate. The diagnosis can only be confirmed by examining brain tissue at an autopsy.Researchers from Belgium analysed 114 older adults who were cognitively normal, 200 who had mild cognitive impairment and 102 who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. They looked for three specific biomarkers, proteins that develop in the brain when the disease is present. A later analysis looking at brain autopsies for confirmation found the test of spinal fluid markers was correct in 64 of 68 cases.The fact that Alzheimer's was diagnosed in about one-third of people without symptoms of the disease means that the disease process is underway well before symptoms occur, the authors said.In an editorial accompanying the paper, two U.S. experts in the disease said that cerebrospinal fluid analysis should be put into wider practice. \\"There is now ample evidence that these measurements have value; physicians need to formulate when and how to incorporate cerebrospinal fluid measurements into practice,\\" they wrote.The use of such tests will become even more important once drugs are developed to stop or slow the progression of the disease. Ideally, experts say, people could begin taking the medications before any sign of symptoms if cerebrospinal fluid markers are positive for the disease.The study was released Monday in the Archives of Neurology -- Shari RoanReturn to Booster Shots blog ||||| Researchers report that a spinal fluid test can be 100 percent accurate in in identifying a signature level of abnormal proteins in patients with significant memory loss who went on to develop Alzheimer’s disease .      Although there has been increasing evidence of the value of this and other tests in finding signs of Alzheimer’s, the study, which will appear Tuesday in the Archives of Neurology, shows how accurate they can be. The new result is one of a number of remarkable recent findings about Alzheimer’s.      After decades when nothing much seemed to be happening, when this progressive brain disease seemed untreatable and when its diagnosis could be confirmed only at autopsy, the field has suddenly woken up.      Alzheimer’s, medical experts now agree, starts a decade or more before people have symptoms. And by the time there are symptoms, it may be too late to save the brain. So the hope is to find good ways to identify people who are getting the disease, and use those people as subjects in studies to see how long it takes for symptoms to occur and in studies of drugs that may slow or stop the disease.      Researchers are finding simple and accurate ways to detect Alzheimer’s long before there are definite symptoms. In addition to spinal fluid tests they also have new PET scans of the brain that show the telltale amyloid plaques that are a unique feature of the disease. And they are testing hundreds of new drugs that, they hope, might change the course of the relentless brain cell death that robs people of their memories and abilities to think and reason.      “This is what everyone is looking for, the bull’s-eye of perfect predictive accuracy,” Dr. Steven DeKosky, dean of the University of Virginia medical school, who is not connected to the new research, said about the spinal tap study.      Dr. John Morris, a professor of neurology at Washington University, said the new study “establishes that there is a signature of Alzheimer’s and that it means something. It is very powerful.”      A lot of work lies ahead, researchers say — making sure the tests are reliable if they are used in doctors’ offices, making sure the research findings hold up in real-life situations, getting doctors and patients comfortable with the notion of spinal taps, the method used to get spinal fluid. But they see a bright future.      Although the latest PET scans for Alzheimer’s are not commercially available, the spinal fluid tests are.      So the new results also give rise to a difficult question: Should doctors offer, or patients accept, commercially available spinal tap tests to find a disease that is yet untreatable? In the research studies, patients are often not told they may have the disease, but in practice in the real world, many may be told.      Some medical experts say it should be up to doctors and their patients. Others say doctors should refrain from using the spinal fluid test in their practices. They note that it is not reliable enough — results can vary by lab — and has been studied only in research settings where patients are carefully selected to have no other conditions, like strokes or depression, that could affect their memories.      “This is literally on the cutting edge of where the field is,” Dr. DeKosky said. “The field is moving fast. You can get a test that is approved by the F.D.A., and cutting edge doctors will use it.”      But, said Dr. John Trojanowski, a University of Pennsylvania researcher and senior author of the paper, given that people can get the test now, “How early do you want to label people?”      Some, like Dr. John Growdon, a neurology professor at Massachusetts General Hospital who wrote an editorial accompanying the paper, said that decision was up to doctors and their patients.      Sometimes patients with severe memory loss do not have the disease. Doctors might want to use the test in cases where they want to be sure of the diagnosis. And they might want to offer the test to people with milder symptoms who want to know whether they are developing the devastating brain disease.      One drawback, though, is that spinal fluid is obtained with a spinal tap, and that procedure, with its reputation for pain and headaches, makes most doctors and many patients nervous. The procedure involves putting a needle in the spinal space and withdrawing a small amount of fluid.      Dr. Growdon and others say spinal taps are safe and not particularly painful for most people. But, he said, there needs to be an education campaign to make people feel more comfortable about having them. He suggested that, because most family doctors and internists are not experienced with the test, there could be special spinal tap centers where they could send patients.      The new study included more than 300 patients in their 70s, 114 with normal memories, 200 with memory problems and 102 with Alzheimer’s disease. Their spinal fluid was analyzed for amyloid beta, a protein fragment that forms plaques in the brain, and for tau, a protein that accumulates in dead and dying nerve cells in the brain. To avoid bias, the researchers analyzing the data did not know anything about the clinical status of the subjects. Also, the subjects were not told what the tests showed.      Nearly every person with Alzheimer’s had the characteristic spinal fluid protein levels. Nearly three quarters of people with mild cognitive impairment, a memory impediment that can precede Alzheimer’s, had Alzheimer’s-like spinal fluid proteins. And about a third of people with normal memories had spinal fluid indicating Alzheimer’s. Researchers suspect that those people will develop memory problems.      In checking their findings against data gathered in a separate study, the researchers found that among 57 patients with mild cognitive impairment who went on to develop Alzheimer’s within five years, 100 percent had the characteristic protein levels five years before.      The prevailing hypothesis about Alzheimer’s says that amyloid and tau accumulation are necessary for the disease and that stopping the proteins could stop the disease. But it is not yet known what happens when these proteins accumulate in the brains of people with normal memories. They might be a risk factor like high cholesterol levels. Many people with high cholesterol levels never have heart attacks. Or it might mean that Alzheimer’s has already started and if the person lives long enough he or she will with absolute certainty get symptoms like memory loss.      Many, like Dr. DeKosky, believe that when PET scans for amyloid become available, they will be used instead of spinal taps, in part because doctors and patients are more comfortable with brain scans.      And when — researchers optimistically are saying “when” these days — drugs are shown to slow or prevent the disease, the thought is that people will start having brain scans or spinal taps for Alzheimer’s as routinely as they might have colonoscopies or mammograms today.      For now, Dr. DeKosky said, the days when Alzheimer’s could be confirmed only at autopsy are almost over. And the time when Alzheimer’s could be detected only after most of the brain damage was done seem to be ending, too.      “The new biomarkers in CSF have made the difference,” Dr. DeKosky said, referring to cerebral spinal fluid. “This confirms their accuracy in a very big way.” ||||| Summary:","output":"A recent study suggests that analyzing a sample of spinal fluid could provide a highly accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, detecting the presence of three substances found in the cerebrospinal fluid in 90% of diagnosed patients.

The best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983. With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute titles for Nintendo's platform.  - The is an 8-bit handheld game console released by Sega on October 6, 1990 in Japan, in North America and Europe, and Australia in 1992. The Game Gear primarily competed with Nintendo's Game Boy, the Atari Lynx and NEC's TurboExpress. The handheld shares much of its hardware with the Master System and is able to play its own titles as well as those of the Master System, the latter being made possible by the use of an adapter. Containing a full-color backlit screen with a landscape format, Sega positioned the Game Gear as a technologically superior handheld to the Game Boy.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - The PlayStation 2 (abbreviated as PS2) is a home video game console that was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It is the successor to the PlayStation, and is the second installment in the PlayStation lineup of consoles. It was released on March 4, 2000 in Japan, October 26, 2000 in North America, November 24, 2000 in Europe, and November 17, 2000 in Australia. It competed with Sega's Dreamcast, Microsoft's Xbox, and Nintendo's GameCube in the sixth generation of video game consoles.  - The is a home video game console released by Sega on November 27, 1998 in Japan, September 9, 1999 in North America, and October 14, 1999 in Europe. It was the first in the sixth generation of video game consoles, preceding Sony's PlayStation 2, Nintendo's GameCube and Microsoft's Xbox. The Dreamcast was Sega's final home console, marking the end of the company's 18 years in the console market.  - The (abbreviated as GBA) is a 32-bit handheld video game console developed, manufactured and marketed by Nintendo as the successor to the Game Boy Color. It was released in Japan on March 21, 2001, in North America on June 11, 2001, in Australia and Europe on June 22, 2001, and in the People's Republic of China on June 8, 2004 (excluding Hong Kong). Nintendo's competitors in the handheld market at the time were the Neo Geo Pocket Color, WonderSwan, GP32, Tapwave Zodiac, and the N-Gage. Despite the competitors' best efforts, Nintendo maintained a majority market share with the Game Boy Advance. As of June 30, 2010, the Game Boy Advance series has sold 81.51 million units worldwide. Its successor, the Nintendo DS, was released in November 2004 and is also compatible with Game Boy Advance software.  - A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive.  - The , referred to as GBC, is a handheld game console manufactured by Nintendo, which was released on October 21, 1998 in Japan and was released in November of the same year in international markets. It is the successor of the Game Boy.  - The , stylized as NINTENDO and often referred to as N64, is Nintendo's third home video game console for the international market. Named for its 64-bit central processing unit, it was released in June 1996 in Japan, September 1996 in North America, March 1997 in Europe and Australia, September 1997 in France and December 1997 in Brazil. It is the industry's last major successive home console to use the cartridge as its primary storage format, as all succeeding home consoles up until the Nintendo Switch used an optical format. In addition, current handheld systems (such as the PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS) also use cartridges. While the Nintendo 64 was succeeded by Nintendo's MiniDVD-based GameCube in November 2001, the consoles remained available until the system was retired in late 2003.  - An arcade game or coin-op is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers. While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home-based video game consoles such as Playstation and Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost.  - The is a third-generation home video game console that was manufactured by Sega. It was originally released in 1985 as the Sega Mark III in Japan. After being redesigned prior to its North American launch, the console was renamed Master System and released in 1986 in North America, 1987 in Europe, and 1989 in Brazil. The redesigned Master System was also released in Japan in 1987. Both the Mark III and the original Master System models could play with both cartridges (or \\"Mega Cartridges\\", as they were officially called) and the credit card-sized Sega Cards, which retailed at lower prices than cartridges but had lower storage capacity; the Master System II and later models did not have the card slot. The Master System also featured accessories such as a light gun and 3D glasses which were designed to work with a range of specially coded games.  - The is an 8-bit handheld video game device with interchangeable cartridges developed and manufactured by Nintendo, which was first released in Japan on , in North America on and in Europe on .

Write a title for this article: PEEBLES, Scotland (Aug. 23) -- Robert Mackie trembles with rage when he describes how he and his wife were kept in the dark about his HIV infection -- and how doctors published his medical data in journals years before they gave him the devastating news. Mackie is one of some 5,700 British hemophiliacs who received tainted blood and were infected with HIV, hepatitis or both, in what has been viewed as one of the worst treatment disasters in the history of Britain's heath care system. Nearly a third of those infected have since died. Robert Mackie, 58, learned he had HIV in 1987 but said he has medical records showing he was used for an AIDS study several years before then. Tainted blood scandals have been investigated throughout the world — in France, Canada, Japan and elsewhere — leading to some convictions of health officials and many compensation packages for infected hemophiliacs, but there has been no detailed probe in Britain until now. One inquiry under way will likely end in a nonbinding report, while the other is an official investigation by the Scottish government that could lead to charges filed against individuals. \\"They used me as a guinea pig,\\" said Mackie, 58, in his house in Scotland. \\"It's just a miracle my wife wasn't infected.\\" Hemophiliacs suffer from an inherited disorder that prevents blood from clotting. Mackie — an active sportsman who had hoped to become a salmon fishing guide — had controlled his hemophilia with a treatment called cryoprecipitate when he switched in 1980 to a new product. Called Factor VIII, it was supposed to be more effective in helping his blood clot. In 1983, he heard hemophiliacs were developing AIDS, then a mysterious disease that usually claimed its victims in two or three years. He said he asked his doctors if he could be exposed to the killer virus through his use of Factor VIII, a relatively new blood plasma product made from blood collected from thousands of donors. They told him not to worry. A year later, he was infected by a contaminated batch. \\"We could have had more of a family,\\" says Alice Mackie, who had a son with Robert before he became infected. \\"The two of us had plans for what we were going to do. But you could say our whole lives stopped.\\" The tainted blood led to the deaths of Mackie's cousin, two uncles and friends, who were part of a close-knit community of hemophiliacs in Scotland. \\"From '87, all we saw was people dying,\\" said Alice, her hair white at 51. \\"And believe me, when you see someone dying of AIDS, it's really bad. It's different each time. No one dies the same way.\\" Mackie said he was told of his infection in 1987. But he told an independent inquiry commission that when he finally obtained his medical records, he learned he had been used for an AIDS study that began several years before then. \\"This AIDS study was, it seems, the beginning of many years of research being carried out on me without my knowledge or consent,\\" he told the inquiry committee headed by Lord Archer, a former solicitor general. Factor VIII was meant to thicken blood so that it would clot properly, and Mackie was told it was a breakthrough when he got his first treatment in 1980. But the risks were high. With each dose, blood plasma from thousands of donors was introduced into his system. Between 2,500 to 22,000 donors contributed to each batch of Factor VIII, which could then treat about 100 patients. The contamination risk increased as the number of donors grew, but it was only once AIDS emerged as a global public health threat that doctors learned how great that risk was. By 1983, U.S. medical experts had established that AIDS — previously concentrated among gay men — was striking hemophiliacs. In April 1983, an American doctor wrote in The Lancet medical journal asking for data on hemophiliacs in areas where there was no reported HIV in the blood donor community. The journal published a response one month later — from Mackie's physician, Dr. Christopher Ludlam. In the letter, published on May 28, 1983, Ludlam described his own patients as a valuable resource for further study because Scotland produced its own Factor VIII and seemed to have an AIDS-free donor community. Mackie said that in 1985 — when he was already infected but didn't know it — Ludlam wrote to government authorities seeking ethics approval to study the immune system of infected patients and claimed that his patients knew about the research and had agreed to participate. \\"If, as the ethics application form states, consent was obtained from all subjects ... how is it that I did not know about my AIDS status until 1987?\\" he said at the hearing. \\"I did not know anything about his studies or research.\\" Mackie obtained copies of the form submitted by Ludlam in which the doctor says his patients were well informed about his studies. Ludlam, who practices at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, declined to talk with The Associated Press about the case. Brian Montgomery, a National Health Service executive who oversees the hospital, said it would be \\"inappropriate\\" to comment while the inquiries are ongoing. Two of Mackie's uncles and a cousin were also hemophiliacs under Ludlam's care. They learned they had been infected around the same time. All three succumbed fairly quickly. The family held three funerals in two years. Mackie was convinced he would be next. Surprisingly, he stayed relatively healthy for a decade. He thought he had escaped a death sentence, but in 1997 his appetite began to wane. By 2000, he had advanced symptoms of AIDS. He became too weak to climb stairs. The smell of food sickened him. Doctors said he had a few weeks left, but he was too stubborn, and too suspicious about doctors, to take the new anti-retroviral drugs that were by then extending the lives of many AIDS patients. For days he sat, feverish, in his kitchen, believing death was imminent. Then, drawing on reserves he did not know he possessed, his fighting spirit returned. He gave in to Alice's pleas and started to take the new drugs after she convinced him they were not poison. The drugs worked. Mackie said they at first caused a dangerous reaction that left him \\"out of his head\\" but eventually gave him more energy and confidence. Despite being weak from AIDS and Hepatitis C, which he found out he had in 2000, Mackie insisted on giving evidence to the Archer committee last year. The hearings were closed to the public but a report is expected next month. Alice read most of his statement, and he spoke quietly when he spoke at all, but he did raise his voice at one point to tell the committee that doctors had endangered the safety of his wife and son by holding back his HIV status. \\"I believe nonconsensual research was conducted by doctors of hemophilia in this country,\\" he said, voice booming again. \\"We were all used as lab rats.\\" The Mackies say they are not expecting much from the new investigations. But Andrew March, a hemophiliac in London who became HIV positive when he was nine after exposure to tainted blood plasma products, said the surviving victims want the truth to finally be told. \\"I feel anger a lot of the time,\\" said March, who is now 34 and generally free of AIDS symptoms. \\"Frustration. A sense of being repeatedly betrayed. There are lessons to be learned that haven't been learned yet.\\" He said the slightest cold makes him wonder how long his immune system will be able to fight off illnesses. Christopher James, chief executive of the Haemophilia Society, said a generation of hemophiliacs was exposed to HIV and Hepatitis C. He said doctors had an obligation to tell Mackie, and other victims, that they were HIV positive so they could take steps to protect their partners. \\"There was a very high death rate,\\" said James, who hopes the inquiries will lead to a financial settlement for the victims as well as a public apology. \\"These people have faced enormous financial and emotional hardships from this catastrophe and they deserve to know what happened and why and to be sure it will never happen again.\\"","output":"Title: \\"Hidden Truths: Hemophiliacs, Tainted Blood, and Unwanted Experiments in Britain\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Inspired by rumours that the President's helicopter had landed at the ancient site, Janice Raffle and her husband James marched across fields with their three sons  in the hope they would catch a glimpse of the US President. At first the family, who live a mile from the monument, were stuck at a fence. But a good-natured Obama wandered over to where they were standing - and  even agreed to pose for a family photo. Landmark:","output":"The Raffle family had been living just a mile away from the famous Stonehenge monument and thought they might be able to get a glimpse of President Obama as the rumors of his helicopter landing nearby spread throughout the local community. Armed with both excitement and determination, Janice, her husband James, and their three sons embarked on a spontaneous adventure, marching across the fields with the hope of seeing the US President in person.  Initially, the family found themselves halted by a fence, unable to move any closer to the historical monument. They stood there, peering over the obstacles, when the unbelievable happened. To their absolute astonishment and delight, President Obama, with his trademark smile and warmth, approached the family himself. It seemed like fate was on their side, as the President crossed paths with this ordinary family during his visit to the world heritage site. Displaying his genuine and good-natured personality, Obama took some time out from his busy schedule to chat with the family. The Raffles, though utterly surprised, were thrilled to engage in conversation with the President. As they enjoyed this unexpected and once-in-a-lifetime encounter, the idea of capturing the moment struck them. Mustering their courage, they asked President Obama if he would be willing to pose for a family photo. Much to their amazement, the President graciously agreed, and the family quickly gathered around him, all smiles. The photograph, which would undoubtedly become a cherished family treasure, was taken with the legendary Stonehenge as a backdrop. The interaction between the Raffle family and President Obama perfectly captured the essence of humanity, transcending political boundaries and nationalities.  As the conversation came to an end, and with the image of President Obama and the Raffle family immortalized, everyone bid their farewells. However, it was only after the astonishing encounter that Janice Raffle was struck with a pang of regret. She wished that she had extended an invitation to President Obama for a cup of coffee at their nearby home. Although the opportunity to invite the President for a more personal and informal visit slipped through their fingers, the Raffle family would always fondly remember the day when they shared a once-in-a-lifetime, heartwarming experience with the then-serving President of the United States. And while Janice may forever wonder about the missed possibility of inviting him back for coffee, the family would cherish that impromptu rendezvous at Stonehenge, which transformed an ordinary day into an extraordinary memory they would carry with them for the rest of their lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which group's cans had the air molecules inside move slower?  A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there  overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first.  Hint: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.","output":"Based on the provided paragraph and the principles of the kinetic-molecular theory, Group George's cans had the air molecules inside move slower compared to Group Jones' cans. This is because Group George vented their cans before heating them, which allowed for the release of the increasing pressure inside the cans as the air molecules gained kinetic energy due to the heat from the campfire. By venting the cans, Group George minimized the chances of an explosion by preventing a rapid increase in internal pressure. Since the pressure was allowed to escape, the air molecules inside Group George's cans did not need to move as fast or impact the container walls with as much force compared to Group Jones' cans. On the other hand, Group Jones did not vent their cans, which led to a rapid buildup of pressure as the air molecules gained kinetic energy from the campfire heat. This increased molecular movement and force against the container walls eventually caused the cans to explode. Therefore, the air molecules inside Group Jones' cans moved at a faster pace as a result of the increasing pressure and temperature."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"\\"Kissing\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is associated with positive emotions, shared experiences, and romantic gestures. In the context of a couple at the end of a sleighing ride, it is natural for the couple to express affection and share a special moment together, such as a kiss. The other possible answers do not align with human common sense for the following reasons: 1. Decline: This term usually implies a decrease in something or a turning down of an offer. It doesn't fit well in the context of sharing a happy experience on a sleigh ride. 2. Going down hill: This phrase can mean both the literal physical descent on a hill, as well as a metaphorical decline or deterioration. In the context of a couple on a sleighing ride, neither meaning seems to be a suitable or positive way to end the experience. 3. Nausea: While this option refers to physical discomfort, it is not directly related to sleigh rides and is not a happy way to end a sleigh ride or connect with a partner. It is also not what a couple would typically associate with an enjoyable winter activity. 4. Death: This option is grim and morbid. It does not align with human common sense in the context of a romantic, enjoyable activity like a sleigh ride.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. It's such a romantic notion, that wines and spirits improve with barrel-aging. Verdant vineyards and happy harvesters bring to mind the pleasures of sniffing, swirling and quaffing wine. We've been led to believe that the best wines require a long time -- often several years -- in barrels (and then in bottles) to reach maturity and \\"drinkability.\\"      As for grape spirits, generically known as brandies, it's a multi-billion dollar market worldwide. You distill the wine (and the pressed skins) to get the raw brandy, which is almost undrinkable in its early life. Before it's even palatable, to shave off the raw edges, it needs to mature. Typically, this is done in oak barrels, where, over time, the spirits pick up color and concentration.      Now a research team in Spain says a lot of that romance isn't necessary. Brandies can age just as well when they're zapped with ultrasound waves. The Spanish experiments, which seem promising, were first reported in the science magazine Discover.      A number of techniques have long been in the cellar master's toolkit. A stainless steel fermenting tank can be lined with oak staves; oak chips and oak extracts are often used to enhance the \\"buttery\\" flavor of young white wines; so-called \\"micro-oxygenation\\" introduces imperceptibly tiny bubbles in young red wines to accelerate their maturation. For spirits, which emerge from the still perfectly clear, it's not unheard of to use artificial coloring agents to bypass the years-long process of evaporation through the pores of oak barrels.      And there are home remedies, too: magnets that supposedly realign the molecules, and a variety of whirlers and twirlers that purport to add (or remove) oxygen. They share only only thing: ineffectiveness.      The best brandy is from the Cognac region in southwestern France. By law, it must be aged for a minimum of two years, and many are aged for ten years or more. But it's an expensive process, hence the drive to find less costly methods.      Ultrasound exams, a common medical procedure these days (to see unborn infants in the womb, for example), use high-frequency pressure waves. In commercial uses, ultrasound waves can actually cause tissues to rupture and release compounds stored within cells. ||||| For many liquors, aging is the key to their distinct flavors. Brandy is no exception, with top-shelf labels spending years in casks. But chemists think they have discovered a shortcut—ultrasound.      Spanish researchers shot a river of brandy through a bed of American oak chips and blasted the mix with ultrasound for three days. They also altered a slate of variables, including temperature, amount of oak chips, alcoholic strength of the liquor, aeration, and more. The team then ran the results past a panel of experts, asking them to rate the quality of the different liquors.      Ultrasound appears to dramatically accelerate the aging process.      While not quite up to the standards of a truly-aged brandy, the ultrasonic spirits were still well received. Here’s Charles Q. Choi, reporting for Discover:      “Obtaining, in three days, a spirit with characteristics near to two-years-aged brandies was something really unexpected for us,” says study co-author Valme García, a professor at the University of Cádiz in Spain. Eight trained judges, including some of the researchers, deemed the resulting spirits nearly as good as traditional brandies. “They tasted surprisingly well, with good fruity and sweet flavors and a high aromatic intensity,” García said.      The best brandy produced in this experiment was stiff—130 proof, or 65% alcohol—and run past a large number of oak chips at room temperature with a bit of aeration.      The accelerated aging is brought about thanks to ultrasound-induced cavitation in the oak chips, where small bubbles formed by the sound waves “explosively collapse,” blasting the wood’s tissues and releasing compounds that add distinctive flavors to the liquor. Booze experts call these “congeners.”      While the liquor produced by the accelerated aging process can’t legally be called brandy in Europe since regulations require that the spirit be aged in oak casks, Gargía pointed out that the technique could be used to help distillers accelerate their development process. Want to know how a new cooper’s casks will affect the flavor? Add ultrasound. What about a different species of wood? Again, ultrasound could help.      Beyond that, more adventurous distillers may gin up entirely new alcoholic beverages with unusual flavors. For García, wine is next on the list. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Spanish researchers have discovered that using ultrasound waves can accelerate the aging process of brandy, significantly reducing the time it takes to achieve a mature taste. By running brandy through a bed of oak chips while applying ultrasound for three days, they were able to create a spirit with characteristics resembling that of traditionally barrel-aged brandies. The process involves ultrasound-induced cavitation in oak chips, which releases compounds that add the distinctive flavors to the liquor. While not a replacement for traditional aging methods, this technique could be used for accelerated testing and development of new alcoholic beverages with unique flavors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But very annoying. I had met a woman. Actually, at 19, she was still a girl. I lived in Pittsburgh. She lived in London, Ontario. She was, to put it bluntly, hotter than hell. On top of that, she’s one of the sweetest, nicest people you were ever going to meet. Needless to say, I was quite smitten, and quickly arranged to spend a week in London with her. When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes. Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week. Nothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc. When I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different. There was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway. My pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded. My alarm clock was on the floor. The power cord had been pulled from the wall and chewed through. There were several…uhmmm… “presents” in the middle of the bed, where they had pulled the sheets back. Some of them were still wet. I figure that trip cost me somewhere in the neighborhood of 1k to repair the damage. So I did what any 24 year old would do when faced with that situation. I cleaned up, went to bed, and went back to London a few weeks later. But I cat proofed the house first. (Yes, they still lived with me for another 12 years before passing away.) Like I said, she was wearing very interesting pajamas when I got to London. At least for a few minutes.

Question: What sentence does Grandier get? Movie title: The Devils Movie plot: In 17th Century France, Cardinal Richelieu (Christopher Logue) is influencing King Louis XIII (Graham Armitage) in an attempt to gain further power. He convinces Louis that the fortifications of cities throughout France should be demolished to prevent Protestants from uprising. Louis agrees, but forbids Richelieu from carrying out demolitions in the town of Loudun, having made a promise to its governor not to damage the town.Meanwhile in Loudun, the Governor has died, leaving control of the city to Urbain Grandier (Oliver Reed), a dissolute and proud but popular and well-regarded Catholic priest. He is having an affair with a relative of Father Canon Mignon (Murray Melvin), another priest in the town, unaware that the deformed, neurotic Sister Jeanne (Vanessa Redgrave), head of the local convent, is sexually obsessed with him. She asks for Grandier to become the convent's new confessor. Grandier secretly marries another woman, Madeline De Brou (Gemma Jones), but news of this reaches Sister Jeanne, driving her to insanity (this includes an attack where Sister Jeanne viciously attacks Madeleine when the latter brings back a book that the former had lent her, and Sister Jeanne accuses Madeleine of being a \\"fornicator\\" and \\"sacrilegious bitch\\", among other things).Baron de Laubardemont (Dudley Sutton) arrives with orders to demolish the city, overriding Grandier's orders to stop. Grandier summons the town's soldiers and forces Laubardemont to back down pending the arrival of an order for the demolition from King Louis. Grandier departs Loudun to visit the King. In the meantime, Sister Jeanne is informed by Father Mignon that he is to be her new confessor. She informs him of Grandier's marriage and affairs, and also inadvertently accuses Grandier of witchcraft and of possessing her. Mignon relays this information to Laubardemont.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z? , can you please find it?   \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" was written by Beyoncé, Terius \\"The-Dream\\" Nash, Thaddis \\"Kuk\\" Harrell, and Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart, and was produced by Nash and Stewart. Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that \\"people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate\\". She stated that although \\"Single Ladies\\" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In \\"Single Ladies\\", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am... Sasha Fierce. The song was released simultaneously with \\"If I Were a Boy\\"; as lead singles, they were meant to demonstrate the concept of the dueling personalities of the singer. This reinforced the theme of the album, which was created by placing its ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs. The singles debuted on US radio on October 8, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" did so on mainstream urban New York radio station Power 105.1. Both singles were added to rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on October 12, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" was sent to urban contemporary playlists the same day, while \\"If I Were a Boy\\" was instead classified for contemporary hit radio.

Answer:","output":"A one-inch ripple in a pond would have significantly less energy than a 350-foot tall ocean tsunami. The energy of a wave is proportional to its height (amplitude), the square of its frequency (how often waves pass a certain point in a certain time), and the square of its wavelength (the distance between successive waves). A 350-foot tall ocean tsunami is incredibly larger in terms of these parameters, and thus carries a massive amount of energy compared to a one-inch ripple in a pond, which is relatively tiny in size and frequency. Therefore, the tsunami would have much more destructive power upon impact. This is why tsunamis can pose major threats to coastal areas, causing widespread destruction, while tiny pond ripples pose no threat."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Sir Alex Ferguson is expected to have little or no say in who will be the next manager of Manchester United. The 72-year-old former United boss, who won 38 trophies in 26 seasons at Old Trafford, was effectively handed full authority to choose his successor after announcing his own retiremment last season. His choice, David Moyes, was fired today after an early mornning meeting with United chief executive at United's Carrington training HQ. Not this time, Sir ALex: Ferguson, who will not appoint Davuid Moyes' successor, checks his watch as he takes in a the match against Bayern Munich in this season's Champions League. No hiding place: Ryan Giggs (left) has been appointed interim manager at United following the sacking of David Moyes (right) The United hierarchy’s explanation for allowing Ferguson to effectively select his successor was that it made sense to trust the judgement of someone with so much success and who was still on the payroll as a £2million-a-year ambassador. United's board clearly remain keen to maintain links with the Ferguson era, however, as they have appointed Ryan Giggs as interim manager, with Nicky Butt his assistant. Sportsmail understands that Phil Neville remains part of the back-room set up despite Moyes' departure. The club are also intent on luring Paul Scholes back in to the Old Trafford fold after the departure of Moyes, as revealed by Sportsmail earlier today. Scholes has hardly been seen at the club since doing some work with Under 19s manager Nicky Butt earlier this season after becoming disillusioned with what he felt were half-hearted attempts by Moyes to find him a role. Now that Moyes has been sacked as United. manager, the club will do everything they can to fit their former. midfield player in to their coaching set-up as they look to retain a. connection with the club’s glorious past behind the scenes. With United set to appoint a foreign manager to replace Moyes the club are concerned that ties with the past could be cut. Ryan Giggs is now the club interim manager and will be retained whatever happens this summer but Phil Neville could follow Moyes out of the club after serving as a coach under the Scot while brother Gary and David Beckham are pursuing other careers. United had no plans in place to reintroduce Scholes to the coaching staff while Moyes was in charge and a source close to the club revealed to Sportsmail last month that the situation was unlikely to change. Scholes teamed up with Butt to help his former team-mate coach the United youngsters for the UEFA youth league in the autumn but this arrangement was on a purely voluntary, non-contracted basis. It was orchestrated by Butt, rather than Moyes, and it remained a temporary role. Last summer, Scholes turned down the chance to play a leading role on Moyes' staff, citing a wish to spend some time with his family before making his return to football.

Here is a premise: In the narrow streets lined with merchants' and tailors' shops, the Star of David, menorahs, and Jewish names are actually more plentiful than Jewish people themselves. Here is a hypothesis: The businesses are not authentically Jewish.  Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"It is not definitively possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Just based on this limited information provided in the premise and the hypothesis, there are alternative explanations to consider, as well as context in which the scenario could be understood. Here is a thorough analysis of the matter: 1. Authenticity: The hypothesis suggests that the businesses are not authentically Jewish, which may imply that the usage of Jewish symbols and names is purely for business purposes or appropriation. However, the presence of the Star of David, menorahs, and Jewish names might be because the business owners or staff have Jewish ancestry or connections with the community, even if they might not be directly practicing Judaism. 2. Demographics: The premise indicates that Jewish symbols and names are more plentiful than Jewish people themselves in the area. This can mean that a significant Jewish community previously lived here and left a lasting cultural and business influence on the area. The current population might have changed, but the history and traditions remained, thereby not necessarily disqualifying the businesses being considered as authentically Jewish. 3. Business Ownership: It is also essential to delve into the question of business ownership. The businesses might have been established by Jewish owners who migrated or moved away, leaving the businesses in the hands of their successors, who might not be Jewish. It is possible that the Jewish spirit of the businesses is intact, albeit with a new generation of non-Jewish owners. The usage of Jewish symbols and names might be a way of continuing tradition and respecting the origins of the businesses. 4. Cultural and Historical Context: The presence of Jewish symbols and names could also be interpreted as homage or respect to the history and culture of a particular location – the streets might be known to have a historical Jewish influence or connection. In this case, the hypothesis that the businesses are not authentically Jewish might not necessarily be true because the businesses could be promoting the cultural heritage of the area, regardless of the number of Jewish individuals currently residing there. In conclusion, while the hypothesis might have some validity, it is not possible to definitively conclude that it is true based solely on the premise provided. A more comprehensive understanding of the area's history, demographics, and cultural context would be required to draw a more accurate conclusion regarding the authenticity of these businesses being Jewish or not."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mystery: Katrice Lee was only two when she went missing from a British Army base in Germany in 1981. The family of a little girl who disappeared more than 30 years ago have spoken of their devastation after David Cameron ruled out any further investigation of the mystery. Katrice Lee was only two when she went missing from a British Army base in Germany in 1981. Her parents believe military police made mistakes in the early stages of their investigation into her disappearance - but the Prime Minister has resisted calls to reopen the inquiry. Katrice's father, Richard Lee, 62, today appealed to Mr Cameron to meet the family to explain why the case will not be taken forward. Mr Lee, who lives in Hartlepool, County Durham, said: 'I want to meet up with the Prime Minister and I want him to look me in the eye and tell me why he isn't looking into the case any further. 'He said he was going to and then he met up with the military police, but why hasn't he asked to meet up with us and get our side?' Mr Cameron promised to look into the case last month when Tory MP Caroline Dinenage raised it during Prime Minister's Questions. Waiting for answers: Katrice's father, Richard Lee, has appealed to Mr Cameron to meet the family and explain why the case will not be taken forward. But Ms Dinenage, the local MP for Katrice's mother, Sharon, of Gosport, Hampshire, received a letter from Mr Cameron stating that the case would not be reinvestigated. Refusal: Mr Cameron was urged to look into the case by Tory MP Caroline Dinenage. Mr Cameron wrote that he had reached the decision following a meeting with military police. It is another blow for Katrice's family, who have campaigned for three decades for police to release their files on the case. They claim military police have been uncooperative over the years and that mistakes were made in the hours after Katrice was reported missing. Mr Lee said: 'Things weren't done that should have been done 30 years ago and now the people who are working in the office with the Prime Minister are people who were never there in the beginning. 'Who better to speak to than us, Katrice's family?' Mr Lee has been working with Hartlepool MP Iain Wright to push for progress in the case. He said: 'I'm not going to let this issue go away.

Which is odd, in that the students at this school are both wealthy and abundant. In fact, the main character lives in a mansion. Makes you wonder how they cannot find money to keep this school alive, have they never heard of property taxes. Oh, but here is the kicker. The school board says that they will keep the school alive, if the students can raise 200,000. So the seniors go about doing this. Hmmm, you raise 200,000 but instead of saving that for college, you put it towards saving the high school that you are a Senior in?

Process: - You breathe in - Diaphragm and other muscles expand to allow room for your lungs to fill - The air flows into the narrow bronchioles in the lungs - From the bronchioles to the alveoli - The oxygen enters into the bloodstream - Is switched with the carbon dioxide in the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide enters through the alveoli - Through the narrow bronchioles - Into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body.  Question: suppose a person is feeling breathless happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen being brought to the body.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If a person is feeling breathless, this could lead to LESS oxygen being brought to the body. Here's how the perturbation would influence the second effect mentioned, which is the diaphragm and other muscles expanding to allow room for the lungs to fill: When a person experiences breathlessness, it is often due to difficulties in the breathing process. This can be caused by various factors such as asthma, lung diseases, or even anxiety. As a result, the diaphragm and other muscles involved in the breathing process might not be able to expand enough to create adequate space for the lungs to fill with air. When this happens, the amount of oxygen entering the system becomes limited. This limitation in oxygen intake will cause a chain reaction that affects the rest of the process: 1. The air flowing into the narrow bronchioles would be reduced, leading to less oxygen reaching the alveoli. 2. Fewer oxygen molecules would be available for exchange in the alveoli, further reducing the oxygen supply in the bloodstream. 3. The switch of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the bloodstream would be less effective, causing more carbon dioxide to remain in the body, potentially exacerbating the feeling of breathlessness. So, the perturbation due to feeling breathless has a LESS effect on the second step mentioned (the expansion of the diaphragm and other muscles) as it hinders the adequate space creation for the lungs to fill with air. This, in turn, reduces oxygen intake and negatively affects the whole breathing process."},{"instruction":"Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose music, from the Fourth Symphony onwards, was strongly influenced by the music of Mahler? ?  After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a...

Brendan Rodgers admits that he will have to win a trophy to be considered a success at Liverpool following last season’s title heartbreak. Liverpool achieved their aim of qualifying for the Champions League but suffered a late stumble in the Premier League title race and lost out to Manchester City on the final day. Rodgers insists the pain of that experience will drive his players on to go one better this season, but has warned that they will be judged on the trophies they win. Wants a trophy: Brendan Rodgers is looking to lead Liverpool to success after last season's slip-up. Team spirit: But the boss insists that means no extra pressure for his side, lead by Steven Gerrard. ‘I want a trophy this year,’ he said. ‘My sole aim in the first three years was to get us into the Champions League. I knew what it meant to the city and the supporters, so my drive in that period was to get us back. ‘Now I want the club to win the big trophies again. That’s what I said to the players. The expectancy this season is continual improvement. We want to win. To be successful is winning trophies. ‘I don’t think it puts pressure on us. We were ahead of schedule last year. I just think there is a real excitement, not pressure of last year. We know we can do it now. We embrace it and I am looking forward to this year. ‘We’ve got players who have had disappointments in their careers and picked themselves up again. We went so close but it is only the beginning for us. I’m super hungry to be a champion and succeed and in the short period of time we have shown we have the credentials to do that. ‘The Premier League is going to be as competitive as ever and we’ve got the belief behind us from the early stages of the season we can win it.’ Agonising: Liverpool - and Gerrard - slipped up at vital times last season, particularly against Chelsea. Dark times: Gerrard has retired from international football to focus on the task ahead with Liverpool. Rodgers believes Liverpool can take heart from Manchester United’s success in the 1990s after Sir Alex Ferguson’s team lost out to Leeds in the race for the old First Division title. ‘If you look at the history of the winning teams they have always come close,’ he added. ‘The United team that won it in 1993, they came close in 1992 when they lost it to Leeds. They came back the following year and won it. That set up an era of winning for them. It has made us even more unified and stronger to be more successful in the future.’ There are concerns about how Liverpool will cope with the loss of Luis Suarez, but Rodgers refuted suggestions that they would be perceived as a selling club after agreeing to let the Uruguay striker join Barcelona for £75million. Moving on: Rodgers insists Liverpool are not a selling club despite Luis Suarez leaving for Barcelona. Step up: Lazar Markovic will be one of those tasked with replacing the Uruguayan forward this season. Loving life: Rodgers oversees a training session during Liverpool's tour of the USA. ‘Liverpool is not a selling club, that’s for sure,’ he said. ‘The big clubs lose the big players at some point. That’s reality. It’s not due to any lack of ambition. Sometimes you lose your best player and the key is planning your success beyond that. ‘Luis had his time here and has looked to move on. He will be in Spain for a time and then end up back in South America. ‘We’re in a really healthy position now. The conversations we’ve had with players and agents is showing the power of the club is back again.’ What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1. Brendan Rodgers admits he needs to win a trophy to be considered a success at Liverpool following the previous season's title heartbreak. 2. Rodgers' initial focus in his first three years was to get Liverpool into the Champions League, which he accomplished. 3.

The little party in the cabin, so disastrously begun, finished, under the mellowing influence of wine and woman, in excellent feeling and with some hilarity.  Mamie, in a plush Gainsborough hat and a gown of wine-coloured silk, sat, an apparent queen, among her rude surroundings and companions.  The dusky litter of the cabin set off her radiant trimness: tarry Johnson was a foil to her fair beauty; she glowed in that poor place, fair as a star; until even I, who was not usually of her admirers, caught a spark of admiration; and even the captain, who was in no courtly humour, proposed that the scene should be commemorated by my pencil.  It was the last act of the evening.  Hurriedly as I went about my task, the half-hour had lengthened out to more than three before it was completed: Mamie in full value, the rest of the party figuring in outline only, and the artist himself introduced in a back view, which was pronounced a likeness.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Sir Arthur John Evans  (8 July 1851 - 11 July 1941) was an English archaeologist and pioneer in the study of Aegean civilization in the Bronze Age. He is most famous for unearthing the palace of Knossos on the Greek island of Crete. Evans continued Heinrich Schliemann's concept of a Mycenaean civilization, but found that he needed to distinguish another civilization, the Minoan, from the structures and artifacts found there and throughout the eastern Mediterranean. Evans was also the first to define Cretan scripts Linear A and Linear B, as well as an earlier pictographic writing. Context: Arthur Evans was born in Nash Mills, England, the first child of John Evans (1823-1908) and Harriet Ann Dickinson (born 1824), his first cousin, the daughter of John's employer, the inventor and founder of Messrs John Dickinson, a paper mill. John Evans came from a family of men who were both educated and intellectually active; they were nevertheless undistinguished by either wealth or aristocratic connection. John's father, Arthur Benoni Evans, Arthur's grandfather, had been headmaster of Market Bosworth Grammar School. John knew Latin and could quote the classical authors.  In 1840, instead of going to college, John started work in the mill owned by his maternal uncle, John Dickinson. He married his cousin, Harriet, in 1850, which entitled him, in 1851, to a junior partnership in the family business. Profits from the mill would eventually help fund Arthur's excavations, restorations at Knossos, and resulting publications. For the time being they were an unpretentious and affectionate family. They moved into a brick row house built for the purpose near the mill, which came to be called the \\"red house\\" because it lacked the sooty patina of the other houses. Harriet called her husband \\"Jack.\\" Grandmother Evans called Arthur \\"darling Trot,\\" asserting in a note that, compared to his father, he was \\"a bit of a dunce.\\" In 1856, with Harriet's declining health and Jack's growing reputation and prosperity, they moved into Harriet's childhood home, a mansion with a garden, where the children ran free.  John maintained his status as an officer in the company, which eventually became John Dickinson Stationery, but also became distinguished for his pursuits in numismatics, geology and archaeology. His interest in geology came from an assignment by the company to study the diminishing water resources in the area with a view toward protecting the company from lawsuits. The mill consumed large amounts of water, which was also needed for the canals. He became an expert and a legal consultant. However, collecting was endemic to the family; his father and grandfather both had done it. He was more interested in the stone-age artifacts he was discovering while mapping stream beds. As Arthur grew older, he was allowed to assist John in looking for artifacts and later classifying the collection.  Ultimately John became a distinguished antiquary, publishing numerous books and articles. In 1859 he conducted a geological survey of the Somme Valley with Joseph Prestwich. His connections and invaluable advice were indispensable to Arthur's career throughout the remainder of his long life.  Arthur's mother, Harriet, died in 1858 when Arthur was seven. He had two brothers, Philip Norman (1854) and Lewis (1853), and two sisters, Alice (1858) and Harriet (1857). He would remain on excellent terms with all of them all of his life. He was raised by a stepmother, Fanny (Frances), nee Phelps, with whom he also got along very well. She had no children of her own and also predeceased her husband. John's third wife was a classical scholar, Maria Millington Lathbury. When he was 70 they had a daughter, Joan, who would become an art historian. John died in 1908 at 85, when Arthur was 57. His close support and assistance had been indispensable in excavating and conceptualizing Minoan civilization. Question: What else occured in his family Answer:","output":"During the course of Arthur Evans's life, several significant events, transitions, and dynamics characterized the family in which he lived. After Evans's birth in Nash Mills, England, his family consisted of his parents, John Evans (1823-1908) and Harriet Ann Dickinson (1824-?), his father's cousin and the daughter of John’s employer. In addition to Evans, his parents had another four children: two brothers, Philip Norman (1854) and Lewis (1853), and two sisters, Alice (1858) and Harriet (1857). Despite the adversity and trials that life exhibited, the family nurtured deep loving relationships, with Evans remaining on cordial terms with his siblings throughout his life. A significant event transpired in 1858 when Harriet, Arthur's mother, tragically passed away when he was just seven. Following Harriet's death, the family dynamics were altered when Fanny (Frances), nee Phelps, became his stepmother. Despite the possibility of tension in such circumstances, Fanny, who had no children of her own, managed to foster a warm relationship with Arthur. However, she predeceased her husband, after which John married for a third time to Maria Millington Lathbury, a classical scholar. John, upon reaching the age of 70, expanded the family by having a daughter with Maria named Joan who later became an art historian. When Arthur was 57, John died at the ripe age of 85. This moment was a critical juncture in the narrative of the family and Arthur's life. John had been a critical source of guidance, support, knowledge, and inspiration for Arthur, making profound contributions to his groundbreaking excavations and pioneering conceptualizations of the Minoan civilization. The household was a scholarly one filled with a variety of intellectual pursuits. Arthur's father, John, held an innate curiosity about the world, as he was interested in numismatics, geology, and archaeology, eventually becoming an esteemed antiquary. Such an enriching environment inevitably shaped and encouraged Arthur's pursuits in the same realm. To sum up, Arthur Evans's family experienced various transformations due to births, deaths, and marriages. These changes in family structure significantly influenced Evans's upbringing and later career. The intellectual atmosphere in the family nurtured Arthur's love for archaeology and contributed to his remarkable discoveries in the field, impacting the course of archaeology and his studies on Aegean civilization in the Bronze Age."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Determine the sentiment: I had been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for quite a while...what with all it's raving reviews, nominations and media attention. And I must say, the first quarter of the movie was good! It really portrayed the black music scene back then. However, as the movie wore on, me and my whole family were bored out of our wits. The singing just kept coming, one after the other. I mean seriously, just one more music number and it would have broke even with RENT. Furthermore, I noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters; I just didn't care what happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphy's character died of a drug overdose, I knew I should have been sad, but I just couldn't feel any emotion for that character. The characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot, but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me in. Finally, the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care, which goes along with the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of a copy-cat movie based on Ray, Chicago, and Rent (Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion). Overall I think this movie would best suit someone who doesn't really care about an overall story, yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances.","output":"To determine the sentiment of this review, I will analyze the provided text in terms of positive and negative aspects, as well as the overall tone. 1.

The review continues by saying that the first quarter of the movie was good, and praises the portrayal of the black music scene.    - This supports a positive sentiment. 3. However, the user goes on to mention that the movie became boring for the entire family as it went on, with too much focus on the singing.    - This indicates a transition to a negative sentiment. 4. The review highlights the lack of character development and the inability to care for the characters.    - This reinforces the negative sentiment. 5.

Aspiring filmmaker Sean is working as a freelance driver to make ends meet. He's assigned to deliver an expensive Mercedes-Benz from Los Angeles all the way to its owner in Miami, which will also allow him to attend the wedding of his sister. He's given strict instructions not to damage the vehicle or pick up any hitchhikers. Sean is driving cross country when he picks up Nick, a hitchhiker who happens to be a vampire hunter hunting a group of vampires led by one of the Forsaken--a group of knights who made a pact with the fallen angel Abaddon to live forever. Two of the Forsaken are located in the United States (including the one Nick is tracking, Kit). Nick was bitten and infected by a vampire but, thanks to an antiviral drug cocktail, the vampire virus is kept at bay. Each of the Forsaken carry a unique strain of vampirism; killing a Forsaken kills his entire bloodline and reverses the condition of anyone infected. Nick believes that if he kills Kit, he will be cured before he turns (as the drug cocktail eventually will lose effect). At first Sean is less than willing to indulge his new acquaintance; however, he is convinced after the two come across a disoriented young woman, Megan, at a diner, who was bitten by the vampires and left for dead. Nick also proves he is telling the truth by killing a vampire, Teddy, with exposure to sunlight. Sean and Nick take Megan to their motel room, but she goes into a rage and bites Sean; they realize they must kill the Forsaken responsible to prevent Sean from turning. Forsaken can only be slain on hallowed ground, so the three head for a Spanish mission 60 miles away. They stop at a gas station where an old woman, Ina, lets them in. She shows them a newspaper connecting Megan to a bloodbath in Arizona; when Megan wakes up and is coherent enough to talk, she explains she was a victim of the vampires' bloodbath. Kit catches up to them and lays siege to the gas station.

I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who was appointed as chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London? is inside the article: In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: \\"I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.\\"Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of person who in her memoirs, says that for a fortnight Mahler was \\"haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration\\"?  By the summer of 1906, Mahler had been director of the Vienna Hofoper for nine years. Throughout this time his practice was to leave Vienna at the close of the Hofoper season for a summer retreat, where he could devote himself to composition. Since 1899 this had been at Maiernigg, near the resort town of Maria Wörth in Carinthia, southern Austria, where Mahler built a villa overlooking the Wörthersee. In these restful surroundings Mahler completed his Symphonies No. 4, No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7, his Rückert songs and his song cycle Kindertotenlieder (\\"Songs on the Death of Children\\").Until 1901, Mahler's compositions had been heavily influenced by the German folk-poem collection Des Knaben Wunderhorn (\\"The Youth's Magic Horn\\"), which he had first encountered around 1887. The music of Mahler's many Wunderhorn settings is reflected in his Symphonies No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4, which all employ vocal as well as instrumental forces. From about 1901, however, Mahler's music underwent a change in character as he moved into the middle period of his compositional life. Here, the more austere poems of Friedrich Rückert replace the Wunderhorn collection as the primary influence; the songs are less folk-related, and no longer infiltrate the symphonies as extensively as before. During this period Symphonies No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7 were written, all as purely instrumental works, portrayed by Mahler scholar Deryck Cooke as \\"more stern and forthright ..., more tautly symphonic, with a new granite-like hardness of orchestration\\".Mahler arrived at Maiernigg in June 1906 with the draft manuscript of his Seventh Symphony; he intended to spend time revising the orchestration until an idea for a new work should strike. The composer's wife Alma Mahler, in her memoirs, says that for a fortnight Mahler was \\"haunted by the spectre of failing inspiration\\"; Mahler's recollection, however, is that on the first day of the vacation he was seized by the creative spirit, and plunged immediately into composition of the work that would become his...

Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop.  and a hint : In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.  Please answer this question : Which crop would need more number of chemicals, crop A or crop B? Answer:","output":"Crop B would need more number of chemicals, as it is not tolerant of herbicides. Crop A has been genetically engineered to be herbicide tolerant, which allows it to grow while the herbicides kill the weeds.

Here is a premise: \\"The boy in blue has the ball, and the boy in white is airborne.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"The boys are alive\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","output":"The premise provided is: \\"The boy in blue has the ball, and the boy in white is airborne.\\" This premise offers a description of a specific moment and details about two boys engaged in an activity. Based on this premise, we can draw on a general understanding that describes a situation involving the boys, the clothes they are wearing, and their actions. The hypothesis given is: \\"The boys are alive.\\" The hypothesis makes a general claim about the existence and state of life of the two boys mentioned in the premise. In order to evaluate whether the premise supports the hypothesis, it is essential to identify and analyze relevant information contributing to the inference or potential support for the hypothesis. The premise consists of two parts: 1. The boy in blue has the ball. 2. The boy in white is airborne. Let's analyze both these parts:  1. The boy in blue has the ball: This statement tells us that one of the boys wears blue clothing and is currently holding or interacting with a ball. It is reasonable to assume that engaging in such an activity often requires someone to be alive, as having the ball denotes intentional actions like holding, catching, or controlling the ball. 2. The boy in white is airborne: This statement tells us that the other boy is wearing white clothing and is in a state of being off the ground or mid-air. Being airborne suggests activities like jumping, running, or performing other physical or sports-related actions. Again, it is reasonable to presume that engaging in these activities requires someone to be alive. The ability to perform these actions suggests that the body is functional and capable of voluntary movement. Both statements provide indirect evidence to support the hypothesis that the boys are alive.

In the 1994 TV documentary Hocus Pocus: Begin the Magic, and on the film's Blu-ray release, producer David Kirschner said he came up with the idea for the film one night.

The film's concept was conceived by producer David Kirschner, who came up with the idea during a whimsical moment with his daughter. This anecdote was shared in the 1994 TV documentary Hocus Pocus: Begin the Magic and also mentioned on the film's Blu-ray release. Kirschner's inspiration emerged from a chance encounter with his neighbor's black cat. He invented a story about how the cat was once a boy who was transformed into a feline by three witches three hundred years ago. This idea laid the foundation for the magical world of Hocus Pocus, featuring the Sanderson sisters and the talking cat, Binx. Screenwriters Mick Garris and Neil Cuthbert, along with Kirschner, then developed the story into the full-fledged script that became the film Hocus Pocus. It was directed by Kenny Ortega and released in 1993. Although there are numerous books, including novelizations and sequels, that have been released since the film's debut, it is important to stress that the original movie is not an adaptation of a pre-existing book. These subsequent literary works were instead inspired by the film itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller. He told the cable show Fox and Friends on Thursday that he'll \\"try and stay away\\" from the Justice Department, but \\"at some point, I... Who is Mueller?

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the rank of the man accused of attacking the widow?  Around 1880, two young British officers arrive to join a regiment in India. One, Lieutenant Drake, from a middle-class background, is extremely eager to fit in while the other, Lieutenant Millington, the son of a general, is keen to get out as soon as possible and deliberately antagonizes his fellow officers. The two newcomers learn the traditions of the regiment, one of which is a mess game in which they chase a wooden pig on wheels, attempting to pierce its anus with their swords. Mrs Scarlett, the flirtatious and attractive widow of a captain who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, is a constant presence in the regiment.  One night at a mess dance, Millington gets drunk and tries to seduce Mrs Scarlett in the garden. She repels him, but moments later runs back into the mess wounded and in shock, claiming the culprit was Millington. An informal court martial -more a mock trial than anything else- is organized with Drake ordered to be Millington's defending officer. Although Drake is pressured by his superior officer to plead guilty for Millington and close the case quickly, he begins to challenge the orders in order to give the defendant a fair trial. Drake learns from an Indian servant that another widow suffered a similar attack with a sword six months earlier, before he and Millington joined. After irrefutable evidence, Mrs Scarlett finally admits it was not Millington who attacked her but will not say who the culprit is. Millington, now indisputably proved innocent, is welcomed back by his brother officers; but Drake, disgusted by the truth he's uncovered, resigns. One officer knows who the culprit is and, hiding Drake in the shadows so he may witness what is to take place, confronts the guilty man privately in the final scene.

The realization that her fitness journey had not only benefitted her but also inspired others made her feel even more motivated and determined to continue pushing herself to new heights. As the conversation continued, Christine eagerly inquired about the specific routines, dietary changes, and lifestyle adjustments that Carrie had adopted in her pursuit of a toned and sculpted physique. Carrie gladly shared her experiences, discussing the grueling early morning workouts, the strict adherence to a balanced and nutrient-dense meal plan, and the importance of maintaining a positive mindset amid inevitable setbacks and challenges. Christine listened attentively, taking mental notes as she began envisioning how she might apply some of Carrie's proven techniques in her own quest for self-improvement. Noticing Christine's interest, Carrie offered to accompany her friend to the gym and guide her through a custom workout plan, which Christine enthusiastically accepted, excited by the prospect of having a reliable and supportive workout partner. The two friends approached their shared fitness journey with gusto, finding that the bond of camaraderie and mutual encouragement greatly enhanced their motivation and commitment to achieving their goals. Week by week, they were delighted to observe visible progress, as they each grew stronger, leaner, and more confident in their physical abilities. Moreover, the positive effects of their rigorous exercise regimen and nutritious diet plan extended far beyond the improvement of their physical appearance, as both Christine and Carrie experienced increased energy levels, improved mood, and enhanced mental clarity. It seemed that their holistic approach to health and wellness had led to a profound and lasting transformation, not only of their bodies but also of their minds and spirits. Ultimately, Christine's simple act of acknowledging Carrie's achievements and expressing genuine praise served as a catalyst for a life-changing journey that would impact both of their lives in ways they could have never anticipated. It was a poignant reminder that a single, heartfelt compliment or word of encouragement can often be the spark that ignites another person's passion, propelling them to self-discovery and growth.

Article: More than 1300 men and women from five countries were asked to colour in areas of the human body that they would allow particular people to touch, from their partner to a stranger and to say for which purposes they would allow touch. The answers were combined to create maps that show how touchable areas of the body are for particular relationships (eg partner, uncle, acquaintance) and also which areas are taboo.      Some results are unsurprising. For example, the maps confirm that women are uncomfortable with being touched by male strangers on most of their body, while men do not want relatives of either gender to touch their genitals. British people are less comfortable with touching than people from the other countries sampled (Finland, France, Italy and Russia). In general, regardless of nationality, the closer the relationship, the greater the area that can be touched.      ‘The results indicate that touching is an important means of maintaining social relationships. The touch space map is closely associated with the pleasure caused by touching. The greater the pleasure caused by touching a specific area of the body, the more selectively we allow others to touch it,’ says researcher Juulia Suvilehto from Aalto University.      Other results were less expected. Italians were less comfortable with being touched than Russians, while overall Finns were the most comfortable with being touched. Also, our willingness to be touched does not fade over time.      We also interpret touch depending on the context of the relationship Professor Robin Dunbar, Department of Experimental Psychology      Oxford University’s Professor Robin Dunbar said: ‘It is the relationship rather than familiarity that matters. A friend we haven’t seen for some time will still be able to touch areas where an acquaintance we see every day would not.      ‘We also interpret touch depending on the context of the relationship – we may perceive a touch in a particular place from a relative or friend as a comforting gesture, while the same touch from a partner might be more pleasurable, and from a stranger it would be entirely unwelcome.      ‘Touch is universal. While culture does modulate how we experience it, generally we all respond to touching in the same ways. Even in an era of mobile communications and social media, touch is still important for establishing and maintaining the bonds between people.’ ||||| Where Men And Women Liked To Be Touched      Trending News: The Beginner's Guide To Touching People      Why Is This Important?      Because everyone has their personal bubble.      Long Story Short      Researchers at Oxford University polled over 1,300 men and women to ask them a simple question: Who do you allow to touch you, and where? The results, while not entirely unexpected, reveal some surprising quirks.      Long Story      When we think about touching, we usually think about it in black and white terms: There are people we’re ok with touching us, and people we aren’t. But in reality, it goes much deeper than that. To find out how much deeper, researchers from Oxford University surveyed over 1,300 men and women from five different countries to determine whom people allow to touch them, and where they’re comfortable being touched.      Oxford University/Aalto University      What you’re looking at is the aggregated data in graphical form of where people are comfortable being touched, based on their relationships. The lighter areas show where people are comfortable, while darker areas signal discomfort. The black areas outlined in blue are “off-limits” zones, where they’re absolutely not comfortable being touched by that particular person.      Overall, the results are not that surprising. People are perfectly fine being touched almost anywhere by romantic partners, and not comfortable being touched at all, really, by strangers. It gets weirder the longer you stare at it, though. For instance, people are uniformly less comfortable being touched in the pelvis area by males of any relationship, which isn’t surprising — no one wants their uncle’s hands on their junk, whether you’re a guy or a girl. But then, oddly, everyone seems to be less comfortable with men touching them specifically below the knees.      Here’s the same graphic, broken out by gender:      Oxford University/Aalto University      Now, we see a little more continuity. Women apparently have no issues with having their sisters, mothers and friends (of both genders!) all up in their crotch business, but men are only (hilariously) somewhat ok with being touched in the wang region by female friends, acquaintances and strangers — it would appear that as long as there’s no law or social convention preventing us from schtupping a lady, we’ll tolerate her handling our packages. Women are less protective of their butts than men are, and will also tolerate touching in the chest region until we get down to the uncle. If you’re a very strange sort of guy who’s ever wondered whether or not your sister would let you grab her boobs, the answer may surprise you!      Other tidbits the researchers discovered include that people from Finland are the most comfortable being touched overall, while Brits are the least comfortable. Women, generally speaking, are more receptive to touch than men across all relationships.      If any of this is surprising to you, then you probably have people in your life who wish you would stop touching them.

Born Richard Henry Sellers on September 8, 1925, in Southsea, Hampshire, England, Peter Sellers was a highly versatile and influential British actor and comedian. He is best remembered for his roles in the British film series 'The Pink Panther' as the iconic Inspector Jacques Clouseau. Throughout his career, he appeared in numerous films, displaying his ability to slip seamlessly into different characters, each with a distinctly unique persona. In contrast, Britt Ekland was born Britt-Marie Eklund on October 6, 1942, in Stockholm, Sweden. She developed a career as an actress, singer, and model, making her mark in both European and American films. Ekland gained international recognition in the 1960s and 1970s, starring in popular films such as 'The Night They Raided Minsky's' (1968), 'Get Carter' (1971), and as a Bond girl named Mary Goodnight in the James Bond film 'The Man with the Golden Gun' (1974). The couple first met in early 1964 at a dinner party held by Peter's agent, Dennis Selinger. Sellers and Ekland quickly became smitten with each other, and after only a short ten-day courtship, they were married. The wedding took place on February 19, 1964, at a small ceremony in Guildford, Surrey, England. The marriage garnered a great deal of media attention at the time due to their status as high-profile celebrities. Despite the lavish and high-profile lifestyle they shared, their marriage was often marked by turbulence, with a fair share of ups and downs. Sellers and Ekland had one child together, a daughter named Victoria, who was born on January 20, 1965. However, their marriage eventually came to an end, and the couple divorced in December 1968.  Throughout his life, Peter Sellers was married four times in total, including his marriage to Ekland. His first wife was Anne Levy, whom he married in 1951 and divorced in 1961. After his marriage to Ekland, he went on to marry Miranda Quarry in 1970, but their marriage also ended in divorce in 1974. His final marriage was to Lynne Frederick in 1977, who remained his wife until Sellers' untimely death on July 24, 1980. Britt Ekland, on the other hand, had three marriages in total. Prior to marrying Sellers, she was married to Peter Hall from 1960 to 1962. After her marriage to Sellers, she later married Stray Cats drummer Slim Jim Phantom in 1984, but they also divorced in 1992."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A:","output":"Autolux and Polvo are both types of alternative rock bands that have made significant contributions to the music landscape, particularly in the genres of indie rock, experimental rock, and noise rock. These bands share some similarities regarding their musical styles and influences but are also quite distinct in terms of their origins, members, discography, and overall impact on the alternative rock scene. Autolux is an American alternative rock band originating from Los Angeles, California, formed in 2000. The band consists of members Eugene Goreshter (vocals/bass), Carla Azar (vocals/drums), and Greg Edwards (vocals/guitar). Autolux's music is characterized by its blending of ethereal melodies, ambient soundscapes, and fuzz-laden guitar work. They incorporate elements of shoegaze, post-rock, and electronic music in their distinctive sound. Their debut studio album \\"Future Perfect\\" (2004), produced by notable producer T-Bone Burnett, was well-received by critics and garnered a dedicated fan following. The album showcased the band's ability to juxtapose melodic tracks with more experimental noise rock offerings. They went on to release two more studio albums, \\"Transit Transit\\" (2010) and \\"Pussy's Dead\\" (2016), continuing to evolve and experiment with their music, gaining praise and recognition for their unique contribution to the alternative rock genre. Polvo is an influential American indie rock band formed in Chapel Hill, North Carolina in 1990. The band was initially composed of Ash Bowie (vocals/guitar), Dave Brylawski (guitar/vocals), Steve Popson (bass), and Eddie Watkins (drums). Polvo's music is primarily known for its complex guitar interplay, irregular time signatures, and unorthodox song structures, placing them within the realm of math rock and noise rock. Throughout their career, Polvo has released a number of well-regarded albums that have served as significant influences on fellow musicians and the alternative rock scene as a whole. Their debut album \\"Cor-Crane Secret\\" (1992) along with other notable releases such as \\"Today's Active Lifestyles\\" (1993), \\"Celebrate the New Dark Age\\" (1994), and \\"Exploded Drawing\\" (1996) demonstrated their adventurous and innovative approach to music, resonating with fans and critics alike. However, the band went on an extended hiatus after releasing \\"Shapes\\" (1997), eventually reuniting in 2008 and released \\"In Prism\\" (2009) and \\"Siberia\\" (2013). In conclusion, Autolux and Polvo are both types of alternative rock bands that have had a lasting impact on the indie rock, experimental rock, and noise rock genres. Despite their different origins and musical trajectories, both bands have been praised for their ingenuity, innovation, and the distinctive styles they brought to the alternative rock landscape. Autolux's atmospheric, shoegaze-tinged sound contrasts with Polvo's more angular, math-rock approach, but both bands share a common dedication to pushing creative boundaries in their respective corners of the music world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Danish and US researchers say warmer air and sea surface could lead to record lows of sea ice at north pole next year      The Arctic is experiencing extraordinarily hot sea surface and air temperatures, which are stopping ice forming and could lead to record lows of sea ice at the north pole next year, according to scientists.      Danish and US researchers monitoring satellites and Arctic weather stations are surprised and alarmed by air temperatures peaking at what they say is an unheard-of 20C higher than normal for the time of year. In addition, sea temperatures averaging nearly 4C higher than usual in October and November.      “It’s been about 20C warmer than normal over most of the Arctic Ocean, along with cold anomalies of about the same magnitude over north-central Asia. This is unprecedented for November,” said research professor Jennifer Francis of Rutgers university.      Temperatures have been only a few degrees above freezing when -25C should be expected, according to Francis. “These temperatures are literally off the charts for where they should be at this time of year. It is pretty shocking. The Arctic has been breaking records all year. It is exciting but also scary,” she said.      Francis said the near-record low sea ice extent this summer had led to a warmer than usual autumn. That in turn had reduced the temperature difference between the Arctic and mid-latitudes.            “This helped make the jet stream wavier and allowed more heat and moisture to be driven into Arctic latitudes and perpetuate the warmth. It’s a vicious circle,” she added.            Sea ice, which forms and melts each year, has declined more than 30% in the past 25 years. This week it has been at the lowest extent ever recorded for late November. According to the US government’s National Snow and Ice Data Centre, (NSIDC), around 2m square kilometres less ice has formed since September than average. The level is far below the same period in 2012, when sea ice went on to record its lowest ever annual level.      Francis said she was convinced that the cause of the high temperatures and ice loss was climate change. “It’s all expected. There is nothing but climate change that can cause these trends. This is all headed in the same direction and picking up speed.”      Rasmus Tonboe, a sea ice remote sensing expert at the Danish Meteorological Institute in Copenhagen, said: “Sea surface temperatures in the Kara and Barents seas are much warmer than usual. That makes it very difficult for sea ice to freeze.      Record-breaking temperatures 'have robbed the Arctic of its winter' Read more      “When we have large areas of open water, it also raises air temperatures, and it has been up to 10/15C warmer. Six months ago the sea ice was breaking up unusually early. This made more open water and allowed the sunlight to be absorbed, which is why the Arctic is warmer this year,” he said.      “What we are seeing is both surprising and alarming. This is faster than the models. It is alarming because it has consequences.”            Julienne Stroeve, the professor of polar observation at University College London said ice that should be growing at this time of year was retreating. “It’s been a crazy year. There is no ice at Svalbard yet. In the last few days there has been a decline in sea ice in the Bering sea. Very warm air has flooded into the Arctic from the south, pressing the ice northwards.      “Air temperature drives the formation of the ice. It has been really delayed this year so the ice is also much thinner than it usually is. The speed at which this is happening surprises me. In the Arctic the trend has been clear for years, but the speed at which it is happening is faster than anyone thought,” said Strove.      “Ice is very sensitive to weather. There is a huge high pressure over the Kara sea, and Eurasia and Canada. We are seeing very strong winds bringing warm air north.”      The significance of the ice forming late is that this affects its growth the following year, with consequences for climate. “Extreme wind and high air temperatures [now],” she said, “could see ice extent drop next year below the record 2012 year”.      She added: “The ice could be even thinner than it was at the start of 2012. This is definitely a strange year.”      Ed Blockley, the lead scientist of the UK Met Office’s polar climate group, said: “The sea ice is extremely low. It is freezing but very slowly. Last week the Barents sea reduced its ice cover. There was less ice at the end than the start.      “These temperature anomalies are not unprecedented but this is certainly extraordinary. We are seeing a continual decline in ice. It it likely to be a hiccup but it puts us in bad starting position for next year.” ||||| November started out pretty normal for the Arctic. The sun had set for the season, temperatures were dropping, ice was growing rapidly. Winter was coming, right on schedule. And then, a few days ago, everything came screeching to a halt. Ice stopped forming. And then it actually started to melt, thanks to a sudden heat wave that blistered the region with temperatures 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit above average. For now, the mass of warm air doesn’t appear to be going anywhere.      That’s bad news for sea ice. Coverage in the Arctic was already at its lowest levels since researchers began using satellite data to measure it back in 1978. And as of November 19, Arctic sea ice was nearly 350,000 square miles below its extent in 2012, the last record-low year. The extreme weather has scientists scrambling to figure out what’s causing the historical temperatures, and more importantly, what their long-term impacts could be.      Climate Change Institute/University of Maine      “It’s absurdly warm over the Arctic Ocean right now and the question is, where the heck is all that heat in the ocean coming from?,” says Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, CO. “No one has a real handle on that yet.”      There are a few likely explanations. At this time of year, without the sun’s rays, the ocean begins to lose its heat in the form of infrared radiation. On its way to outer space, the radiation has to pass through the atmosphere, and water vapor and carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap and absorb some of that radiation, heating up in the process.      That’s all pretty normal. But this year, atmospheric circulation patterns are bringing more warmth to the Arctic than usual. Last month, an unusually high pressure system centered over Scandinavia brought in a flow of warm southerly air between Greenland and Norway. At the same time, in the Pacific, an abnormally low pressure system formed just east of Russia, along the Kamchatka Peninsula. That drew in warm heat from the mainland up toward Alaska and the Bering Sea. With their powers combined, they blasted the Arctic with a heavy, sweaty dose of hot air.      This wouldn’t be such a big deal on its own, but warmer and more humid air increases the greenhouse effect. It becomes more and more difficult for the ocean to transmit heat away from its surface, and more and more difficult for ice to form. Which is one explanation for why Arctic sea ice cover continues to run at record low levels this late into the year.      The effects are being felt far below the 66th parallel. States in the Upper Midwest experienced their warmest falls ever, with temperatures running about 15 degrees warmer than average through the second week of November. Minnesota experienced the longest growing season ever recorded: 220 days. And the Twin Cities set a record for the latest frost in history.      On his weather nerd cult blog the Updraft, Minnesota Public Radio chief meteorologist Paul Huttner said that the Arctic “was broken.” Normally, northwest winds blow down from the Arctic over snow-covered ground and iced-over lakes before reaching the US. But this year bare ground all the way up the Arctic circle allowed the sun to warm the upstream air mass more efficiently (no snow means no albedo effect). “The Arctic is North America’s refrigerator,” Huttner says. “If it stops getting as cold as it should, the effects are felt far and wide. I always say that the Arctic is no Las Vegas. Whatever happens in the Arctic, doesn’t stay in the Arctic.”      Which is why climate scientists are gathering data points to try to understand what this anomaly means for the future. It’s too soon to tell if the extreme temperatures are part of a pattern or just an outlier, Serreze says. But if there’s one thing history teaches us, it’s that the Arctic is not as resilient as it once was. Thick layers of old sea ice are the Arctic’s buffer against rare weather events—and that kind of ice has been rapidly disappearing. In the 1980s, multiyear ice made up 20 percent of sea ice cover; today, it’s only 3 percent. As those numbers decline, the Arctic becomes more vulnerable to wide temperature fluctuations.      “Had that same pattern set up in 1980, the sea ice could have taken the punch,” say Serreze. “Now it can’t. And what we’ve learned is that the response of the ice to these extreme events is changing, and with it so are the odds. It loads the dice.”      Dear Arctic, may the odds be ever in your favor. ||||| NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio      It’s an internet sensation. An alarming graph showing the global area of sea ice falling to unprecedented lows for this time of year has gone viral.      The graph adds together the area of sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic to show the global total.      Wipneus Advertisement      It was compiled by a contributor to the Arctic Sea Ice blog called Wipneus, rather than an official source, but it is accurate. The latest version can be found here. One scientist suggested the trend was due to a sensor error, but this is not the case. So, should we be worried?      Here’s what you need to know.      This is a weather event, not a climate event      What’s happening in the Arctic would be impossible without a century of global warming causing a long-term decline in sea ice levels — but it is actually a short-term weather event.      At this time of year, sea ice should be growing rapidly as winter sets in. But the cold air that usually sits over the pole has flowed south over Siberia, while warmer air has flowed north. This has resulted in temperatures an astonishing 20 °C warmer than usual, so sea ice is melting when it should be forming.

Antarctic sea ice is pretty much at an all time low for this time of year. pic.twitter.com/oqTdTpPCrr — Eric Steig (@ericsteig) November 21, 2016      So, sea ice levels at both poles are much lower than the seasonal average.      Antarctic sea ice levels have actually been increasing slightly over the past three decades, so this low is unusual. The increase could be due to a combination of stronger winds spreading out the sea ice and fresh water from melting ice on land diluting seawater so it freezes at higher temperatures.      Global warming may be making freak weather events in the Arctic more likely      All weather events are influenced by climate change as they now take place in a world more than 1 °C warmer than a century ago.      There is growing evidence that the crazy weather we’re seeing in the Arctic and surrounding regions is made far more likely by climate change. Normally, cold air is kept locked up in the Arctic by a spinning vortex of air bounded by fast winds high in the atmosphere called the jet stream.      Now, more and more often, the jet stream seems to weaken and allow cold Arctic air to flow south, with warm air flowing north to replace it. This odd jet stream behaviour could be to blame for many of the freakishly cold weather events in recent years as well as current events.      Yes, we should be worried      What’s happening now is alarming, but it’s not the short-term craziness we should be worrying about. The reason to be alarmed is that this kind of event can happen only because the planet is so much warmer than in pre-industrial times.      Sea ice in the Arctic might fall to a record low next year, but it is likely to then briefly “recover” for a few years before falling to new record lows. How do we know? Because there are negative and positive feedback effects at work.      For instance, open water exposed by the loss of sea ice soaks up more of the sun’s heat during summer, but it also loses much more heat in autumn.      What will happen to the sea ice in Antarctica over the next few years is less clear. We don’t have a good understanding of what’s going on there, largely because we don’t have good data. We have no idea how thick the sea ice around Antarctica is, for instance.      In the long term, however, Antarctic sea ice is expected to decline too.      The loss of sea ice does not directly raise global sea levels, but it is already affecting us all through its effects on the weather. As the planet continues to warm we are going to see even more freakish weather. |||||Summary:","output":"The Arctic Ocean is experiencing air temperatures that are 20C higher than normal and sea temperatures that are 4C higher than average, meaning ice is not forming at the usual rate and could lead to record lows of polar ice next year, warn scientists from the US and Denmark. They add that the cause is climate change and fear that high temperatures and ice loss could lead to more extreme weather worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step-by-step explanation and justification: 1. Capitalize \\"Passover\\" as it is a proper noun referring to a specific Jewish holiday. 2. Add a comma after \\"Passover\\" to separate the two prepositional phrases \\"in Jerusalem at the Passover\\" and \\"at the feast.\\" 3. Add a comma after \\"feast\\" to separate the two main clauses: \\"many believed in his name\\" and \\"beholding his signs which he wrought.\\" The comma helps to provide a pause and separate the action (believing) from the reason (beholding the signs). 4.

In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red. Two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf. Regardless of which story is true, the red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts; this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the club reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season.

Someone knocks on his door, and knowing it's Julian, the paid assassin, he refuses to answer. But did he really?  Richard Shephard, the director of \\"The Matador\\", presents us with a character, Julian Noble, who shows no redeemable qualities. In fact, we have already seen him in action, doing what he does best. When Julian meets Danny at the bar of the Camino Real in Mexico City, he spills the beans and tells his new acquaintance what he really does for a living. Danny, who has come to sell his program to a Mexican company, but it seems he is competing against a local outfit that appears to be in the front for getting the contract. Danny is a naive person who falls prey of the charisma and charm doled out by the smarter Julian. It's not until some time later, on a cold winter night that the killer appears at Danny's door asking his friend to repay a favor and accompany him on a trip to Tucson. It's at this point that the secret that binds them together is revealed in an unexpected way. Pierce Brosnan, acting against type, makes a great contribution with his irreverent Julian Noble.

Article: Animals are natural resources that people have wasted all through our history. Animals have been killed for their fur and feathers, for food, for sport, and simply because they were in the way. Thousands of kinds of animals have disappeared from the world forever. Hundreds more are on the danger list today. About 170 kinds in the United States alone are considered in danger. Why should people care? Because we need animals. And because once they are gone, there will never be any more. Animals are more than just beautiful and interesting. They are more than just a source of food. Every animal has its place in the balance of nature  . Destroying one kind of animal can create many problems. For example, when farmers killed large numbers of hawks  , the farmers' stores of corn and grain were destroyed by rats and mice. Why? Because hawks eat rats and mice. With no hawks to keep down their numbers, the rats and mice multiplied quickly. Luckily, some people are working to help save the animals. Some groups raise money to let people know about the problem. And they try to get the governments to pass laws protecting animals in danger. Quite a few countries have passed laws. These laws forbid   the killing of any animals or plants on the danger list. Slowly, the number of some animals in danger is growing. Question: What has happened to the animals on the earth? Answer: Answer:","output":"Many animals on Earth have been killed or faced extinction due to human activities, such as hunting for fur, feathers, food, sport, or due to habitat destruction. Thousands of animal species have disappeared forever, with hundreds more currently on the danger list. Some efforts are being made to protect endangered animals through conservation and legislation, which has slowly increased the numbers of some species in danger."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Who does Snaps have a meeting with? Title: Oscar Movie plot: In the prologue, gangster Angelo \\"Snaps\\" Provolone promises his dying father (Kirk Douglas) that he will give up a life of crime, and instead \\"go straight\\". A month later, Snaps awakes at his mansion and begins his important morning. He has a meeting with several prominent bankers, as he hopes to donate a large sum of cash and join the bankâs board of trustees, thereby having an honest job and keeping his word to his father. Anthony Rossano, Snaps's young, good-natured accountant, arrives at the mansion and tells his boss that heâs in love, asks for a 250% raise, then tells Snaps the true love he speaks of is actually \\"Snaps's daughter.\\" Snaps is furious, does not want his daughter marrying Anthony and goes to talk to his daughter, Lisa. Lisa is the only child of Snaps and Sofia, a spoiled daughter whose dreams of seeing the worldâs great sights run into a roadblock because of her overly protective father. Wishing to move out of the house, she lies to her parents (at the suggestion of the maid, Nora) and claims to be pregnant. Snaps, believing the father to be Anthony (as he wants to marry \\"Snaps's daughter\\"), is shocked when Lisa says the father is Oscar, the former chauffeur who is now serving overseas in the military. Things get even more complicated when Anthony learns that Theresa, the woman he fell in love with, is not actually Snaps' daughter as she had claimed to be. Before Anthony can catch on, Snaps tricks him into agreeing to marry his actual daughter, Lisa, who is supposedly pregnant but without a husband. Both Lisa and Anthony are unhappy at the hasty arrangement, and the pair luck out when Lisa falls in love with someone else: Dr. Thornton Poole, Snaps' dialectician, whose frequent world travels appeal to her adventurous nature. Meanwhile, local police lieutenant Toomey is keeping an eye on the mansion, believing that Snaps is meeting with Chicago mobsters soon. Also watching Snaps is mob rival Vendetti, who, too, believes that Snaps is meeting Chicago mobsters. Vendetti plans a hit on...

The shirt matched her shoes, but did not go with her socks, as the  Options:  a). shoes were a matching color to it.;  b). socks were a matching color to it.;","output":"The sentence ends with option a). The complete sentence would be: \\"The shirt matched her shoes, but did not go with her socks, as the shoes were a matching color to it.\\" In this sentence, the subject is the shirt, which is being compared to both the shoes and the socks. The sentence emphasizes that the shirt matched the shoes, establishing a harmonious connection between these clothing items. However, the same cannot be said about the relationship between the shirt and the socks, as the socks do not share the same matching color with the shirt. Consequently, there is a contrast between the visual compatibility of the shirt with the shoes as opposed to the socks. The sentence structure effectively communicates this contrast by first establishing the positive relationship between the shirt and the shoes and then immediately negating it in reference to the socks. By using option a) to end the sentence, the focus remains on the matching quality of the shirt and the shoes, while simultaneously emphasizing the discordant aspect of the shirt's color in relation to the socks. This ending choice presents a concise description of the coordination, or lack thereof, of the individual's outfit. Choosing b) to end the sentence would have changed the meaning significantly. It would focus more on the matching nature of the shirt and the socks, thus implying that the contrast lies more between the shoes and the socks instead of the shirt.

I was amazed no traffic, extremely affordable housing market, friendly, helpful and caring people and trees as far as the eyes could see. It was top 3 places I had lived in this country. After the Tech boom peaked near 2000 and after 9/11 the flood gates opened and people spilled in from all over the Earth for the bountiful opportunities. The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant?

Please answer a question about the following article about Muslim world: A Latin translation of Ibn Tufail's work, Philosophus Autodidactus, first appeared in 1671, prepared by Edward Pococke the Younger, followed by an English translation by Simon Ockley in 1708, as well as German and Dutch translations. These translations might have later inspired Daniel Defoe to write Robinson Crusoe, regarded as the first novel in English. Philosophus Autodidactus, continuing the thoughts of philosophers such as Aristotle from earlier ages, inspired Robert Boyle to write his own philosophical novel set on an island, The Aspiring Naturalist. Who first translated Philosophus Autodidactus into latin?","output":"The first person to translate Ibn Tufail's work, Philosophus Autodidactus, into Latin was Edward Pococke the Younger. This Latin translation first appeared in 1671. Prior to its translation, the work was originally written in Arabic, and the Latin translation helped to make it more accessible to European readers of that time. Edward Pococke the Younger was an English Orientalist scholar, who, with the translation of this work, contributed significantly to the dissemination of Islamic philosophical thought in Europe. The Latin translation facilitated subsequent translations into other languages such as English (by Simon Ockley in 1708), German, and Dutch, further broadening the reach of Ibn Tufail's ideas."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary.  and the situation: Manny and Annie were two foodie friends.

Answer:","output":"The world's smallest bird is a species of hummingbird called the Bee Hummingbird (Mellisuga helenae), which is native to the island country of Cuba and the Isla de la Juventud, a smaller island located off the southwestern coast of Cuba. This tiny bird indeed lives up to its name as it is about the size of a large bee, measuring between 5.5 to 6.1 centimeters (2.2 to 2.4 inches) in length and weighing just around 1.6 to 1.9 grams (0.056 to 0.067 ounces). The Bee Hummingbird exhibits sexual dimorphism, meaning there are noticeable and distinctive differences between the males and females of the species. Males of the Bee Hummingbird species are smaller and more brightly colored than the females. The males have an iridescent red or pink head, gorget (throat feathers), and upper chest, whereas the females are mainly green with blue colorations and white underparts, including the tail feathers marked with blue and black tips. As with all hummingbirds, the Bee Hummingbird is an agile and quick flyer, capable of producing rapid wing beats, hovering, and flying backward or upside down. Its extremely small size and highly specialized morphology enable it to feed on nectar from various flowers, particularly those with tubular shapes that are most suited for its long, slender bill. The bird's fast metabolism compels it to consume large amounts of nectar to maintain its energy levels. Moreover, the Bee Hummingbird has a unique reproductive process. It begins during the mating season, when the male performs a fascinating, intricate flight display to attract the attention of the female. After mating, the female builds a nest, typically measuring around 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) in diameter, using materials like plant fibers, lichens, and cobwebs. This nest is often situated on a slender tree branch. The female then lays one to two tiny eggs, measuring approximately 0.3 grams (0.01 ounces) each. She assumes the responsibility of incubating the eggs for around 16 to 20 days before they hatch. The Bee Hummingbird is highly significant in the ecosystem as it plays a crucial role in plant pollination. Its feeding habits uniquely facilitate the cross-pollination of various flowers. Despite being a locally abundant species, the Bee Hummingbird does face threats due to habitat loss, mainly driven by deforestation, agricultural transformation, and urbanization. These activities have caused a decline in the availability of suitable nesting sites and food sources. Currently, the IUCN Red List categorizes the Bee Hummingbird as \\"Near Threatened,\\" suggesting the importance of implementing conservation measures and monitoring the species to ensure its survival and protection for future generations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tim's land is of similar size. The clay soil on Tim's property is very alkaline, so he had to amend it with aluminum salts to make it more acidic in order to grow crops. The soil on Pat's parcel has a good structure and high infiltration capacity. Pat gets twice as much food of his land every year.  Hint: Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell[1] and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils.

Interval training is a form of training in which you alternate periods of moderate-intensity exercise with high-intensity exercise. Interval training may help increase fat loss, as it allows you to work out more efficiently. It also burns more calories — your body will continue to burn calories for hours after you have completed HIIT training. If you want to try interval training, decide on the length of your intervals.  Many people think interval training is complicated, but there are actually no prescriptive rules. You can choose any length for your intervals of intense activity. You can do them for up to two or three minutes, or for as short as 20 seconds. You may want to do some trial and error before setting hard and fast rules for yourself. You may find, when working out, two minute intervals wear you down fast. Instead, try going for intervals of one minute or 30 seconds. You can also alternate. You can warm up with a few intervals of 30 seconds, and then move on to intervals of a minute. Once you've decided on intervals, you can begin your routine. During that time, go at a steady pace for two to five minutes, then switch to a high-intensity pace for 30 seconds (or however long you choose). Continue this pattern for the duration of your workout routine.  Your HIIT workout should last between 20 and 30 minutes. Your heart rate should be at 85% during the high-intensity interval. When it comes to interval training targeted specifically at fat burning, rules depend heavily on your personal fitness level, target heart rate, current weight, and many other factors. Therefore, it's a good idea to discuss your desire to burn more fat with a personal trainer. He or she can help you figure out the time and duration of your intervals. Interval training comes with certain risks. You should be careful about engaging in interval training without talking to a doctor, especially if you have certain conditions.  If you have heart disease, you may want to talk to your doctor before attempting interval training. Injury is a risk if you rush into a routine that's too strenuous. It may be a good idea to start out with just one or two high intensity intervals during your regular workout.","output":"Interval training alternates moderate and high-intensity exercise periods, potentially increasing fat loss, burning calories, and improving efficiency, but should be tailored to personal fitness levels and discussed with a doctor or trainer to minimize risks."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed Context: Set several months after the events of the original film, runaway teenager Brigitte Fitzgerald (Emily Perkins) uses an extract of monkshood to fight the effects of the lycanthropy that transformed her sister into a werewolf and it is now affecting her.The opening credits play over Brigitte shaving the hair all over her body, cutting her arm with a scalpel, then injecting herself with a dose of monkshood, then cutting to Brigitte in a library, where the librarian Jeremy (Brendan Fletcher) clumsily hits on her. When she goes to check out her books, her library card has too many fines owing, and she walks out, leaving the books behind.Back in her motel room, she inspects her latest cut and records the time and state of healing on a page filled with similar entries. Ginger (Katharine Isabelle), her late sister, appears to her as an apparition, saying that she is healing faster and the monkshood is not a cure. It only slows the transformation.Brigitte shoots a deadly second dose of monkshood, and immediately after, Brigitte senses the presence of the male werewolf that has been stalking her, whose identity is unknown. She hastily packs and opens the door to find Jeremy with her library books. However, the additional dose has pushed her into toxic shock. Jeremy gets her in his car and is about to drive her to hospital, when the driver side window is smashed, and the werewolf drags him from the car. Brigitte stumbles down the street and collapses in the snow.She wakes up in a building which is a combination of a rehab clinic for drug abusing girls and chronic care patient facility, located in the only operational section of a large, old hospital.

Answer the following question: Bailey was in a fight and was told the school would be sending an expulsion notice.  Given the context: What does Bailey need to do before this?  Possible answers: needed to trash the house, needed to run away, needed to plan on what to say in their defense Answer:","output":"Before receiving the expulsion notice, Bailey needs to assess the situation and take several crucial steps to address the problem proactively. Among the possible options presented, the most appropriate action for Bailey would be to plan what to say in their defense. It's essential to consider the potential consequences of each option before deciding how to proceed. Firstly, trashing the house is not a solution in this situation. Such behaviour could exacerbate the problem by showing a lack of responsibility and maturity, which are qualities needed when addressing a serious issue like expulsion. This action could also lead to further disciplinary measures and potential legal consequences. Secondly, running away is also not a viable option. Escaping from the situation will not resolve the problem and may signal that Bailey is unwilling to face the consequences of their actions. Running away may also lead to additional issues, such as concerns for Bailey's safety and well-being. This option does not address the underlying issue and may only further complicate matters. The most appropriate and constructive course of action for Bailey would be to plan what to say in their defense. Here are some steps Bailey should consider to prepare effectively: 1. Reflect on the incident: Bailey should begin by analyzing the events that led to the fight. They must recognize and acknowledge their role in the altercation and any other factors contributing to the situation. This reflection will help Bailey develop a better understanding of the incident and show their willingness to take responsibility for their actions. 2. Gather evidence: Bailey should gather any evidence or documentation related to the incident that could help their defense. This may include witness statements, any photographs or videos, or even information about the other individuals involved (e.g., past aggressive behavior). This evidence can be crucial in supporting Bailey's case. 3. Consult with a trusted adult: Bailey should seek advice from a trusted adult, such as a parent, guardian, or teacher. These individuals can provide valuable insights and guidance on how to approach the situation, as well as emotional support. 4. Develop a clear, concise defense argument: Bailey should come up with a clear and logical defense argument that addresses the reasons for their actions and presents any factors that could potentially justify or mitigate the severity of the incident. They should also be prepared to acknowledge any wrongdoing and express remorse and willingness to learn from their mistakes. 5. Practice the defense: Bailey should rehearse their defense before presenting it to school officials. Practicing the defense can help Bailey remain calm, collected, and articulate when discussing the incident with the necessary parties. 6. Be prepared for possible outcomes: Finally, Bailey should be prepared for various outcomes of the expulsion hearing and consider how they might respond and move forward in each scenario. This preparation can help alleviate stress and uncertainty related to the disciplinary process. In summary, the most appropriate course of action for Bailey to take before receiving the expulsion notice is to plan what to say in their defense. By reflecting on the situation, gathering evidence, consulting with trusted adults, and preparing a clear argument, Bailey can address the issue responsibly and constructively, demonstrating their willingness to learn from their mistakes. Trashing the house or running away would only exacerbate the situation and may lead to additional negative consequences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

As a magician Cynthia has learned ways to trick people like Rachel,","output":"As a magician, Cynthia has learned ways to trick people like Rachel, skillfully maneuvering through elaborate performance routines that leave her audience questioning their own sense of reality and perception. Magic, as an art form, has always been about capturing the wonder and amazement of its audience. As a seasoned magician, Cynthia has honed her craft to effectively captivate and manipulate the expectations of those around her, especially individuals such as Rachel who often find themselves questioning their own senses. Over time, Cynthia has developed techniques and tools to support her skill set in creating a world of enchantment and illusion. To truly trick people like Rachel, magicians such as Cynthia employ numerous methods based on psychology, misdirection, and finesse. They combine these elements to create seemingly impossible acts that leave spectators in awe. Let's take a deeper look into some of these strategies and how they contribute to a magician's overall success in the art of deception. 1. Psychology: A magician's understanding of human psychology is critical, as they need to be in tune with their audience's thoughts, expectations, and emotions. By exploiting these factors, Cynthia is able to subtly lead Rachel and others through a predetermined experience, while at the same time, making it appear to be impromptu. This often involves using cognitive biases, such as the \\"confirmation bias,\\" where Rachel is drawn to notice and accept information that confirms her preconceptions, while disregarding information that contradicts them. 2. Misdirection: At the heart of every magic trick is a well-planned act of misdirection. Cynthia uses this technique to divert Rachel's attention away from the crucial moment when the trick is executed. This may involve using hand gestures, body movements, and even verbal cues to lead Rachel's focus toward irrelevant details, while the real action occurs elsewhere. As a result, Rachel sees what Cynthia wants her to see, while the secret behind the illusion remains hidden. 3. Finesse: In addition to psychological manipulation and misdirection, the art of magic also requires a great deal of technical skill and finesse. For instance, a magician may employ \\"sleight of hand\\" techniques, where dexterity and precision are used to manipulate objects or cards in a manner that is virtually undetectable to the naked eye. Cynthia has spent countless hours perfecting such techniques, and this mastery enables her to perform her magic tricks with grace and seamless execution. 4. Patter: Magicians often utilize storytelling or patter to help enhance the atmosphere during a performance. The use of an engaging script not only keeps the audience entertained but can also serve as an additional form of misdirection. Cynthia's ability to weave intricate stories and humorous anecdotes into her routines provides a further layer of deception, as Rachel and the other spectators are momentarily caught up in the narrative, their attention drawn away from the mechanics of the trick itself. 5. Timing and presence: The success of a magician's performance often comes down to their ability to command attention and control the pace of the act. Cynthia has honed the skill of maintaining a strong stage presence, dictating the flow of her show based on cues from her audience. By carefully timing her tricks and regulating the rhythm of her performance, she is able to keep Rachel and other participants fully engaged and invested in the unfolding narrative. In conclusion, as a magician, Cynthia has learned ways to trick people like Rachel through a mastery of psychology, misdirection, finesse, storytelling, and stage presence. By using these various techniques and elements together, she is able to craft a world of illusion that leaves her audience captivated, curious, and hungering for more."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh.  I am facing a new situation today: Italy had two distinct regions. Northern region where the animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, and the southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which region had fewer species inhabiting it? The answer is:","output":"The northern region. Step 1: Identify the key information from the background article. - Biodiversity is determined by many factors, including abiotic stress. - When abiotic stress is high, biodiversity tends to be low. - When abiotic stress is low, biodiversity tends to be high. - As abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases, which makes them more likely to become threatened, endangered, or extinct. Step 2: Analyze the given new situation. - Italy has two distinct regions: the northern region with high abiotic stress and the southern region with low abiotic stress. Step 3: Apply the background information to the new situation. - Since high abiotic stress negatively affects biodiversity and leads to a lower number of species, the northern region with high abiotic stress should have fewer species inhabiting it compared to the southern region with low abiotic stress. Therefore, based on the relationship between abiotic stress and biodiversity outlined in the background article, the northern region of Italy, where animals are exposed to more abiotic stress, likely has fewer species inhabiting it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

According to Reporters Without Borders it ruled that that the cartoon's depiction of Roosevelt looked suspiciously like the Islamic Republic's founder Ayatollah Khomeini and was insulting to his memory. The court shut down Hayat No, and Eshraghi spent nearly two months in prison. \\"Over the past ten years I've been working as a journalist both in OPTIONS: - Ali Reza Eshraghi and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions,\\" he explained. - Arabic and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions,\\" he explained. - Ayatollah Khomeini and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions,\\" he explained. - CNN and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions,\\" he explained. - Dean Obeidallah and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions,\\" he explained. - Eshraghi and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions,\\" he explained. - Franklin Roosevelt and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions,\\" he explained. - Hayat No and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions,\\" he explained. - Hayat No. and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions,\\" he explained. - Iran and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions,\\" he explained. - Iranian and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions,\\" he explained. - Islamic Republic and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions,\\" he explained. - Reporters Without Borders and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions,\\" he explained. - Roosevelt and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions,\\" he explained. - Special Court for the Clergy and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions,\\" he explained. - Supreme Court and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions,\\" he explained. - U.S. and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions,\\" he explained.","output":"Ali Reza Eshraghi and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions,\\" he explained.

During those times, Illinois had already gained a notorious reputation for its endemic political corruption. Blagojevich's anti-corruption slate struck a chord with voters, who were tired of decades of scandal-ridden governance. They saw him as a promising figure who would put an end to unethical practices and restore public trust in the state government. But little did the voters know that this would be a classic tale of irony and deception. Blagojevich's campaign promised increased transparency, accountability, and an end to the \\"pay-to-play\\" politics that had plagued Illinois for decades. His charisma, populist message, and commitment to fight corruption resonated with voters across the state, propelling him to a landslide victory in the gubernatorial election. People celebrated his triumph, believing they had finally elected a governor who would break the cycle of corruption and bring about lasting change. Governor Blagojevich wasted no time in implementing his reform programs. He leveraged his newly acquired political capital to challenge the status quo, launching initiatives aimed at increasing transparency in government contracting and rooting out graft within state departments. Illinois, it seemed, was finally on the path towards ethical governance. Praise for Blagojevich's leadership spread outside the state, earning him recognition as a bold reformer with the potential for higher political office. However, as the years passed, whispers of doubt and suspicion began to circulate. The crusading governor seemed to be acting increasingly erratic and authoritarian. Rumors spread of shady backroom deals and dubious pay-to-play practices. The anti-corruption champion was fast becoming a source of embarrassment for the very people who had embraced him as their savior. It was not long before the federal investigation, “Operation Board Games,” revealed shocking evidence of corruption at the highest levels of the Blagojevich administration. The governor was accused of several high-value frauds, including his infamous attempt to sell the US Senate seat vacated by President-elect Barack Obama. In December 2008, Blagojevich was arrested by the FBI, effectively bringing his political career to a grinding halt. The arrest came as a gut-wrenching betrayal for the people of Illinois, who were once again left to bear the brunt of the deceitful nature of their political leadership. Blagojevich was subsequently impeached by the Illinois General Assembly and removed from office in January 2009. The story of Rod Blagojevich stands as a cautionary tale of the dangers of hypocrisy and the thin line between a genuine desire to reform and the seduction of power. Though he rose to prominence as an anti-corruption crusader, his eventual descent into the very cesspool of misconduct he vowed to drain demonstrates the allure of power and how easily it can corrupt even the most idealistic of politicians. This tale of betrayal serves as a poignant reminder that restoring public trust in political institutions necessitates a collective responsibility among elected officials, civil society, and the public at large to hold politicians accountable and to demand transparency and ethical governance. As we strive to ensure a brighter future for the next generation, this story should be etched in our minds – not just as a historical footnote but as a stark warning of the consequences of neglecting the values of integrity and honesty in public service."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"Yes, the answer \\"once you get love, you will get Success and Wealth\\" is a valid interpretation of the passage. In this story, the woman and her family ultimately decide to invite Love into their home. This decision brings with it the additional benefits of Wealth and Success, as they follow Love wherever he goes. The lesson the passage seeks to convey is that choosing love as a guiding principle can naturally lead to prosperity and achievement, as it fosters an environment that is conducive to the growth and well-being of everyone involved. By prioritizing love, individuals and families may unknowingly unlock the door to other blessings such as wealth and success.

Does the sentence \\"The first medical use of cotton wool was by Sampson Gamgee at the Queen's Hospital (later the General Hospital) in Birmingham, England.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What individual first used cotton wool medically?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"The first medical use of cotton wool was by Sampson Gamgee at the Queen's Hospital (later the General Hospital) in Birmingham, England.\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"What individual first used cotton wool medically?\\"  The sentence offers specific and relevant information that directly answers the question. It provides the name of the individual, Sampson Gamgee, who first used cotton wool for medical purposes, and it also gives context by mentioning the location and institution (the Queen's Hospital, later named the General Hospital, in Birmingham, England) where this pioneering use of cotton wool took place. To understand the significance and background of this discovery, let's explore further details: Sampson Gamgee (1828–1886) was an English surgeon who contributed to the development of various surgical procedures and medical techniques in the 19th century. One of his most notable contributions was the introduction of cotton wool as a medical material for dressing and dealing with wounds. Cotton wool, also known as absorbent cotton or cotton batting, is a soft, fluffy, and absorbent material made from short cotton fibers that have been carded to remove impurities and aligned for uniformity. The development of this cotton wool made it possible to dress wounds more efficiently, protect them from external bacteria, and facilitate faster healing by providing an absorbent and cushioning layer between the wound and any external factors. Before the introduction of cotton wool by Sampson Gamgee, the medical community relied on materials like linen and muslin for wound dressings. These materials were not as effective in maintaining a sterile environment and had limited absorbent capacity compared to cotton wool. Gamgee's innovation transformed wound care and paved the way for the development of modern wound dressings and techniques. In conclusion, the sentence in question does provide a valid answer to the query about the individual who first used cotton wool for medical purposes. Sampson Gamgee, a surgeon in 19th century England, introduced cotton wool to the medical field at the Queen's Hospital (later the General Hospital) in Birmingham, significantly improving the efficiency and efficacy of wound care and paving the way for future advancements in medical technology and treatment procedures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hoping to rebound from their Thursday night road loss to the Cowboys, the Packers went home for Favre's 250th (270th including playoffs) consecutive start, along with Green Bay's Week 14 interconference duel with the Oakland Raiders. After a scoreless first quarter, the Packers sliced away in the second quarter with rookie RB Ryan Grant getting a 6-yard TD run, while CB Will Blackmon returned a punt 57&#160;yards for a touchdown. The Raiders would end the half with their only score of the game as QB Josh McCown completed a 25-yard TD pass to WR Jerry Porter. In the third quarter, Green Bay took control with rookie Mason Crosby nailing a 44-yard field goal, QB Brett Favre completing an 80-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings, while Blackmon recovered an Oakland fumble in their endzone for a touchdown (making him the first player since Cincinnati's Lemar Parrish in 1974 to return a punt and a fumble for a touchdown in one game).

Write a summary based on this article: Texas Women Fight Rule for Burial of Miscarriages AUSTIN, Texas (CN) — As Hillary Clinton gave her concession speech Wednesday, women in Texas pleaded with state officials to stop proposed rules that would require embryonic and fetal tissue to be buried or cremated after an abortion, miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy.      Women said Texas' proposed rules would restrict access to abortion and inflict further pain and suffering on women who have lost a baby during pregnancy.      It was the Texas Department of Health Services' second public hearing on rules that would require embryonic and fetal tissue to be buried or cremated after an abortion, miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy.      Texas officials say that all fetal remains, regardless of the period of gestation, deserve \\"a dignified interment,\\" while opponents say the measure is just another in a series of unconstitutional attempts to restrict abortion access in Texas.      \\"These proposed rules are not meant to protect people's health and safety,\\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, executive director of Planned Parenthood Texas Votes. \\"They are just another attempt to restrict access to care that's deeply needed and shame and hurt women in the process.      \\"The department has not provided any shred of evidence that Texas's current rules have not protected health and safety.\\" Some spoke on behalf of groups such as the National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL) or Jane's Due Process, some on their own behalf. Many shared painful stories of their miscarriages or abortions, and said that having arrange a funeral for fetal remains would have made these experiences even worse.      There also are concerns about how the rules will be implemented.      The Texas Medical Association asked the Department of Health Services in August whether a death certificate will be required all fetal tissues interred, which raises privacy issues.      The Medical Association also expressed concerns about the costs of this, echoing concerns the Funeral Consumers Alliance of Texas raised in July.      Ashley Blinkhorn, who cried as she testified about the two miscarriages she suffered before she was 25, said the rules would affect \\"so many people in so many ways that people aren't considering.\\"      \\"You're monkeying around with people's lives here,\\" Blinkhorn said.      Texas Health Commission spokesman Bryan Black told the Texas Tribune in July, after the new rules were quietly published in the Texas Register, that they were developed to \\"ensure Texas law maintains the highest standards of human dignity.\\"      Gov. Greg Abbott asked the department and the Texas Health and Human Services Commission in January to review the rules on disposition of \\"special waste\\" from healthcare facilities.      The rules today still allow for fetal tissue to be incinerated or ground and flushed or disposed of at a sanitary landfill.      Abbott wrote in a July fund-raising letter for his anti-abortion initiative that the rule changes were designed to \\"reflect our respect for the sanctity of life\\" and that the groups protesting the rules \\"simply refuse to acknowledge any rights of the unborn.\\"      Representatives from the Texas Alliance for Life and Texas Right to Life made similar arguments at the Wednesday hearing.      \\"It is unconscionable that anyone would defend the grinding and flushing of the bodies of unborn babies who are victims of abortion down the drain and into a city sewer system as if they were mere medical waste,\\" said John Pojman, executive director of Texas Alliance for Life. \\"That method of the disposition of the remains should be banned, as the proposed rules do.\\"      Blake Rocap, legislative director for NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, said the state should concentrate on ensuring that patients are \\"supported and respected and empowered in their health care decision,\\" instead of \\"passing laws that force government intrusion on a patient's access to health care.\\"      \\"This rule provides no public health benefit, just like the state's abortion restrictions that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down in June,\\" Rocap said in a statement Wednesday.      He referred to Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, in which the court rejected by 5-3 vote a 2013 Texas law that required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles, and required the clinics to meet the same minimum standards as ambulatory surgical centers.      The court found that neither provision provided any medical benefits that would justify the undue burdens imposed upon women seeking abortions.      Opponents to the new fetal burial rules believe that even if they do go into effect, they will be struck down by the courts on the basis of Hellerstedt.      However, they also are concerned that president-elect Donald Trump may appoint a justice to the truncated court that may help overturn Hellerstedt, and even Roe v. Wade.      The Center for Reproductive Rights said in a statement Wednesday that the country \\"strands perilously close to a return to the dark days when women were forced to put their own lives at risk to get safe and legal abortion care.\\"      \\"It is 2016, and our leaders should build on the historic advancements we've made for women's health and rights, not threaten to undo them,\\" the center said.      It's clear that a fight is coming in Texas.      \\"I'm sure that after last night's results many people feel emboldened to continue their attacks on women,\\" said Sheila Sorvari, who testified Wednesday. \\"But if you thought we were going to pull up the covers and cry and go away, you're wrong.\\"      The Texas Department of Health Services will incorporate comments from the hearing with previous comments from the public consultation period in August.      It is unclear whether any changes will be made to the proposed rules. No date has been set for the rules to go into effect. ||||| Wednesday’s public hearing was the second on a proposed rule change.      About 30 people testified at the hearing Wednesday at state health agency’s offices in Central Austin.      In a last-ditch effort, abortion rights advocates urged state officials Wednesday to reconsider a proposal that would require cremation or burial of miscarried and aborted fetuses.      The Texas Department of State Health Services held a second public hearing about the rule, which was first proposed in July.      Armed with a few new arguments, critics said the rule not only discourages women from abortion and retraumatizes them after a miscarriage, but it doesn’t necessarily further “uphold the dignity of life” as some proponents have argued because mass cremation and burial would still be allowed.      “This is not about children. … This is not about dignity. … This is not about health,” said Gordon Vincent, who was among 30 or so people who testified Wednesday.      Abortion opponents have argued that the proposed rule would give fetuses the respect that they deserve. They said that women are often appalled by the current rules for fetal tissue disposal.      + Jay Janner Ashley Blinkhorn cries in the hallway after she testified Wednesday against a proposal that would require cremation or burial of miscarried ... read more Jay Janner ×      Current rules allow fetal remains, as with other medical tissue, to be ground and discharged into a sewer system, incinerated or disinfected followed by disposal in a landfill.      “It is unconscionable that anyone would defend the grinding and flushing of bodies of unborn babies who are victims of abortions down the drain into a city sewer system as if they were mere medical waste,” Joe Pojman with the Texas Alliance for Life testified Wednesday.      Agency officials have argued that the rule would protect the public from communicable diseases.      The proposal is a part of Gov. Greg Abbott’s Life Initiative, meant to “protect the unborn and prevent the sale of baby body parts,” according to a statement on his website.      After holding a public comment period and a hearing in August about the proposal, the state agency in September published an analysis that concluded the rule wouldn’t fiscally burden medical facilities.      Blake Rocap, with the abortion rights group NARAL-Pro Choice, testified Wednesday that the state agency had an opportunity to consider thousands of comments from the public over the last few months and change the rule but failed to compromise.      “Instead, you mashed together things that are not part of modern medical practice and imposed this mandate on every family,” Rocap said.      Some women were in tears as they shared stories about their traumatic miscarriages and abortions. They said they would have suffered more had they been required to bury or cremate the fetus.      Nakia Winfield, a mental health fellow with the National Association of Social Workers, said that many women who choose to have an abortion can barely afford it. Adding burial requirements would cost up to 2,000, she said.      Chris Williston, with nonprofit The Mary Claire Project which provides low-cost burials, echoed state officials’ assertions that public-private partnerships would help defray costs.      John Seago with Texas Right to Life said that he would like the rule clarified to exclude the requirement from women who miscarry at home.      Rebecca Teng, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Central Texas, said the rule is an unfunded mandate for providers. Providers already treat fetal tissue with respect, rendering the rule pointless, she said.      “Let’s dedicate these resources to help women, infants, children and families instead,” Teng said.      State officials said that they will take all comments into consideration and decide on an implementation date, if any. ||||| Through tears, Austin resident Ashley Blinkhorn said she had undergone two miscarriages by age 25. If a proposed rule that forces women to bury or cremate their aborted or miscarried fetal tissue (rather than deposit in sanitary sewers and medical-waste landfills) had been in effect, Blinkhorn wouldn't have sought medical care because the costs associated with the regulation would've been too high, she told the Department of State Health Services during a hearing on the new rule earlier this week.      \\"There's no health reason that we should do this,\\" said an emotional Blinkhorn. \\"Health clinics are already following state standards, there's no reason to change the rule for this kind of waste. It's not reasonable and not necessary. This is targeted at [women], and this is not something we need to stand for.\\"      The Health Department held its second public hearing (see \\"Fetal Burial Saga Continues,\\" Aug. 5) on the anti-abortion rule on Wednesday, Nov. 9, the morning after an unexpected victory for anti-abortion and sexist President-elect Donald Trump, casting an additional pall on an already somber hearing. The rule could be a harbinger of what's to come nationally under a Trump presidency: Vice President-elect Mike Pence signed a similar law in Indiana (temporarily blocked by a federal judge in June) even harsher than the one proposed today in Texas. Both men have vowed to ensure Supreme Court appointments that would undo abortion rights, including Roe v. Wade and the historic victory of Texas' Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt.      At the hearing, a stream of anti-choice speakers with Texas Alliance for Life, the Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops, and Texas Right to Life applauded the measure as a move toward \\"dignity\\" and \\"respect,\\" and used graphic language to describe fetal disposal. \\"It is unconscionable to grind and flush an unborn child ... like they're mere medical waste,\\" said TAL's Joe Pojman. John Seago with TRL noted their group wanted a clarification showing that women who experience miscarriages at home would not be subject to the rule.      On the other end, pro-choice advocates with Planned Parenthood Texas Votes, Jane's Due Process, NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, and individual citizens criticized the regulation as another attempt to shame, stigmatize, and restrict women's access to abortion care. \\"Legally, practically, and morally, these rules are unnecessary,\\" said Tina Hester of Jane's Due Process in testimony read aloud by proxy. Since the state will not shoulder the price tag of burials and cremation, the cost burden falls on abortion providers and patients, already straining from a trail of anti-choice laws, said pro-choice speakers. The Funeral Consumers Alliance of Texas estimates the rule could add 2,000 to the cost of abortion care.      The Texas Medical Association, the Texas Hospital Association, and health professionals have expressed deep concern over how to implement the rules. \\"The significant financial burden, the invasion of privacy, and intrusion of government will only hurt women,\\" said Round Rock OB-GYN Rebecca Teng, echoing some of the overall worry from the medical community. Advocates also stressed that the state has shown no medical evidence the rule would actually promote the health and safety of women – a requirement mandated by the SCOTUS Whole Woman's decision. The Center for Reproductive Rights and the ACLU of Texas have both warned the rule is unconstitutional and will likely spark a legal challenge (\\"Fetal Burial Rule May Flout Constitutional Limits,\\" Aug. 12).      The proposed regulation still needs to be approved by the Health and Human Services Commission executive commissioner and posted in the Texas Register. It would then take effect 20 days later. DSHS spokesperson Carrie Williams said the Health Department will offer additional information on next steps after reviewing the thousands of comments it received. But with the blessing and encouragement from conservative anti-choice Gov. Greg Abbott, it's hard to imagine the department turning back without yet another lawsuit to stop them. |||||","output":"In Texas, women have protested the proposed rule change that would require embryonic and foetal tissue to be buried or cremated following an abortion, miscarriage, or ectopic pregnancy.

I knocked on the door and asked, \\"Hey, Kevin, do you want to talk?\\" No answer. I tried again, \\"Why don't you come out of there?\\" Again, on answer. I tried again, \\"Why don't you come out of there?\\" Again, on answer. So, looking around, I grabbed a stack of  cards and a pencil and wrote, \\"if you don't want to talk, we can write notes to each other..\\" An hour later, I was still sitting on the floor outside the bathroom with two stacks of cards in front of me. One was blank and one was cards from Kevin on which he had translated all his _ feeling into words for me. As I read one of Kevin's notes, tears came to my eyes. It said, \\"No-body in this family cares about me. I'm not the youngest, and I'm not the oldest. Tommy thinks I'm silly and Dad wishes he had the other Kevin as a kid because he's better at basketball. And you're never around to even notice me.\\" Tears came to my eyes as I wrote back to him. \\"You know Kevin, I really do love you and I'm sorry I don't always show it . I am here for you and you are loved in this family.\\" There was no answer for a while, but then I heard a tearing sound coming from inside the bathroom. Kevin, who had run out of words wrote on a torn paper cup. \\"Thanks.\\" I wrote back, \\"For what?\\" It returned to me with \\"Loving me.\\" On it. Since then, I try my best to never only half-notice my family members any more. Kevin and I have a closer relationship now. And sometimes when one of us notices that the other is upset, we'll smile and say \\"Write it on a paper cup.\\" ,. Question: What could the reason that Kevin's Dad doesn't like him? Answer: The answer is:","output":"There isn't a clear indication in the text that Kevin's dad doesn't like him. However, Kevin perceives his dad as wishing for a different Kevin – probably another kid named Kevin who is better at basketball – which could suggest that Kevin feels underappreciated or overshadowed in the family. This perception might stem from a lack of attention or his dad's focus on his siblings' achievements, rather than a genuine dislike from his dad."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Mix this all together and let it cook for another 10 minutes, adding more water if needed. This is the correct answer because after sautéing the onions, we need to add the rest of the ingredients like peppers, garlic, spices, and chilies to make the curry base. Adding water will help combine all these ingredients and cook them properly. A is incorrect because chicken is not added at this stage of cooking and the recipe does not mention dried ingredients. B is incorrect because it talks about adding unrelated ingredients like dried fruit and nuts, curry oil, and lime juice which are not part of the chicken and pineapple curry. D is incorrect because setting the wok to medium heat should be done prior to melting the butter and sautéing the onions, not after."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sampson delivered a lecture on it in the late 1980s? ?  Despite the steep decline in Watts's popularity, Hope continued to hold a place in popular culture, and there remained those who considered it a major work. When the Tate Gallery held an exhibition of its Watts holdings in 1954, trade unionist and left-wing M.P. Percy Collick urged \\"Labour stalwarts\\" to attend the exhibition, supposedly privately recounting that he had recently met a Viennese Jewish woman who during \\"the terrors of the Nazi War\\" had drawn \\"renewed faith and hope\\" from her photographic copy. Meanwhile, an influential 1959 sermon by Martin Luther King Jr., now known as Shattered Dreams, took Hope as a symbol of frustrated ambition and the knowledge that few people live to see their wishes fulfilled, arguing that \\"shattered dreams are a hallmark of our mortal life\\", and against retreating into either apathetic cynicism, a fatalistic belief in God's will or escapist fantasy in response to failure.Myths continued to grow about supposed beliefs in the redemptive powers of Hope, and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in the Six-Day War, the Egyptian government issued copies of it to its troops. There is no evidence this took place, and the story is likely to stem from the fact that in early 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt, the image of Hope appeared on Jordanian postage stamps. Likewise, it is regularly claimed that Nelson Mandela kept a print of Hope in his cell on Robben Island, a claim for which there is no evidence.In 1990 Barack Obama, at the time a student at Harvard Law School, attended a sermon at the Trinity United Church of Christ preached by Jeremiah Wright. Taking the Books of Samuel as a starting point, Wright explained that he had studied Watts's Hope in the 1950s, and had rediscovered the painting when Dr Frederick G. Sampson delivered a lecture on it in the late 1980s (Sampson described it as \\"a study in contradictions\\"), before discussing the image's significance in the modern world.

Her father, Gerardo Velasquez, was a construction estimator, and her mother, Teresita (nee Ansong), was a homemaker. The singer has three younger sisters, Cacai, Diane and Deca, and a younger brother, Jojo. The family moved to Hinundayan, Southern Leyte where Velasquez spent the early years of her life. Context: In 1990, Velasquez signed a contract with Vicor Music and released her second studio album, Nineteen 90. Velasquez worked with Louie Ocampo who provided the musical arrangement for the album's lead single \\"Narito Ako\\", a song originally recorded and performed by Maricris Belmont and written by Nonong Pedero for the 1978 Metro Manila Popular Music Festival. In July 1990, Velasquez headlined her first major concert as a solo artist in support of the album at the Folk Arts Theater. She recorded a duet with Jose Mari Chan, \\"Please Be Careful With My Heart\\", for his sixth studio album Constant Change, and contributed backing vocals for Gary Valenciano's \\"Each Passing Night\\", a single from his sixth album, Faces of Love. At the end of 1990, Velasquez made her North American concert debut at the Isaac Stern Auditorium of Carnegie Hall in New York City--a first for an Asian solo artist. Soon after, British theatrical producer Cameron Mackintosh invited Velasquez to audition for the West End production of the musical Miss Saigon. Velasquez received a letter from the production company offering intensive musical theater training in the United Kingdom; she declined the offer citing inadequate theatrical experience.  Velasquez's third studio album Tagala Talaga was released in October 1991, and included cover versions of classic OPM recordings by National Artist for Music recipients Ryan Cayabyab, Lucio San Pedro and Levi Celerio. The album's lead single \\"Buhay Ng Buhay Ko\\", originally recorded by Leah Navarro, was also written by Pedero, who Velasquez previously worked with on Nineteen 90. Three singles were released the following year--\\"Anak, \\"Sa Ugoy Ng Duyan\\" and \\"Kastilyong Buhangin\\".  By early 1993, music executives Alex Chan and Norman Cheng from PolyGram Far East approached Velasquez and began negotiations for a record deal, mapping her commercial debut in the region. Following the deal, PolyGram Far East announced its joint venture licensing agreement in the Philippines with the formation of its subsidiary, PolyCosmic Records. Reason Enough, released in July 1993, was the newly formed label's maiden release. David Gonzales of AllMusic described the album as a \\"mixture of passionate, easy listening love songs, which are popular in the Philippines, and songs with a modern, contemporary touch, more attuned to an international audience\\". Velasquez recorded a duet with Paul Anka for the album's first single \\"It's Hard to Say Goodbye\\", marking her first musical collaboration with an international artist. The album's second single, \\"Sana Maulit Muli\\", became one of the most popular songs of her career, and won the Awit Award for Best Performance by a Female Recording Artist in 1994. The album received a double platinum certification. Question: And what is Reason Enough?. Whats the answer?","output":"Reason Enough is Regine Velasquez's album released in July 1993 under PolyCosmic Records, which was formed as a joint venture between PolyGram Far East and a local Philippine company. The album is described as a mixture of passionate, easy listening love songs and modern, contemporary tunes catering to an international audience. It features her first musical collaboration with an international artist, Paul Anka, in the song \\"It's Hard to Say Goodbye.\\" The second single from the album, \\"Sana Maulit Muli,\\" became one of her most popular songs and won the Awit Award for Best Performance by a Female Recording Artist in 1994.

Do you argue whether it's cold outdoors or whether the car in front of you is going faster than the speed limit? If you get into such arguments, try to think about the story about the six blind men and the elephant. The first blind man who felt the elephant's trunk said it was like a snake. The second who felt the elephant's side said it was like a wall, while the third said it was like a spear as he touched the animal's tusk. The fourth, who got hold of the elephant's tail insisted that it was like a rope. The fifth man said it looked like a tree as he put his arms around one of the elephant's legs. The sixth, who was tall and got hold of the elephant's ears, said it was like a huge fan. Each man's idea of the animal came from his own experience. So if someone disagrees with you about a \\"simple fact\\", it's often because his experience in the matter is different from yours. To see how hard it is for even one person to make up his mind about a \\"simple fact\\", try this simple experiment. Get three large bowls. Put ice water in one. Put hot water in the second.

You watch  her  in action & vote R!â âIn a tweet the previous day  Mr. Trump encouraged the media to focus on  Mrs. Wilson . â[Trump tweeted:] âI hope the Fake News Media keeps talking about  Wacky Congresswoman Wilson  in that  she   as a representative  is killing the Democrat Party!ââ Trump is right; there would be nothing better for Republicans than to make  Frederica Wilson  the face of the Democrats. There is scarcely a more shining example of the utter intellectual bankruptcy of the party than the Florida congresswoman  but the same could be said of most Democrats including of course  Nancy Pelosi  Maxine Waters  Adam Schiff or Senators Chuck Schumer  Elizabeth Warren or Al Franken. By adding  Wilson âs name to the more well-known troupe not only do you glimpse a bad comedy act that isnât funny  you now have an elected official who dresses up for Halloween every day of the year and doesnât even realize it.  Wilsonâs  stood out since the beginning of  her  tenure in Congress having been one of the first to suggest the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin was due to racism (the facts be damned!).  Similarly Wilson  labeled  General Kellyâs  âempty barrelâ description of  her  as a âracist term.â  Wilson âs become the standard-bearer for everything thatâs wrong with the Democrat party today  a substance-less privilege abusing politician whoâs crawled  her  way to the top of local politics and is now entrenched in Congress for as long as  she  chooses to stay because thereâs no organized partisan opposition in  her  district. In other words   Wilson  is the poster-child for term-limits. Charles Hurt of the Washington Times described her best. Hurt wrote  â Congresswoman Wilson  is living proof that  literally  anyone â no matter how stupid â can get elected to Congress. And the fact that there is actually a party in American politics that would allow someone so dumb in their caucus only proves how unseriously Democrats take themselves and how much contempt party leaders have for innocent American voters. â Congresswoman Wilson  has long been known for pretty much only one thing: the ridiculous  colorful  feathered and sequined cowboy hats  she  sports around the halls of Congress. Otherwise   she  is ignored because of  her  stultifying ignoranceâ¦ âFor the good of humanity â not to mention the notion of self-governance in America â  this woman  must be removed from public office.â No doubt humanity would benefit from such an occurrence but I have to say  I agree with Trump â instead of being rid of a dolt like  Wilson  itâs much better for the Republican Partyâs cause to keep  her  around; and the more  she  talks the more enriched conservatives will be. As amply noted the Republican Party has massive issues of its own; the entrenched GOP establishment will take years to vanquish and the #NeverTrump âconservativesâ have dug themselves a very deep hole from which they cannot emerge without losing face within their own circles. But âclownsâ like  Rep. Frederica Wilson  make a mockery of the entire Democrat Party â a circumstance that will only worsen with every absurd word she utters.

My girlfriend (at the time) and I were planning to go on a day trip on a Saturday, and so the Friday night before, we decided to celebrate our mini vacation by having a few drinks at a local bar. It was a known hangout for bikers, and had a reputation of being a rowdy place, but I was on good terms with a few of the regulars, and felt safe enough. As the night wore on, I started getting out of control, and didn't even realize it. I loved my girlfriend deeply, and had no desire to be with anyone else, but that night I was most definitely not myself. I was told that I openly flirted with the barmaid in front of my girlfriend, bet and lost on the pool table several times, and tried to start fights with some of the patrons, as I strongly suspected that someone had slipped something into my drink. At the time, I was a seasoned drinker, and the amount of alcohol I had consumed that night was pretty minimal in comparison, so naturally I was convinced that someone was messing with me. To this day I'm still not sure if my drinks were spiked, or it was just one of those nights. I do know that I hadn't eaten prior to that, so I would tend to choose the latter culprit, even though it pained me to admit it. I woke up the next afternoon in my own bed, with no memory of the trip home, a screaming hangover headache, and no girlfriend. She eventually forgave me, and we were together off and on for a few more years before we grew apart. I haven't set foot in that bar since, so I have no idea if I'm barred, or how the people there felt about me. I hope they've moved on, but I'm still too scared to find out. It's an experience I never want to repeat, even though I didn't actually experience anything. :/ Question: Who did he flirt with?

Question: Deciding to go on a diet is easy, but sticking to a diet is not easy! So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . .  the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle.

Question: To prevent unwanted pregnancies, you'd keep the heifers and the bulls in separate what? Options:  A. cattle show  B. houses  C. corral  D. dairy barn  E. countryside","output":"To prevent unwanted pregnancies in cattle, the ideal option in line with common sense to separate the heifers (female cows that haven't yet given birth) and the bulls (intact adult male cows) would be Option C: Corral. In a corral system, you can effectively manage and organize cattle in separate areas, which is essential for maintaining control over breeding patterns and preventing unplanned pregnancies. Corrals are specifically designed to shelter and confine livestock, provide secure access to water and feeding systems, and enable easy observation and monitoring. By keeping heifers and bulls in separate corrals, you can avoid accidental mating occurrences and ensure that you are only breeding the animals intentionally when desired. Here is a detailed analysis of the options given: A. Cattle Show: This is not a suitable option for managing the breeding process or preventing unwanted pregnancies in cattle. Cattle shows are public events where livestock are typically displayed and judged based on their appearance, traits, and overall conformity to breed standards. They are not designed or intended to serve as a separation mechanism for managing the breeding process, and usually will only last for a short period of time. B. Houses: The term \\"houses\\" is typically not associated with housing cattle. Cattle are livestock animals that are generally kept outdoors in specific animal shelters, like barns or corrals. Moreover, keeping heifers and bulls in separate houses would not necessarily be practical or efficient for managing them on a farm, since it could create issues related to space, access to water, feeding, and overall animal husbandry. D. Dairy Barn: A dairy barn is a type of livestock shelter commonly used for housing dairy cows and managing their milk production process. While dairy barns may include separate stalls or areas for individual animals, they are generally not designed or intended as a means to separate heifers and bulls for breeding purposes. Dairy barns focus more on the care, comfort, and well-being of dairy cows to optimize milk production rather than preventing unwanted pregnancies. E. Countryside: This option is not ideal either because it provides little to no control over the livestock. When cattle are left in the vast, open spaces of the countryside, it can be difficult to monitor and manage their interactions, making it nearly impossible to prevent unwanted pregnancies between heifers and bulls in such an environment. In conclusion, the most effective option for preventing unwanted pregnancies in cattle by separating heifers and bulls would be to use separate corrals. This method of confinement allows for controlled breeding, ease of monitoring, and proper management of all aspects of animal husbandry, ultimately helping in maintaining a healthy and productive livestock population."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Fright Night II Context: Three years after the first film, 20-year-old Charley Brewster, as a result of psychiatric therapy, now believes that Jerry Dandrige was nothing but a serial killer posing as a vampire. As a result, he comes to believe that vampires never existed. College student Charley, along with his new girlfriend, Alex Young, go to visit Peter Vincent, who is again a burnt-out vampire killer on Fright Night, much to the chagrin of Charley. While visiting Peter's apartment Charley sees four coffins being taken into a car. On the way out from Peter's apartment, Charley sees four strange people walk past him, into an elevator. Charley instantly becomes drawn to one of the four, the alluring Regine. Charley drives Alex back to her dorm and begins to make out with her, only to pull away and see Regine staring back at him. An upset Alex storms off, not realizing that something is following her. Another girl leaves the dorm as Alex enters, and she is followed and killed by one of Regine's vampires, Belle. Alex, meanwhile, is unaware that Louie, another of Regine's group, is scaling up the wall outside her window, but he is startled and falls when Alex inadvertently slams her window shut on his hands. Bozworth, a bug-eating servant of Regine, makes fun of Louie before consuming some bugs. Later that night, Charley dreams that Regine comes to visit him, only to turn into a vampire and bite him. The next day, Charley talks to his psychiatrist, Dr. Harrison, who assures him that what he dreamed was only natural. Alex finds Charley bowling, per doctor's orders, and Charley agrees to go to the symphony with her. On his way there, however, he sees his friend Richie with Regine and opts to follow him. Charley climbs up to a fire escape outside of Regine's apartment, only to be horrified when he sees Regine and Belle attack and drain Richie's blood. Charley runs off to find Peter, and the two of them arm themselves with crosses and crash Regine's party. There, Charley finds Richie, but is shocked to find him alive and well, with no bite...

Schwarzenegger gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position, determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next gubernatorial election.\\". Can you tell me what it is?","output":"From the provided information, the relationship Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, had with a Democrat was the appointment of Susan Kennedy, a Democrat, as his Chief of Staff. This move was considered significant because Schwarzenegger went against the advice of fellow Republican strategists in choosing a member of the rival political party for such a key role in his administration. Appointing a person from the opposition party as Chief of Staff can signify that Schwarzenegger was aiming for a more bipartisan and politically moderate approach during his tenure as Governor. The Chief of Staff is a crucial position in any administration as they oversee and manage the day-to-day operations of the office, maintain strong connections with key legislators and interest groups, and develop or help implement policy strategies for the Governor. The decision to appoint Susan Kennedy reflects Schwarzenegger's desire to build a winning legacy and maintain a cooperative attitude towards both parties in order to find common ground on policy issues. Additionally, with the next gubernatorial election on the horizon, this move suggests that Schwarzenegger was trying to appeal to a broader base of voters, including both Republicans and Democrats, in hopes of bolstering his image and securing further political success. In summary, Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, had a working relationship with a Democrat, Susan Kennedy, whom he appointed as his Chief of Staff despite the recommendations of Republican strategists. This decision implies a desire for a more moderate political stance, bipartisan collaboration, and an effort to create a lasting legacy by engaging both sides of the political spectrum."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Reading is the key to school success and, like any skill, it takes practice. A child learns to walk by practicing until he no longer has to think about how to put one foot in front of the other. An excellent sportsman practices until he can play quickly, correctly and without thinking. Educators call it \\"automaticity  \\".  www.ks5u.com A child learns to read by sounding out the letters and finding the meaning of the words. With practice, he stumbles less and less, reading by the phrase  . With automaticity, he doesn't have to think about the meaning of words, so he can give all his attention to the meaning of the text. It can begin as early as first grade. In a recent study of children in Illinois schools, Alan Rossman of Northwestern University found that automatic readers in the first grade not only read almost three times as fast as the others, but also got better results in exams. According to Rossman, the key to automaticity is the amount   of time a child spends reading , not his IQ. Any child who spends at least 3.5 to 4 hours a week reading books, magazines or newspapers will probably reach automaticity. It can happen if a child turns off TV just one night for reading at home. You can test yourself by reading something new which is suitable   for your level. If you read aloud with expression, with a sense of the meaning of the sentences, you probably are an automatic reader. If you read brokenly, one word at a time, without expression or meaning, you need more practice. Question: Rossman tells that any child who_will possibly be an automatic reader.

Build a movie plot around this: Which character leads anti-apartheid demonstrations? Dap Answer:","output":"Title: \\"The Freedom of Dap\\" Step 1: Establish the main character Our story will center around Dap, a passionate and charismatic activist who leads anti-apartheid demonstrations in South Africa during the late 1980s. Dap is a black South African who has grown up witnessing the horrors of apartheid firsthand and is determined to bring an end to the injustice. Step 2: Introduce key supporting characters - Lerato, Dap's love interest, who is a journalist in a local newspaper, amplifying Dap's message to the public. - Johan, a white South African police officer who secretly sympathizes with the anti-apartheid movement but fears repercussions from his peers and superiors. - Naledi, Dap's devoted sister who discovers her own leadership qualities through her brother's activism. Step 3: Set up the inciting incident While attending a peaceful anti-apartheid protest, Dap witnesses the brutal beating of a fellow protestor by the police. This event drives him to begin organizing and leading demonstrations himself in the hopes of drawing attention to the apartheid government's cruelty and inspiring change. Step 4: Present conflicts and challenges - Dap faces constant danger from the police forces, who are tasked with quashing any dissension against the apartheid regime. - Johan struggles with his conflicting loyalties, questioning whether he should break his oath to protect and serve the apartheid government or stand up for what he knows is right. - Lerato faces pressure from her newspaper's editor to avoid covering the demonstrations or risk losing her job, meaning Dap's message could be silenced. Step 5: Include a turning point or climax One of the anti-apartheid demonstrations, led by Dap, turns violent when the police arrive and a confrontation ensues. In the chaos, Naledi is arrested and brutally beaten by a police officer. Johan, unable to stand by any longer, intervenes, saving Naledi's life and revealing his sympathies to Dap. Step 6: Show character growth and resolution - Dap and his fellow protestors continue to resist the apartheid regime, gaining international attention and support. - Lerato defies her editor by publishing a damning article about the apartheid government's violence against peaceful demonstrators, leading to more widespread media coverage of the issue. - Johan joins the anti-apartheid movement, providing crucial insider information on police tactics and strategy. Step 7: Reach a conclusion The apartheid regime eventually falls due to the pressure mounted by Dap’s and others’ activism, coupled with the broader international condemnation of the government. As South Africa moves towards a new era of equality, our main characters live on to witness – and help shape – the nation they fought so hard to change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In typography, Durer depicts the geometric construction of the Latin alphabet, relying on Italian precedent. However, his construction of the Gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of polyhedra. Here Durer discusses the five Platonic solids, as well as seven Archimedean semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention. In all these, Durer shows the objects as nets. Finally, Durer discusses the Delian Problem and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective. It was in Bologna that Durer was taught (possibly by Luca Pacioli or Bramante) the principles of linear perspective, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of Piero della Francesca. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of Leonardo da Vinci. Although Durer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, Durer discusses in this last book of Underweysung der Messung an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.

Answer the question A wet towel will dry when it is left in the Sun. Which process occurs to make this happen?","output":"To answer the question, I will first analyze the given information, identify the processes under consideration, and finally, select the most suitable one. 1. Analyzing the given information: The problem states that a wet towel dries when left in the Sun. 2. Identifying the processes: There are several processes that could potentially occur to make this happen, such as conduction, convection, radiation, and evaporation. 3. Analyzing conduction: Heat transfer through a solid medium. In the context of the wet towel in the Sun, conduction may happen between the fibers of the towel. However, this process is not significant enough to cause the towel to dry. 4. Analyzing convection: The movement of hot molecules from one place to another, usually in fluids or gases. In this case, the air around the wet towel becomes warmer due to the Sun. Since air is a poor conductor, convection is primarily responsible for heating the air around the towel, but not for the drying process itself. 5. Analyzing radiation: The process of heat transfer through electromagnetic waves. The Sun emits radiant energy, which heats up the towel. Although radiation contributes to the heating of the towel, it is not the primary process responsible for drying the towel. 6. Analyzing evaporation: The process in which a liquid turns into a gas as a result of an increase in temperature and/or a decrease in pressure. In the case of the wet towel, the Sun's energy heats the liquid water in the towel, providing the necessary energy for the water molecules to escape into the air as water vapor. This process removes moisture from the towel, causing it to dry. Conclusion: Evaporation is the primary process that occurs when a wet towel is left in the Sun, causing it to dry. This is because the Sun's energy provides the necessary heat for the water molecules within the towel to escape into the air as water vapor, which in turn leads to the removal of moisture and the drying of the towel."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To contour your lips, apply some highlighting powder along the top of your cupid's bow and a dab of bronzer just below your bottom lip. Blend well and apply some bright lipstick.

I usually reserve that for a really horrible experience but in this case, this place earned a one star rating. I know that is harsh but this place straight up sucked.   There were 8 of us and when you have a large group it's difficult to coordinate where to go to eat. Someone in the group suggested we check out the Binion and off we went. We stumbled across Benny's and decided to go in since it wasn't busy.   There is no hostess stand so you walk in and find your own table to sit at, at least I think that's how it works. The middle aged waitress didn't acknowledge us while we were standing at the front. We walked around the small space seeing if there was a table for 8, there was not. There's only tables for 4. One couple was leaving and told us we could have their table to put together with the open table next to theirs. We did that. The waitress came over and did a quick wipe down with a dirty rag that left streaks and food behind. Eeww. I ended up wiping it down with the paper towels that were on the table.  The menu consists of 4 things. Full rack or half rack of ribs, 1/2 roasted chicken or 1/2 roasted chicken with 1/2 rack of ribs. Prices were really cheap. I'm thinking with only 4 things on the menu, the food has to be phenomenal. I was wrong. Mediocre. The ribs were a dry rub with sauce on the side. The sauce tasted like bottled sauce. My corn was the smallest out of the group about 2 inches long. The slaw was watery and the baked beans tasted like a pound of sugar was dumped in it. I didn't try the corn bread. My friend's chicken wasn't cooked all the way and was pink by the bone so she didn't eat it.  Service was slllloooooooowwwwww. My 86 grandma walks faster than she does. It took about 15 mins (and I'm being generous) for our waitress to come over and give us menus and even longer for her to come back and take our order. She left her bifocals on our table and when we were finally able to flag her down she mentioned she was looking all over for it because she couldn't put in our order since she couldn't see the computer screen. Great. We probably waited about an hour for our food. I really wanted to walk out but my friends said to give it a couple of more mins. Luckily we got our food after that.   One thing I saw that really disturbed me was, I saw our waitress dumping water glasses full of ice into the water pitcher. I know what I saw. She had 3 of the red water glasses, the same one I was drinking out of and saw her dump all 3 one at a time into the water pitcher. I don't know if she was recycling customers drinking water or if she used the glasses as a vessel to carry ice. She then dropped ice on the counter and scooped it up off the counter with her bare hands and dumped it into the pitcher. I stopped drinking the water and told my friends not to drink it.  There was another waitress there, a younger one but she was more preoccupied with coming in and out of the restaurant. Can't tell you what she was doing but she wasn't working that's for sure.   When our very frazzled and slow waitress finally brought our check, she actually gave us the wrong check. We had to flag her down and get the correct one. We spent another 15 mins waiting for her to come back with my friend's credit card. Actually she didn't come back so we went to her. My other friends went to go gamble while we dealt with her and my friend's now missing credit card. When she finally found it she hadn't processed it yet. While she was doing that she told us that the party before us forgot their credit card...uh..more like you forgot to give it back.   Also there was a young couple smoking their vapor there which I thought was rude and disrespectful.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A few weeks earlier, they had also agreed to give the government in Athens two more years to cut its overspending. That decision came as Greece's parliament approved a budget for 2013 that involves 9.4bn euros of spending cuts, a budget that triggered mass public protests in Athens. The delay in releasing the latest bailout money was largely due to wrangling between eurozone lenders and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over whether and by how much to cut Greece's debt, which will inevitably grow even more if Athens continues overspending for longer than previously planned. Why is Greece in trouble? Greece was living beyond its means even before it joined the euro. After it adopted the single currency, public spending soared. Public sector wages, for example, rose 50% between 1999 and 2007 - far faster than in most other eurozone countries. The government also ran up big debts paying for the 2004 Athens Olympics. And while money flowed out of the government's coffers, its income was hit by widespread tax evasion. So, after years of overspending, its budget deficit - the difference between spending and income - spiralled out of control. Moreover, much of the borrowing was concealed, as successive Greek governments sought to meet the 3%-of-GDP cap on borrowing that is required of members of the euro. When the global financial downturn hit - and Greece's hidden borrowings came to light -  the country was ill-prepared to cope. Debt levels reached the point where the country was no longer able to repay its loans, and was forced to ask for help from its European partners and the IMF in the form of massive loans. In the short term, however, the conditions attached to these loans have compounded Greece's woes. What has been done to help Greece? In short, a lot. In May 2010, the European Union and IMF provided 110bn euros (140bn: £88bn) of bailout loans to Greece to help the government pay its creditors. However, it soon became apparent that this would not be enough, so a second, 130bn-euro bailout was agreed earlier this year. As well as these two loans, which are made in stages, the vast majority of Greece's private-sector creditors agreed to write off about three-quarters of the debts owed to them by Athens. They also agreed to replace existing loans with new loans at a lower rate of interest. In the latest agreement, Greece's lenders have found ways to shave an extra 40bn euros off Greece's debtload. However, in return for all this help, the EU and IMF insisted that Greece embark on a major austerity drive involving drastic spending cuts, tax rises, and labour market and pension reforms. These have had a devastating effect on Greece's already weak economic recovery. The latest Greek budget predicts that the economy will shrink by 6.5% this year and by a further 4.5% in 2013. Greece has already been in recession for four years, and its economy is projected to have shrunk by a fifth between 2008 and the end of this year. Without economic growth, the Greek government cannot boost its own tax revenues and so has to rely on aid to pay its loans. Many commentators believe that even the combined 240bn euros of loans and the debt write-off will not be enough. Why did it take so long to agree the latest tranche of aid? Despite Greece approving its tough budget for 2013, the next tranche was not released immediately as there was no agreement among Greece's lenders on how to make the country's debt sustainable. Eurozone finance ministers agreed earlier this month to give Greece two more years - until 2016 - to meet the deficit reduction targets that are a condition of the bailout loans. The key to releasing the next tranche of bailout loans was to reach agreement on how to make Greek debt sustainable again. Greece's debt is currently forecast to hit almost 190% of GDP next year. The IMF made clear that it would only consider the debts sustainable if they could be brought down to 120% of GDP by 2020. The IMF will not lend money to a country whose debts it does not deem sustainable. Under the compromise, Greece's debts are now expected to fall to 124% of GDP by 2020. This will be done by cutting the interest rate on existing rescue loans, returning profits earned by the European Central Bank on Greek debts it owns, and helping Greece buy back its private-sector debts at their currently depressed market prices. It will not involve any write-off of the bailout loans owed by Greece - something that Germany and other lenders said would be unacceptable. The money will not be released until 14 December, in order to allow national parliaments in eurozone countries time to approve the deal. What happens next? When Antonis Samaras's New Democracy won the general election in June, he insisted Greece did not need a further bailout but wanted a two-year \\"breathing space\\" to meet the tough budget targets attached to the bailout from the EU and IMF. Greece has now been granted the extra time, but major problems remain and the financial markets are still nervous. If Greece's economy continues to contract sharply, the country may not be able to cut its overspending as much as planned, and may ultimately be unable to repay its debts, meaning it will need further help. If the rest of Europe is no longer willing to provide it, then Greece may be forced to leave the euro. There is, of course, the possibility that the Greek people, fed up with rising unemployment and falling living standards, will make it impossible for the government to continue even with the slower rate of austerity that is now planned. Why does this matter for the rest of Europe? If Greece does not repay its creditors, a dangerous precedent will have been set. This may make investors increasingly nervous about the likelihood of other highly-indebted nations, such as Italy, or those with weak economies, such as Spain, repaying their debts or even staying inside the euro. If investors stop buying bonds issued by other governments, then those governments in turn will not be able to repay their creditors - a potentially disastrous vicious circle. To combat this risk, European leaders have agreed a 700bn-euro firewall to protect the rest of the eurozone from a full-blown Greek default. Moreover, if banks in the weaker eurozone countries that are already struggling to find enough capital are forced to write off even more loans they have made - something that becomes more likely if the eurozone economy falls deeper into recession - they will become weaker still, undermining confidence in the entire banking system. Eurozone banks may then find it even hard to borrow, and therefore to lend, potentially sparking a second credit crunch, where bank lending effectively dries up, hurting the economy further. This problem would be exacerbated by savers and investors taking money out of banks in vulnerable economies, such as Greece, Portugal and Spain, and moving it to banks in safer economies such as Germany or the Netherlands. These potential scenarios would be made immeasurably worse if Greece were to leave the euro. The country would almost certainly reintroduce the drachma, which would devalue dramatically and quickly, making it even harder for Greece to repay its debts, and setting an even worse precedent.

Throughout much of her later career, Hopper was much in demand as a speaker at various computer-related events. She was well known for her lively and irreverent speaking style, as well as a rich treasury of early war stories. She also received the nickname \\"Grandma COBOL\\".  While she was working on a Mark II Computer at a US Navy research lab in Dahlgren, Virginia in 1947, her associates discovered a moth that was stuck in a relay; the moth impeded the operation of the relay. While neither Hopper nor her crew mentioned the phrase \\"debugging\\" in their logs, the case was held as an instance of literal \\"debugging.\\" For many years, the term bug had been in use in engineering. The remains of the moth can be found in the group's log book at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.  Grace Hopper is famous for her nanoseconds visual aid. People (such as generals and admirals) used to ask her why satellite communication took so long. She started handing out pieces of wire that were just under one foot long (11.80 inches = 300 millimeters)--the distance that light travels in one nanosecond. She gave these pieces of wire the metonym \\"nanoseconds.\\" She was careful to tell her audience that the length of her nanoseconds was actually the maximum speed the signals would travel in a vacuum, and that signals would travel more slowly through the actual wires that were her teaching aids. Later she used the same pieces of wire to illustrate why computers had to be small to be fast. At many of her talks and visits, she handed out \\"nanoseconds\\" to everyone in the audience, contrasting them with a coil of wire 984 feet long, representing a microsecond. Later, while giving these lectures while working for DEC, she passed out packets of pepper, calling the individual grains of ground pepper picoseconds.

Firstly, it is important to consider the meaning of the term \\"vandalized\\". Vandalism typically refers to the deliberate act of damaging or destroying the property of others. In this instance, the graffiti might be considered as vandalism since it possibly involves the defacement of a building's exterior. Now, let's assess the possible associations between \\"Boss Life\\" graffiti and gang activity. The phrase \\"Boss Life\\" might or might not relate to gangs, as it does not explicitly reference any known gang symbols, names or slang. Moreover, graffiti can often include various elements, such as artistic expressions, political messages, and personal tags, which do not necessarily have any connection to criminal activity or gangs. Furthermore, the original sentence mentions two people standing in front of the building. Even if we assume that the people are somehow linked to the graffiti, it could be a result of numerous scenarios that involve activities ranging from street art to spontaneous writings by individuals unaffiliated with gangs. There is no concrete evidence to ascertain that these people are responsible for the graffiti, let alone being members of a gang. In conclusion, while the sentence \\"The building was vandalized by a gang\\" could be considered a plausible interpretation, it is not fully supported by the information provided within the original sentence. Other explanations, such as an individual artist or random passerby painting the graffiti, are equally plausible. To conclusively state the truth of the second sentence, more context, thorough investigation, and clear evidence would be necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 3: Comparing the premise and the hypothesis The premise says that the White House lawyers invoked attorney-client privilege, which is a legal principle protecting the confidentiality of communications between a client and their attorney. This is done so that the client can fully disclose information to their attorney without fearing that the information will be revealed to others. Step 4: Conclusion Since invoking attorney-client privilege implies that the lawyers acted to protect the confidentiality of their client's communications, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Lawyers disclosed everything their client had said.\\" is not true, as the lawyers did not disclose their client's communications due to the upheld privilege."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The young girl in the sex video that prompted the gang murder of an innocent Bronx teen has been receiving threatening messages on social media, a high-ranking police source said Monday.      The 15-year-old girl is under NYPD police protection as a result of messages she’s gotten on Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram, the source said.      Some refer to her as a “whore” and blame her for the death of Lesandro “Junior” Guzman-Feliz, who was dragged out of a bodega and hacked to death Wednesday by a group of five suspected Trinitarios gang members.      Like Guzman-Feliz, the girl is enrolled in the NYPD Explorers program for youths interested in a career in law enforcement, the source added.      Police believe Guzman-Feliz, 15, was the victim of mistaken identity. He resembles a young man who raps in a video that shows the girl having sex in the background. She’s believed to be the relative of a Trinitarios member. ||||| A bodega worker heartlessly gave the boot to mistaken-ID murder victim Lesandro “Junior” Guzman-Feliz as the desperate teen bled all over the store rather than offer him any aid, according to newly released video footage.      In the first of two clips that emerged Tuesday, Guzman-Feliz, 15, enters the Cruz and Chiky grocery on East 183rd Street near Bathgate Avenue in the Bronx last Wednesday night and jumps behind the counter in an attempt to hide from the Trinitarios gangbangers who would soon hack him to death with knives and a machete.      He struggles with a worker in a blue shirt, who puts his arm out to stop the frightened teen — but Guzman-Feliz manages to scramble behind the counter.      The second video — made seconds after Guzman-Feliz was stabbed outside the bodega — shows him staggering back into the store and past two men.      The teen leaves a trail of blood on the floor as he heaves himself up on the counter, apparently seeking help for his mortal wounds.      But the callous bodega worker can be seen jumping backward and then motioning toward the front door. Guzman-Feliz seems to comply, by promptly stumbling back outside.      It is unclear what was said, ­because the videos lack sound.      Guzman-Feliz’s left hand smears a pool of blood left on the counter as he leaves.      A previously released clip from exterior surveillance shows the teen then exiting the deli and throwing his hands up in the air in exasperation.      He limped a block to St. Barnabas Hospital, but collapsed on the sidewalk steps away.      The worker watched the boy grow up over the years only to let him die before his very eyes, grieving mom Leandra Feliz said.      “They know him! We live here 17 year, [the owner] knows him,” she said over the weekend. “He pushed him like, ‘Take him! Take it outside!’ Before the killers get in, my son was hiding inside the store. He [had] time to lock the door or call police or something. He did nothing.”      Outrage at the bodega hit a fever pitch Tuesday as a trio of local lawmakers demanded that the place be shuttered.      “An owner who stands idly by while a 15-year-old is dragged out of his store and murdered in cold blood with a machete is no long­er worthy of doing business in NYC,” reads a letter City Council members Ritchie Torres, Vanessa Gibson and Rafael Salamanca sent to the Department of Consumer Affairs Commissioner Lorelai Salas on Monday, demanding that the agency shutter the store, formerly known in the neighborhood as Zesarina Grocery.      The council members sent a similar letter to the State Liquor Authority demanding that it pull the bodega’s license to sell booze.      “I saw video where the owner was engaged in business as usual right after Junior ran frantically in the store,” Torres told the Post Tuesday.      “He continued to engage in a business transact with Junior’s blood right in front of him.”      The owner did, however, call 911, NYPD Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea confirmed during a press conference Tuesday.      Community members have ripped the owner and those inside the store that night for seemingly doing nothing to help save Guzman-Feliz as gang members dragged him out.      The bodega owner, who could not be reached for comment Tuesday, has been getting death threats since the slaying and has kept his business closed, a police source said.      The deli owner could not be reached for comment, and the SLA did not respond to requests for comment.      “We are reviewing the letter. No general business license exists in ­local law,” said DCA spokeswoman Gloria Chin.      Additional reporting by Stephanie Pagones ||||| Eight suspects are now in custody in connection with the vicious murder of a New York teenager. Mourners filled the streets in the Bronx Monday, frustrated with the violence that cost 15-year-old Lesandro Guzman-Feliz his life.      According to a relative, the gang believed to be responsible admitted on social media it had attacked the wrong person, reports CBS News' DeMarco Morgan. They reportedly thought he had leaked a sex tape of one of the gang members' relatives. The teen's family said an apology is not enough. They want justice.      Guzman-Feliz – known as Junior – was beaten and stabbed repeatedly by five men and was able to walk himself to a nearby hospital after the attack, where he died. His father, Lesandro Guzman, rushed home from a job in Florida when he learned about the attack.      \\"I miss him. I miss him a lot. I don't know what happens tomorrow, but I miss him,\\" Guzman said.            The gruesome murder is mobilizing the community in the streets and online, under the new hashtag \\"Justice for Junior.\\" Police used social media to solicit tips and were flooded with information, which reportedly helped identify multiple suspects, including their names, locations, and gang affiliations.      All of Guzman-Feliz's suspected attackers are alleged members of a gang know as the \\"Trinitarios.\\" Family members believe the incident was a case of mistaken identity and claim the gang even apologized to them on social media.      \\"No sorry, no apologize is going to bring my son back. He was a good and sweet kid,\\" Leandra Feliz, his mother, said.      The slain teen's parents say he dreamed of becoming a detective and was part of the NYPD Explorers, a program for high school students. New York police commissioner James O'Neill was at his wake along with hundreds of others.      \\"I'm very thankful for the support from everybody. Makes me feel like sure my son gonna have justice,\\" Feliz said.            A GoFundMe page set up for Guzman-Feliz's family has raised 240,000. Local rapper Cardi B donated 8,000 to the fund. Another wake service is scheduled for the teen on Tuesday night. His funeral is planned for Wednesday. ||||| The 15-year-old New York City teen who died last week after being brutally hacked with a machete outside a deli went into the store after the attack to seek help – but instead was denied medical assistance and was asked to leave, a disturbing new video shows.      Graphic surveillance footage posted online – which is drawing widespread outrage Tuesday on social media – captures the sequence of events inside the Zesarina Grocery store in the Bronx last Wednesday before and after Lesandro Guzman-Feliz was attacked. Police have since arrested seven men in connection to the gang-related killing.      The clip begins with Guzman-Feliz entering the deli to escape the attackers, who police believe targeted him in a case of mistaken identity. A police source told the New York Post on Monday that Guzman-Feliz resembled a young man seen rapping in a video that shows a girl – believed to be the relative of a Trinitarios gang member – having sex in the background.      WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT BELOW      A post shared by 🤴🏽Robert 🌈Williams🦁 (@areumdawo_saja) on Jun 25, 2018 at 11:00pm PDT      As Guzman-Feliz jumps onto the counter, he appears to be met with resistance by a worker behind the cash register. The worker eventually lets the teen onto the other side before the two walk off camera.      Then the suspected attackers come into the store and drag Guzman-Feliz outside, where he was savagely hacked with a machete and left to die with blood gushing out of a neck wound.      Shortly after the attack, the footage shows Guzman-Feliz coming back into the store to seek assistance. As he slumps over the counter, the worker behind it appears to jump back and refuses to come to his aid.      WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT BELOW      An apparent customer who was inside the store the entire time is also seen gesturing for the teen to leave, pointing toward the door. Guzman-Feliz walks out.      Then, in one of the video’s most shocking moments, the customer reaches over a pool of Guzman-Feliz’s blood to complete a transaction that got put on hold during the attack, handing the worker what appears to be cash before getting an item back in response. The customer then throws a backpack over his shoulder and leaves the store, following Guzman-Feliz’s trail of blood out the door, while the worker is pictured making a phone call.      The teen died shortly afterward, steps away from nearby St. Barnabas Hospital.      \\"This just makes my blood boil,\\" one Instagram user wrote next to the footage. \\"The murderers came into the store and was still able to drag the boy out the bodega with nobody helping him. To [make] matters worse HE CAME BACK INTO THE BODEGA!! Bleeding… after the attack and nobody helped him!!!”      “They treated him like an animal. My heart breaks for this poor boy his family and friend,” another user reacted on Twitter.      New York City police so far have charged 19-year-old Kevin Alvarez of the Bronx with murder and gang assault in relation to the killing. Six other suspects taken into custody over the weekend in Paterson, N.J. -- identified as Jose Muniz, 21, Jose Tavarez, 21, Manuel Rivera, 18, Danel Fernandez, 21, Santiago Rodriguez, 24 and Joniki Martinez, 24 -- waived their right to contest extradition at a hearing on Tuesday, Fox 5 NY reported. They are expected to be arraigned on Wednesday in Bronx Criminal Court. All the men are suspected Trinitarios gang members.      Meanwhile, more than a thousand people reportedly turned out Monday for Guzman-Feliz’s wake.      The teen, who aspired to become a New York City police detective, was also memorialized in a tattoo on his father’s hand.      “My heart is broken, really broken,” Lissandro Guzman told the New York Post. “He’s my son, but he’s also like my best friend.”      NBA star Carmelo Anthony was among those to appear Monday at a makeshift memorial of candles and photographs outside the deli, which has been shuttered since the killing. New York Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia and singer Rihanna also have posted their condolences online, with the hashtag #JusticeForJunior going viral. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"A young girl who was in a video that led to a terrible mistake and the death of an innocent boy is now getting mean messages and the police is keeping her safe.

Henry VI, elected King of the Romans since 1169, succeeded his father Frederick and was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Celestine III in 1191. In his struggle with the Princes to enforce his succession, the tide turned in his favour when the returning crusader King Richard was captured in Austria and only released against an oath of allegiance and an enormous ransom. In 1194 Henry could assert the inheritance claims of his wife Constance by conquering the Kingdom of Sicily. By declaring a new Crusade to reconquer Jerusalem, Henry aimed at an agreement with Pope Celestine III to acknowledge his rule over Sicily. In 1195 the armistice concluded by King Richard ended. Sultan Saladin had already died in 1193 and a conflict over his succession raged in the Ayyubid lands.

Although they both use the same word, \\"draw\\" has multiple meanings in the English language, and in this case, it is utilized in different contexts. Here is a detailed explanation: 1. In the first sentence: \\"At the start of their turn, each player must draw a card.\\" In this context, \\"draw\\" refers to taking or selecting something (a card, in this case) from a set, container, or in a game. When referring to games, such as card games or board games, \\"drawing\\" typically means that a player removes a card from a deck or a tile from a pile, and adds it to their hand or play area. The action of selecting, taking or picking up a new card during a game is the fundamental idea behind \\"draw\\" in this sentence. 2. In the second sentence: \\"The session was drawn to a close.\\" Here, \\"draw\\" has an entirely different meaning, as it refers to bringing something (in this case, the session) to an end or closing point. Rather than the aforementioned idea of selecting or taking something, \\"draw\\" in this context is associated with the gradual movement towards a conclusion, an end of an event or an approaching deadline. It functions as a way to convey the idea of reaching the finality of something, such as an event or process. So, these two sentences demonstrate distinct uses for the word \\"draw,\\" with the first referring to selecting a card, while the second involves moving towards the completion of an event.

This diet also claims that it will help you lose 15 pounds (6.8 kg) in the first 2 weeks, so Atkins is a great plan if you are hoping to drop a large amount of weight quickly. The South Beach diet was developed by a cardiologist and it claims to help you develop a healthier way of eating while also promoting weight loss. Also, the South Beach diet does not restrict carbs as intensely as some other diets, so it may be easier to follow and stick with it. This diet plan focuses on getting your daily intake to 75% fat, 20% protein, and 5% carbs.  This will force your body to use fat for energy and promote quick weight loss.  A ketogenic diet has long been known as beneficial for people with epilepsy. However, following the diet may also help to prevent Alzheimer’s, stroke, dementia, and traumatic brain injury.  Some people experience negative side effects as they transition to a very low-carb diet, such as brain fog, fatigue, and moodiness. The Dukan diet is one of the most structured low-carb diets, which some people find helpful. In the first 10 days of this diet, you only eat lean protein, oat bran, and water. After that you can include non-starchy veggies, a serving of fruit, a serving of whole grain, and hard cheeses. You may lose 10 pounds (4.5 kg) or more in the first couple of weeks, and then about 2 pounds (0.91 kg) to 4 pounds (1.8 kg) pounds after that. Keep in mind that any time a diet has a lot of restrictions, you are at risk of nutritional deficiencies. You cannot have any dairy, grains, potatoes, or processed foods on this diet, but you can eat lots of meat, veggies, roots, fruits, and nuts. The whole foods approach of this diet is healthy and you will get to eat plenty of food to stay full and satisfied.  The goal of the Paleo diet attributes many of the health issues people have today, including obesity, with the modern agricultural diet that includes dairy and grains. Summary:","output":"This article talks about different low-carb diets that help people lose weight and become healthier. The Atkins diet can help you lose a lot of weight quickly.

The dog caused Mr. Grogan a lot of trouble, but it also provided many stories for his newspaper articles. Later, he wrote a best-selling book, \\"Marley and Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog.\\" Marley was happy and fun-loving. But he was also extremely large and difficult to control. He bit anything that he could find around the house, including plastic, clothing and jewelry. And he had a great fear of loud noises, especially thunderstorms. Unfortunately, the Grogans lived in Florida where many thunderstorms develop. Marley would attack the furniture, walls and doors until his feet bled if he was left alone in the house during a thunderstorm. Marley almost damaged their home several times. John Grogan said that at first he considered that probably his dog could be trained to be a show champion. But he soon realized that was impossible. Marley didn't like to learn skills that didn't belong to dogs, and he was driven out of the dog training school for causing troubles for other dogs. He didn't want to hide his emotions.

Summarize: Dwight Hammond, 73, and his son Steven, 46, were convicted of arson in 2012 but a court ruled their original sentences were too short. The Hammonds' lawyer has said that the family does not want the protesters' support, according to CBS News. The case has riled right-wing activists who resent government interference. They said they lit fires on federal land to combat invasive species and protect their land from wildfires. Those occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge centre in Burns say they plan to stay for years and may use violence if police try to evict them. Local police said \\"outside militants\\" had seized the building, and that multiple agencies were working on a solution, the Oregonian reported. Among those there is Ammon Bundy, whose father Cliven was involved in a stand-off with the government over grazing rights in 2014. Speaking to CNN, Mr Ammon made no specific demands but said the action was aimed at helping locals \\"claim back their lands and resources\\". He said that the wildlife refuge had expanded at the expense of ranchers and miners. The incident is part of a decades-old conflict between ranchers and the federal government over the use of public land. Critics of the federal government say it often oversteps its authority over land use. On Saturday an unknown number of men took over the bird sanctuary on a snowy desert plain in Oregon. There is no sign of police officers and there has been no violence or negotiations. The militia men who seized the complex say they are prepared to stay for years. They have urged supporters to take up arms and join them to assert the rights of ranchers in the American west; rights which they say have been trampled by a federal government over-reaching its authority. The FBI said it was aware of the occupation and the sheriff has urged people to stay away from the building, saying multiple agencies were working on a solution. In an interview with the Associated Press news agency, Ammon Bundy's brother, Ryan Bundy, said the protesters' ultimate goal was to turn the land over to local authorities so that people can use it free of federal oversight. \\"I understand the land needs to be used wisely, but that's what we as stewards need to do. A rancher is going to take care of his own ranch,\\" he added. But despite the protest Dwight Hammond says he and his son plan to report peacefully to prison on Monday. His lawyers told Associated Press \\"neither Ammon Bundy nor anyone within his group/organisation speak for the Hammond Family\\". Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward was critical of the protesters and their motives. \\"These men came to Harney County claiming to be part of militia groups supporting local ranchers, when in reality these men had alternative motives to attempt to overthrow the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the United States,\\" Mr Ward said in a statement.

The 34-year-old of Derby spent two days in the city where a nuclear reactor at Chernobyl Power Station exploded on April 26, 1986. During the accident itself, 31 people died and it has left devastating long term effects, such as cancer and deformities, which are still being accounted for. Mr Batchelor said: 'Each day when leaving the area you had to be scanned for high levels of radioactivity.

Desks and chairs lie in disarray, as if frozen in time, while textbooks and other materials have been left to decay over the years. The city, once bustling with life, now stands as a ghost town, with eerie silence enveloping the abandoned buildings. In his photographs, Toby Batchelor captures the desolation and despair that hang heavy in the air, a testament to the magnitude of the disaster. Vegetation has started to reclaim the city, adding to the haunting atmosphere and displaying nature's resilience amidst the devastation. It is a chilling reminder of the potential dangers of nuclear power and the lasting impact it can have on communities when things go wrong. Despite the severity of the catastrophe, Pripyat has become an unlikely tourist destination for those interested in exploring the site of the nuclear disaster. Tour groups are guided through the area, adhering to strict safety precautions, allowing them a glimpse into the chilling past of the doomed city. For many, it serves as a stark warning of the risks associated with nuclear technology and the importance of prioritizing safety measures. Yet, even as the world bears witness to the long-term effects of the Chernobyl disaster, the cleanup process continues at a slow pace. Thousands of workers operate under challenging conditions, with the dangers of radiation exposure still very much present, in an effort to contain the contamination and restore some sense of normalcy to the area. No one can truly know the full extent of the impact that the Chernobyl disaster will have on generations to come, but the harrowing images captured by Toby Batchelor remind us of the tragic consequences that can result from failing to protect the environment and the communities we live in."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help. Ambler was offered the opportunity to go with them, but felt that his duty as a doctor required him to stay with the main body.For the next week De Long's party struggled on, sometimes making barely a mile a day.

They piloted the explosives-laden boat alongside the USS Cole, made friendly gestures to crew members, and detonated the bomb. Quso did not arrive at the apartment in time to film the attack. Back in Afghanistan,  Bin Laden anticipated U.S. military retaliation. He ordered the evacuation of al Qaeda's Kandahar airport compound and fled- first to the desert area near Kabul, then to Khowst and Jalalabad, and eventually back to Kandahar. In Kandahar, he rotated between five to six residences, spending one night at each residence. In addition, he sent his senior advisor, Mohammed Atef, to a different part of Kandahar and his deputy, Ayman al Zawahiri, to Kabul so that all three could not be killed in one attack. There was no American strike. In February 2001, a source reported that an individual whom he identified as the big instructor (probably a reference to  Bin Laden) complained frequently that the United States had not yet attacked. According to the source,  Bin Laden wanted the United States to attack, and if it did not he would launch something bigger. The attack on the USS Cole galvanized al Qaeda's recruitment efforts. Following the attack,  Bin Laden instructed the media committee, then headed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, to produce a propaganda video that included a reenactment of the attack along with images of the al Qaeda training camps and training methods; it also highlighted Muslim suffering in Palestine, Kashmir, Indonesia, and Chechnya. Al Qaeda's image was very important to  Bin Laden, and the video was widely disseminated. Portions were aired on Al Jazeera, CNN, and other television outlets. It was also disseminated among many young men in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and caused many extremists to travel to Afghanistan for training and jihad.

In both cases, the subject, presumably a man, is relocating. However, the order of the cities and the timing of when he moved to them is different in each statement, which changes the meaning significantly. In the first statement: \\"He moved to Attika, Indiana in 1853, and in 1859 to Bloomington, Illinois.\\" This tells us that the man moved to Attika, Indiana first, specifically in the year 1853. Then, approximately six years later, in 1859, he moved again, this time to Bloomington, Illinois. This information is sequential and puts his relocation to Attika, Indiana before his time in Bloomington, Illinois. This directly impacts any events or experiences he might have had in each place, his relationship to each place, and how we understand his timeline and story. In contrast, the second statement: \\"He moved to Bloomington, Illinois in 1853, and in 1859 to Attika, Indiana.\\" This tells a very different story. In this scenario, the man moved to Bloomington, Illinois first in 1853, which is then followed by a move to Attika, Indiana in 1859. This swaps the order of the relocation events compared to the first statement, moving his time in Bloomington, Illinois to before his time in Attika, Indiana. As with the first statement, this directly influences his experiences, relationship to each city, and how we track his timeline and story. Therefore, despite both sentences discussing the same man and the same two cities, the difference in timing and order of the moves leads to two divergent narratives and meanings, they are not the same."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is \\"Tensions soon developed among different Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars.\\" the correct answer?","output":"The statement \\"Tensions soon developed among different Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars.\\" is a simplified answer. To provide a detailed and long answer, we need to delve into the history of ancient Greece. The Ancient Greek world was primarily composed of city-states or \\"poleis\\" that were relatively independent from each other, and many conflicts occurred between these city-states throughout history. While it is challenging to give an exact number of successive civil wars that occurred among Greek clans, there are a few significant examples that shed light on the nature of conflict among the ancient Greeks. While the term \\"civil war\\" might not be an accurate representation of the Greek poleis' conflicts, the Peloponnesian War offers a broad context for the rivalries and tensions among Greek clans. The Peloponnesian War (431 – 404 BCE) was a series of conflicts between the Athenian Empire and the Peloponnesian League, led by Sparta. It comprised two main phases, separated by a brief period of peace: 1. Archidamian War (431 – 421 BCE): This phase of war was named after the Spartan king Archidamus II. It began in 431 BCE when the Thebans attacked the city-state of Plataea, an ally of Athens. The war continued for a decade and ended with the Peace of Nicias, a treaty signed in 421 BCE between Athens and Sparta. However, the peace did not last long. 2. The Decelean War or Ionian War (413 – 404 BCE): The second phase of the Peloponnesian War followed the failed Sicilian Expedition by the Athenians, during which their navy was virtually destroyed. With increased support from Persia, the Spartans managed to defeat the Athenian Empire, and in 404 BCE, Athens was forced to surrender. Apart from the Peloponnesian War, other examples of conflict among Greek clans include: 1. The First Sacred War (594 – 585 BCE): This war was fought between the Amphictyonic League, a religious federation of ancient Greek tribes, and the city of Kirra. The cause of the war was Kirra's alleged piracy and impiety against the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi. The conflict ended with the destruction of Kirra. 2. The Lelantine War (circa 700 – 650 BCE): This war was fought between the city-states of Chalcis and Eretria over control of the fertile Lelantine Plain, located in Euboea. This war was significant because it involved most of the important poleis of the time, including Athens, Corinth, and Samos, testing their alliances and rivalries. Given the complexity of the historical context and the numerous wars and conflicts in Ancient Greece, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact number of successive civil wars between Greek clans. The answer provided in the statement is an oversimplification of the historical events and conflicts that took place among ancient Greek factions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This conclusion can be drawn from several key elements within the review. First, the reviewer opens their statement with \\"Wow. This is really not that good,\\" which clearly indicates a negative sentiment. This phrase speaks volumes about the reviewer’s disappointment or dissatisfaction with whatever they are reviewing. The use of the word \\"really\\" is an intensifier and suggests an even greater level of negativity or disappointment. Second, the reviewer states \\"I would like to agree with the others in that at least the acting is good…it is, but it is nothing special.\\" The transitional phrase \\"I would like to agree\\" might initially suggest the reviewer is about to present a positive sentiment, but they immediately counteract this by insisting that the acting is \\"nothing special.\\" This downplays the seeming positivity of the compliment and shifts focus back to a negative perspective. Lastly, the reviewer says \\"The movie is so predictable and I for one am sick of receiving culture info through movies.\\" The term \\"predictable\\" is generally used in a negative context when critiquing films, as it suggests a lack of originality or creativity. Furthermore, the expression of being \\"sick\\" of a certain aspect also illustrates their dissatisfaction. Lastly, the rating \\"/****\\" places a stark point on the overall negative sentiment. Without a clear numerical value provided, it's assumed that this symbol represents a low score.  Hence, collectively these factors point to a negative review, showing dissatisfaction and a lack of enthusiasm towards the movie.

Which former bandleader was married to Ava Gardner and Lana Turner What is the answer?","output":"The former bandleader who was married to both Ava Gardner and Lana Turner was Artie Shaw. Artie Shaw, born Arthur Jacob Arshawsky on May 23, 1910, in New York City, gained prominence as a big band leader, jazz clarinetist, and composer during the swing era of the 1930s and 1940s. Shaw was the leader of one of the most popular big bands in the late 1930s through the early 1940s. Artie Shaw was married eight times in his life, with his spouses including some of Hollywood's most famous actresses. In 1945, he married the stunning Ava Gardner, who at the time was an up-and-coming actress. Gardner eventually became one of the most celebrated actresses in Hollywood, renowned for her roles in films like \\"The Barefoot Contessa\\" (1954) and \\"Mogambo\\" (1953). Their marriage was short-lived, as they divorced in 1946. Before marrying Ava Gardner, Artie Shaw had been married to Hollywood actress Lana Turner, whose notable films include \\"Peyton Place\\" (1957), \\"The Bad and the Beautiful\\" (1952), and \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" (1946). Turner was known as one of the most glamorous screen icons of the era and later gained recognition for her personal life and scandals. Artie Shaw married Lana Turner in 1940, but like his marriage to Gardner, it was a short-lived union, and they divorced in 1940 itself. In addition to Ava Gardner and Lana Turner, Artie Shaw was married to several other women over the years, including stars such as Doris Dowling, Evelyn Keyes, and actress-author Kathleen Winsor. Artie Shaw passed away on December 30, 2004, at the age of 94, leaving behind a rich musical legacy and a fascinating personal life marked by numerous high-profile marriages and relationships."},{"instruction":"Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: \\"God is a Bullet\\" would make a hell of an Action Movie.

Jonah or Jonas is the name given in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh/Old Testament) to a prophet of the northern kingdom of Israel in about the 8th century BCE. He is the eponymous central figure of the Book of Jonah, in which he is called upon by God to travel to Nineveh and warn its residents to repent of their sins or face divine wrath. Instead, Jonah boards a ship to Tarshish. Caught in a storm, he orders the ship's crew to cast him overboard, whereupon he is swallowed by a giant fish. The Book of Jonah (Yonah yvnh) is one of the twelve minor prophets included in the Tanakh. According to one tradition, Jonah was the boy brought back to life by Elijah the prophet in 1 Kings 17. Another tradition holds that he was the son of the woman of Shunem brought back to life by Elisha in 2 Kings 4 and that he is called the \\"son of Amittai\\" (Truth) due to his mother's recognition of Elisha's identity as a prophet in 2 Kings 17:24. The Book of Jonah is read every year, in its original Hebrew and in its entirety, on Yom Kippur - the Day of Atonement, as the Haftarah at the afternoon mincha prayer. According to Rabbi Eliezer, the fish that swallowed Jonah was created in the primordial era and the inside of its mouth was like a synagogue; the fish's eyes were like windows and a pearl inside its mouth provided further illumination.  According to the Midrash, while Jonah was inside the fish, it told him that its life was nearly over because soon the Leviathan would eat them both. Jonah promised the fish that he would save them. Following Jonah's directions, the fish swam up alongside the Leviathan and Jonah threatened to leash the Leviathan by its tongue and let the other fish eat it. The Leviathan heard Jonah's threats, saw that he was circumcized, and realized that he was protected by the Lord, so it fled in terror, leaving Jonah and the fish alive.  Teshuva - the ability to repent and be forgiven by God - is a prominent idea in Jewish thought. This concept is developed in the Book of Jonah: Jonah, the son of truth (the name of his father \\"Amitai\\" in Hebrew means truth), refuses to ask the people of Nineveh to repent. He seeks the truth only, and not forgiveness. When forced to go, his call is heard loud and clear. The people of Nineveh repent ecstatically, \\"fasting, including the sheep,\\" and the Jewish scripts are critical of this. The Book of Jonah also highlights the sometimes unstable relationship between two religious needs: comfort and truth. Ask a question about this article.","output":"Can you provide more insight into the significance of reading the Book of Jonah during Yom Kippur and its connection to the theme of repentance and forgiveness?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Electricity is a physical phenomenon associated with the presence of electric charge. Although initially considered a phenomenon separate to magnetism, since the development of Maxwell's Equations both are recognized as part of a single phenomenon:electromagnetism. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others. In addition, electricity is at the heart of many modern technologies.  - Geography (from Greek , \\"geographia\\", literally \\"earth description\\") is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of Earth. The first person to use the word \\"\\" was Eratosthenes (276194 BC). Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of the Earth and its human and natural complexitiesnot merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. It is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography. The four historical traditions in geographical research are: spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences. Geography has been called \\"the world discipline\\" and \\"the bridge between the human and the physical sciences\\".  - The term export means shipping in the goods and services out of the jurisdiction of a country. The seller of such goods and services is referred to as an \\"exporter\\" and is based in the country of export whereas the overseas based buyer is referred to as an \\"importer\\". In international trade, \\"exports\\" refers to selling goods and services produced in the home country to other markets.  - Lightning is a sudden electrostatic discharge that occurs during an electrical storm. This discharge occurs between electrically charged regions of a cloud (called intra-cloud lightning or IC), between two clouds (CC lightning), or between a cloud and the ground (CG lightning). The charged regions in the atmosphere temporarily equalize themselves through this discharge referred to as a \\"strike\\" if it hits an object on the ground, and a flash, if it occurs within a cloud. Lightning causes light in the form of plasma, and sound in the form of thunder. Lightning may be seen and not heard when it occurs at a distance too great for the sound to carry as far as the light from the strike or flash.  - An economy (From Greek   \\"household\\" and o  \\"manage\\") is an area of the production, distribution, or trade, and consumption of goods and services by different agents in a given geographical location. Understood in its broadest sense, 'The economy is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use and management of resources'. Economic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency, but monetary transactions are only a small part of the economic domain.  - The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is a civilian foreign intelligence service of the United States federal government, tasked with gathering, processing and analyzing national security information from around the world, primarily through the use of human intelligence (HUMINT). As one of the principal members of the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC), the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet.  - The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking.  - ALMANAC is the name of a major breast cancer trial. The acronym stands for \\"Axillary Lymphatic Mapping Against Nodal Axillary Clearance.\\" This major randomized trial performed in several centres in the UK produced clear evidence that sentinel node biopsy (SNB), used to stage axillary spread of disease, can be used with low failed localization and false negative rates, provided both radioisotope and blue dye are used to locate the sentinel nodes.  - The World Factbook (also known as the CIA World Factbook) is a reference resource produced by the Central Intelligence Agency with almanac-style information about the countries of the world. The official print version is available from the National Technical Information Service and the Government Printing Office. Other companiessuch as Skyhorse Publishingalso print a paper edition. \\"The Factbook\\" is available in the form of a website that is partially updated every week.

There are two types of electric charges: positive and negative. Like charges repel and unlike attract. An object is negatively charged if it has an excess of electrons, and is otherwise positively charged or uncharged. The SI derived unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C). In electrical engineering, it is also common to use the ampere-hour (Ah), and, in chemistry, it is common to use the elementary charge (\\"e\\") as a unit. The symbol \\"Q\\" often denotes charge. Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called classical electrodynamics, and is still accurate for problems that don't require consideration of quantum effects.  - Communication (from Latin \\"commnicre\\", meaning \\"to share\\") is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules.  - The world is the planet Earth and all life upon it, including human civilization. In a philosophical context, the world is the whole of the physical Universe, or an ontological world. In a theological context, the \\"world\\" is the material or the profane sphere, as opposed to the celestial, spiritual, transcendent or sacred.

Lack of attention to details: The reviewer acknowledges that they bought the product without looking at the dimensions, which suggests that they might not have been fully informed before their purchase. However, this part of their experience is not necessarily a reflection of the product's quality itself but rather an aspect of the consumer's decision-making process. Despite this acknowledgment, the review as a whole maintains an unfavorable depiction of the changing table. In conclusion, the product review presents a significantly unflattering portrayal of the changing table. The main issue lies in the dimensions, which seem insufficient to accommodate a growing baby.

Premise: \\"Anse glanced at the mule's long melancholy face.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The mule never looked happy.\\"?","output":"In order to determine if the premise \\"Anse glanced at the mule's long melancholy face\\" truly entails the hypothesis \\"The mule never looked happy,\\" we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements and evaluate their implications. The Premise: \\"Anse glanced at the mule's long melancholy face.\\" This premise provides information about a particular situation in which Anse observes the mule's facial expression as being melancholic. The key term here is \\"melancholy,\\" which, by definition, refers to a feeling of sadness or a gloomy state of mind. Therefore, in this specific instance, the mule appears sad or unhappy. The Hypothesis: \\"The mule never looked happy.\\" On the other hand, the hypothesis takes the information from the premise and makes a broader generalization, stating that the mule never appears happy. The conclusive nature of the word \\"never\\" implies a sense of permanence, suggesting that the mule is incapable of exhibiting a happy or content demeanor. One singular observation of the mule looking melancholic, as mentioned in the premise, does not necessarily mean that the mule has not looked or cannot look happy in some other instances. Now, let's analyze the relationship between these two statements and evaluate their implications. The premise does not exclusively confirm the hypothesis, as it only provides a snapshot of one particular situation. It is possible that in other instances, the mule has looked happy, but we are unable to determine this based solely on the given premise. Therefore, while there may be a correlation between the two statements, the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. It is important to recognize that a single instance of an observation does not automatically lead to drawing a conclusive or generalized claim. In order to support the hypothesis, additional evidence or instances of the mule's demeanor would be needed. For instance, if multiple situations were described where the mule consistently appeared unhappy or sad, perhaps then there may be stronger grounds to support the hypothesis. However, with the given information, we cannot confirm that \\"The mule never looked happy\\" based on the single observation presented in the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rodeos often involve events such as bull riding or bronco riding (both in the case of saddle bronc and bareback bronc riding).  So, it is not specifically mentioned whether the cowboy is on a bull or a bronco. With this information, it is not possible to logically conclude that \\"A cowboy is about to be bucked off a bull.\\" While it is certainly a possibility in the scenario described, there is no definitive evidence in the statement to conclude it with certainty. It could also be the case that the cowboy is riding a bronco or is successful in staying on the bull or bronco for the entire 8 seconds or more.  There are different potential outcomes in this scenario: 1. The cowboy stays on the bull for more than 8 seconds, successfully completing the objective and not getting bucked off. 2. The cowboy is bucked off the bull before the 8 seconds have passed. 3. The cowboy is participating in a bronco riding event instead of bull riding, making it impossible for him to be bucked off a bull in that particular event.

Marie Hedwig Auguste of Sulzbach (German: \\"Marie Hedwig Auguste von Sulzbach\\" ; born: 15 April 1650 in Sulzbach; died: 23 November 1681 in Hamburg) was a Countess Palatine of Sulzbach by birth and by marriage, Archduchess of Austria and by her second marriage, Duchess of Saxe-Lauenburg. Can we draw the following conclusion? Marie Hedwig Auguste of Sulzbach had no children.  [i] Yes [ii] It's impossible to say [iii] No","output":"[iii] No It is not accurate to draw the conclusion that Marie Hedwig Auguste of Sulzbach had no children based solely on the provided information. To assess her role as a mother, it is essential to examine her marriages and any offspring that resulted from those unions. Marie Hedwig Auguste of Sulzbach had two marriages during her lifetime. Her first marriage was to Archduke Ferdinand Maria of Austria on 30 June 1662. This union produced one surviving daughter, Theresia Kunigunde (1665-1670), who died at a young age. However, this is a clear indication that Marie Hedwig Auguste of Sulzbach had at least one child in her lifetime. Marie Hedwig Auguste's second marriage was to Julius Francis, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, on 9 April 1668. They had two surviving daughters: Anna Maria Theresia (1670-1670), who passed away shortly after birth, and Maria Anna Carolina (1672-1672), who also died during infancy. Although both children did not survive beyond their early years, this evidence further confirms that Marie Hedwig Auguste did have children in her lifetime. Based on her marriages and the children that resulted from them, it is incorrect to conclude that Marie Hedwig Auguste of Sulzbach had no children. Instead, it is reasonable to assert that she had three children, though tragically, none of them survived into adulthood."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.Titian was a personal friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death.

The entire family is still mourning the tragic loss of Oskar's father, Daniel, who lost his life during the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Despite the passing of time, Oskar cannot shake the feeling that there might be more to his father's story than what he knows. Oskar often finds solace in a hidden box of mementoes under his bed that belonged to his father. One fateful day, he discovers a mysterious letter addressed to Daniel alongside an old photograph of a group of people. The writer, named Richard, leaves cryptic instructions - a clue revealing the existence of a safety deposit box in Manhattan. Oskar becomes determined to unearth the truth behind his father's death and understand the significance of the discovered items. Act Two Against his mother's wishes, Oskar secretly sets out on a journey to New York City to unlock the secrets of Daniel's life. His investigation leads him to the safety deposit box, which contains a series of letters, photographs, and other keepsakes. It quickly becomes apparent that Daniel, a financial analyst, was not the person he claimed to be. Oskar soon learns that his father was part of a team of covert government operatives working to unravel a major terrorist plot. Tragically, this role cost Daniel his life. With the help of retired agent and Daniel's former friend, Elena, Oskar begins to piece together his father's secret life. In doing so, he also learns the story of the people in the photograph, who, along with Daniel, risked everything to protect their country. As he delves deeper into his father's past, Oskar realizes that his father's death was worthy of honor and respect, regardless of the intriguing circumstances surrounding it.

Background: Morbid Angel is an American death metal band based in Tampa, Florida formed in 1983 by guitarist and sole remaining original member Trey Azagthoth, vocalist and bassist Dallas Ward, and drummer Mike Browning. Widely considered as one of the most influential bands in the genre and important in the transition of death metal from its thrash metal roots, they were one of the first bands to incorporate guttural vocals, up-tempo blast beats, multiple tempo changes and dark atmosphere. They have been described as one of \\"the most influential and emulated bands in death metal\\", alongside Obituary and Cannibal Corpse, and have been cited as an influence by many later bands. They were also the first death metal band to experience mainstream success in connection with being signed to Giant Records in 1992, heavy rotation of their music videos on MTV, and having the music video for the song \\"God of Emptiness\\" shown on an episode of Beavis and Butt-head. Context: Morbid Angel was formed in 1983 in Tampa, Florida by guitarist Trey Azagthoth and drummer/vocalist Mike Browning. The band made their debut in 1987 on the New Renaissance Records record label. They recorded their debut album, Abominations of Desolation, in 1986, but the band was unsatisfied with the final product and it remained unreleased until 1991, printing 10,000 copies. In the early stages of their career the band developed a reputation for \\"gruesome stage antics.\\"  In 1986, David Vincent joined the band, replacing Michael Manson and Sterling von Scarborough as vocalist and bassist respectively. Fellow Terrorizer drummer Pete Sandoval soon followed. Their first studio album, Altars of Madness, was released in 1989, and is regarded by many as one of the most important death metal albums of all time. It is also considered the first true death metal album. Music journalist Jason Birchmeier writes that:  Few albums struck a chord within the ears and minds of the late-'80s underground metal scene like Morbid Angel's Altars of Madness did at the end of the decade, setting a new precedent for metal bands to reach. With the arguable exception of Chuck Schuldiner's Death, never before had a heavy metal band carried their lightning-fast guitar riffs and equally spellbinding guitar solos into such horrific territory. Venom and Slayer redefined the extent to which a metal band could align itself with all things evil during the beginning of the decade, but Morbid Angel made these two groups sound like children's music compared to the Florida-based group's assaulting death metal sounds and their blasphemous lyrics. Question: Who were the members of the band? Answer:","output":"Morbid Angel is a music group formed in Tampa, Florida in 1983. They play a type of music called death metal. The people who started the band were a guitarist named Trey Azagthoth, a singer and bass player named Dallas Ward, and a drummer named Mike Browning. Later, more people joined the group, such as David Vincent, who became the new singer and bass player, and Pete Sandoval, who became the new drummer. Their music is known for being very fast, loud, and scary, and many people who like death metal think they are one of the best bands ever."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Carl Gustav Jung (; German: [karl jUNG]; 26 July 1875 - 6 June 1961) was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology. His work has been influential not only in psychiatry but also in anthropology, archaeology, literature, philosophy, and religious studies. As a notable research scientist based at the famous Burgholzli hospital, under Eugen Bleuler, he came to the attention of the Viennese founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud. Carl Gustav Jung was born in Kesswil, in the Swiss canton of Thurgau, on 26 July 1875 as the second and first surviving son of Paul Achilles Jung (1842-1896) and Emilie Preiswerk (1848-1923). Their first child, born in 1873, was a boy named Paul who survived only a few days. Being the youngest son of a noted Basel physician of German descent, also called Karl Gustav Jung (1794-1864), whose hopes of achieving a fortune never materialised, Paul Jung did not progress beyond the status of an impoverished rural pastor in the Swiss Reformed Church; his wife had also grown up in a large family, whose Swiss roots went back five centuries. Emilie was the youngest child of a distinguished Basel churchman and academic, Samuel Preiswerk (1799-1871), and his second wife. Preiswerk was antistes, the title given to the head of the Reformed clergy in the city, as well as a Hebraist, author and editor, who taught Paul Jung as his professor of Hebrew at Basel University.  When Jung was six months old, his father was appointed to a more prosperous parish in Laufen, but the tension between his parents was growing. Emilie Jung was an eccentric and depressed woman; she spent considerable time in her bedroom where she said that spirits visited her at night. Although she was normal during the day, Jung recalled that at night his mother became strange and mysterious. He reported that one night he saw a faintly luminous and indefinite figure coming from her room with a head detached from the neck and floating in the air in front of the body. Jung had a better relationship with his father.  Jung's mother left Laufen for several months of hospitalization near Basel for an unknown physical ailment. His father took the boy to be cared for by Emilie Jung's unmarried sister in Basel, but he was later brought back to his father's residence. Emilie Jung's continuing bouts of absence and often depressed mood influenced her son's attitude towards women--one of \\"innate unreliability\\". This was a view that he later called the \\"handicap I started off with\\". He believed it contributed to his sometimes patriarchal views of women, but these were common in the society of his time. After three years of living in Laufen, Paul Jung requested a transfer; he was called to Kleinhuningen, next to Basel in 1879. The relocation brought Emilie Jung closer into contact with her family and lifted her melancholy. When he was nine years old, Jung's sister Johanna Gertrud (1884-1935) was born. Known in the family as \\"Trudi\\", she later became a secretary to her brother.

The Emirates team, under the leadership of British skipper Walker, emerged victorious. This victory marks an especially notable achievement for Walker, who not only participated in his third round-the-world race but also became the first British skipper ever to overall win the trophy.  The article mentions the performance of all the teams involved in this world race. Specifically, Team Alvimedica won the final leg of the race, leaving only one team out of the seven-strong fleet without a stage win. The winning team, Abu Dhabi Ocean Racing, performed remarkable throughout the competition. They secured top-three podium spots in all but two legs and had victory in two of them. Additionally, Team SCA, an all-female crew, made history by winning a leg of the race for the first time in 25 years, though they eventually finished seventh overall. The Swedish boat, led by Briton Sam Davies, was the only team entirely composed of females in the race, a representation that wasn't seen for the past 10 years.  The oceanic race, sailed using a single-design Volvo Ocean 65 boat, was fraught with numerous challenges and unforeseen circumstances. The teams visited 11 ports across every continent and faced a series of dramatic incidents such as shipwrecks and extreme weather. For example, Team Vestas Wind had a near-fatal accident when they crashed onto a remote coral reef surrounded by shark-infested waters during the second leg from Cape Town to Abu Dhabi. Consequently, they missed five legs as their boat had to be reconstructed. Moreover, the race organizers had to establish an ice exclusion zone after spotting an enormous iceberg, and the teams also experienced severe storms leading to mast breakages.  Despite the tumultuous journey, Walker reflects on the race positively, emphasizing the sense of camaraderie and deep bonds formed during such enduring shared experiences. He applauds every crew member's achievement and relishes the uniqueness of their trans-global sailing navigation. He conveyed that despite the numerous dramatic incidents that occurred, every sailor was going back to their loved ones and every boat was making its way back to harbor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Twenty rabbis flew to Birmingham to support the cause, equating silence about segregation to the atrocities of the Holocaust. Local rabbis disagreed and asked them to go home. The editor of The Birmingham News wired President Kennedy and pleaded with him to end the protests. Fire hoses were used once again, injuring police and Fred Shuttlesworth, as well as other demonstrators. Commissioner Connor expressed regret at missing seeing Shuttlesworth get hit and said he \\"wished they'd carried him away in a hearse\\". Another 1,000 people were arrested, bringing the total to 2,500. News of the mass arrests of children had reached Western Europe and the Soviet Union.

Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund.

Vesuvius consists of a large cone partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera caused by the collapse of an earlier and originally much higher structure.  - The Highlands (\\"the place of the Gaels\\") are a historic region of Scotland. The region became culturally distinguishable from the Lowlands from the later Middle Ages into the modern period, when Lowland Scots replaced Scottish Gaelic throughout most of the Lowlands. The term is also used for the area north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, although the exact boundaries are not clearly defined, particularly to the east. The Great Glen divides the Grampian Mountains to the southeast from the Northwest Highlands. The Scottish Gaelic name of \\"A' Ghàidhealtachd\\" literally means \\"the place of the Gaels\\" and traditionally, from a Gaelic-speaking point of view, includes both the Western Isles and the Highlands.  - Inverness (from the , meaning \\"Mouth of the River Ness\\") is a city in the Scottish Highlands. It is the administrative centre for the Highland council area, and is regarded as the capital of the Highlands of Scotland. Inverness lies near two important battle sites: the 11th-century battle of Blàr nam Fèinne against Norway which took place on The Aird and the 18th-century Battle of Culloden which took place on Culloden Moor. It is the northernmost city in the United Kingdom and lies within the Great Glen (Gleann Mòr) at its north-eastern extremity where the River Ness enters the Moray Firth. At the latest, a settlement was established by the 6th century with the first royal charter being granted by Dabíd mac Maíl Choluim (King David I) in the 12th century. The Gaelic king Mac Bethad Mac Findláich (MacBeth) whose 11th-century murder of King Duncan was immortalised in Shakespeare's play \\"Macbeth\\", held a castle within the city where he ruled as Mormaer of Moray and Ross.  - Macbeth (full title The Tragedy of Macbeth) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare; it is thought to have been first performed in 1606. It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake. Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I, who was patron of Shakespeare's acting company, \\"Macbeth\\" most clearly reflects the playwright's relationship with his sovereign. It was first published in the Folio of 1623, possibly from a prompt book, and is his shortest tragedy.  - The Great Glen (Scottish Gaelic: \\"An Gleann Mòr\\"), also known as Glen Albyn (from the Scottish Gaelic \\"Gleann Albainn\\" \\"Glen of Scotland\\") or Glen More (from the Scottish Gaelic \\"An Gleann Mòr\\") is a long and straight glen in Scotland running for from Inverness on the edge of Moray Firth, to Fort William at the head of Loch Linnhe.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe.

Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe.

Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest.   - King Duncan is a fictional character in Shakespeare's \\"Macbeth.\\" He is the father of two youthful sons (Malcolm and Donalbain), and the victim of a well-plotted regicide in a power grab by his trusted captain Macbeth. The origin of the character lies in a narrative of the historical Donnchad mac Crinain, King of Scots, in Raphael Holinshed's 1587 \\"The Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland,\\" a history of Britain familiar to Shakespeare and his contemporaries. Unlike Holinshed's incompetent King Duncan (who is credited in the narrative with a \\"feeble and slothful administration\\"), Shakespeare's King Duncan is crafted as a sensitive, insightful, and generous father-figure whose murder grieves Scotland and is accounted the cause of turmoil in the natural world.  - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.   - Merseyside is a metropolitan county in North West England, with a population of 1.38 million. It encompasses the metropolitan area centred on both banks of the lower reaches of the Mersey Estuary, and comprises five metropolitan boroughs: Knowsley, St Helens, Sefton, Wirral, and the city of Liverpool. Merseyside, which was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, takes its name from the River Mersey.  - George Thomson Cornet ( 15 July 1877 -- 22 April 1952 ) was the only Scot in the Great Britain and Ireland water polo team that won gold in the 1908 Summer Olympics and the 1912 Summer Olympics . He was born in Inverness and died in Rainhill .

These games were originally scheduled to be held in Rome, but were re-located on financial grounds following a disastrous eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906. They were the fourth chronological modern Olympic Games in keeping with the now-accepted four-year cycle as opposed to the proposed Intercalated Games alternate four-year cycle. The IOC president for these Games was Baron Pierre de Coubertin. Lasting a total of 187 days, or 6 months and 4 days, these games were the longest in modern Olympics history.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - The 1912 Summer Olympics (Swedish: \\"Olympiska sommarspelen 1912\\"), officially known as the Games of the V Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event held in Stockholm, Sweden, between 5 May and 22 July 1912. Twenty-eight nations and 2,408 competitors, including 48 women, competed in 102 events in 14 sports. With the exception of tennis (starting on 5 May) and football and shooting (both starting on 29 June), the games were held within a month with an official opening on 6 July. It was the last Olympics to issue solid gold medals and, with Japan's debut, the first time an Asian nation participated. Stockholm was the only bid for the games, and was selected in 1909.  - The Intercalated Olympic Games were to be a series of \\"International Olympic Games\\" halfway between what is now known as the Games of the Olympiad. This proposed series of games, intercalated in the Olympic Games cycle, was to always be held in Athens, and were to have equal status with the international games. However, the only such games were held in 1906.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - Rainhill is a large village and civil parish within the Metropolitan Borough of St Helens, in Merseyside, England. The population of the civil parish taken at the 2011 census was 10,853.  - The Moray Firth (Scottish Gaelic: \\"An Cuan Moireach\\", \\"Linne Mhoireibh\\" or \\"Caolas Mhoireibh\\") is a roughly triangular inlet (or firth) of the North Sea, north and east of Inverness, which is in the Highland council area of north of Scotland. It is the largest firth in Scotland, stretching from Duncansby Head (near John o' Groats) in the north, in the Highland council area, and Fraserburgh in the east, in the Aberdeenshire council area, to Inverness and the Beauly Firth in the west. Therefore, three council areas have Moray Firth coastline: Highland to the west and north of the Moray Firth and Highland, Moray and Aberdeenshire to the south. The firth has more than 800 kilometres (about 500 miles) of coastline, much of which is cliff.  - Stockholm (or ) is the capital of Sweden and the most populous city in the Nordic countries; 932,917 people live in the municipality, approximately 1.5 million in the urban area, and 2.3 million in the metropolitan area.

Please answer the following question: \\"That's Glenn Miller,\\" my father said. \\"But it can't be.\\" He had the back of the hospital bed cranked upright, the lower lid of his left eye creeping up in a warning signal I'd learned to recognize as a child. My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44.

The 1688 Glorious Revolution replaced James II and VII with his Protestant daughter Mary II and her husband William III and II. Since neither Mary or her sister Anne had surviving children, the 1701 Act of Settlement ensured a Protestant successor by excluding Catholics from the English and Irish thrones, and that of Great Britain after the 1707 Act of Union. When Anne became the last Stuart monarch in 1702, her heir was the distantly related but Protestant Sophia of Hanover, not her Catholic half-brother James Francis Edward.

Microsoft's Internet Explorer has been a longstanding choice for many users, but as with any software, it is not immune to bugs and glitches. Recently, Microsoft issued a temporary software fix for a bug in its Internet Explorer web browser, aimed at ensuring user safety and seamless browsing experience. In this article, we will explore the details of this software fix, the potential impact on users and businesses, and future steps for browser security. Microsoft's Internet Explorer Bug and Its Impact The bug in question has the potential to cause significant disruption for users and remain a security threat, especially since Internet Explorer continues to be widely used despite being replaced by Microsoft Edge as the company's primary browser. A vulnerability that allows attackers to execute malicious code on a user's computer can lead to major security breaches and potentially compromise a user's sensitive personal information. As users and businesses depend on their web browsers for a multitude of tasks ranging from online shopping and banking to collaboration and project management, a secure and reliable browser is essential. This bug could impact countless users worldwide, potentially exposing their personal and financial information to cyberattacks. In the worst-case scenario, it could lead to identity theft or unauthorized access to organizational data. Temporary Software Fix and Future Implications Acknowledging the severity of this bug, Microsoft has swiftly released a temporary software fix that users can apply to mitigate the risks associated with this vulnerability. While this solution provides some relief from potential security threats and disruption, it is crucial to note that it is a temporary measure. In the long run, Microsoft will need to address the vulnerability by developing and deploying a permanent fix for the browser. This process could take some time, as pinpointing the source of the problem and implementing a lasting solution requires thorough evaluation and testing. Users and businesses should be aware of this interim solution and continue to monitor updates from Microsoft on the progress of a permanent resolution. In the meantime, as Internet Explorer is gradually being phased out in favor of Microsoft Edge, users are encouraged to make the transition to the newer browser for improved security and performance. Microsoft Edge offers additional features and employs a more secure architecture to provide a safer browsing experience, which can potentially alleviate the risks posed by vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. Final Thoughts This recent incident underscores the importance of timely detection and remediation of software bugs and vulnerabilities. As technology continues to evolve, cyber threats are becoming more advanced and widespread. It is crucial for both individuals and organizations to prioritize their online security by staying informed, applying patches and updates, and using the latest and most secure software available. The temporary fix for the Internet Explorer bug serves as a cautionary reminder – users should remain vigilant about the software they use and ensure that they apply any available updates to minimize risks associated with vulnerabilities. By doing so, they can protect their sensitive information and maintain a safer browsing experience in an increasingly interconnected digital world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","output":"The constellation named after the mother of the legendary Greek princess Andromeda is Cassiopeia. Cassiopeia is a prominent northern constellation that is easily recognizable due to its distinctive W-shaped pattern formed by its five brightest stars. This constellation is named in honor of the mythical Greek queen Cassiopeia, who was the wife of King Cepheus and the mother of Princess Andromeda. According to Greek mythology, Cassiopeia was a vain and boastful woman who claimed that both she and her daughter were more beautiful than the Nereids, the sea nymphs who were the daughters of the sea god Nereus. This act of hubris angered the sea god Poseidon, who decided to punish Cassiopeia and her kingdom. Poseidon sent a sea monster, known as Cetus, to wreak havoc along the coastline of the kingdom. In an attempt to appease Poseidon and save their kingdom, King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia consulted an oracle, who advised them to sacrifice their daughter Andromeda to the sea monster. Andromeda was then chained to a rock by the sea as an offering to Cetus. However, she was eventually rescued by the hero Perseus, who slew the sea monster and married Andromeda. In the sky, the constellation Cassiopeia is surrounded by other constellations that represent the characters of this myth. Adjacent to Cassiopeia is the constellation Cepheus, which represents King Cepheus. Nearby, the constellation Andromeda represents the princess herself, while the constellations Perseus and Cetus symbolize the hero and the sea monster, respectively. This celestial grouping of constellations effectively tells the story of the mythological tale, serving as a reminder of the ancient Greek story. Cassiopeia, along with the other constellations in this group, is part of the Perseus family of constellations. The constellation is visible throughout the year in the northern hemisphere, particularly during the autumn months. The brightest star in the constellation is Schedar, followed by Caph, which form the two ends of the W-shape. Apart from its mythology, Cassiopeia is also an interesting constellation for astronomers due to the various celestial objects it contains, such as star clusters, galaxies, and supernova remnants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Experiences in life teach us new lessons and make us a better person. With each passing day we learn to handle various situations. Love Love plays a pivotal role on out life. Love makes you feel wanted. Without love a person could go hayward and also become cruel and ferocious. In the early stage of our life, our parents are the ones who shower us with unconditional love and care, they teach us about what is right and wrong, good and bad. But we always tend to take this for granted. It is only after marriage and having kids that a person understands and becomes sensitive to others feelings. Kids make a person responsible and mature and help us to understand life better. Happiness and sorrow Materialistic happiness is short-lived, but happiness achieved by bringing a smile on others face gives a certain level of fulfillment. Peace of mind is the main link to happiness. No mind is happy without peace. We realize the true worth of happiness when we are in sorrow. Sorrow is basically due to death of a loved one, failure and despair. But these things are temporary and pass away. Failure and success Failure is the path to success. It helps us to touch the sky, teaches us to survive and shows us a specific way. Success brings in money, fame, pride and self-respect. Here it becomes very important to keep our head on out shoulder. The only way to show our gratitude to god for bestowing success on us is by being humble, modest, courteous and respectful to the less fortunate ones. Hope and despair Hope is what keeps life going. Parents always hope their children will do well. Hope makes us dream. Hope builds in patience. Life teaches us not to despair even in the darkest hour, because after every night there is a day. Nothing remains the same we have only one choice keep moving on in life and be hopeful. Life teaches us not to regret over yesterday, for it has passed and is beyond our...

Here is a premise: In the case of Japan, there is a compelling intellectual case for a recovery strategy based on the deliberate creation of managed inflation. Here is a hypothesis: Japan used a recovery strategy that involved creating managed inflation. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To analyze this, we'll break it down step by step. 1. Firstly, acknowledging the premise: The premise states that in Japan, a compelling intellectual case can be made for a recovery strategy that involves the creation of managed inflation. 2. Understanding the premise: This means that theoretically, the grounds for using managed inflation as a recovery strategy in Japan are considered strong. It doesn't state, however, that Japan has implemented this strategy, but that arguments can be made in favor of it. 3. Secondly, recognizing the hypothesis: The hypothesis posits that Japan has used a recovery strategy involving the creation of managed inflation. 4. Analyzing the relationship: If we look at the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we see they're talking about the same strategy - managed inflation as a recovery method - but they differ in the \\"reality\\" status. The premise talks of a theoretical application, whereas the hypothesis states it as a factual occurrence. 5. Conclusion: So, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise only argues that a compelling case could be made for the strategy, not that the strategy has been implemented. The hypothesis, on the other hand, assumes that the strategy has already been used. Given this, we cannot infer the truth of the hypothesis directly from the premise. To do so, we would need additional information that confirms Japan indeed implemented such a recovery strategy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It will mean pre-school children with moderate to severe learning difficulties will attend school for 2.5 hours instead of at least 4.5 hours a day. The cut was revealed by the Education Authority (EA) in a letter to a parent. It confirms that from September 2016 \\"all pre-school children will receive 2.5 hours in pre-school per day\\". The EA said the move \\"is designed to increase the opportunity for children to access special school places,\\" and will provide \\"greater regional consistency\\". However, a body that represents special school principals and governors said the cut will \\"hold back and restrict the development of children with complex needs\\". In a submission to the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Strategic Leadership Forum for Special Schools (SLFSS) said they \\"totally disagree\\" with the move. They said it will have a range of impacts including: Francine Wilson's three-year-old son Aodhan, is due to start pre-school at a special school in September. \\"Aodhan has Down's Syndrome and we were hoping in September 2016 he would get five hours of nursery placement,\\" she said. \\"Receiving two and a half hours will, I believe, result in delayed development in Aodhan, both educationally and socially.\\" However, a spokesperson for the EA said the reduction was \\"in line with the Department of Education's 'Learning to Learn' policy\\". \\"There has been a progressive move towards part-time places in all sectors,\\" the spokesperson said. \\"This policy recognises the research evidence that there is no discernible difference in children's development at the start of primary school between those who received part-time and full-time pre-school provision. \\"This move is designed to increase the opportunity for children to access special school places, preferably nearer to their homes.\\" \\"The provision of increased access and greater regional consistency is a priority,\\" they added. Summary:","output":"Starting in September, special schools in Northern Ireland will reduce the school day for pre-school children with learning difficulties. Instead of being at school for 4.5 hours, they will only be at school for 2.5 hours. This change will affect all 39 special schools. The Education Authority says this will help more children go to special schools closer to their homes.

But Theodor Seuss Geisel---better known as the children's books author Dr. Seuss ---who came into the world on 2 March, 1904, was an unusual man. Like generations of children I was raised on his wonderful stories. But when I now read them to my children it's not just the childhood memories I enjoy. His writing is brilliant and imaginative and flows with a self-confidence as sure as the words of a Shakespeare poem. Readers ride his characteristic rhythm   with an effortless joy that cannot be matched by any other modern writer: You have brains in your head You have feet in your shoes You can steer yourself any direction you choose And will you succeed? Yes indeed, yes indeed! Ninety-eight and three-quarters percent guaranteed. Seuss's brilliant cartoons and clever words make his books a delight for adults but they attract mostly children of course. His stories teach kids moral lessons but in indirect and entertaining ways. The first Seuss book I was given was The Lorax, written just as the 60s were becoming the 70s. Seuss was ahead of his time, and in this book the dawn of concern for environmental problems are shown as the Lorax \\"who speaks for the trees\\" battles against an evil businessman who wants to destroy the forest and make goods \\"which everyone needs\\". It's not only a warning of the heavy price of environmental destruction, written well before most people had thought to worry, but it's also a smart analysis of consumer societies: \\"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.\\" This is of course a moral message, but not of the kind designed to persuade the youngsters into behavior that adults want. I could go on, but hey, it's a birthday, and I'm sure you folks have some good toasts to raise for the party... What's the purpose of this passage? A) To introduce Dr. Seuss's life. B) To analyze Dr. Seuss's books. C) To describe Dr. Seuss's writing style. D) To celebrate Dr. Seuss's achievements. A:","output":"The purpose of this passage is D) To celebrate Dr. Seuss's achievements. The writer is not merely introducing Dr. Seuss's life or analyzing his books, though these elements are indeed present in the passage. Instead, these aspects of Dr. Seuss's life and work are used in service of acknowledging and honoring his achievements. The author is showing the enduring legacy of Dr. Seuss's work, not only as they influenced their own childhood but now as they bring joy and lessons to their own children. More than that, the writer is praising Dr. Seuss's unique writing style, one that flows \\"with a self-confidence as sure as the words of a Shakespeare poem.\\" The author also highlights the innovative topicality of Dr. Seuss's work, referencing \\"The Lorax\\" and the way it tackles environmental concerns before such topics were widely discussed, appreciating how Seuss was ahead of his time. This acknowledgment of Dr. Seuss's exquisite imagination, unique writing style, moral lessons in his stories, and his forward-thinking themes forms a celebration of his brilliant accomplishments in the field of children's literature. Lastly, the writer ends the passage on a note of festivity, stating it's a birthday and hence a reason to celebrate, thereby further emphasizing the celebratory tone of the passage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Gustaf V was born in Drottningholm Palace in Ekero, Stockholm County, the son of Prince Oscar and Princess Sofia of Nassau. At birth Gustaf was created Duke of Varmland. Upon his father's accession to the throne in 1872, Gustaf became crown prince of both Sweden and Norway. On 8 December 1907, he succeeded his father on the Swedish throne, which had been separated from the Norwegian throne two years earlier. Context: When he ascended the throne, Gustaf V was, at least on paper, a near-autocrat. The 1809 Instrument of Government made the king both head of state and head of government, and ministers were solely responsible to him. However, his father had been forced to accept a government chosen by the majority in Parliament in 1905. Since then, prime ministers had been chosen according to parliamentary support.  At first, Gustaf V seemed to be willing to accept parliamentary rule. After the Liberals won a massive landslide in 1911, Gustaf appointed Liberal leader Karl Staaff as Prime Minister. However, during the runup to World War I, the elites objected to Staaff's defence policy. In February 1914, a large crowd of farmers gathered at the royal palace and demanded that the country's defences be strengthened. In his reply, the so-called Courtyard Speech--which was actually written by explorer Sven Hedin, an ardent conservative--Gustaf promised to strengthen the country's defences. Staaff was outraged, telling the king parliamentary rule called for the Crown to stay out of partisan politics. He was also angered that he had not been consulted in advance of the speech. However, Gustaf retorted that he still had the right to \\"communicate freely with the Swedish people.\\" The Staaff government resigned in protest, and Gustaf appointed a government of civil servants headed by Hjalmar Hammarskjold (father of Dag Hammarskjold) in its place. To date, it is the last time that a Swedish king directly intervened in the governing of the country.  The 1917 elections showed a heavy gain for the Liberals and Social Democrats. Despite this, Gustaf initially tried to appoint a Conservative government headed by Johan Widen. However, Widen was unable to form a coalition. It was now apparent that Gustaf could no longer appoint a government entirely of his own choosing, nor could he keep a government in office against the will of Parliament. With no choice but to appoint a Liberal as prime minister, he appointed a Liberal-Social Democratic coalition government headed by Staaff's successor as Liberal leader, Nils Eden. The Eden government promptly arrogated most of the king's political powers to itself and enacted numerous reforms, most notably the institution of complete (male and female) universal suffrage in 1918-1919. While Gustaf still formally appointed the ministers, they now had to have the confidence of Parliament. He was now also bound to act on the ministers' advice. Although the provision in the Instrument of Government stating that \\"the King alone shall govern the realm\\" remained unchanged, for all intents and purposes the ministers did the actual governing. Gustaf accepted his reduced role, and reigned for the rest of his life as a model limited constitutional monarch. Parliamentarianism had become a de facto reality in Sweden, even if it would not be formalized until 1974.  Gustaf V was considered to have German sympathies during World War I. His political stance during the war was highly influenced by his wife, who felt a strong connection to her German homeland. On 18 December 1914, he sponsored a meeting in Malmo with the other two kings of Scandinavia to demonstrate unity. Another of Gustaf V's objectives was to dispel suspicions that he wanted to bring Sweden into the war on Germany's side. Question: What did Gustaf say about the Germans?. Whats the answer?","output":"Gustaf V did not directly say anything specific about the Germans in the information you provided. However, it is mentioned that he was considered to have German sympathies during World War I.

It appears that option [III] They have been cooped up all day while I work and want to enjoy the sun, is the most accurate explanation for their behavior. Here are some of the reasons why they might be eager to spend time outside on the patio: 1. Natural instinct: Cats, as descendants of wild felines, have an inherent desire to explore and roam in their natural environment. Outdoor access allows them to fulfill these natural needs and engage in various activities such as hunting, climbing, and territorial marking. 2. Sunshine and warmth: Cats are known for their love of warmth and sunlight. Their bodies are designed to absorb and retain heat from the sun, making sunbathing an enjoyable and cozy experience. The warmth of the patio's sun-soaked concrete is likely a pleasurable sensation to them. 3. Physical and mental stimulation: Being outdoors offers cats a wealth of visual, auditory, and olfactory stimulation. Engaging in activities such as stalking and chasing chipmunks or moths not only provides physical exercise but also helps keep their minds sharp and instincts honed. This mental and physical stimulation can contribute to their overall well-being and happiness. 4. Territory expansion: Cats are territorial creatures, and by exploring the outdoors, they can expand their territory, whether it's just around the patio or further out into the garden. This territorial claim helps them feel secure in their environment, and they may feel the urge to patrol or defend their domain. 5. Social interaction: Although cats are often considered solitary animals, they do engage in social interactions with other cats or animals when given the opportunity. By going outside, they can encounter other cats or wildlife to interact with, curiously observe, or even just play with. 6. Entertainment: The outdoors can be a never-ending source of entertainment for cats. From watching birds fly to stalking squirrels, the opportunities for excitement and play are limitless. This keeps them entertained and helps break up the monotony they might experience when confined indoors all day. In conclusion, the cats' desire to be outside on the sunny patio is a combination of natural instinct, love for warmth and sunshine, physical and mental stimulation, territorial behavior, social interaction, and entertainment. As a responsible cat owner, it's crucial to provide them with opportunities to experience these outdoor joys while ensuring their safety and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Life-long learning is the concept that \\"It's never too soon or too late for learning.\\" -- a philosophy that has taken root in a larger number of different organizations. Life-long learning is an attitude -- learners believe that one can and should be open to new ideas, decisions, skills or behaviors. Life-long learning throws the well-known rule \\"You can't teach an old dog new tricks\\" out of the door. Life-long learning provides the general public with learning opportunities at all ages and in different ways: at work, at home and through leisure activities, not just through formal channels such as school and higher education. Life-long education is often achieved through distance learning or e-learning, continuing education, home schooling, etc. It also includes training programs for those who want to improve their qualifications, bring their skills up to date or retrain for a new line of work. In later life, especially in retirement, continued learning takes various forms, crossing traditional academic limits. One of the reasons why life-long education has become so important is the rapid progress of modern science and technology. Although the period of primary, secondary and university education is increased, the knowledge and skills gained there are usually not _ for a professional career spanning  three or four decades. Question: What is the main idea behind life-long education? - To force people to keep in learning new skills throughout their working life. - To provide teachers with extra income. - To allow people to have chances to receive education throughout their life. - To prevent students from learning at school. Answer:","output":"The main idea behind life-long education is to allow people to have chances to receive education throughout their life. This concept emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and being open to new ideas, decisions, skills, or behaviors regardless of age or stage in life.

Articulate: This term is generally associated with clear and effective communication, especially in speech. It doesn't directly relate to hands or manual labor. 2. Soft: Individuals who do not engage in manual labor often have softer hands, as their skin is not calloused or roughened from manual work. This is a relevant descriptor. 3. Sign language: While this involves hand movements, it is unrelated to whether someone does manual labor or not. It's a method of communication and not an accurate description of the hands themselves. 4. Graceful: This term refers to movement that is elegant and pleasing to the eye. While it can be used to describe hand movements, it does not directly relate to manual labor. 5. Cup water: This is an action that can be performed by anyone, regardless of their occupation or experience in manual labor. It doesn't specifically describe the hands of someone who doesn't do manual labor. In conclusion, the best answer is \\"soft\\" because it directly relates to the hands of someone who doesn't do manual labor.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is android better than iOS in 2016? Does iOS really work better than Android? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"In 2016, both Android and iOS had their unique advantages and made significant progress, so comparing them requires looking at various aspects and use-cases. First, let's discuss the two statements in the questions to understand the context: 1. Is Android better than iOS in 2016? 2. Does iOS really work better than Android? These two questions are similar but not exactly the same. While the first question focuses on a direct comparison of Android and iOS in 2016, the second question implies that iOS is widely considered to work better than Android and asks about the validity of this belief. To make a comparison between the two, we can look at the following aspects: 1. Customization: One of the biggest strengths of Android in 2016 was its customization capabilities. Users could personalize their devices by adding widgets, changing app icons, and installing custom launchers. This freedom made Android more appealing to those who wanted a tailored user experience. On the other hand, iOS had limited customization options, keeping the interface more homogeneous. 2. App Quality: Generally, iOS had a reputation for delivering high-quality applications. Since it had fewer device models and strict guidelines, developers could optimize their apps for a specific resolution and hardware configurations, resulting in smoother performance. Android, being open source, had a wider range of devices with varying resolutions and hardware capabilities, making it a challenge for developers to ensure a consistent user experience. 3. Security: iOS is well-known for its strong security measures due to Apple's closed ecosystem and strict app review process. This made it less prone to malware and viruses, especially in comparison to Android. Android, with its open nature, was more likely to encounter security breaches. However, Google made significant efforts to improve the security of Android devices with features like Google Play Protect and Android Nougat's granular app permission controls. 4. Hardware & Price Range: In terms of hardware, Android devices offered a broader choice of manufacturers and price ranges, catering to different budgets. This flexibility allowed customers to choose a device that met their specific needs and preferences. In contrast, Apple's iOS devices were limited to iPhones, which were typically more expensive and had fewer hardware options. 5. Software Updates: Apple prided itself on providing timely software updates to iOS devices, including those that were relatively old. This was a significant advantage over Android, where the number of devices and manufacturers often led to delayed updates or older devices being left with outdated software. 6. Ecosystem Integration: Apple's ecosystem of devices, like Macs, iPads, and Apple Watches, all worked seamlessly with iPhones, making them more appealing to users who were looking to have a unified experience. In comparison, Android was not as closely integrated with other devices, although there were exceptions with certain manufacturers. In conclusion, deciding whether Android or iOS was better in 2016 depends on an individual's preferences and needs. Android offered greater customization and a wider choice of devices at different price points, while iOS was known for its higher quality apps, increased security, prompt software updates, and ecosystem integration. The two questions provided are inquiring about similar information, but the second question seeks to examine if iOS genuinely had a performance advantage over Android."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . .  that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... David Meyer probably believes that  A. Multitasking is hard  B. not enough information  C. It is better to multitask  D. People are too busy Answer:","output":"A.

I'm in school and due to financial reasons I'll be moving back in with my parents. My sister is also there and she has an 11 month old. I've been talking with my mom for the last month about how to make this work and we've 90% settled out the details. My sister called me today and I've just found out that she has an entire different view on it. She has ground rules because of the baby, but I completely disagree with many of them which I'll talk about below. Some of them, I get and am supportive of. &amp;#x200B; This is what she's proposing: &amp;#x200B; -&gt; My medicine in a lock box in my room -&gt; I must keep my room baby friendly (no choking hazards, etc) -&gt; My cat needs to be locked in the basement at all times -&gt; I have to keep my dishes in my room or in one single area (food allergies) -&gt; I have a list of her pet peeves that I can't do (No left overs in the fridge, etc) -&gt; I can't bring most of my furniture, only the small things bc there is 'no space' &amp;#x200B; Now, from this it's implied that her and baby will have free reign of my room. I want to keep my cat in my bedroom at first until it becomes accustomed to the people/house and then most likely let it stay in the basement with me when I'm down there because it's a much larger space. I 100% understand that she's not comfortable with a cat near her child, so I get not letting it roam the house, but why can't it be in my bedroom? I mentioned putting a lock on my door to keep baby out and safe but she said that baby's always find a way into rooms and that my cat will be let out. I asked why people will be entering my room, and she said that she wants somewhere she can go to be alone when I'm not there. She's upset because she shares a room with the baby and doesn't have her own space. I told her that despite that I still need and want my own space. She also said that she wants help with the baby and implied that I would be able to help watch him anytime she wanted some freedom. IMO, this isn't ok. I'm fine with babysitting and helping out but I have my own life and can't be watching a baby whenever she wants a break. I also told her that I'll be bring my furniture will put the 2-3 non bedroom things in the basement. She said that there's no room and that I should throw it out. I'll be moving out in a year or so and can't afford to re-buy my furniture.  AITA for demanding that my sister and her baby stay out of my room when I'm not there? For deciding to put a lock on the door so that no one can go in there when I'm not home? For not wanting to be her free personal baby sitter?

Ross McEwen pulls an unusual bank job in the New Mexico town of Santa Maria, taking the banker Frenger with him, then letting him go a few miles away, minus boots but with an I.O.U. for the 2,000 he stole. Pat Garrett, the new marshal, will try to catch the thief, as will bounty hunters after Frenger's reward offer of 3,000. McEwen is bitten by a rattlesnake before he can board a train, where he is helped by a couple of passengers, Monte Marquez, a gambler, and Fay Hollister, a nurse. The train tracks are washed out near Albuquerque, so the small group goes off alone via a route used to deliver mail. Fay finds out a posse from Santa Maria is after a wanted man and recalls that's where McEwen came on board. But he and she have developed an attraction. When they reach an Alamogordo saloon that Marquez's cousins run, a cattleman named Burnett is willing to take on McEwen as a hired hand. Garrett and deputy Clint Waters come to town, so McEwen must leave but offers her an engagement ring. Fay rides along, but ends up separated and captured by Garrett's men. After crossing the desert with difficulty, McEwen comes across a Mexican rancher named Florencio, whose family is ill.

While being filmed, the girl smiles.Shuya Nanahara, a Japanese middle school student, attempts to cope with life after his father's suicide by hanging. Meanwhile, schoolmate Noriko Nakagawa is the only student attending class -- 3-B. Their teacher, Kitano, quietly leaves upon her tardy, apologetic arrival, but is attacked by student Yoshitoki Kuninobu and resigns after recovering from his wound.One year later, class 3-B takes a field trip after completing their compulsory studies; however, the class is gassed on their bus. They wake up in a \\"briefing room\\" on a remote island, wearing strange electronic collars. Kitano explains that the class has been chosen to participate in this year's Battle Royale as a result of the BR Act, which was passed after 800,000 students walked out of school. The orientation video cheerfully instructs the class to kill each other for three days until only one student remains.

Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Body temperature rises - The brain tells blood vessels to dilate - The sweat glands become active - Moisture is released from the pores - The moisture evaporates The answer is:","output":"The final step of this process is \\"the moisture evaporates.\\" This is the culmination of the body's efforts to regulate and cool down its temperature. Let's break down the steps and justify each one: 1. Body temperature rises: This is the initial condition. An increase in body temperature can be caused by various factors such as physical activity, hot weather, or fever. 2. The brain tells blood vessels to dilate: When the body detects an increased temperature, the hypothalamus (a part of the brain) sends a signal to the blood vessels to dilate (widen) and increase blood flow to the skin's surface. This step helps in dissipating heat through the increased surface area of blood vessels and loss of heat through radiation. 3. The sweat glands become active: In response to the increased temperature, the sweat glands become active and start producing sweat. Sweat glands are located all over the body and are responsible for regulating body temperature by producing sweat. 4. Moisture is released from the pores: Once the sweat glands become active, they produce sweat (composed mainly of water, salt, and some minerals), which is then released onto the skin's surface through the pores. This step aids in cooling the body down as the moisture on the skin absorbs the heat from the body. 5. The moisture evaporates: This is the final step of the process. The moisture present on the skin evaporates, taking away the heat absorbed from the body with it. This evaporation of sweat is an endothermic process, meaning it requires heat, and thus, as heat is utilized for the evaporation, it helps to cool the body down."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ask for private Snaps. Move the conversation off Snapchat. Article:","output":"Title: Enhancing Your Snapchat Experience: Responding to Snaps, Requesting Private Snaps, and Moving Conversations Off-platform Introduction Snapchat is an immensely popular social media platform known for its ephemeral and interactive nature. Users can easily share moments of their lives with friends, engage with creative content, and explore new avenues of communication. However, it can sometimes become challenging to fully engage with people you've connected with on the platform. In this article, we will discuss three techniques to enhance your Snapchat experience: responding to snaps, asking for private snaps, and moving the conversation off Snapchat. 1. Responding to Snaps Receiving snaps from your friends and acquaintances is a fundamental part of the Snapchat experience. Responding to their snaps is crucial in various ways: A. Strengthening Connections: By actively engaging with others' content, you show them that you're invested in their experiences and interested in what they have to share. This helps in fostering closeness and maintaining a strong bond with your Snapchat contacts. B. Encouraging Reciprocity: Responding to snaps demonstrates your enthusiasm for the platform, which may encourage others to share more snaps with you. People are more likely to share content with those who are responsive and engaging. C. Enhancing Visibility: Responding to snaps can keep you on top of your friends' minds, as your conversation threads remain active. This can help you gain more visibility among your contacts and increase your chances of receiving future snaps from them. 2. Asking for Private Snaps While Snapchat is primarily designed for sharing content with multiple people simultaneously, it also enables users to send private snaps directly to specific individuals. By asking for private snaps, you can strengthen your connections and create a more personalized experience. A. Building Trust: Requesting private snaps can signify trust, as you are allowing the sender to share something exclusively with you. This can help deepen connections and make your relationship feel more genuine. B. Personalized Content: Private snaps are more likely to be tailored to your interests and preferences since they are intended for specific recipients. This can result in a more enjoyable and engaging experience. 3. Moving the Conversation Off Snapchat Once a connection has been established, it can be beneficial to move the conversation beyond Snapchat and onto other platforms. A. Extended Conversations: Snapchat's temporary nature can sometimes make it difficult to have in-depth conversations. By transitioning your communication to a different platform, you can engage in more meaningful discussions that are not restricted by time or format limitations. B. Strengthening Connections: Moving the conversation to another platform indicates that your relationship has progressed beyond casual interactions on Snapchat. This could lead to more profound connections and potentially deeper friendships. C. Diversifying Communication Channels: Engaging contacts on multiple platforms provides more opportunities to connect, and opens up different ways in which you can interact. Expanding your communication channels can help enrich your experience and strengthen relationships with your contacts. Conclusion Snapchat is a fun and exciting platform that allows users to share snippets of their life with friends and followers. By actively responding to snaps, requesting private snaps, and moving conversations off Snapchat, you can elevate your social media experience and create more meaningful connections with your contacts. Remember that the key to maintaining strong relationships is to be responsive, attentive, and open to new ways of communication."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants.

At night, she works in the FBI's cybercrime division with Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks), fighting identity theft and similar crimes. One night, an anonymous tip leads them to a website called KillWithMe.com. The site features a streaming video of a cat being tortured and killed. The website cannot be shut down, as the creator knew that someone would try and built into it a fail-safe; every time the server is closed, a mirror server immediately replaces it. After the cat's death, KillWithMe.com's webmaster graduates to human victims and makes their deaths correlate directly with the number of hits the site receives. At a press conference, the public is urged to avoid the website, but as Jennifer feared this only increases the site's popularity. The videos are recorded in the killer's basement and his victims include a helicopter pilot (bled to death by injections of anticoagulant), a newscaster (burnt to death by heat lamps while cemented into the floor), and Griffin Dowd (killed by slowly increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid solution in which he is submerged up to his neck). At first it seems the victims were randomly chosen, but this is revealed to be untrue: the first two victims were chosen because they were part of filming or presenting the suicide of a junior college teacher. The teacher's unstable techno prodigy son, Owen Reilly (Joseph Cross), broke down and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: A Samoan airline says that it is the world's first carrier to charge passengers by their weight. Samoa Air, which opened in 2012, asks passengers to give their personal weight during booking, which is then charged according to the length of a flight. The customers will also be weighed just before they board the plane. \\"It is believed that all people throughout the world are the same size,\\" Samoa Air CEO Chris Langton said. \\"Airplanes always run on weight, not seats.\\" \\"There is no doubt in my mind that this is the concept of the future. This is the fairest way of your travelling with your family or yourself.\\" Though the airline introduced the plan last November, it caught people's attention last week when the carrier began international flights to neighboring American Samoa. Almost at the same time, a Norwegian economist, Bharat Bhatta, published a report suggesting that airlines should charge obese passengers more. The Pacific Islands contain some of the world's most common countries for obesity, many ranking in the top 10, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Samoa is ranked number four, with 59.6 percent of the population considered obese, said the most recent WHO report. According to Samoa Air's latest schedule, the airline charges up to 0.57 per kg for flights in Samoa and 1.03 per kg for its only international flight to American Samoa, around 250 miles. Children under 12 are charged 75 percent of the adult rate, with fares also based on weight. Any overweight baggage is calculated at the same rate as the passenger's personal weight. The plan could actually prove cheaper in some cases, such as for families travelling with small children, and Langton said customer reaction has mainly been \\"amazingly positive\\". The idea of charging passengers by weight has been hotly discussed before, and in the US some airlines require those who do not fit into a seat comfortably to buy a second seat. Question: In Bharat Bhatta's eyes, Samoa Air's plan might be   _  . Options: A: funny B: acceptable C: strange D: disappointing The answer to this question is:","output":"B: acceptable"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This was a thesis project for the writer/director , JT Petty. He did a great job of having me on the edge of my seat. I never really knew what to expect, and for a jaded horror-movie goer, this is Nirvana! The film concerns an elderly man who lives in a isolated log cabin in the woods. One day, while searching for his cat in the woods, he witnesses the murder of a child, or does he? He agonizes about this the rest of the film. What is most unusual about this film is that here is no dialogue until the last few scenes. I found this to be intriguing. The writer manages to get hold of your senses and gives them a relentless tug. Give this film a go, you won't be disappointed.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article:Twelve-year-old twin sisters Fitriani Sabatini and Fitriana Sabrina are among the top ranked players in their age group when they appear in tournaments such as the New Armada event in Central Java. The pair - affectionately known as Ani and Ana by their mother - have been taught at home for a year so they can concentrate on their tennis. \\"It was difficult to get the permission to skip classes to go to tournaments,\\" says their mother Yetti \\"Nur\\" Mastuti. \\"Their teachers were not very understanding.\\" Nur, and the youngsters' tennis coach father Nursalim sold the family home in Jakarta - and now live in rented accommodation - in order to pay tennis travel costs for the young pair. At least once a month they compete in tournaments, some of them away from their home city. The youngsters hope to emulate the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, who each went on to become the world's number one player. When I ask who would achieve this feat first,  Ani, the older of the two. quips with a big smile, \\"The big sister first, of course.\\" But it is a dream that is increasingly hard to achieve for Indonesian players. Indonesia's economic growth is visible in the sprawling new apartments that dot the Jakarta skyline, and the modern buildings come with sporting facilities not previously available to many Indonesians. Tennis courts are a common feature. But the sport is not necessarily more popular today than a few years ago, when Indonesian tennis was a force to be reckoned with, at least regionally. Yayuk Basuki was Indonesia's biggest tennis star, winning four Asian Games gold medals in the 1980s and 1990s. She also reached the quarter finals of Wimbledon in 1997, the furthest any Indonesian has ever gone at a Grand Slam event. Later that year she also become the highest-ever WTF ranked tennis player from Indonesia, reaching number 19. Today she runs the Yayuk Basuki Tennis Academy, teaching more than 150 under-18-year-olds the fundamentals of the game. She claims her school charges less than others in Jakarta, because she wants to give everyone a chance to play. Yayuk's school has trouble finding affordable facilities to use. There are no free public tennis courts in Indonesia. Even government facilities charge fees, and Yayuk says the fees go up every year. \\"We're not asking for free facilities,\\" Yayuk said. \\"But if I can subsidise kids who are not wealthy enough to pay, why can't the government also subsidise if they have good facilities?\\" The situation means tennis remains known as a sport for the wealthy in the country. Most children who pick up tennis at a young age come from the upper middle class, who have access to a court at home, or whose family can afford to put them in a club. However, the trouble for Indonesia is that the majority of the privileged children are not interested in pursuing tennis in the way that twins Ana and Ani are. Their drive saw the twins win the doubles at the the New Armada tournament, and in the singles Ani was the losing finalist, and Ana reached the semis. Private tennis instructor Alex Santoso sees a lot of potential in some of his students. But he says those from richer families do not want to become professionals, as there is no guarantee they can \\"make a lot of money\\" by becoming a top-ranked male ATP or female WTA player. And he claims that with the current competition and development programmes in Indonesia \\"it's impossible to get there\\". The Indonesian Tennis Association, known as Pelti, is the governing body of tennis in the country. Many Indonesians who are involved in tennis criticise Pelti for neglecting the development of young players, which has led to the talent drain in the last few years. Its chairman Maman Wirjawan admits that there is a lot of work to be done, but refuses to take the blame. \\"It's not only the government's job. The government has many problems as well. So we have to support the government. We have to help find ways to build sport in this country,\\" he says. Since taking on the leadership of Pelti in 2012 he says he has been working on a sustainable programme to develop young talent. \\"We start from junior [level] - we are now planning to have tournaments in many cities, especially big cities, [in] 10 to 15 cities throughout the nation,\\" he explains. \\"We will hold it on a monthly basis for the next five years.\\" Wirjawan's programme can only succeed with corporate sponsorship. But he is a brother of Indonesia's Trade Minister Gita Wirjawan, and has extensive experience in port and oil and gas businesses. Many hope that his wide network can help secure the support tennis needs. That will give much comfort to potential talents like twins Ani and Ana who will be able to play more matches in their home town and improve their skills. But unless and until that happens, the sacrifices made by the twins and their family may be high-risk, and the outlook for Indonesian tennis remains bleak. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"This article is about two 12-year-old twin sisters, Fitriani Sabatini and Fitriana Sabrina, who are really good at playing tennis in their age group. They are from Indonesia and they want to be as famous as the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena.

Tennis in Indonesia is mostly played by rich kids because it's expensive and there aren't any free public tennis courts.
