Article: Vanita Gupta, the acting head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, said it’s “for the city and the community in Ferguson to decide what they want” to happen with the police force there. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)      A team of Justice Department civil rights lawyers is planning to travel to Ferguson, Mo., in the coming weeks to meet with residents and help decide whether to reform the police department or disband it and replace it with a regional force, according to the head of the department’s civil rights division.      In her first wide-ranging interview since taking over the civil rights division last fall, acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta said that her lawyers want to ensure that the systemic racial bias and constitutional violations identified in the scathing Justice report on the Ferguson Police Department “don’t continue for a day longer than they should.”      “What kind of police department do Ferguson residents want?” said Gupta, a longtime civil rights lawyer and former deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. “All of the options are on the table. And now, we’re going to roll up our sleeves and figure out, ‘what does this look like?’ Some of what has happened in the last week really demonstrates the urgency of putting together an agreement.”      Last week, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said he will resign Thursday. The announcement came a day after Ferguson’s city manager resigned and two days after the city’s top municipal court judge also stepped aside. Shortly after Ferguson’s mayor announced Jackson’s resignation, two police officers were shot outside the police department.      Jeffrey Williams, 20, was arrested late Saturday and charged in the shooting. During a brief public appearance Monday at the St. Louis county courthouse, Williams told the judge he would seek private counsel and not use a public defender, according to Stephen Reynolds, who is the chief public defender in St. Louis County.      Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said last week that he would step down March 19 shortly after the city’s manager resigned and two days after the city’s top municipal court judge also stepped aside. (Scott Olson/Getty)      Williams had previously been on probation in relation to a felony charge of receiving stolen property.      On Monday morning, a woman who identified herself as Williams’s grandmother answered the door at the address listed as his home in court documents. She said Williams, who has two small children and a third on the way, did not graduate high school and did not have a steady job.      She said she last saw him on Friday and was concerned when she saw red marks across his face in his mug shot.      “The police beat him up,” she said, repeating an assertion made by a pastor and protest organizer who said he spoke with Williams. St. Louis County police have denied that Williams was beaten.      Williams’s grandmother said she was struggling to figure out how her grandson could have been accused of the shooting. “We raised him right.”      Gupta said the Justice Department “will flood the community in an intense way to make sure that we understand and are hearing from law enforcement leaders and line officers, city officials, and the community.      “Frankly, it isn’t for the Justice Department to decide what this looks like,” she said. “It’s for the city and the community in Ferguson to decide what they want. We think this could be done in a matter of months, but it depends on the ability of the city to engage with us in a serious way.”      Demonstrators argue during a protest outside the Ferguson, Mo. police station on March 15, the day the St. Louis County prosecutor announced that Jeffrey Williams was arrested for the shooting of two police officers who were working during a protest last week. (Scott Olson/Getty)      If the Justice Department does not come to an agreement with the city of Ferguson about the future of the police department, it can sue to force change, as it has in other cases.      Gupta, only five months into the job, is well positioned to help lead negotiations with Ferguson city officials, a process that began after the fatal shooting in August of Michael Brown, an unarmed African American man, by a white Ferguson police officer.      The youngest of two daughters of Indian parents who immigrated to the United States in the late 1960s, Gupta has devoted her career to civil rights issues and criminal justice reform. She grew up in Philadelphia and went to Yale University, where she was co-chair of the Women’s Center and was also involved in labor and immigrant rights issues. (Her husband is the legal director of the D.C. Legal Aid Society.)      After graduating from New York University Law School, her first legal case for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund was an effort to win the release of 38 defendants in Tulia, Tex., whose drug convictions and long sentences were discredited by her legal team. Gov. Rick Perry in 2003 pardoned all of the defendants, and Gupta helped negotiate a 6 million settlement for the defendants.      Later, at the ACLU, she won a landmark settlement with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency on behalf of immigrant children detained at T. Don Hutto, a privately run detention center in Taylor, Tex., which ended “family detention” at the facility. On the wall of Gupta’s Justice Department office overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue are four pictures drawn by immigrant children she represented while they were held inside the Texas facility.      Her work in criminal justice reform has attracted, as she said, “unusual bedfellows.” Both Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, and David Keene, former president of the National Rifle Association, have praised Gupta, reflecting both her effort to listen to all sides and also a common ground that both liberals and conservatives are finding on issues such as prison reform.      Gupta, the mother of two young boys, is overseeing many other kinds of civil rights cases, including litigation on voting rights and on LGBT rights.      But the effort to reform Ferguson is getting the most attention, overshadowing even the division’s work to reform more than 20 other police departments in places such as Albuquerque, N.M.; East Haven, Conn.; Cleveland; and New Orleans.      “With the report on Ferguson,” said Gupta, “we’ve been able to paint a broader picture of what’s happening in this town’s criminal justice system that resonates with a lot of communities of color in the way that they experience courts and police around the country.”      Robert Samuels in Ferguson, Mo., contributed to this report. ||||| St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch conducts a news conference as Sunday, March 15, 2015, in Clayton, Mo. McCulloch said 20-year-old Jeffrey Williams has been charged with two counts of first-degree... (Associated Press)      CLAYTON, Mo. (AP) — A man accused of shooting two officers last week in Ferguson was not targeting police or aiming at demonstrators at a late-night protest, his attorney said as he countered an earlier police description of the crime.      Defense attorney Jerryl Christmas also suggested Monday that St. Louis County police may have used excessive force when arresting the suspect, Jeffrey Williams, saying his client had bruises on his back, shoulders and face and a knot on his head.      Police spokesman Brian Schellman called the lawyer's allegations \\"completely false,\\" adding that Williams was seen by a nurse when booked into the county jail, standard procedure for all incoming inmates.      \\"The nurse released Williams as fit for confinement,\\" he said.      Williams is accused of shooting the two officers early Thursday outside Ferguson's police station, which has been the scene of protests since last summer's fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.      Williams, 20, appeared in court Monday, one day after his arrest on charges of felony assault, armed criminal action and a weapons offense. His case was continued until March 31. Christmas did not appear at the brief hearing and said he first spoke with his client late Monday afternoon.      \\"This wasn't any type of ambush shooting,\\" Christmas said in an interview with The Associated Press, countering an earlier description by St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar of the March 12 shooting outside Ferguson police headquarters. \\"Those officers were shot accidentally.\\"      Williams told investigators he was not targeting law enforcement and had been aiming instead at someone with whom he had a dispute, authorities said. But that assertion was met with skepticism by St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch.      \\"We're not sure we completely buy that part of it,\\" the prosecutor said Sunday.      Christmas said he wasn't aware of any details regarding a possible dispute that could have preceded the shooting.      The shooting happened as a demonstration began to break up. The protest followed the resignation of city Police Chief Tom Jackson in the wake of a Justice Department report that found widespread racial bias in the city's police practices.      Christmas said his client was not a regular participant in Ferguson demonstrations, echoing statements by protest leaders who said they did not recognize Williams as one of their own.      \\"That little strip has become the hang-out spot,\\" Christmas said, noting that the area has attracted people besides demonstrators.      Williams is jailed on 300,000 bond. Christmas said his client is unemployed and expecting a child with his girlfriend.      On Monday, no one answered the door of the north St. Louis County home Williams listed as his address on court records, and several neighbors said they did not know him. The home is about 5 miles northeast of the Ferguson Police Department.      According to 2014 county court records, Williams lived in nearby Jennings, which borders Ferguson. No one answered the door there either.      Online state court records show a man by the name of Jeffrey Williams at the address police provided Sunday was charged in 2013 with receiving stolen property and fraudulent use of a credit/debit device.      Belmar had said the two officers easily could have been killed. A 41-year-old St. Louis County officer was shot in the right shoulder, the bullet exiting through his back. A 32-year-old officer from Webster Groves was shot in the right cheek, just below the eye, and the bullet lodged behind his ear.      The officers were released from the hospital hours after the attack.      The Ferguson Police Department has been a national focal point since Brown, who was black and unarmed, was killed by police officer Darren Wilson, who is white. A grand jury declined to indict Wilson in November, and Wilson was cleared of civil rights charges by a Justice Department report released March 4. Wilson resigned in November.      A separate Justice Department report found widespread racial bias in the city's policing and in a municipal court system driven by profit extracted from mostly black and low-income residents.      ___      Associated Press writers Jim Salter in St. Louis and Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report. ||||| That's how police are responding to allegations that they beat the man arrested for shooting two police officers during protests in Ferguson, Missouri, last week.      Jeffrey Williams, 20, has been charged with two counts of first-degree assault, a count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal activity.      Police have said he admitted to firing the shots that struck the officers. But Williams' lawyer says he has little confidence in such statements.      \\"He's scared. You know, this has been pretty traumatic for him,\\" attorney Jerryl Christmas said about his client on Monday.      \\"One thing that is clear is that he has a large amount of bruising on his body that I noticed that I'm very concerned about. It appears that whatever statements he made, he was without the advice of counsel, and when I look at the bruising, it's hard for me assess if these were voluntary statements that he made.\\"      Christmas told CNN that Williams has bruising across his back, and a knot on his head.      \\"He said he was bruised by the police when he was taken into custody. And he was in a lot of pain when he was being questioned,\\" Christmas said. \\"They used a lot of force on him.\\"      Police deny the accusation.      \\"With regard to the allegations that Jeffrey Williams was 'beaten' by police, the St. Louis County Police Department calls these allegations completely false,\\" Sgt. Brian Schellman said in a statement. \\"Immediately following the arrest, arresting officers transported Williams to St. Louis County Police Headquarters where he was interviewed by Crimes Against Persons Detectives. This entire interview was video and audio recorded.\\"      Schellman also said that Williams was seen by a nurse, who released Williams as \\"fit for confinement.\\"      Williams is being held on a cash-only 300,000 bond, according to St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch, who said it's possible Williams could face more charges and that others could be charged in the case.

To provide a detailed explanation, let's first understand the meaning of roughness and friction. Roughness refers to the surface texture of an object or material consisting of small, irregular bumps or grooves. Friction, on the other hand, is the resistive force that opposes the relative motion between two objects or surfaces. In this logic test, Mary learned that mahogany is rougher than birch. In other words, the surface of mahogany has more small, irregular bumps and grooves compared to that of birch. Consequently, when Mary rubs her sandpaper over the two surfaces, more friction will be experienced on the rougher surface, which in this case is mahogany. This is because the roughness causes a higher number of contact points between the sandpaper and the wood surface, which results in an increased resistive force (or friction). Moreover, when sanding wood surfaces, the goal is typically to smoothen out the texture and even out the surface. Given the rougher nature of mahogany compared to birch, it might require more effort and time to achieve the desired smoothness through sanding. In some cases, it might also require a change in the type or grit of the sandpaper to produce the best results. It is worth noting that the natural differences in wood grain and surface texture make each type of wood suitable for specific applications and woodworking projects. Mahogany, for instance, is often valued for its durability and dimensional stability, while birch is known for its smooth finish and straight grain, which makes it easier to work with. In summary, based on the given information that mahogany is rougher than birch, the answer to the logic test is (A) mahogany, as rubbing sandpaper over its surface will result in more friction compared to rubbing it over the surface of birch."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Victoria decided to choose express shipping while Katrina did not, so","output":"Victoria's package arrived on her doorstep several days before Katrina's. Both of them had ordered the same products from an online store, as a result of their shared excitement after experiencing the product demonstration at a recent trade show. The item in question was a state-of-the-art wireless headphone set by a company called \\"SoundWave,\\" which had received rave reviews for its incredible sound quality and user-friendly features. For Victoria, the decision to pay extra for express shipping was a deliberate one. She is well-organized and attentive to her schedule, and she knew that she would be flying to a conference in a few days. As a frequent traveler, she could not wait to use her new headphones for the long flight. The extra cost for the expedited mail service justified the soon-to-be-realized relaxation during her trip. On the other hand, Katrina is known for her laid-back and patient attitude towards most things in life. While she was equally excited for the headphones, she didn't see the need to spend extra on shipping, believing that the regular delivery speed should suffice. Furthermore, her schedule in the coming days had no essential events that warranted the necessity for swift package arrival. When Victoria's package arrived at her door, she gingerly unboxed the wireless headphones with the enthusiasm of a child on Christmas morning. Eager to test her new audio gear, she connected them to her smartphone, marveling at their sleek design and intuitive set-up process. The first song she played filled her ears with clear, crisp sounds, the bass resonating and powerful, the treble and mid-tones exquisitely balanced. Her investment in express shipping seemed entirely worth it as she reveled in her new gadget. As Victoria was enjoying the company of her new headphones, Katrina watched her tracking updates diligently, anticipating the arrival of her package. It was not until four days later that her wireless headphones finally arrived. Even though she did not get to enjoy the headphones as early as Victoria, she found satisfaction in knowing she had saved some money by opting for standard shipping. With each passing day, both Victoria and Katrina continued to discover incredible features that made their new wireless headphones indispensable. Apart from the unparalleled sound quality, the headphones have advanced noise cancellation capabilities, which allowed them to work or relax in even the noisiest environments. Bluetooth connectivity meant they could walk and roam about their house or workspace without limits, as they were no longer tethered to devices via cables. The battery life turned out to be surprisingly impressive and their intuitive controls simplified adjusting the volume and switching between songs. In the weeks that followed, Victoria and Katrina agreed that investing in the SoundWave wireless headphones was one of the best decisions they had made in recent months. As for their choices in shipping, each of them was content with their respective decisions. Victoria's choice of express shipping allowed her to enjoy her new headphones during her conference trip and provided her with the comfort she sought on long flights, while Katrina's patience allowed her to save money without sacrificing any of the benefits they both reaped from their new gadgets. Ultimately, both Victoria and Katrina understood that everybody has different preferences and priorities in life. Victoria's need for speed and Katrina's cost-consciousness reflect the balance of priorities inherent in each individual. They carried this lesson forward, appreciating that divergent perspectives can often lead to the same destination - satisfaction and happiness in life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One valuable tool for doing so is learning how to accurately measure and analyze our body's dimensions. This article will provide a step-by-step guide on how to take the essential body measurements, input them into the correct equation, and interpret the results in order to better understand your health and body. By understanding how to accurately measure your body, you can gain insights into areas of improvement for your overall health and fitness. Step 1: Measure your neck Neck circumference is an important measurement to take, as it can indicate issues related to sleep apnea, hypertension, and other health problems. To measure your neck, follow these steps: 1. Locate the midpoint of your neck, which is typically about one inch below the Adam's apple for men, and slightly lower for women. 2. Wrap a flexible measuring tape around your neck, making sure it is parallel to the ground and snug against your skin, without being too tight. 3. Record the measurement in inches or centimeters. Step 2: Measure your waist Waist circumference is related to overall body fat distribution. A larger waist circumference is linked to increased risk of various health conditions, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes. To measure your waist, follow these steps: 1. Stand with your feet hip-width apart and locate the area around your natural waist, which is the smallest point between your rib cage and belly button. 2. Wrap the measuring tape around your waist, ensuring it is parallel to the ground and snug, but not tight or distorting your skin. 3. Take a deep breath and exhale, then record the measurement in inches or centimeters. Step 3: Measure your hips Hip circumference is an essential measurement to understand your overall body shape and fat distribution. To measure your hips, follow these steps: 1. Stand with your feet together and locate the widest part of your hips, often around the gluteal muscles. 2. Wrap the measuring tape around your hips, ensuring it is parallel to the ground and snug against your skin without being too tight. 3. Record the measurement in inches or centimeters. Step 4: Measure your height Accurate height measurement is essential for inputting data into various body composition algorithms. To measure your height, follow these steps: 1. Stand barefoot and straight against a flat wall with your heels, buttocks, and shoulders touching the wall, and your head facing forward. 2. Have a helper use a straight object, such as a book, to make a horizontal mark level with the top of your head. 3. Measure the distance from the floor to the mark in inches or centimeters. Step 5: Enter your recorded data into the correct equation Now that you have collected all the essential body measurements, input them into an appropriate equation to assess your health. Some useful equations include calculating your Body Mass Index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, or waist-to-height ratio. These equations are crucial tools to determine your overall health risk, body composition, and fitness level. Step 6: Interpret your results After inputting your measurements into the chosen equation, interpret the results to understand your health status and areas that need improvement. Keep in mind that these figures are just a part of the puzzle of understanding your overall health, and should be taken into consideration alongside other aspects such as exercise, nutrition, and lifestyle. Conclusion Knowing your body's dimensions is vital for understanding your health and making informed decisions about your wellness journey. Following this guide will allow you to measure your body accurately, input the data into the correct equation, and interpret the results to make positive changes in your life. Remember that understanding your body composition is a vital tool in maintaining good health and promoting a balanced lifestyle. So, grab a measuring tape, and get started on your path to better health!"},{"instruction":"Instructions: You are given a sentence in Hebrew.

Context: The 19th-century Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone considered Burke \\"a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America\\" and in his diary recorded: \\"Made many extracts from Burke—sometimes almost divine\\". The Radical MP and anti-Corn Law activist Richard Cobden often praised Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity. The Liberal historian Lord Acton considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with William Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: \\"I have now finished reading again most of Burke's works. Admirable! The greatest man since Milton\\". The Gladstonian Liberal MP John Morley published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice. The Cobdenite Radical Francis Hirst thought Burke deserved \\"a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate. In politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site\\". Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France was controversial at the time of its publication, but after his death, it was to become his best known and most influential work, and a manifesto for Conservative thinking.","output":"The answer to the question is that the greatest man since Milton, according to Lord Macaulay, was Edmund Burke.

Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere.

The researchers set out to examine the connection between social media use and sleep among young adults. Levenson, who led the study, noticed that these young adults are possibly the first \\"generation to grow up with social media.\\" The researchers wanted to find out how often young people used social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Histogram, etc. For the study, they gave questionnaires to nearly 1,800 adults, aged 19 to 32. On average, members of the study group used social media sites one hour a day. They also \\"visited various social media accounts 30 times per week.\\" Thirty percent of the study's participants  reported having serious problems with sleeping. Those people who used social media a lot were three times more likely to have a sleep disorder. And those who spent the most time on social media were two times as likely to suffer from sleep disorders. Levenson said the number of times a person visits social media is a better predictor  of sleep problems than overall time spent on social media. If this is true, she adds, then practices that stop such behaviors may be most effective. Question: What is the passage mainly about? Options: A: How should young adults use social media correctly?

Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment.  \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself.

As it turns out Danny had a condition called hypercalcaemia, while Greg had hypocalcaemia.  But I can use this background: Excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia. However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue.  What is an answer for this question: Which friend had an excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH)? The answer to this question is:","output":"Danny had an excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH).  The given background information states that excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia, which can be more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), excessive intake of vitamin D, or bone destruction. In this scenario, Danny is the friend who has been diagnosed with hypercalcaemia. Therefore, it can be inferred that it is Danny who had an excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH).  On the other hand, Greg had hypocalcaemia, which is associated with inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes or issues related to inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or defective PTH receptors in cells. So, Greg did not have excessive secretion of PTH."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Take your macaw to an avian veterinarian for a complete physical checkup. Get blood tests done and test for hypothyroidism, psittacine beak and feather disease.","output":"After you have completed the physical examination of your macaw and have consulted with an avian veterinarian, the most logical next event would depend on the results. If a medical issue was identified as the cause for the feather picking or chewing, then you should address the underlying medical issue with the appropriate treatment prescribed by your veterinarian. However, if no medical issue is identified, then the following steps can be taken to help prevent further feather picking or chewing: 1. Environmental Enrichment: Feather picking can be a sign of boredom or stress in a macaw. Providing a variety of toys, perches, and activities in their cage can keep them mentally stimulated and engaged. Rotate and change the toys periodically to prevent boredom. Consider puzzle toys and foraging opportunities that stimulate their natural instincts. 2. Social Interaction: Macaws are social creatures and require regular human interaction or companionship from other birds. Spend more time with your macaw and engage them in play, training, or conversation, depending on their preferences. Positive reinforcement through rewards and praise when they refrain from feather picking can help in reducing the behavior. 3. Balanced Diet: A nutritious diet plays a vital role in their overall health and can affect their feather condition. Provide a balanced diet of pellets, fresh fruits, vegetables, and occasional seeds and nuts. Consult your veterinarian for specific dietary recommendations for your macaw. 4. Proper Grooming: Maintain a regular grooming routine to keep your macaw's skin and feathers in good condition. This includes periodic misting or allowing your macaw to bathe, as well as trimming their nails and beak as needed. Encourage preening by supplying them with preening materials like natural fiber ropes. 5. Stress Reduction: Identify and eliminate any stress factors that could be contributing to their feather picking behavior. This may include loud noises, sudden changes in their environment, inadequate lighting, or a lack of privacy. Establish a consistent daily routine and provide a comfortable and consistent environment for them to help reduce stress. 6. Anti-Feather Picking Sprays: If necessary, use anti-feather picking sprays or ointments that can discourage the behavior by making the feathers less appealing to the macaw. Make sure to use products specifically designed for birds, and follow the instructions carefully. When in doubt, consult your veterinarian for recommendations on suitable products. 7. Behavioral Consultation: If the feather picking or chewing continues despite your intervention, consult an avian behavior specialist. They can provide behavioral modification training and guidance on how to manage the issue. This might involve adjusting your interaction with the bird, addressing separation anxiety, or using positive reinforcement to redirect the behavior to healthier alternatives. Remember that stopping a macaw from feather picking or chewing can be a time-consuming process that requires patience and consistency. Monitor your macaw closely and communicate regularly with your veterinarian to ensure their physical and emotional well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Tocqueville thought the conquest of Algeria was important for two reasons: first, his understanding of the international situation and France's position in the world, and, second, changes in French society. Tocqueville believed that war and colonization would \\"restore national pride, threatened\\", he believed, by \\"The gradual softening of social mores\\" in the middle classes. Their taste for \\"material pleasures\\" was spreading to the whole of society, giving it \\"an example of weakness and egotism\\". Applauding the methods of General Bugeaud, Tocqueville went so far to claim that \\"war in Africa is a science. Everyone is familiar with its rules and everyone can apply those rules with almost complete certainty of success. One of the greatest services that Field Marshal Bugeaud has rendered his country is to have spread, perfected and made everyone aware of this new science.\\" Tocqueville advocated racial segregation in Algeria with two distinct legislations, one for European colonists and one for the Arab population. Such a two-tier arrangement would be fully realised with the 1870 Cremieux decree and the Indigenousness Code, which extended French citizenship to European settlers and Algerian Jews, whereas Muslim Algerians would be governed by Muslim law and restricted to a second-class citizenship.

Vasco da Gama was born in 1460 or 1469 in Sines, on the southwest coast of Portugal, probably in a house near the church of Nossa Senhora das Salas. Sines, one of the few seaports on the Alentejo coast, consisted of little more than a cluster of whitewashed, red-tiled cottages, occupied chiefly by fisherfolk. Vasco da Gama's father was Estevao da Gama, who had served in the 1460s as a knight of the household of Infante Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu. He rose in the ranks of the military Order of Santiago. In December 1499, King Manuel I of Portugal rewarded Vasco da Gama with the town of Sines as a hereditary fief (the town his father, Estevao, had once held as a commenda). This turned out to be a complicated affair, for Sines still belonged to the Order of Santiago. The master of the Order, Jorge de Lencastre, might have endorsed the reward - after all, da Gama was a Santiago knight, one of their own, and a close associate of Lencastre himself. But the fact that Sines was awarded by the king provoked Lencastre to refuse out of principle, lest it encourage the king to make other donations of the Order's properties. Da Gama would spend the next few years attempting to take hold of Sines, an effort that would estrange him from Lencastre and eventually prompt da Gama to abandon his beloved Order of Santiago, switching over to the rival Order of Christ in 1507.  In the meantime, da Gama made do with a substantial hereditary royal pension of 300,000 reis. He was awarded the noble title of Dom (lord) in perpetuity for himself, his siblings and their descendants. On 30 January 1502, da Gama was awarded the title of Almirante dos mares de Arabia, Persia, India e de todo o Oriente (\\"Admiral of the Seas of Arabia, Persia, India and all the Orient\\") - an overwrought title reminiscent of the ornate Castilian title borne by Christopher Columbus (evidently, Manuel must have reckoned that if Castile had an 'Admiral of the Ocean Seas', then surely Portugal should have one too). Another royal letter, dated October 1501, gave da Gama the personal right to intervene and exercise a determining role on any future India-bound fleet.  Around 1501, Vasco da Gama married Catarina de Ataide, daughter of Alvaro de Ataide, the alcaide-mor of Alvor (Algarve), and a prominent nobleman connected by kinship with the powerful Almeida family (Catarina was a first cousin of D. Francisco de Almeida).Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What is the origin of this title?","output":"To provide the quote for answering the question \\"What is the origin of this title?\\" in reference to the title \\"Almirante dos mares de Arabia, Persia, India e de todo o Oriente\\": \\"On 30 January 1502, da Gama was awarded the title of Almirante dos mares de Arabia, Persia, India e de todo o Oriente (\\"Admiral of the Seas of Arabia, Persia, India and all the Orient\\") - an overwrought title reminiscent of the ornate Castilian title borne by Christopher Columbus (evidently, Manuel must have reckoned that if Castile had an 'Admiral of the Ocean Seas', then surely Portugal should have one too).\\""},{"instruction":"Bachelor of Integrated Studies -  Bachelor of Integrated Studies (BIS) is an interdisciplinary bachelor's degree offered by several universities in the United States and Canada.

The Hollywood Walk of Fame is a notable landmark in Hollywood, California that honours individuals in the entertainment industry for their contributions in the categories of Motion Pictures, Television, Recording, Radio and Live Performance/Theatre. Although Berridge has had a long and successful career in film, television, and theatre, a star on the Walk of Fame is not automatically granted to all involved in these sectors; it requires a specific nomination and selection process. The process of getting a star on the Walk of Fame includes being nominated by anyone who can pay the submission fee, the nominee's agreement to attend the award ceremony if selected, and the payment of a sizable fee for the creation and maintenance of the star. Therefore, a star is not solely an acknowledgement of talent or success, but also involves extraneous factors including willingness to participate in the process, and financial backing. While Berridge's contributions to the industry, especially her role in the Academy Award-winning movie \\"Amadeus\\" and her performance in the \\"The John Larroquette Show\\", are significant, it does not automatically signify that she has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Write some highlights for the following article: A French team of engineers has developed an artificial tree that can generate electricity using the wind. 'The idea came to me in a square where I saw the leaves tremble when there was not a breath of air,' said Jérôme Michaud-Larivière, the founder of the Parisian start-up which will market the Wind Tree in 2015. He added the energy 'had to come from somewhere and be translatable into watts'. It uses tiny blades housed in the 'leaves' that turn in the wind - regardless of its direction - and has the added advantage of being completely silent. Scroll down for video. Green energy: A French start-up has developed a 'Wind Tree' that generates power from air currents. Innovative: It uses tiny blades housed in the 'leaves' that turn in the wind - regardless of its direction. After three years of research, the team of engineers developed a 26ft prototype, which is now installed in the Pleumeur-Bodou commune in Brittany in northwestern France. He hopes they can eventually be used in people's own homes and in urban centres. The tree, which will sell for £23,500, can reportedly generate electricity on twice the number of days as a conventional wind turbine because it can generate power on winds of just 4.5mph. Mr Michaud-Lariviere said the tree - which has not yet been tested by an independent laboratory - is profitable after winds of 7.8mph on average over one year. 'The idea came to me in a square where I saw the leaves tremble when there was not a breath of air,' said Jérôme Michaud-Larivière, the founder of the Parisian start-up which will market the Wind Tree in 2015. He hopes the tree can be used to exploit small 'deposits' of air currents flowing into town along the buildings and streets to feed, for example, LED street lamps, or a charging station for electrical cars. He admits there are more consistent winds 160ft in the air but they require 'monstrous machines', far from where energy is consumed, he added. He hopes the tree can be combined with other means of power generation such as photovoltaic, and geothermal, combined with energy-efficient buildings. In the future Mr Michaud-Larivière hopes to develop a 'perfect tree that has leaves with natural fibres, roots that could generate geothermal energy and 'bark' covered with photosensitive cells. However, Robert Bellini an engineering expert at the Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME), says the potential of small wind turbines in the city remains 'quite low'.

They had to prepare for a school project so they decided to learn about animals. Manny studied animal communication, while Dean studied animal feeding patterns and nutrition.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which student learned more about animals that live in social groups? The answer is:","output":"Manny learned more about animals that live in social groups. This is because he studied animal communication, which is a vital aspect of social behavior among animals. Animals that live in social groups rely on various forms of communication to interact with each other. These forms of communication can include vocalizations, body language, chemical signals, and even bioluminescence in some cases. Studying animal communication enables Manny to gain a deeper understanding of how animals that live in social groups coordinate their actions, share information about their environment, establish and maintain relationships, and navigate the complex social hierarchies within their communities. For instance, he may have learned about the intricate communication systems of bees, ants, and termites, which are essential for coordinating the activities of their large colonies. Similarly, he could have studied the sophisticated vocalizations of dolphins and whales, which facilitate their social interactions and cooperative efforts when hunting and navigating their aquatic environments. Dean, on the other hand, focused on animal feeding patterns and nutrition, which are critical to understanding the energy and nutrient needs of animals in various habitats. However, this aspect of their behavior does not necessarily provide insights into the social dynamics of animals or the differences between animals that live in social groups and those that lead solitary lives. Thus, while both Manny and Dean gained valuable knowledge about various aspects of animal behavior during their research, it is Manny who learned more about animals that live in social groups, given his focus on animal communication."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: For starters, I only got the 3rd disk, and it pretty much sucks! The only song I kind of like is Pretty in Pink, but I like it better when The Grown-Ups sings. This is NOT goth! I would not recommend THE GOTH ANTHOLOGY!!! Answer: Answer:","output":"The given product review does not seem to be a positive one. Here is a brief analysis of the review to help you understand why it is negative: 1. Title: \\"Very Disappointing!!!\\" - Right off the bat, the title of the review conveys dissatisfaction and disappointment with the product in question, which in this case is THE GOTH ANTHOLOGY. 2. Review Content: The reviewer goes on to provide specific reasons for their dissatisfaction with the product. They mention that they only received the 3rd disk, implying that they were expecting more than one disk. This could be seen as an issue with the product's packaging or delivery, leading to an incomplete collection, which further adds to the negative feeling. 3. The reviewer also states that the 3rd disk \\"pretty much sucks,\\" indicating that they did not enjoy the music and found it to be of poor quality or not to their taste. This adds to the negative sentiment of the review. 4. The reviewer mentions liking one song, \\"Pretty in Pink,\\" but only when performed by another band, The Grown-Ups. This further emphasizes that the content provided in the product - in this case, the song as performed by the original artist - was not up to their expectations or standards. 5. The reviewer then stresses that this product is \\"NOT goth,\\" suggesting that the content of the anthology does not align with the expectations set by the title or description of the product. This misrepresentation of the genre may be seen as another negative aspect of the product. 6. Finally, the reviewer ends the review by stating that they \\"would not recommend THE GOTH ANTHOLOGY.\\" This definitive statement serves as a summary of their overall negative experience and dissuades potential buyers from considering this product. In conclusion, the product review is undoubtedly negative, as it expresses disappointment and dissatisfaction with both the content and packaging of the product, as well as the misrepresentation of the genre. The reviewer's unenthusiastic opinion of the specific songs mentioned and their decision not to recommend the product further contribute to the negative sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The main problem of this movie is that actors aren't capable of holding this movie on their back. Why? Because of bad script.

Article: The moral considerations associated with doping are as complicated as the lexical challenges of the term itself. What “doping” is, precisely, and under what conditions it should be allowed are questions the sports world may never totally resolve. Caffeine is a drug that enhances performance, but it’s OK. Amphetamine is also a drug that enhances performance, but it is not.      It’s all a matter of where you draw the line. So if competitive cyclists want to gain an advantage by ingesting someone else’s poop, I say we all just go ahead and let them, for crying out loud.      You think I am joking, but it’s right here in this Denver Post link, the URL of which ends with “poop-doping-cycling,” and the content of which concerns a powerful microbiome.      The most important, perhaps, is Prevotella. Not typically found in American and European gut microbiomes, Prevotella is thought to play a role in enhancing muscle recovery. “In my sampling, only half of cyclists have Prevotella, but top racers always have it,” she told Bicycling. “It’s not even in 10 percent of non-athletes.” Peterson reports she hosts Prevotella in her own gut – but not naturally. In fact, she might be the first case of “poop doping,” thanks to a fecal transplant she administered herself three years ago. Her donor? Another elite athlete.      That’s Lauren Peterson, a microbiologist and pro endurance mountain biker, who self-administered her first poop transplant from another elite athlete three years ago. She said she did it both to improve her athletic performance and to treat symptoms from the Lyme disease she contracted as a child.      Fecal transplants are rare for reasons I assume are obvious, and some reasons that are not. In the U.S., they’re pretty much only done to treat extreme cases of a specific disease, Clostridium difficile, which causes chronic diarrhea. Peterson couldn’t find a doctor willing to do a poop transplant on her, so she did it herself.      Sign up Like this article?

Something went wrong. Try again?      “I just did it at home,” she said of the February 2014 procedure. “It’s not fun, but it’s pretty basic.”      Of course, you know what happens next. It was a miracle cure, her energy went through the roof, she started winning races.      “I had more energy than I knew what to do with,” she told the same podcast last year. “Like everything just changed.”      All because of somebody else’s poop.      Whatever is to become of “poop doping,” these are the early stages of it. Peterson is pretty sure it’s going to catch on in cycling, and given everything we’ve learned about cycling culture over the last, oh … let’s just say the whole modern history of the sport, this seems like a good bet. Peterson imagined a day when you could accomplish the same thing just by taking a pill.      That would certainly be called a Prevotella pill, but we’d all know it by its street name: The Poop Pill.      And if that’s what cyclists really want to do, I say go ahead. I’m not going to talk you out of eating poop. That’s what your parents are for. ||||| RELATED: Gut Science is the Future of Hydration      “I couldn’t find a doctor who could help me,” remembers Petersen. An interest in finding her own solutions had already propelled her towards a career in science, and while she was in grad school she had her gut sequenced by the American Gut Project*. The results showed that her gut microbiome is 96% gram-negative bacteria. While American Gut is purely a research project and results cannot be used as a diagnostic or to inform treatment, Petersen worried that some of these bacteria might be pathogenic, and could get into her blood stream. “I had no microbes to help me break down food, and I had picked up bugs in the lab where I was working because my system was so weak and susceptible.”      But a few months after her transplant, Petersen was training five days a week (up from her usual two). She started enduro racing, and was soon placing and even winning in the pro field. “I wondered if I had gotten my microbiome from a couch potato, not a racer, if I would I be doing so well,” remembers Petersen. \\"Then it made me wonder what the best possible microbiome for a racer would be.”      RELATED: How use of Probiotics Benefits Cyclists      So, she started gathering stool samples from amateur and professional bike racers. She observed that Prevotella, a microorganism she received in her own transplant, is common amongst elite racers. “The more a person trains, the more likely they are to have Prevotella,” says Petersen. “In my sampling, only half of cyclists have Prevotella, but top racers always have it... it’s not even in 10% of non-athletes.”      She is currently extracting Prevotella to understand what it is, and how to boost its abundance naturally or through a probiotic pill for athletes or aspiring athletes. What she already knows: Prevotella synthesize branch chain amino acids critical for muscle recovery.      RELATED: How to Change Your Gut Bacteria to Lose Weight      In addition to Prevotella, Petersen has identified an archeon named Methanobrevibacter smithii, or M. smithii, which she believes is also significant. Archeon are ancient microorganisms that have managed to survive for millions of years in hostile habitats like sulfur springs and deep in the ocean. They also live in the human digestive system, where they have specialized functions. Like Prevotella, Elite cyclists often have M. smithii, but it’s less common in amateur racers. That’s significant because M. smithii also appears to be a performance-enhancing microbe.      What does it do? In science terms, it thrives on hydrogen and carbon dioxide and other bacterial waste products in the gut. In 12-year old boy terms, M. smithii eats the poop of bacteria. Yes, everybody poops, even bacteria, and it can have detrimental effects on your health. Namely: buildups of hydrogen and carbon dioxide can prevent the other bacteria in your gut from properly breaking down your food for fuel, which is bad news if you need calories for that sprint.      So in 12-year-old boy terms, M. smithii is kind of like a bacterial pooper scooper. In science terms, it helps you turn the food you’re eating into energy more efficiently. For example, it boosts the ability of your gut bacteria to break down fiber from fruit into the short-chain fatty acids that are critical fuel for athletes.      Petersen is still investigating how different foods can impact Prevotella, M. smithii, and the rest of the 120 species and 350 strains of microbes she’s identified in bike racers' guts. And she doesn’t know if those microorganisms need other ingredients to work. She also doesn’t know if Prevotella and M. smithii are differentiators for cyclists only, or also common in elite basketball players or gymnasts. So unfortunately it could be years, not months, before you’ll be able to buy performance-enhancing probiotics. (In the mean time, you can try top-rated Ultimate Flora for 29 on Amazon.)      As for actual poop doping…. fecal transplants are available, but not in the U.S. And if you do find a clinic willing to do it, Petersen warns that \\"you can’t choose your donor, and it’s a risky procedure. As with any transplant, your immune system could reject what you get. It’s not something you should take lightly. I did a lot of research, and I took a risk for sure.” To be clear, Petersen in no way supports 'at home' fecal transplants— she simply thinks there's room to improve our probiotic and prebiotic knowledge.      RELATED: Pro Cyclist Habits to Follow— or Ignore      With the data collected from the Athlete Microbiome Project, Petersen is diving into research not just on performance enhancing probiotics for cyclists, but whether cyclist-derived gut microorganisms could boost the health of athletes and non-athletes alike, providing greater long-term benefits than the probiotics currently available.      “What we’re learning is going to change a lot for cyclists as well as the rest of the population,” says Petersen. “If you get tested and you’re missing something, maybe in three years you’ll be able to get it through a pill instead of a fecal transplant. We’ve got data that no one has ever seen before, and we’re learning a lot. And I think I can say with confidence that bacterial doping— call it poop doping, if you must— is coming soon.”      Want to get involved? If you’re a Pro or Cat 1 cyclist and want to share what’s in your gut, contact Lauren.      *The American Gut Project does not provide information that should be used for clinical decisions. |||||Summary:","output":"The use of fecal microbiota transplants, or \\"poop doping\\", among cyclists could become widespread as researchers work to understand and replicate the benefits of key microbes.

Before embarking on an explaining menstruation, make a conscious effort to keep things neutral or positive. It’s important that both boys and girls see menstruation as a normal and healthy process, not something that people should be embarrassed about or feel guilt or shame from. Avoid derogatory language that makes menstruation sound negative, dirty, or unpleasant.  Boys may think that the bleeding may be painful, like from a cut. Assure them that the bleeding does not hurt and is not painful. You can explain that some women experience cramps, which are muscle cramps in the body, but the pain does not come from bleeding. When talking about menstruation, communicate that menstruation is a healthy and normal part of growing up for girls. Just like boys develop facial hair and their voices change, girls start to physically change, too. Say, “Before her blood comes for the first time, a girl does not have access to her power to create a baby. When it does come, it signals her that her body is ready to have a baby. It’s exciting to have this ability. Now, whether she is ready for a baby is something else!” For young children, you can talk about how the body cleans itself. Say, “Girls’ bodies are different than boys’ bodies. A major part of the body is cleaning from the inside out, like when you go pee or poo, or when you blow your nose. When girls get older, their body starts cleaning in a new way. Sometimes girls use special things to help their bodies be clean.” Girls have different body parts than boys. You may want to define terms like “uterus,” “vagina,” or “pregnancy.” Say, “These are all body parts that girls have that boys do not have. Uterus is a big word that means where a baby grows. Vagina is a word that tells us where babies leave the body, or where blood leaves if there is no baby. Pregnancy is what happens when a baby is growing inside a woman.” You can say, “Women and girls have different body parts than boys. This is because women can grow babies in their bodies and men cannot. These are the things that women have that men don’t.” With older boys, you may want to introduce common terminology related to women’s cycles. Clearly explain any newly introduced terminology. Some things you may want to explain include the words “period,” “menstruation,” or “cycle.” You may also want to include slang terms, like “time of the month,” “Aunt Flo,” or “moon/moon cycle,” as these terms may come up at school or within the boy’s social network. Keep your answers simple. If explaining the word period, say, “A period is something at the end of a sentence. But it can also mean  the time each month when a woman’s body cleans itself from the inside out. It’s a word that sums up a process that happens in a woman’s body.” Clearly communicate that there is nothing “wrong” with menstruation blood. It is not embarrassing, gross, or shameful. It doesn’t make a girl “dirty.” If your boys know that a girl is menstruating, tell them to treat her with respect and not to tease her or make her feel bad.  Say, “If you notice a girl has her period or has blood on her clothes, it’s important to treat her with respect. It’s not okay to tease her or make fun of her. Don’t say anything hurtful to her or anyone else. Remember that it’s normal to have a period.” Make sure they know that menstruation is totally normal and healthy.","output":"Educate both boys and girls about menstruation as a normal and healthy process, using neutral and positive language, while introducing appropriate terminology and emphasizing the importance of treating each other with respect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While on a tour of works at Cardiff, he caught a chill and returned to London, half-paralysed, where he lay dying for some three weeks. Among his last visitors were Oscar Wilde and James Whistler. He was buried in the tomb he designed for his mother at West Norwood, London. On his death, John Starling Chapple, Burges's office manager and close associate for more than twenty years, wrote \\"a constant relationship ... with one of the brightest ornaments of the profession has rendered the parting most severe. Thank God his work will live and ... be the admiration of future students. I have hardly got to realize my lonely position yet. He was almost all the world to me.\\" Lady Bute, wife of his greatest patron, wrote, \\"Dear Burges, ugly Burges, who designed such lovely things – what a duck.\\" In Saint Fin Barre's, together with memorials to his mother and sister, there is a memorial plaque to Burges, designed by him, and erected by his father. It shows the King of Heaven presiding over the four apostles, who hold open the Word of God. Under the inscription \\"Architect of this cathedral\\" is a simple shield and a small, worn, plaque with a mosaic surround, bearing Burges's entwined initials and name. Legal complications obstructed Burges's wish to be buried in the cathedral he had built. Burges's own words on Saint Fin Barre's, in his letter of January 1877 to the Bishop of Cork, sum up his career, \\"Fifty years hence, the whole affair will be on its trial and, the elements of time and cost being forgotten, the result only will be looked at.

Information:  - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.  - Krisiun is a Brazilian death metal band, founded by brothers Alex Camargo (bass, vocals), Moyses Kolesne (guitars) and Max Kolesne (drums).

Lennon's hope is to ensure that the 26-year-old remains a key player in Hibernian's squad, contributing to the team's success by scoring more goals and delivering consistent performances.

Retaining his services would mean that the club continues to benefit from his talents and experience, contributing to a brighter future for the team.

On a hot summer afternoon, the First Savings Bank of Brooklyn is held up by Sonny Wortzik and Sal two down-and-out characters. Although the bank manager and female tellers agree not to interfere with the robbery, Sonny finds that there's actually nothing much to steal, as most of the cash has been picked up for the day. Sonny then gets an unexpected phone call from Police Captain Eugene Moretti, who tells him the place is surrounded by the city's entire police force. Having few options under the circumstances, Sonny nervously bargains with Moretti, demanding safe escort to the airport and a plane out of the country in return for the bank employees' safety. Written by alfiehitchieFirst-time crook Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) and his friend Sal (John Cazale) rob a Brooklyn bank to fund Sonny's boyfriend's sex change operation, only to discover that the bank has very little money. Unsure what to do, the two robbers camp out in the bank, holding all the workers hostage. The police are alerted that there is a robbery in progress. Detective Eugene Moretti (Charles Durning) and numerous officers set up a siege around the bank. When Moretti calls the bank to tell the lead robber, Sonny, that the police have arrived, Sonny warns that he and his armed accomplice, Sal, have hostages and will kill them if anyone tries to come into the bank.

A large rectangular metal pan appears with instructions that say to fill it with a pan of hot water. the circular cake pan","output":"The circular cake pan, with its smooth and sleek design, is carefully placed into the rectangular metal pan. The purpose of this arrangement is to create a water bath, also known as a bain-marie, which provides gentle and consistent heat for delicate recipes like cheesecake, custard, or even some types of mousse. The water in the larger pan transfers heat slowly and evenly to the contents of the smaller pan, ensuring that the dessert cooks through without curdling or developing a tough texture. As you examine the pans, you notice that the rectangular pan is sturdy, with high sides that will safely hold the hot water necessary for this technique. It is crucial to use a pan that will not warp or buckle under the heat and weight of the water, as it could lead to uneven cooking or potential spills in the oven. On the other hand, the circular cake pan, designed specifically for your dessert, is slightly smaller in size, so it can comfortably fit within the larger pan. The instructions specify that you should fill the rectangular pan with hot water, so you carefully pour water from a recently boiled kettle into the pan until it reaches approximately halfway up the sides of the circular cake pan. It is important not to overfill the pan, as the water could overflow and potentially cause injury or damage when moving the pans in and out of the oven. Once the water bath is set up, you'll want to ensure steady heat from the oven itself. Preheat the oven to the temperature specified in your recipe, allowing enough time for the heat to equalize before placing your dessert inside. As you slide the water bath onto the middle rack, it's essential to use caution and move smoothly to prevent any splashing or spills. Throughout the baking process, you'll need to keep a close eye on the water level, as some of it may evaporate during cooking. You may need to occasionally replenish the hot water to maintain the right depth. Properly maintaining the water bath will help you achieve the desired consistency, texture, and appearance for your dessert. Once your dessert has finished cooking, use oven mitts to carefully remove the pans from the oven, again being cautious not to let the hot water splash. Let the circular cake pan sit in the water bath until it cools down to room temperature to prevent sudden temperature changes that could lead to cracks or other imperfections. After cooling, you'll likely want to refrigerate your dessert for a few hours or until it sets completely, depending on your recipe. In conclusion, the art of using a water bath, or bain-marie, is essential when preparing delicate and sensitive desserts. By following the instructions provided, taking proper precautions, and being attentive throughout the cooking process, you'll be sure to create a delectable and visually appealing treat for everyone to enjoy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist M. Shadows, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Zacky Vengeance, lead guitarist and backing vocalist Synyster Gates, bassist and backing vocalist Johnny Christ, and drummer Brooks Wackerman. Avenged Sevenfold is known for its diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise. Avenged Sevenfold emerged with a metalcore sound on the band's debut Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and continued this sound through their second album Waking the Fallen. In January 2009, M. Shadows confirmed that the band was writing the follow-up to their self-titled fourth album within the upcoming months. They also played at Rock on the Range, from May 16-17, 2009. On April 16, they performed a version of Guns N' Roses' \\"It's So Easy\\" onstage with Slash, at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles. On December 28, 2009, the band's drummer James \\"The Rev\\" Sullivan was found dead at his home at the age of 28. Autopsy results were inconclusive, but on June 9, 2010, the cause of death was revealed to have been an \\"acute polydrug intoxication due to combined effects of Oxycodone, Oxymorphone, Diazepam/Nordiazepam and ethanol\\". In a statement by the band, they expressed their grief over the death of The Rev and later posted a message from Sullivan's family which expressed their gratitude to his fans for their support. The band members admitted in a number of interviews that they considered disbanding at this point in time. However, on February 17, 2010, Avenged Sevenfold stated that they had entered the studio, along with now-former Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy, to drum for the album, in place of The Rev.  The single \\"Nightmare\\" was digitally released on May 18, 2010. A preview for the song was released on May 6, 2010 on Amazon.com, but was removed soon after for unknown reasons. Mixing for the album had been completed in New York City, and Nightmare was finally released worldwide on July 27, 2010. It met with mixed to positive reviews from music critics but was well received by the fans. Nightmare beat sales projections easily, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of 163,000 units in its first week. After finishing recording, in December, Portnoy and the band posted simultaneous statements on their websites stating that he would not be their replacement for The Rev. However, Portnoy did travel with the band overseas in December 2010 for three shows in Iraq and Kuwait sponsored by the USO. They played for U.S. Soldiers at Camp Adder, Camp Beuhring, and Balad Air Base. On January 20, 2011, Avenged Sevenfold announced via Facebook that former Confide drummer Arin Ilejay would begin touring with them that year. He was not yet considered a full-time member at this point.  Avenged Sevenfold performed at the Rock am Ring and Rock im Park festivals on June 3-5, 2011 alongside other bands such as Alter Bridge, System of a Down, and In Flames. On April 2011, the band headlined the Golden God Awards held by Metal Hammer. The same night the band won three awards for \\"Best Vocalist\\" (M. Shadows), \\"Epiphone Best Guitarist(s)\\" (Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance) and \\"Affliction's Album of The Year: \\" for Nightmare, while Mike Portnoy won the award for \\"Drum Workshop's Best Drummer\\" for his work on the album.  Avenged Sevenfold headlined the 2011 Uproar Festival with supporting acts Three Days Grace, Seether, Bullet for My Valentine, Escape The Fate, among others.

After sitting out yesterday #39;s morning skate, Canada #39;s top goalie chose to bow out of last night #39;s World Cup of Hockey semi-final victory over the Czech Republic because of his left wrist injury.","output":"Title: Martin Brodeur's Absence in the World Cup Hockey Semi-final Due to Wrist Injury Introduction: The World Cup of Hockey is one of the most prestigious international competitions in the sport of ice hockey. Featuring the best players from around the globe, teams compete for the coveted trophy, showcasing their skill, teamwork, and national pride. In 2004, the participants in the semi-final match between Canada and the Czech Republic were in for an exciting and memorable game. However, the absence of one of the key players from the Canadian team, Martin Brodeur, due to a wrist injury, was a significant talking point before the match. Background on Martin Brodeur: Martin Brodeur is widely considered one of the greatest goaltenders in the history of ice hockey. Born and raised in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Brodeur has an impressive career spanning over two decades. Known for his ability to read the game and his unique puck handling skills, he has become a vital part of any roster he has been a part of. A three-time Stanley Cup Champion with the New Jersey Devils and a two-time Olympic gold medalist, Brodeur has solidified his position as one of the greatest to ever dress for team Canada. Wrist Injury and Impact on the Team: Brodeur sat out during the team's morning skate session leading up to the semi-final game against the Czech Republic due to discomfort in his left wrist. After consultation with the team's medical staff, it was determined that he would not be able to perform at his best in the crucial match. As a result, Brodeur made the difficult decision to sit out of the game. His absence was a significant loss for the Canadian team as he was their starting goaltender and had been performing exceptionally well during the tournament. Additionally, it added pressure onto the shoulders of the backup goaltender, Roberto Luongo, who needed to step up and take the place of a hockey legend in a critical game with high stakes. Brodeur's Team-first Mentality: Despite the immense disappointment he must have felt from missing out on a pivotal game, Brodeur's decision to prioritize the team's best interests over his own is a testament to his character and commitment to the sport. By acknowledging his physical limitations and stepping aside for a healthier teammate, Brodeur displayed true sportsmanship and team-first mentality. His decision was celebrated as a selfless act that allowed the Canadian team the best chance of victory in a vital match. Conclusion: In the end, the Canadian team managed to secure a victory against the Czech Republic in the World Cup of Hockey semi-final. Brodeur's decision to prioritize his team over personal glory serves as a valuable lesson for athletes and sports fans alike. It teaches the importance of selflessness, teamwork, and the ability to make difficult decisions for the greater good of one's team. While his wrist injury forced him to sit out, Martin Brodeur's legacy as one of the greatest goaltenders in ice hockey history remains intact. His selflessness and willingness to put the team's success above his own serve as an inspiration not only to his teammates but also to future generations of hockey players world over."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who has devised and elaborate scheme against Lufton with Pindalest?  Cowboy drifter Jim Garry is summoned by his friend, smooth-talking Tate Riling. Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him. Eventually, Amy comes to trust (and fall in love with) Garry, especially after he defends her father from two of Riling's men. The answer to this question is:","output":"Tate Riling is the person who has devised an elaborate scheme against John Lufton with Jake Pindalest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In which novel of 1869 does Pierre Bezuhov fight a duel in which both participants survive?","output":"The novel you are referring to is \\"War and Peace\\" (1869) by Russian author, Leo Tolstoy. This monumental work of literature is set in the period surrounding the French invasion of Russia and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society. The duel scene that you mention takes place in the first volume of the novel between the characters Pierre Bezukhov and Dolokhov. Pierre Bezukhov is one of the novel's leading characters and is a wealthy and sincere man, although sometimes gullible and prone to rash decisions. He is often torn between his intellectual and moralistic ideals and the temptations that confront him within high society. On the other side, Dolokhov is an amoral character, known for his cunning, ruthlessness, and skilled manipulation. He is particularly talented in the art of dueling and has won many duels without being defeated. The conflict between Pierre and Dolokhov begins when Pierre discovers that his wife, Helene, is rumored to be having an affair with Dolokhov. Pierre is devastated and feels a mixture of betrayal, humiliation, and anger. Unable to contain his emotions, Pierre confronts Dolokhov and challenges him to a duel. Dolokhov, known for his expertise in combat and extensive experience in duels, accepts the challenge without hesitation. The duel takes place early in the morning in a snowy woodland at the remote outskirts of the city, with only a few individuals present as witnesses. Pierre, who has never fought a duel before, is obviously nervous and unprepared. Despite this inexperience, Pierre manages to shoot and wound Dolokhov, while Dolokhov's shot misses Pierre. Pierre is both surprised and horrified by his actions, and the experience serves as a turning point for his character in the novel. Both participants survive this tense encounter, although it leaves a lasting impact on their lives. Recently disillusioned by the intrigues and corruption of Russian high society, Pierre undergoes a major spiritual and personal transformation by the end of the novel. Dolokhov, on the other hand, resumes his manipulative ways and becomes involved in more trouble elsewhere in the course of the narrative. Overall, the duel between Pierre Bezukhov and Dolokhov in \\"War and Peace\\" serves as a pivotal scene for the development of the characters and provides a broader commentary on the morality and challenges faced by the individuals in this tumultuous period of Russian history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

În 2003, entitatea numită ESI a stârnit numeroase controverse prin faptul că a cerut ca puterile extensive ale lui Ashdown de a destitui oficiali și de a impune legi să fie abolite. Această solicitare a fost privită cu scepticism și critici de către o parte a societății, întrucât ar fi dus la o schimbare semnificativă în funcționarea autorităților și în modul în care erau aplicate legile. Mai mult, această solicitare a fost interpretată de mulți drept un atac direct la adresa autorității lui Ashdown și a puterii pe care aceasta o exercita în țară. Acest moment dificil în politica țării a dus la discuții aprinse și dezbateri între susținătorii și detractorii ideii propuse de ESI. Unii considerau că puterile pe care le avea Ashdown erau absolut necesare pentru a menține ordinea și stabilitatea, în timp ce alții credeau că acestea reprezentau o amenințare la adresa democrației și a drepturilor cetățenilor. Pe parcursul anului 2003, dezbaterile au continuat să încalcească sentimentele oamenilor și să provoace diviziuni în sânul societății, determinând liderii politici și oficialii guvernamentali să ia poziție și să facă declarații în legătură cu subiectul. Deși numeroase voci influente au apreciat curajul ESI de a aduce în discuție această problemă în public, alții au considerat că organizația a fost iresponsabilă și că a încercat să destabilizeze guvernul și să provoace haos în țară. În cele din urmă, controversa declanșată de ESI în 2003 a împins guvernul să reflecteze asupra rolului și puterilor lui Ashdown, precum și asupra modalităților în care acestea puteau fi modificate sau restricționate în interesul unei mai mari transparențe și responsabilități.

Santiago compared unfavorably to his fellow Marines, had poor relations with them, and failed to respect the chain of command in attempts at being transferred to another base. An argument evolves between base commander Colonel Nathan Jessup and his officers: while Jessup's executive officer, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson, advocates that Santiago be transferred immediately, Jessup regards this as akin to surrender and orders Santiago's commanding officer, Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick, to train Santiago to become a better Marine. When Dawson and Downey are later arrested for Santiago's murder, naval investigator and lawyer Lieutenant Commander JoAnne Galloway suspects they carried out a \\"code red\\" order, a violent extrajudicial punishment. Galloway asks to defend them, but instead, the case is given to Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee, an inexperienced and unenthusiastic U.S. Navy lawyer. Initially, friction exists between Galloway, who resents Kaffee's tendency to plea bargain, and Kaffee, who resents Galloway's interference. Kaffee and the prosecutor, his friend Captain Jack Ross (USMC), negotiate a bargain, but Dawson and Downey refuse to go along. They insist they were ordered by Kendrick to shave Santiago's head, minutes after Kendrick publicly ordered the platoon not to touch the would-be victim, and did not intend their victim to die. Kaffee is finally won over by Galloway and takes the case to court. In the course of the trial, the defense manages to establish the existence of \\"code red\\" orders at Guantanamo and that Dawson specifically had learned not to disobey any order, having been denied a promotion after helping out a fellow Marine who was under what could be seen as a \\"code red\\".

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: You might be able to prevent a fall by getting off the skateboard and running. Jump off your board by placing your back foot onto the ground in front of the skateboard, and following with your front foot. Begin running in the direction that you were traveling in and only stop the board once you have slowed down and regained control. Practice your running technique from a stationary skateboard first. Once you have got the hang of this, try running from a moving board, in a quiet space. Only try this at the skate park after lots of practice. Bailing is when you opt out of a trick before you get hurt. If you know that you're about to fall hard, you can try and stop the trick before it's too late, and jump off your board. Rather a bruised ego, than a bruised leg!   It is important to kick your board away when bailing, as you don't want to land back on your board and slip over. If you kick forward there is a greater chance that you will land back on the board, so always kick the board behind you by kicking your legs back. Bailing isn't good for your board deck, and it will cause scratches and chips. However, it is better to bail and chip your board, than to not bail and hurt yourself. If a fall is inevitable, you need to use all your limbs to soften the impact. It is important to keep your arms and legs loose so that they can absorb the shock of the fall.   If you stiffen your body, there is a greater chance of you breaking bones. Keep those limbs loose! Don't break falls by using only your outstretched arms. Wrist injuries are rife in skateboarders, and this is going to hurt or cause you to break your wrists. It's a good idea to wear knee-pads and if you are going to fall whilst on a ramp, always fall on your knees. This will cause you to slide down the ramp, and avoid serious injury. Rolling distributes the impact of a fall and prevents serious injury. Remember to shield your face with your arms and aim to land on your back or shoulders. Practice falling correctly on a soft surface before you hit the skate park. This way you'll be prepared for future falls and falling safely will become second nature to you.","output":"To avoid falling while skateboarding, try stepping off and running.

Answer based on context: Andrei Augostovich Eberhardt   was an Admiral in the Imperial Russian Navy of Swedish ancestry. Eberhardt was born in Patras, Greece, where his father was the Russian consul.  Eberhardt graduated from the Marine Cadet Corps in 1878. From 1882 to 1884, he served in the Pacific Fleet as a signals officer. In 1886, he became a flag officer and adjutant to Admiral Ivan Shestakov  and in 1891 he became a flag officer to Admiral Tyrtov commanding the Russian Pacific Squadron. In 1896 Eberhardt was moved to the Black Sea Fleet, where he was gunnery officer on the battleships Ekaterina II and Chesma. In 1898 he moved to the Far East, where he commanded the Admiral Nakhimov and took part in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion. During the Russo-Japanese War, Eberhardt was chief naval aide to Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev, the viceroy of Manchuria. In 1905, he was captain of the battleship  Imperator Aleksandr II and in 1906 he was made captain of the Panteleimon. He was promoted to Rear Admiral in 1907 and Vice Admiral in 1909. Eberhardt was Russia's Chief of the Russian Naval General Staff from 1908 and Commander-in-Chief of the Black Sea Fleet from 1911. During World War I, his top achievement was setting up a naval blockade of the Zonguldak coal fields, choking the coal supply of the German-Turkish fleet. He also commanded the Russian battleship squadron during the Battle of Cape Sarych. However he  was cautious to start further offensive actions against Turkish positions in the Bosporus and was replaced by Aleksandr Kolchak in 1916. Eberhardt retired from service in 1917 and was arrested by the Cheka in 1918 but released. He died in 1919 and is buried in the Novodeviche Cemetery in Petrograd. What happened first: Eberhardt graduated or served in the Pacific Fleet?","output":"Based on the context, Eberhardt graduated from the Marine Cadet Corps first in 1878 before serving in the Pacific Fleet as a signals officer from 1882 to 1884."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Literary career\\" correctly answer the question \\"Which group worked against the Nazis?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"Literary career\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"Which group worked against the Nazis?\\".

The focus of the Roman senate was usually directed towards foreign policy.

The power of the senate expanded over time as the power of the legislative assemblies declined, and the senate took a greater role in ordinary law-making.

Race on to find Gulf Coast dolphin killers Gulfport, Mississippi (CNN) -- Someone has turned a crucial dolphin birthing area off the U.S. Gulf Coast into a killing zone and the race is on to find the culprit or culprits before the marine mammals begin giving birth and the newborn dolphins are put at risk. \\"There is a sense of urgency. It is important that we find the person or persons who is perpetrating this heinous act,\\" said Moby Solangi, lead biologist of The Institute of Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport, Mississippi. \\"It looks like somebody is deranged. It's really senseless. It's repugnant. It's illegal. I don't understand what sort of person would do such a cruel act,\\" Solangi told CNN during an aerial tour of the sites where many of the dolphin carcasses were found. At least seven carcasses have turned up along a 120-mile stretch of the Gulf Coast, from Louisiana in the west to Florida in the east. Some have gunshot wounds, others have been mutilated, including one with its jaw cut off. Solangi, who performed necropsies of all the slaughtered dolphins, said the cruelty of what he's seen is the equivalent of having your pet dog's neck sliced. \\"This is gruesome really,\\" Solangi said. \\"It's not only killing them, it's also mutilating them. And the parts that are taken are disposed of; not next to the animal, they are taken. And they are not worth anything.\\" The first dolphin was found January 8 with a bullet wound on Deer Island, near Biloxi, Mississippi. In June, a bottlenose dolphin was found in Perdido Bay, Florida, near the Florida-Alabama state line, with a screwdriver stuck in its head. In September, one was found on Elmers Island, Louisiana, with a gunshot wound. On October 10, a dolphin was found on the beach in Dauphin Island, Alabama with its fluke cut off. The list gets worse from there. On November 6, a dolphin was found in near Ocean Springs, Mississippi, dead from numerous cuts. Three days later two more were discovered; another one with bullet wounds near Ocean Springs, and one on Ship Island, a remote barrier island off Biloxi, Mississippi, that was found with its jaw cut off. Authorities are still trying to determine if a dead dolphin found November 2, in Bayou Julia, Louisiana, is linked to the other killings. To stop the slaughter before the dolphins' birthing season, which begins soon, federal authorities say they need the public's help. \\"We need to have witnesses come forward. We need public input and information,\\" said Jeff Radonski, a deputy special agent for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is leading the hunt for the dolphin killer or killers. Investigators hope the culprit has bragged to friends or acquaintances about the killings. The large area over which the carcasses have been found make the investigation more difficult, Radonski said. There could be several motives for the slaughter -- it might be someone who is a \\"thrill seeker,\\" or fishermen who found the dolphins interfering with their operations on the water, he explained. In at least two previous cases, fishing charter captains have been found guilty of shooting at dolphins that approached their boats, or the fish their passengers had hooked, NOAA told CNN. The Marine Mammal Protection Act states that anyone convicted of killing a dolphin could be sentenced to one year in prison and fined up to 100,000. The law also makes it a crime to feed dolphins in the wild. Lt. Col. Claude Pittman, who patrols in the area of the killings for the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources, said he hasn't seen a dolphin shot in his 22 years of work. But these dolphin killings are making him fearful. \\"You don't know what type of person is doing this,\\" he said. \\"Would they carry it any further?

Try to Relax – Understand That You Are Okay The first step in reducing stress is to acknowledge your current state and realize that the situation is manageable. Remind yourself that you are okay and, with some effort, you can overcome the challenge at hand. This initial positive affirmation is important as it helps you eliminate excessive worries and focus on creating a solution-oriented mindset. 2. Wiggle Your Toes, Scrunch Your Face, or Make a Fist – Engage Your Body In Relaxation Techniques Engaging in physical relaxation techniques is an excellent way to combat stress. These simple actions help relax the body and ultimately reduce the adverse effects of stress on your mental and physical well-being. Some practical techniques include: a. Wiggling your toes: This simple motion helps increase blood circulation in the feet and promotes relaxation of the various muscles in the lower extremities. b. Scrunching your face: By scrunching your face and then releasing the tension, you can effectively relax the facial muscles and alleviate some tension in the head and neck area. c. Making a fist: Clenching your fists for a few seconds and then releasing the tension can reduce stress and promote relaxation in the palms and fingers. 3. Talk to Your Partner – The Importance of Communication One of the best ways to deal with stress is to share your thoughts and feelings with someone close to you. Often, just verbalizing your concerns and listening to your partner's insight can help put things into perspective and provide you with a fresh outlook. Moreover, maintaining open communication with your partner strengthens the bond you share, making you feel emotionally supported and less stressed. This emotional connection will benefit both of your well-being, resulting in a healthier, happier relationship. Conclusion In conclusion, stress has become an unfortunate inevitability in the modern world. However, by adopting practical relaxation techniques and fostering open communication with your partner, you can learn to manage stress effectively. The key is to invest in your emotional and physical health through exercise, healthy communication, and self-awareness. Remember, we may not be able to avoid stress completely, but we have the power to control how it affects our lives."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article based on this summary: – A former University of Connecticut student who went on a drunken, obscenity-laced tirade about jalapeno-bacon macaroni and cheese has been arrested in Florida after an altercation with a police officer, the AP reports. Luke Gatti was charged May 28 in Boca Raton with battery on an officer and resisting an officer with violence. According to the Hartford Courant, the incident took place at a treatment facility for people dealing with drug addiction and mental illness. Last year, the 20-year-old was arrested over his Oct. 4, 2015, outburst in the Student Union. He ranted at and shoved a university food service supervisor for refusing to sell him the macaroni and cheese. The altercation was caught on video and was widely viewed online. Gatti was put on probation and released his own video in which he apologized for his actions. Article:","output":"Once upon a time, there was a young man named Luke Gatti, who used to be a student at the University of Connecticut. One day, he really wanted to eat jalapeno-bacon macaroni and cheese. But because he was not in a good mood and was using bad words, the person working at the food place didn't want to sell him the yummy macaroni and cheese. This made Luke very angry and he started to shout and push the food service supervisor. Someone recorded the whole thing on their phone, and many people saw it online. After that happened, Luke was punished, and he had to be on probation. Probation is like a time-out for grown-ups when they do something wrong. He felt bad and said he was sorry in a video. But recently, Luke got into trouble again, and this time it was in Florida. He was at a place where people go for help if they have problems with drugs or if they are not feeling well in their minds. Something happened with a police officer there, and it was not nice. Luke was arrested for doing some not-so-good things, like fighting with the officer and not listening to him. It is important to remember that sometimes people make mistakes, and they need help to learn from them and become better persons. So, let's hope that Luke will learn from his mistakes and try to be more gentle and kind in the future."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts. Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part  # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a list, of lists, of integers. For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list. Problem:[[-46, 6, 22, -10], [6, 35, 38, -23, -20], [31, 28, 40, -34], [-14, 31, 40], [46, 44], [-4, 36, -29, 12, -41], [-43, 14, -30, 15], [-44, -10, -44], [-42, 15], [25, -27, -35, -10], [39, -43], [-7, 28]] Solution:","output":"Part #1: Identify the input list, of lists, of integers.

Each inner list contains a different number of integers. Part #2: Multiply every odd number in each inner list. Usage: For the inner list [6, 35, 38, -23, -20], the odd numbers are 35 and -23. Multiplying them together gives a product of -805.  Explanation: We check each number in the inner list to see if it's odd (its remainder when divided by 2 is not 0). Then, we multiply the odd numbers together. Part #3: Output a list of integers, with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. Usage: Based on the sample input, our output list should have a length of 12 because there are 12 inner lists within the input list. Explanation: We need to make sure the output list has an equal number of elements as there are inner lists in the input list. Part #4: If there are no odd numbers in an inner list, output 0 for that list. Usage: The inner list [46, 44] has no odd numbers. Therefore, the output for this inner list should be 0. Explanation: If we cannot find any odd numbers within an inner list, we must output a 0 in the corresponding position in the output list."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, but said later that year that he was glad to be out of coaching. With the expansion of the NFL, he said, talent had become diluted and fielding a good team was difficult. Coaches, meanwhile, customarily took the blame for a team's failures, and the sport had become too violent.  Ewbank's coaching style was laid-back but efficient, combining his mild personality with an orderliness inherited from Paul Brown. \\"Weeb combined a low-key style with a flair for the most dramatic of accomplishments\\", former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in 1998. \\"He led two of the legendary teams during the era of pro football's greatest growth. But he preferred to stay in the background and let the players take the credit.\\" He favored well-practiced execution of a limited number of plays over complicated offensive and defensive systems. Paul Brown \\"had the exact same approach: Don't do too much, but what you do, execute it flawlessly\\", Raymond Berry said in 2013, adding that the Colts' 1958 championship team had only six passing plays.  Ewbank is the only man to coach two professional football teams to championships, and the only man to win the NFL championship, the AFL championship and a Super Bowl. Ewbank's regular-season career record in the NFL and AFL was 130-129-7, and his playoff record was 4-1. Ewbank was selected as the head coach on the AFL All-Time Team in 1970. In addition to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he was inducted into the Miami University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1969, the Indiana Football Hall of Fame in 1974 and the Talawanda School District Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999. He also won the Walter Camp Distinguished American Award in 1987 and was inducted into the Jets' Ring of Honor in 2010.  Ewbank suffered a dislocated hip in the aftermath of the Jets' 1968 AFL championship game win, and had other health issues in his later years.

Well, there are plenty of reasons for that, not the least of which is that our version had a nine-season run compared to the 15-episode original series over there. That’s a lot of years to grow attached to a group of people, no matter their character flaws. But the main reason is that, for all our recession-era bitterness and anxiety, Americans are huggers and criers. We completely buy into what “Generation X” author Douglas Coupland once termed the “air family” – those co-workers and fellow travelers to whom we become attached simply because of the time we’ve done together in the cubicle trenches. In America, familiarity may indeed breed contempt, but it’s also an excellent way to harvest sap. Like all real-life office workers, the characters in “The Office” may yet discover the real meaning of air family now that they are largely apart: Over the years they’ll have less to talk about and nothing in common. They’ll forget about one another. This seems an obscene and frigid notion in the face of the lovefest we were shown Thursday night. After an hour-long special spent luxuriating in “The Office’s” tender trap, the writers and producers of the show chose to fixate more (much, much more) on happy endings instead of the sharp comedy that got them to this point. This meant that Steve Carell returned late in the episode as Michael Scott, to serve as the surprise best man at the wedding of Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) – a welcome sight, but oddly lacking in funny lines for Michael. “I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. It’s every parent’s dream,” he said, in a prime example of the finale’s propensity to favor Kleenex over comedy. In other (spoiler) news: Kelly and Ryan (Mindy Kaling and B.J. Novak) ran off together once more. (Kaling had one of the smarter observations during the hour-long special: All you young couples who model your own romance on the Jim-and-Pam ideal might do better to admit that most relationships look a lot more like the narcissistic doom that surrounds Kelly and Ryan.) The PBS documentary project that formed “The Office’s” mockumentary conceit aired in its entirety and brought little tumult to the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin, but it did reunite the office receptionist – never-adopted-foster-child Erin (Ellie Kemper) – with her birth parents. (Played by Joan Cusack and Ed Begley Jr., in a clever bit of casting.) Jenna Fischer snaps a picture on May 4, 2013 in downtown Scranton, Pa. during “The Office” Parade and wrap party. Both the retrospective special and the final episode leaned heavily on Jenna Fischer (both as herself and as Pam Beesly Halpert) for emotional grounding and articulate finish. My favorite part about the end of “The Office” was Pam’s confession that she never finished watching the documentary. She just couldn’t stand to watch herself missing out on life – taking too long to fall in love with Jim (John Krasinski) or pursue her art career or move beyond Dunder Mifflin. Pam had the exact reaction we all had to Pam in the beginning: She wanted to scream at her. “Life just isn’t that long,” Pam cautioned the viewers, in a moving speech that veered close to the platitudes of the YOLO handbook. But it was also Pam who most succinctly wrapped up the reason why America became so hooked on a show about something as banal as life in a drab office that sells paper: “There’s a lot of beauty in ordinary things,” she said. “Isn’t that the point?” Then we came to the end: It’s our last day at ‘The Office’ Watch: Eight great ‘Office’ moments, chosen by Angela Kinsey Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The American version of \\"The Office\\" had a warmer and more emotionally-invested tone compared to its more cynical British counterpart, cultivating a sense of \\"air family\\" among the characters.

Q:FINAL EXAM  Question 1. Which family does Mappia racemose, which grows on the fourth largest island in the Caribbean? A:","output":"Mappia racemosa, a rare and endemic plant species, belongs to the Icacinaceae family. This particular family consists of tropical and subtropical evergreen trees, shrubs, and lianas. The Icacinaceae family contains approximately 55 genera and 400 species that are distributed across Africa, Madagascar, Asia, the Americas, and the islands of the Pacific. The Mappia racemosa species is specifically found on the fourth largest island in the Caribbean, which is Jamaica. Jamaica has a host of unique and diverse flora, some of which are endemic to the island due to its isolated nature and varied topography. The Mappia racemosa is one such example of a native plant that has adapted to the island's environmental conditions. The Mappia racemosa plant is characterized by its racemose inflorescence, meaning that its flowers are arranged on a central axis with the oldest flowers situated at the base and younger flowers further up the stem. This arrangement is typical of the Icacinaceae family and is a distinguishing feature for the Mappia racemosa species. The plant's natural habitat includes limestone forests, lower montane wet forests, and moist regions in Jamaica. These environments provide optimal conditions for the plant to thrive, with sufficient moisture, sunlight, and nutrients available. The Mappia racemosa species is of ecological significance as it contributes to the overall biodiversity of the Caribbean region. Given its rarity and limited distribution, it is important to monitor and conserve this species to prevent further decline in its population. Conservation efforts could involve habitat restoration, protection of vital ecosystems, and awareness campaigns to promote the importance of preserving endemic Caribbean flora. In summary, the Mappia racemosa plant is a member of the Icacinaceae family and is endemic to the fourth largest Caribbean island, Jamaica. It is a rare species with distinctive racemose inflorescence and can be found in select habitats such as limestone forests and lower montane wet forests. Its conservation is vital for maintaining the rich biological diversity of the Caribbean region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Reconquest: The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the Muslims. After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart? ?  After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive.  He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself.  He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus.  Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding.  Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended.  One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel.  There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point.  In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised 1,000.  Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine.  His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the 1,000 he had collected. An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - The blood sugar drops in a body - Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood - The blood sugar levels are restored.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose More rain than usual happens, how will it affect MORE regulation of blood sugar level being needed.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The process described above is the regulation of blood sugar levels in the human body, specifically the response to low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia). The steps outlined are as follows: 1. The blood sugar drops in a body. 2. Cells in the pancreas (alpha cells) release glucagon. 3. The liver converts glucagon into glucose through a process called glycogenolysis (breaking down glycogen into glucose) and gluconeogenesis (generating glucose from non-carbohydrate sources). 4. The liver releases glucose into the blood, increasing blood sugar levels. 5. The blood sugar levels are restored. The perturbation hypothesis proposed is that there is more rain than usual. It is important to determine if this change in weather has a direct or indirect effect on the regulation of blood sugar levels. Direct effects: Rain and blood sugar regulation are not directly related as there are no physiological mechanisms in the human body that respond to increased rainfall to trigger changes in blood sugar levels. A direct effect would require rain to somehow influence the synthesis, secretion, or reception of glucagon and insulin, which are hormones directly involved in blood sugar regulation, or the rate at which glucose is synthesized and released from the liver. Indirect effects: While it is unlikely that there is any direct effect of increased rainfall on blood sugar regulation, there could be indirect effects related to changes in behavior, diet, or physical activity levels. For example: - Changes in diet: Increased rainfall could influence a person's diet, causing them to consume more or fewer carbohydrates, which in turn could affect blood sugar levels. Additionally, the availability and quality of food in agricultural regions might be affected by changes in rainfall, which could also indirectly influence a person's diet. - Physical activity levels: People might be less likely to engage in outdoor activities due to poor weather conditions, resulting in lower levels of physical activity. Reduced physical activity can impact blood sugar regulation, as physical activity generally leads to an increase in insulin sensitivity and can help maintain stable blood sugar levels. - Emotional stress: Changes in weather, such as increased rainfall, might affect mood and emotional state. Stress and related hormones can impact blood sugar regulation, potentially leading to an increase in both blood sugar levels and a greater regulation need. - Health conditions: Increased rainfall can impact health conditions, such as asthma, allergies, or arthritis, which might indirectly affect blood sugar regulation if these conditions alter diet, physical activity, or overall health. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis stating that more rain than usual might impact the regulation of blood sugar levels in the human body does not have a direct effect on the process. However, there can be indirect effects through changes in behavior, diet, physical activity, and health conditions. These indirect effects would need to be evaluated on an individual basis, as the impacts could vary among people depending on their unique circumstances and responses to environmental changes like increased rainfall."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Given the background: Another possible benefit of aggregation is to protect against predation by group anti-predator behavior. Many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. This increased vigilance might result in less time and energy spent on foraging, thus reducing the fitness of an individual living in smaller groups. One striking example of such shared vigilance is exhibited by meerkats. Meanwhile, other species move in synchrony to confuse and avoid predators such as schools of sardines and flocks of starlings. The confusion effect that this herding behavior would have on predators will be more effective when more individuals are present.Cooperative feeding  and the situation: Two different types of animals live in the same habitat but have vastly different behaviors. Animals A and B are both the same size which is relatively small. Animal A lives in small groups of 4 or 5. Animal B however lives in very large groups and when they move around they all move at the same time. Both groups are also hunted by the same predator.  Answer the following question: Which group likely relies on confusing potential predators, group A or B? Answer:","output":"Group B likely relies on confusing potential predators. This is because they live in very large groups and move in synchrony when moving around, similar to schools of sardines and flocks of starlings mentioned in the background information. Such synchronized movement and herding behavior tend to create a confusion effect on predators, making it more difficult for them to single out and catch individual prey. The larger the group, the more effective this confusion effect would be, as there are more individuals involved in the coordinated movement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

SACRAMENTO -- Two state senators said Wednesday they will introduce legislation to eliminate a controversial \\"personal belief exemption\\" that allows California parents to refuse to vaccinate their children.      \\"We shouldn't wait for more children to sicken or die before we act,\\" Sen. Richard Pan, a Sacramento Democrat who is also a pediatrician, said at a Wednesday news conference. \\"Parents are letting us know our current laws are insufficient to protect their kids.\\"      Pan is sponsoring the legislation with Sen. Ben Allen, D-Redondo Beach.      In Washington, D.C., California's two Democratic senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, on Wednesday asked state health officials to go further and consider eliminating the \\"religious exemption.\\"      Boxes of single-doses vials of the measles-mumps-rubella virus vaccine live and ProQuad vaccine are kept frozen inside a freezer at the practice of Dr. Charles Goodman in Northridge on Jan. 29, 2015. (Damian Dovarganes/Associated Press)      The clamor to repeal the state's permissive \\"opt out\\" vaccination policy appears to be overwhelming the state's anti-vaccine movement as the number of measles cases climbs.      Gov. Jerry Brown -- who pushed for more parental choice just two years ago -- quickly signaled that he was open to reform. \\"The governor believes that vaccinations are profoundly important and a major public health benefit and any bill that reaches his desk will be closely considered,\\" said Evan Westrup, Brown's spokesman.      \\"This is an important tipping point ... when state governments consider badly needed reforms where exemptions have been far too easy to obtain,\\" said bioethicist Jason Schwartz, who studies vaccine policy at the Princeton University Center for Human Values.      Advertisement      The political push comes at a time when the state is experiencing its worst measles outbreak in two decades. There are now at least 99 Californians infected with the extremely contagious measles virus. Of these, 39 were exposed while visiting Disneyland in December and another 23 contracted the virus from members of their household or close contacts. Three infections were acquired in the community, such as simply sharing space in a hospital emergency room.      Vaccine exemptions have been available since 1961, when California first required all public school teachers and students to be inoculated against polio. But there has been a surge in their popularity in recent years. From 2000 to 2014, the rate of parents seeking exemptions tripled, from 0.77 percent to 2.5 percent -- or one in every 40 kids. California is one of 19 states that allow exemptions based purely on parents' personal beliefs.      \\"An exemption is something we can only allow under the condition where it very rarely is exercised,\\" said Stanford University's David Magnus, a professor of pediatrics who directs the Center for Biomedical Ethics. \\"The fact that there has been so much misuse means it is time to tighten things.\\"      Politically, the well-to-do \\"all-natural\\" parents who have come to symbolize the anti-vaccination movement in California simply don't have many political supporters in Sacramento, said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a veteran political analyst at the University of Southern California.      Two potential Republican presidential candidates who have questioned forcing parents to get their children vaccinated -- such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky -- are pandering to the sorts of anti-government primary voters who could torpedo their chances of reaching a general election, Jeffe said.      But in California, so far no state lawmakers have publicly opposed the proposed legislation -- and there's little reason to believe opposition will succeed in a solidly blue state like California, she said.      Still, state Republicans are treading carefully for now.      Bob Huff, the state Senate's Republican leader, said, \\"We look forward to reviewing the proposed legislation in detail and weighing what appropriate actions should be taken in the coming months.      \\"Many Californians are rightfully asking if this is because of California's 'exemption' clause, which has prompted a larger debate of our state's youth vaccination policies,\\" Huff added. \\"While medical experts are overwhelmingly in agreement that vaccines are safe, preserving the freedom of choice has also emerged as part of this important discussion.\\"      While both \\"personal belief\\" and \\"religious\\" exemptions are available, most parents use the \\"personal belief\\" option.      Vaccine experts cautioned that repeal of just that option could drive parents to choose the \\"religious\\" option instead.      Governments are reluctant to police religious objections because \\"they do not want to become guardians of people's conscience\\" -- and it's unclear whether the Constitution allows them to, said Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, a law professor at UC Hastings College of the Law.      California's vaccine policy was tightened in 2012 by then-Assemblyman Pan, who introduced a law that required parents seeking exemptions to receive counseling and signatures from health care professionals.      The move led to a 20 percent decrease in parents opting out of vaccinating their kindergartners. But despite this effort, many children remain unvaccinated.      One problem has been that vaccine conversations can be initiated by naturopaths, who practice alternative medicine and typically oppose vaccination.      Santa Cruz parent Amy Kelchner, who practices naturopathy and is authorized to write vaccine exemptions, supports the continued availabilty of exemptions because she believes vaccines should be given only to healthy children over age 3.      \\"Public health refuses to consider the possibility that the astronomical rates of allergies, autism, chronic disease -- all legitimate public health concerns -- might have something to do with the overuse of suppressive medication, including vaccines,\\" she wrote in an email.      But many Bay Area parents and children traveled to Sacramento to urge a change in policy.      \\"My husband and I worry our son will get sick if we put him in day care,\\" said Palo Alto mother Leah Russin, holding her 16-month-old son. \\"Many day cares in our area have vaccination rates well below what is necessary to protect the community.\\"      Mountain View's Gina Lunde, also holding her toddler son, said, \\"The studies I've read show that it's impossible to change the minds\\" of opponents.      \\"We need this legislation to keep our kids safe,\\" she said. ||||| LOS ANGELES Responding to an outbreak of measles that has infected more than 100 people, two California lawmakers said on Wednesday they would introduce legislation to end the right of parents in the state to exempt their children from school vaccinations based on personal beliefs.      California public health officials say 92 people have been diagnosed with measles in the state, many of them linked to an outbreak that they believe began when an infected person from outside the country visited Disneyland in late December.      More than a dozen other cases have been confirmed in 19 other U.S. states and Mexico, renewing a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked science, have led a small minority of parents to refuse to allow their children to be vaccinated.      \\"The high number of unvaccinated students is jeopardizing public health not only in schools but in the broader community. We need to take steps to keep our schools safe and our students healthy,” state Senator Ben Allen said in a written statement announcing the legislation he is co-sponsoring with fellow Democrat Richard Pan.      The measure would make California the 33rd state to bar parents from opting out of vaccinations based on personal beliefs.      Also on Wednesday, a top Los Angeles County health official said that a total of 21 cases have been recorded in the county but that after the initial wave of reports, the number has fallen to four in the latest two-week period.      “We're getting to a number of cases that’s manageable, and I'm hopeful that within weeks or a couple of months we will be able to turn the corner on this particular outbreak,” Interim Health Officer Dr. Jeffrey Gunzenhauser told a press conference, although he cautioned that a lag in reporting could still add a few more cases.      A day care center at a high school in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Monica closed earlier this week and more than a dozen infants placed under a three-week quarantine after a baby enrolled in the program was diagnosed with measles.      Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But last year the nation had its highest number of measles cases in two decades.      Most people recover from measles within a few weeks, although it can be fatal in some cases.

Our problem is: -44 * n = 24 * n - 340 Let's break it down step-by-step and solve it together. Step 1: We want to get all the terms with 'n' on one side of the equation. So, let's move 24 * n to the left side by subtracting it from both sides: -44 * n - 24 * n = -340 Step 2: Now, let's combine the 'n' terms on the left side: (-44 - 24) * n = -340 That simplifies to: -68 * n = -340 Step 3: To find the value of 'n', we want to get it all by itself on one side. Since 'n' is being multiplied by -68, we'll divide both sides by -68: n = -340 / -68 Step 4: Now we just need to do the division: n = 5 So, the answer is n = 5. That means if we replace 'n' in the original equation with 5, it will make the equation true! Great job solving this together!"},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Identify the subject: \\"this Oscar-nominated documentary\\" - This part of the phrase gives us information about the documentary being discussed. The fact that it is \\"Oscar-nominated\\" implies that it is well-regarded and recognized for its quality, which can be considered a positive aspect. 2. Analyze the verb: \\"takes\\" - This verb indicates that the documentary is responsible for guiding or transporting the viewer to a particular place or experience, without any negative or positive connotations in itself. 3. Consider the object: \\"you there\\" - This part of the phrase implies that the documentary successfully immerses the viewer in its subject matter or story, allowing the viewer to feel like they are part of the experience.

I bought them in bulk, and my order came very quickly. Excellent! Answer:","output":"The given product review would most likely increase the chances of me buying the product for several reasons. Firstly, the review title, \\"Oh, so good!\\" implies a strong and positive reaction from the reviewer, which is a good indication that they had a satisfying experience with the product. Additionally, the detailed review adds further weight to this positive sentiment. The reviewer also highlights specific aspects of the product that they enjoyed, such as the perfect ratio of candy coating to concealed licorice. This not only hints at the product's high quality but also gives potential buyers a better understanding of what they can expect regarding the product's taste and texture. Moreover, the reviewer mentioned that they bought the product in bulk, which suggests a level of confidence in the product and a willingness to commit to a more substantial purchase. This factor, too, can provide some assurance to potential buyers that the product is worth trying. Furthermore, the reviewer's comment about the order arriving quickly adds an additional element of positivity to the review. Timely delivery is an essential aspect of the purchasing experience, especially for online orders, and is something customers often take into account when deciding whether to buy a product.

The most common cause of corns and calluses on the feet is something causing irritation, pressure, or friction in the same spot. By eliminating the source of the friction, you can prevent corns and calluses from forming. Shoes that do not fit can rub against your toes or cause your foot to slide inside the shoe.  Be sure your toes have plenty of wiggle room inside your shoes.  Corns develop along the tops and sides of your toes, and can be due to wearing shoes that do not give your toes enough room.  Repeated rubbing or irritation caused by shoes that do not fit properly are a major cause of corns of calluses.  Tightly fitting shoes and shoes with high heels that cause your fit to slide forward can cause corns and calluses to develop.  Calluses develop when the bottom or side of the foot slides against a part of the shoe that is irritating, or slides inside of shoes that are too large. Going without socks can cause your feet to experience friction and pressure from your shoes.  Always wear socks to prevent the friction and pressure. Especially in shoes that are designed to wear socks, such as athletic foot wear, heavy work shoes, and boots.  Be sure your socks fit properly. Socks that are too tight can squeeze your toes causing unwanted pressure and friction. Loosely fitting socks can slide down on your foot while in the shoe and contribute to added friction and pressure on areas of your foot. Use pads placed on top of the areas where the corns develop, between your toes, or along areas where the calluses form. Using pads, sections lamb’s wool, or toe separators can help to reduce the friction and pressure along your toe or foot area where the corns and calluses are located. Calluses form on your hands at the areas of greatest friction.  In many cases, calluses on the hand are welcomed. One example involves people that play musical instruments. Guitar players, for instance, appreciate the calluses that form on the tips of their fingers. This helps them to play their instrument without pain.  Another example is athletes that lift weights. The calluses that form on their hands can help them to grasp and manipulate the bars used in weight lifting. Summary:","output":"Corns and calluses on feet are primarily caused by ill-fitting shoes, friction, and pressure, which can be prevented by wearing properly-fitting shoes and socks, and using pads or separators to reduce friction in problem areas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Syriana Movie plot: U.S. energy giant Connex is losing control of key Middle East oil fields in a kingdom ruled by the al-Subaai family. The emirate's foreign minister, Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig), has granted natural gas drilling rights to a Chinese company, greatly upsetting the U.S. oil industry and government. To compensate for its decreased production capacity, Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen, a smaller oil company that recently won the drilling rights to key petroleum fields in Kazakhstan. Connex-Killen ranks as the world's twenty-third largest economy, and antitrust regulators at the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) have misgivings. A Washington, D.C.-based law firm headed by Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) is hired to smooth the way for the merger. Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) is assigned to promote the impression of due diligence to the DOJ, deflecting any allegations of corruption. Emir storyline[edit] Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an energy analyst based in Geneva, Switzerland. Woodman's supervisor directs him to attend a private party hosted by the emir at his estate in Marbella, Spain, to offer his company's services. The emir's illness during the party prevents Woodman from speaking directly with him while, at the same time, the emir's younger son, Prince Meshal Al-Subaai (Akbar Kurtha), shows the estate's many rooms and areas to Chinese oil executives via remote-controlled cameras. No one notices that a crack in one of the swimming pool area's underwater lights has electrified the water. Just as Woodman and all the other guests are brought to the pool area, Woodman's son jumps into the pool and is electrocuted. In reparation and out of sympathy for the loss of his son, Prince Nasir, the emir's older son, grants Woodman's company oil interests worth US75 million, and Woodman, though initially insulted by the offer, gradually becomes his economic advisor. Prince Nasir is dedicated to the idea of progressive reform and understands that oil dependency is not sustainable in the long term; Nasir...

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work.

Sentence 2: A person might be human, even when they were a zombie, if they had enough character. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, let's analyze both sentences step by step: Step 1: Understand the meaning of both sentences - Sentence 1 communicates the idea that it is unfair for someone with a strong character to be eliminated without any thought, even if they're a zombie. - Sentence 2 conveys the idea that someone can still be considered human if they have enough character, even if they are a zombie. Step 2: Compare the information in both sentences - Both sentences discuss the relationship between character and being a zombie. - However, the first sentence specifically discusses the fairness of wiping out someone with character, while the second one addresses the notion of being considered human. Step 3: Determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first - The first sentence implies that there can be zombies with character, and that it is unfair to wipe them out without consideration. - Although it doesn't explicitly state that these zombies are considered human, that being \\"human\\" is a core aspect of having character is implied. Thus, the first sentence indirectly suggests that a person might still be viewed as human even when they're a zombie, based on their character. Based on this analysis, I would argue that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, although not explicitly. The first sentence establishes the importance of character even in a zombie, and as a result, the second sentence becomes a plausible and related conclusion that can be derived from this premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The first clause indicates it as an obligation (\\"must\\"), and the second clause expresses it as a future plan (\\"will\\").

Francisco de Ibarra was a Spanish explorer and conquistador in the 16th century who played a significant role in the exploration and conquest of what is now known as northern Mexico. He embarked on a series of expeditions that expanded Spanish influence in the region over several years. One such expedition took him to the area of modern-day Casas Grandes, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, where the archaeological site of Paquime is located. Paquime, also known as Casas Grandes, is an important archaeological site in the north of Mexico, dating back to the late Pre-Columbian period. Paquime was inhabited by the ancient Casas Grandes culture, also known as the Mogollon, between approximately AD 1130 and 1450. The site showcases a unique blend of architectural styles, combining influences from puebloan cultures in the north and Mesoamerican cultures in central and southern Mexico. This mixture is evident in the adobe architecture, ceramics, and artifacts discovered at Paquime. Excavations at the site have revealed a complex urban center featuring multi-story buildings, plazas, workshops, and an extensive, sophisticated water control system. Paquime was also an important center for trade, connecting the various cultural groups within the region. Turquoise, shells, copper, and macaws were traded, as well as goods from even more distant regions like Central Mexico and the American Southwest. Francisco de Ibarra, following in the footsteps of his uncle, Diego de Ibarra, helped expand Spanish control and influence in the north of Mexico throughout the 1560s and 1570s. It is thought that during his expeditions, Francisco de Ibarra encountered the ruins of Paquime, making him the first known European to see the remains of this once-thriving ancient city. This discovery signified the richness and complexity of the pre-Columbian cultures that inhabited the region before the arrival of the Europeans, providing valuable insights into the history and heritage of the region in which Paquime played a significant role."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: One reason radiation is dangerous is that it can’t be detected with the senses. You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation.

Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on  Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed  Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding  Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get  Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.

The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as murder, serial killers, necrophilia, torture, genocide, human experimentation, Satanism, hate crimes, terrorism, religion, antireligion, Nazism and war, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups and factions of the general public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, Reign in Blood (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums. Slayer has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States.

Q:Question: \\"What is the full name of the organization that claimed censorship by the Tajik government in 2010?\\"  Context: \\"The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The full name of the organization that claimed censorship by the Tajik government in 2010 is the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who said Saint-Saëns's operas were \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s?\\" ?  Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...

Is Subsequently, Plato and Aristotle produced the first systematic discussions of natural philosophy, which did much to shape later investigations of nature. a good answer to this question?","output":"While the provided statement does mention Plato and Aristotle's considerable contributions to the development of natural philosophy, it doesn't specifically address the question about the discussion technique they are responsible for. A more appropriate and detailed answer would be: Plato and Aristotle are often credited with developing the philosophical discussion technique known as \\"dialectic\\" or \\"dialectical method.\\" This method involves structured discussions between two or more people, where opposing views are presented and debated in order to arrive at a greater understanding of the topic at hand or establish a consensus.  The dialectic method relies on reasoned arguments and critical thinking, serving to uncover philosophical truths by examining different perspectives. Plato's Socratic Dialogues, a series of written works featuring Socrates as the protagonist, best exemplify this technique. In these dialogues, Socrates engages in discourse with various people and asks a series of questions, pushing them to question their own beliefs and ultimately reach a greater understanding. This process is also referred to as the \\"Socratic method\\" or \\"elenchus.\\" Aristotle, a student of Plato, also employed dialectic in his works, though he developed and refined the technique further. Aristotle maintained that dialectic helped in forming genuine knowledge by identifying the basic principles and axioms through a process of gathering information, challenging premises, and testing conclusions. Aristotle's dialectic can be found across his vast body of work, touching on topics such as metaphysics, ethics, politics, and natural sciences. Consequently, both Plato and Aristotle contributed significantly to the evolution of dialectic, shaping the discussions and debates that would occur in philosophical and intellectual circles for centuries to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit.

This is the only mention of prisoners taken throughout the war. Gunib was relieved the next day. North up the canyon was Gerghebil which was considered the key to the relief of Kunzakh. On 7 or 8 January 2686 men began the attack. On 26 January the place fell to a night attack. Todorsky justified the heavy losses on the grounds that difficult victories demoralized the enemy. Two days later Khunzakh was relieved for a second time. The next move was north down the canyon to Arikani and Gimry. Arikani fell on 14 February. Gimry had been battered by artillery from late December, ninety percent of the village being destroyed. On 18 February it surrendered. With the core area occupied other places began to surrender. On the 19th Ashitla west of Gimry was occupied by 125 officer cadets. All were killed during the night and the next day 52 mutilated bodies were found. It is not clear what provoked this unusual brutality. The area to the northwest to the Chechen border was occupied: Botlikh , Andi  and northward . On 9-13 March the Dagestan Reds linked up with those in Chechnya. On 15 March the Petrovsk Military Soviet declared the uprising liquidated. Meanwhile, on 25 February, Tiflis was occupied by the Red army. With Georgia now under Soviet control the remaining rebels in Dagestan were surrounded. The rebels made their last stand at Gidatl where the uprising was first organized. It fell in May. Small bands continued to resist until the end of May.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"If the plates were to move more quickly past each other, it would directly impact a step of the process. Since the movement speed of the tectonic plates has increased, the force exerted between them would also increase more rapidly over time. This means that the crust has a higher likelihood of breaking sooner, and the stress, which leads to an earthquake, is released at a shorter interval. As a result of the more frequent release of stress, there might be more earthquakes, but they could potentially be weaker in intensity. This is because there's a lesser chance of a massive build-up of stress and force before the crust breaks, so the energy released in each earthquake might be lower than if the plates moved slower. However, it's important to note that this is a hypothetical situation, and the actual impacts could vary depending on many geological factors."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While travelling by train, Schaffner decides to evade authorities. He drugs and switches identities with fellow train passenger Paul Scarff, who looks like him and has a Mexican passport. He throws Paul Scarff off the train, injuring Scarff. Carl later discovers that Scarff is wanted in Mexico as a political assassin. Carl then tracks down Scarff, who is resting from his injuries, to get back his original passport. Carl arrives in Mexico and is captured by the local police, who mistake him for Scarff. Carl then fights to show his true identity to the local police.  The plan seems foolproof until he is forced to care for the dog of Scarff's dog.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article:It means \\"nothing happens\\" but people often use it reassuringly as in: \\"Don't worry about it, it's nothing.\\" When it comes to solving murders, \\"no pasa nada\\" is a pretty accurate description. According to Mexico's statistics institute, 98% of homicides in 2012 went unsolved. The culture of impunity is frightening. The 31 July murder of photojournalist Ruben Espinosa along with four women in a middle-class neighbourhood of Mexico City is a crime that many fear will once again go unsolved. Mr Espinosa worked as a photojournalist in the eastern state of Veracruz for the investigative magazine Proceso, among others. He had recently left Veracruz for Mexico City because of safety fears. Veracruz is the most dangerous place to be a journalist in Mexico, which itself is deemed one of the most dangerous countries for journalists. Nationwide, 88 journalists have been murdered since 2000, according to free speech organisation Article 19. Fourteen journalists from Veracruz state alone have died since current governor Javier Duarte took office in 2010. That makes Veracruz the most lethal state for journalists out of Mexico's 31 states and its federal district. Relations between the Veracruz governor and the media have been tense. In July, Governor Duarte accused some journalists of having criminal ties. He went on to warn them to \\"behave\\", arguing that if anything were to happen to them, it would be him who would be \\"crucified\\". Some local journalists saw this as a thinly veiled threat against them. Human rights investigator Patrick Timmons says that while Veracruz may currently be the most risky place for journalists in Mexico, other states are not immune from violence against the media. \\"We have to understand that what we're seeing in Veracruz has happened in other states and it will happen in other states too,\\" he warns. Mexican authorities investigating the multiple murder said they were keeping all lines of investigation open, including robbery. But friends and relatives of Mr Espinosa think he was deliberately targeted, pointing to the execution-style nature of the killing. All five victims were shot in the head. Mr Espinosa's body showed signs of torture and three of the four women were raped. So far, one suspect has been arrested. Investigators said his fingerprints had been found at the crime scene and matched to a database which showed he had a criminal record for rape and assault. But Emily Edmonds-Poli, associate professor of political science at the University of San Diego and author of a paper on violence against journalists in Mexico, is sceptical. \\"That's so old-hat in Mexico, you pick up the nearest criminal and you accuse them of the crime,\\" she said. \\"I don't believe anyone is fooled by that,\\" she added, Many of the journalists killed in Mexico reported on organised crime and drug trafficking, considered inherently risky beats. But Prof Edmonds-Poli thinks their killings should not be dismissed that easily. \\"Many of them have covered corruption beats or politics, they are not necessarily chasing ambulances and trying to report on cartel activities,\\" she argues. She says that \\"it's the nexus between drug-trafficking organisations and the government, and that's why this really isn't solely a drug-related issue\\". \\"It's about how the state deals with being exposed,\\" she adds. The fact that Mr Espinosa was killed in Mexico City after having fled Veracruz, where he had received death threats, is seen by many as a dark development. Mexico City had for several years been seen as a safe haven, a bubble for journalists. But that bubble has now burst. Free speech group Article 19 argues that Mr Espinosa's murder marks a new level of violence against journalists in Mexico. \\"If you get pursued into Mexico City, that shows another level of determination on the part of people who are interested in silencing journalists,\\" said Emily Edmonds-Poli. Ruben Espinosa's murder shows that it is no longer true that in Mexico City \\"no pasa nada\\". Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"In Mexico, many journalists are getting hurt or killed because they are reporting on dangerous topics like crime and corrupt politicians. The situation is really bad in a place called Veracruz. Recently, a journalist named Ruben Espinosa was killed in Mexico City, along with four women. People are worried that this crime will not be solved, just like many other crimes in Mexico. This makes it very scary for journalists who want to report the truth.

I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you. Question: The narrator was thankful: === The answer to the above question is Select from: [A]. during the time she treated her body badly. [B]. not enough information. [C]. after she treated her body badly. [D]. before she treated her body badly. A:","output":"[C]. after she treated her body badly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A lawmaker from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party has described rape as a social crime, saying 'sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong.' The latest controversial remarks by an Indian politician about rape came as political leaders of Uttar Pradesh, the state where two cousins aged 12 and 14 were raped and hanged last week, have faced criticism for failing to visit the scene and for accusing the media of hyping the story. A regional politician from Modi's own party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said on Thursday that the crime of rape can only be considered to have been committed if it is reported to police. The BJP dismissed OPTIONS: - BJP's comments as an expression of his personal views, and not the party's. - Babulal Gaur's comments as an expression of his personal views, and not the party's. - Bharatiya Janata Party's comments as an expression of his personal views, and not the party's. - Indian's comments as an expression of his personal views, and not the party's. - Modi's comments as an expression of his personal views, and not the party's. - Narendra Modi's comments as an expression of his personal views, and not the party's. - Uttar Pradesh's comments as an expression of his personal views, and not the party's.","output":"Correct answer: - Babulal Gaur's comments as an expression of his personal views, and not the party's. Explanation: Based on the context given, it can be inferred that the person making controversial remarks about rape is a lawmaker from Prime Minister Modi's party, BJP. There's no mention of the lawmaker's name being directly referred to as \\"BJP,\\" \\"Bharatiya Janata Party,\\" \\"Indian,\\" \\"Modi,\\" \\"Narendra Modi,\\" \\"Uttar Pradesh\\". Therefore, these options are incorrect.  The choice that fits best in this context is Babulal Gaur. The reason other answers are wrong is that they are not the names of the lawmaker in question and the comments are not attributed directly to BJP, Bharatiya Janata Party, Modi, Narendra Modi, Uttar Pradesh, or India. So the statements attributing the comments to these entities or individuals are incorrect.  Based on logical inference and elimination, Babulal Gaur must be the name of the regional politician from BJP who made the controversial remarks about rape, and so the correct option is distinguished as Babulal Gaur."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Wayne Rooney might have missed a few chances at one end of the pitch for Manchester United on Sunday but he was lucky not to give away a penalty at the other. From a Tottenham corner late in the second half, Rooney grabbed hold of Harry Kane and hauled him to the ground, but referee Jonathan Moss did not award a penalty. 'I don't know what guidelines are going to make it any better,' said former Fulham captain Danny Murphy on Match of the Day on Sunday night.

Translate to Turkish","output":"Ve bu, evdeki eğitimlerinden kaynaklanıyor,\\" diye SETimes'a anlattı. Bu açıklama, günümüzde eğitim sistemi ve çocukların kişisel gelişimi hakkında yapılan genel tartışmalara dikkat çekiyor. Ev eğitimi, öğrencilere düzenli bir okul ortamında öğretilen derslerin yanı sıra, aile değerleri, kültür ve etik konularında da eğitim sağlar. Bu nedenle, bazı insanlar ev eğitiminin geleneksel eğitim sistemine kıyasla daha fazla avantaja sahip olduğunu düşünmektedir. Ev eğitimi, öğrencilere birçok yönden fayda sağlar. Öncelikle, özelleştirilmiş bir öğrenme deneyimi sunar. Evde öğrenen çocuklar, kendi hızlarında çalışarak ve ilgi alanlarına odaklanarak bilgiyi daha etkin bir şekilde özümseyebilirler. Bu, onların okul dışındaki yaşamlarına da olumlu bir etki yapabilir. Ayrıca, ev eğitimi çocuklara daha fazla teşvik ve destek sunar. Anne ve babalar, çocuklarının güçlü ve zayıf yönlerini bildiklerinden, onlara daha iyi eğitim ve öğretim sunarak akademik başarılarını artırabilirler. Bu, çocukların daha özgüvenli, bağımsız ve kendine yeterli bireyler haline gelmelerine yardımcı olur. Ev eğitimi, aynı zamanda öğrencilere eğitimde süreklilik ve istikrar sağlar. Evde eğitim gören çocuklar, özellikle de düşük gelirli ailelere sahip olanlar, okul değişikliklerinden ve kesintilerden daha az etkilenir. Bu sağlamlık ve istikrar, onların akademik başarılarına ve genel yaşam başarılarına da yansır. Ancak, ev eğitiminin de bazı dezavantajları vardır. İlk olarak, sosyal becerilerin gelişimi ev eğitimiyle sınırlıdır. Okul ortamında, öğrenciler sınıf arkadaşları ve öğretmenlerle etkileşime girerek sosyal yeteneklerini geliştirirler. Evde öğrenen çocuklar, bu tür sosyal etkileşimlerden mahrum kalabilirler. Bu, onların işbirliği, iletişim ve problem çözme becerilerini etkileyebilir ve genel yaşam başarılarını olumsuz yönde etkileyebilir. Buna ek olarak, evde eğitim alacak nitelikte bir öğretmenin bulunması her zaman mümkün olmayabilir. Kaliteli eğitimi sağlayacak kaynak ve deneyime sahip olan yetişkinlerin bulunması, özellikle uzmanlık gerektiren konularda zor olabilir. Bu durum, ev eğitiminin akademik başarısını sınırlayabilir. Sonuç olarak, ev eğitimi öğrencilere çeşitli avantajlar sunar, ancak sosyal becerilerin gelişimi ve öğretmen kalitesi gibi bazı dezavantajları da vardır. Aileler bu faktörleri göz önünde bulundurarak, ev eğitimi ve geleneksel eğitim arasında en uygun seçeneği belirleyebilirler."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: The Village Voice obtained a copy of MTV's standard contract for The Real World, a 30-page document that essentially requires cast members to sign their lives away, quite literally—the first stipulation being the understanding that participating in this reality show could cause death, loss of limbs, or mental illness. Hundreds of cast members have agreed to these terms in the past 25 seasons of the show.      While some of the terms in the contract may seem outlandish, they're there for good reason. Because one time a guy did almost die. In 2010, during the D.C. season, cast member Andrew Woods was pushed off a two-story balcony by one of his drunk roommates, landing on a concrete slab.      And there are many more examples of \\"mental illness\\" or \\"extreme emotional distress\\" in the form of nervous breakdowns. During the 2006/2007 season of Denver, Brooke LaBarbera became a staple of on The Soup for her numerous meltdowns caused by the stress of her living conditions.      This also ties into another contract stipulation:      [Portrayal of cast members] may be disparaging, defamatory, embarrassing, [causing exposure to] public ridicule, humiliation or condemnation…[Cast members] may be portrayed in a false light.      While also signing off on any objections to \\"a serious invasion of privacy,\\" Cara Kahn, part of 2002's Chicago cast, learned exactly what this meant the hard way, after watching herself have sex with several different men on television. It was the first time that Real World producers had used night vision cameras in the bedrooms and hidden microphones in the headboards of the beds, enabling them to pick up the audio of Cara opening a condom wrapper. The cast were unaware of this new development in production until the show aired, and Kahn later admitted to being humiliated by her portrayal as a \\"slut.\\"      As for being portrayed in a \\"false light,\\" in 1998, Irene McGee, part of the Seattle cast, left the show and her departure was depicted as having to do with a relapse of her Lyme Disease, but footage of McGee was also edited to make it appear that she was losing her mind. After the show aired, McGee spoke out that she'd really left the show for \\"ethical objections to the production,\\" and went on to give lectures about the falseness of reality TV, speaking out against The Real World and divulging industry secrets. She was sued by MTV.      Advertisement      McGee's legal dealings with MTV and her telling tales out of school no doubt contributed to another contract stipulation that requires cast members to participate in all producer-determined press and are required to abstain from engaging in any other media (radio, TV, blogs, chat rooms, message boards) without the producers' written permission. Additionally, if cast members are found to have violated any of the stipulations of the contract, they are required to pay producers 1 million.      Given the impact that AIDS activist Pedro Zamora had during the 1994 season in San Francisco, it's interesting that cast members are no longer allowed to participate in the show if they have any STDs and are required to sign a statement saying they don't. However, the contract also states that the other roommates might have STDs and that MTV is not responsible if you contract anything like AIDS \\"gonorrhea, herpes, syphilis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), Chlamydia, scabies (crabs), hepatitis, genital warts, and other communicable and sexually transmitted diseases or Pregnancy; etc.\\" from a roommate while living in the house. (In 2004, during the Philadelphia season, Melanie Silcott contracted scabies while living in the house.)      If you were wondering why nobody on The Real World has dealt with an unwanted pregnancy since Tami in the 1993 Los Angeles season—particularly considering MTV's boner for young moms and teen pregnancy—it's because cast members are not allowed to be pregnant. Pregnancy is grounds for dismissal.      Advertisement      Safety in The Real World house is also not a guarantee. Aside from the dangers of dying or contracting AIDS, the producers are under no obligation to conduct background checks on any of the roommates—meaning a participant could live with a violent criminal—and cast members are required to understand that they might have to deal with \\"non-consensual physical contact, of which MTV is not responsible. So basically, if you are raped or murdered by a fellow cast member, it's really on you.      During the filming of the 2004 season of San Diego, a 22-year-old woman claimed she was raped in the house, by a guest of one of the roommates, after being roofied. Apparently, the production staff found the woman lying naked on the bathroom floor. One cast member said she heard the accused rapist of walking out of the bathroom saying, \\"I just hit that.\\" The cameras were rolling when the woman woke up, and one of the female roommates in the house informed her that she may have been sexually assaulted. The woman went to the police the next day, who began an investigation. However, the cast and crew had already left for Mexico, where they were filming their \\"vacation.\\" A producer of the show did allow police into the home for a search, and provided them with the consent forms and IDs of guests in the house.      A lawyer for Bunim/Murray stepped in and refused to let the cops search the bedrooms. The police, most likely pissed off, returned with a search warrant and seized all bedding, editing equipment, and tapes from the time of the alleged crime. The result was that nearly a month of footage ended up on the cutting room floor because it wasn't returned in time, including the cast's Mexican vacation footage. No arrests were ever made in that case.      Some other contract stipulations worth noting:      You can't change your physical appearance during filming without the producers' permission. (So did Rachel need to get a note, for the 1994 San Francisco show, when she got a tattoo?)      Producers can misrepresent cast members' life stories.      Producers can have access to cast members' school records and credit history.      Production can show up at cast members' personal homes at any time to film or remove any possessions from those homes as long as they return said possessions once production has ended.      Cast members are obligated to participate in a reunion special for up to five years after the show ends. (This might stem from Aaron's and Dominic's refusal to participate in any reunion shows after they finished filming the Los Angeles season in 1993.)      Cast members are responsible for the cost of all long-distance phone calls during filming and must reimburse producers.      We Have Obtained a Copy of MTV's Standard Real World Cast-Member Contract [VV] ||||| Last Wednesday's Village Voice cover story profiled the DeBartoli sisters, two Staten Island sisters who starred in the never-aired Jersey Shore precursor Bridge & Tunnel and signed enormously binding contracts, legal documents that seemed to be written in another language but that they accepted anyway. This is standard practice for all its reality-show subjects, and though the following is a different document than the one the B&T; girls inked, we've managed to get our hands on an unsigned Real World contract. The 30-page spectacular is worth careful scrutiny, but please enjoy the amusingly specific highlights we've summarized below. Happy birthday, MTV!      Under the stipulations of the following standard contract, participants in Real World--the grandaddy of \\"reality\\" shows, after Cops--agree to the following terms:      • You may die, lose limbs, and suffer nervous breakdowns. (Stipulation 1)      • If you undergo any medical procedures while involved in the show, they carry the risk of infection, disfigurement, death. (4)      • You may be humiliated and explicitly portrayed \\"in a false light.\\" (12)      • Producers are under no obligation to conduct background checks on your fellow cast members. (7)      • If you contract AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases while filming [\\"gonorrhea, herpes, syphilis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), Chlamydia, scabies (crabs),'hepatitis, genital warts, and other communicable and sexually transmitted diseases or Pregnancy; etc\\"], MTV is not responsible. (7)      • Interacting with other cast members carries the risk of \\"non-consensual physical contact\\" and should you contract AIDS, etc. during such an interaction, MTV is not responsible. (7)      • You don't have STDs, but accept that other people on the show might. (18)      • You're not pregnant and you won't become pregnant before the show's done filming. If you do become pregnant, you'll tell the Producer immediately--and pregnancy is grounds for dismissal. (38)      • If you get kicked off the show, it will be filmed. (14)      • You can't change your physical appearance during filming, without the Producer's express permission. (26)      • You grant the Producer blanket rights to your life story. (49)      • The Producer can do pretty much anything they want with your life story, including misrepresent it. (49)      • Your email may be monitored during participation. (20b)      • You promise not to hide from MTV cameras in establishments where they can't film. (20a)      • You authorize the Producer to have total access to your school records, government forms, your credit history. (19)      • The production crew can show up at your personal house at any time to film and/or to take anything they want, as long as they return the objects once production has ended. (20a)      • Under ordinary circumstances, all of this would be considered a \\"serious\\" invasion of privacy. (11)      • For one year after the show's final episode airs, cast members are required to participate in all producer-determined press and forbidden from engaging in any media (radio, television, chat rooms, blogs) without the Producer's written permission. (9)      • The Producer holds the authorship and copyright to every photograph, email, website, sound or video recording, documented performance created in relation to the program, on every medium imaginable. (8)      • You're obligated to participate in a Reunion Special for up to five years after the show ends, you'll be paid 2500 for your involvement, and the Producer only has to give you 14 days notice. (50c)      • You're required to participate in book or home video projects for two years after the show ends, and you'll be paid 750.00 for each one. (50f)      Also, worth noting:      • While you're on the show, you're responsible for all long-distance phone charges. (16a)      • The explicit list of physical tasks you might be subjected to, enumerated in the contract, include traveling by \\"air (whether via helicopter, commercial airliner, glider, private aircraft or otherwise), train and/or automobile, as well as strenuous and/or dangerous and/or mental activity, including but not limited to, horseback riding, jogging, bicycling, motorcycling, exercise and/or weight equipment, skydiving, swimming, bungee jumping, parasailing snorkeling, jet skiing, amusement park activities, rock climbing, engaging in contact sports, hiking, kayaking and boating.\\" (1)      There's a lot more where that came from.

The Federal Reserve, however, continued to increase the money supply, resulting in stagflation and a rapidly declining value of the U.S. dollar in the 1970s.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the last year Boult taught at the Royal College of Music? ?  Boult, unlike many of his contemporaries, preferred the traditional orchestral layout, with first violins on the conductor's left and the seconds on the right. Of the practice of grouping all the violins together on the left, he wrote, \\"The new seating is, I admit, easier for the conductor and the second violins, but I firmly maintain that the second violins themselves sound far better on the right. ... When the new fashion reached us from America somewhere about 1908 it was adopted by some conductors, but Richter, Weingartner, Walter, Toscanini and many others kept what I feel is the right balance.\\"This care for balance was an important feature of Boult's music-making. Orchestral players across decades commented on his insistence that every important part should be heard without difficulty. His BBC principal violist wrote in 1938, \\"If a woodwind player has to complain that he has already been blowing 'fit to burst' there is trouble for somebody.\\" The trombonist Ray Premru wrote forty years later, \\"One of the old school, like Boult, is so refreshing because he will reduce the dynamic level – 'No, no, pianissimo, strings, let the soloist through, less from everyone else.' That is the old idea of balance.\\"As an educator, Boult influenced several generations of musicians, beginning with his conducting class at the Royal College of Music, London, which he ran from 1919 to 1930. As no such classes had been held before in Britain, Boult \\"created its curriculum from out of his own experience. ... From that first small class has come all the later formal training for conductors throughout Britain.\\" In the 1930s Boult ran a series of \\"conferences for conductors\\" at his country house near Guildford, sometimes helped by Vaughan Williams who lived a few miles away. From 1962 to 1966 he again taught at the Royal College of Music. In later life, he made time for young conductors who sought his counsel.  Among those who studied with or were influenced by Boult were Colin Davis, James Loughran, Richard Hickox and Vernon...

Please write a short summary for the following article: United Airlines will honour flight tickets mistakenly sold for 5 to 10 Customers rushed to book 10 United Airlines flights to destinations including Hawaii and Las Vegas. Photo: Toru Hanai/Reuters United Airlines will honour plane tickets it mistakenly sold online for between 5 and 10, the company said on Friday. Customers using the airline's website were able to book tickets without paying airline fares – just airport and security fees – for a brief time on Thursday due to a human error, United confirmed. The mistake saw some customers quickly book discount flights to high-desirability locations including Hawaii and Las Vegas. United rectified the problem on Thursday but said it would honour the sales. \\"We've reviewed the error that occurred yesterday and based on these specific circumstances, we will honor the tickets,\\" the company tweeted on Friday afternoon. United said it had accidentally filed some fares for 0, due to a human error. It did not reveal how many tickets were sold at erroneous prices. It shut down its website entirely on Thursday afternoon before reopening at around 2.45pm, according to reports. The discount flights were no longer available when the site came back online. Andy Farrimond, a software consultant from Washington DC, told CNN Money that he discovered the error as he booked a business trip to Minneapolis. Farrimond alerted a number of co-workers to his discovery, he said. His colleagues spent the next hour booking personal trips to the West Coast and Hawaii, CNN Monday reported. \\"It was pandemonium in the office for a while yesterday,\\" Farrimond said. He came away from the United website having booked trips with his wife to Honolulu, Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Jose. His co-workers had booked flights to Las Vegas and other popular vacation destinations. Bob Stokas, from Chicago, told NBC that he had stumbled across the cheap flights while searching for a round-trip ticket to LA next June. He had been expecting to pay up to 400 per ticket when he noticed the cheap fares. \\"When I scrolled down past the non-stop fares, when I got to the connecting flights, the flights to and from Los Angeles per person was 10,\\" Stokas told NBC. \\"That was a shock and a surprise, and I was like, 'I've got to book this flight right now before they rescind their offer of 10 for this flight.'\\" Stokas bought six tickets for 60. He said he returned to United's website to buy tickets for a trip to Roanoke, Virginia, this weekend, but found the website to be offline.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that created the Oviri ceramic? , can you please find it?   Gauguin was foremost a painter; he came to ceramics around 1886, when he was taught by the French sculptor and ceramist Ernest Chaplet. They had been introduced by Félix Bracquemond who, inspired by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at Vaugirard, where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles. Gauguin first visited Tahiti in 1891 and, attracted by the beauty of Tahitian women, undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived. He completed Oviri in the winter of 1894, during his return from Tahiti, and submitted it to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts 1895 salon opening in April the following year. There are two versions of what ensued: Charles Morice claimed in 1920 that Gauguin was \\"literally expelled\\" from the exhibition; in 1937 Ambroise Vollard wrote that the piece was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw his own works in protest. According to Bengt Danielsson, Gauguin was keen to increase his public exposure and availed of this opportunity by writing an outraged letter to Le Soir, bemoaning the state of modern ceramics.At the outset of 1897, Vollard addressed a letter to Gauguin about the possibility of casting his sculptures in bronze. Gauguin's response centred on Oviri: I believe that my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse (\\"The Murderess\\"), is an exceptional piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money. Art historian Christopher Gray mentions three...

Step 2: Consider the rabbit's perspective It's important to think about how the rabbit might have felt during this experience. Rabbits are often naturally timid and skittish animals, so being at a vet's office and having a human poking and examining them can be a stressful experience. Step 3: Evaluate the potential reasons for the rabbit's reaction In light of the rabbit's perspective, there are a few possible reasons why your rabbit tried to escape: a) Discomfort: The examination near the rabbit's rear end might have been uncomfortable for your pet, as it is a sensitive area. b) Fear: Your rabbit could have been scared as it was being held by a stranger (the vet) in an unfamiliar environment (the vet's office) and subjected to an unusual experience (poking and examination). c) Stress: The combined factors of being in an unfamiliar place and being handled by a stranger could have caused your rabbit to feel stressed, making it more likely to attempt to escape. Step 4: Determine the most probable reason Based on the information provided and considering the rabbit's perspective, it seems likely that your pet was trying to escape due to a combination of discomfort, fear, and stress.

Information:  - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.  - The Kentucky Supreme Court was created by a 1975 constitutional amendment and is the state supreme court of the U.S. state of Kentucky. Prior to that the Kentucky Court of Appeals was the only appellate court in Kentucky. The Kentucky Court of Appeals is now Kentucky's intermediate appellate court.  - The Kentucky House of Representatives is the lower house of the Kentucky General Assembly. It is composed of 100 Representatives elected from single-member districts throughout the Commonwealth. Not more than two counties can be joined to form a House district, except when necessary to preserve the principle of equal representation. Representatives are elected to two-year terms with no term limits. The Kentucky House of Representatives convenes at the State Capitol in Frankfort.  - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east.  - The Kentucky General Assembly, also called the Kentucky Legislature, is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Kentucky.  - An appellate court, commonly called an appeals court, court of appeals (American English), appeal court (British English), court of second instance or second instance court, is any court of law that is empowered to hear an appeal of a trial court or other lower tribunal. In most jurisdictions, the court system is divided into at least three levels: the trial court, which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case; at least one intermediate appellate court; and a supreme court (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts. A jurisdiction's supreme court is that jurisdiction's highest appellate court. Appellate courts nationwide can operate by varying rules.  - Kentucky, officially the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a state located in the east south-central region of the United States. Kentucky is one of four U.S. states constituted as a commonwealth (the others being Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts).

In 1810 , he was appointed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals , where he served for two years before resigning to pursue a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives . He served two terms in that body , resigning in 1816 . Clark accepted an appointment to the circuit court of Bourbon and Clark counties in 1817 . It was in this capacity that the most defining event of his career occurred . In 1822 , he struck down a debt relief law in the case of Williams v. Blair on the basis that it impeded the obligation of contracts . His decision was unpopular with the legislature , who condemned the ruling and summoned Clark to appear before them and defend it . An attempt by the legislature to remove him from office fell short of the needed two - thirds majority . The following year , the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark 's ruling . In retaliation , the legislature attempted to abolish the court and create a new one more sympathetic to their views . This event and its aftermath became known as the Old Court - New Court controversy . In 1825 , Clark was chosen to fill the congressional seat vacated by Henry Clay 's elevation to Secretary of State . He served until 1831 , but did not seek re-election that year .

It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the \\"Krautrock\\" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s.  - \\"Phantom Minds\\" is the 21st single by Japanese singer and voice actress Nana Mizuki, released on January 13, 2010, by King Records.

With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States.

It was released on December 6, 2000 by King Records.  - Pop rock is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music.  - , also known by the abbreviations and SAS, is a Japanese rock band that first formed in 1974.  - The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California in 1961.

They emerged at the vanguard of the \\"California Sound\\", initially performing original surf songs that gained international popularity for their distinct vocal harmonies and lyrics reflecting a southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. Rooted in jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and doo-wop, Brian led the band in devising novel approaches to music production, arranging his compositions for studio orchestras, and experimenting with several genres ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic and baroque styles.  - J-pop (often stylized as J-POP; \\"jeipoppu\\"; an abbreviation for Japanese pop), natively also known simply as pops, is a musical genre that entered the musical mainstream of Japan in the 1990s. Modern J-pop has its roots in traditional Japanese music, but significantly in 1960s pop and rock music, such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys, which led to Japanese rock bands such as Happy End fusing rock with Japanese music in the early 1970s. J-pop was further defined by new wave groups in the late 1970s, particularly electronic synthpop band Yellow Magic Orchestra and pop rock band Southern All Stars.  - Traditional Japanese music is the folk or traditional music of Japan.

On 17 May 1977 the Likud, headed by Begin, won the Knesset elections by a landslide, becoming the biggest party in the Knesset. Popularly known as the Mahapakh (\\"upheaval\\"), the election results had seismic ramifications as for the first time in Israeli history a party other than the Alignment/Mapai was in a position to form a government, effectively ending the left's hitherto unrivalled domination over Israeli politics. Likud's electoral victory signified a fundamental restructuring of Israeli society in which the founding socialist Ashkenazi elite was being replaced by a coalition representing marginalized Mizrahi and Jewish-religious communities, promoting a socially conservative and economically liberal agenda.  The Likud campaign leading up to the election centered on Begin's personality. Demonized by the Alignment as totalitarian and extremist, his self-portrayal as a humble and pious leader struck a chord with many who felt abandoned by the ruling party's ideology. In the predominantly Jewish Mizrahi working class urban neighborhoods and peripheral towns, the Likud won overwhelming majorities, while disillusionment with the Alignment's corruption prompted many middle and upper class voters to support the newly founded centrist Democratic Movement for Change (\\"Dash\\") headed by Yigael Yadin. Dash won 15 seats out of 120, largely at the expense of the Alignment, which was led by Shimon Peres and had shrunk from 51 to 32 seats. Well aware of his momentous achievement and employing his trademark sense for drama, when speaking that night in the Likud headquarters Begin quoted from the Gettysburg Address and the Torah, referring to his victory as a 'turning point in the history of the Jewish people'.  With 43 seats, the Likud still required the support of other parties in order to reach a parliamentary majority that would enable it to form a government under Israel's proportionate representation parliamentary system. Though able to form a narrow coalition with smaller Jewish religious and ultra-orthodox parties, Begin also sought support from centrist elements in the Knesset to provide his government with greater public legitimacy. He controversially offered the foreign affairs portfolio to Moshe Dayan, a former IDF Chief of Staff and Defense Minister, and a prominent Alignment politician identified with the old establishment. Begin was sworn in as Prime Minister of Israel on 20 June 1977. Dash eventually joined his government several months later, thus providing it with the broad support of almost two thirds of the Knesset. While Prime Minister, Yehuda Avner served as Begin's speech writer.","output":"This text is about Menachem Begin, who was an Israeli politician, founder of Likud, and the sixth Prime Minister of Israel."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a news article: China is building massive databases of Americans’ personal information by hacking government agencies and U.S. health-care companies, using a high-tech tactic to achieve an age-old goal of espionage: recruiting spies or gaining more information on an adversary, U.S. officials and analysts say.      Groups of hackers working for the Chinese government have compromised the networks of the Office of Personnel Management, which holds data on millions of current and former federal employees, as well as the health insurance giant Anthem, among other targets, the officials and researchers said.      “They’re definitely going after quite a bit of personnel information,” said Rich Barger, chief intelligence officer of ThreatConnect, a Northern Virginia cybersecurity firm. “We suspect they’re using it to understand more about who to target [for espionage], whether electronically or via human ­recruitment.”      [How the Internet became so vulnerable]      The targeting of large-scale data­bases is a relatively new tactic and is used by the Chinese government to further its ­intelligence-gathering, the officials and analysts say. It is government espionage, not commercial espionage, they say.      China hacked into the federal government’s network, compromising four million current and former employees' information. The Post's Ellen Nakashima talks about what kind of national security risk this poses and why China wants this information. (Alice Li/The Washington Post)      “This is part of their strategic goal — to increase their intelligence collection via big-data theft and big-data aggregation,” said a U.S. government official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic. “It’s part of a strategic plan.”      One hack of OPM, which was disclosed by the government Thursday, dates at least to December, officials said. Earlier last year, OPM discovered a separate intrusion into a highly sensitive database that contains information on employees seeking or renewing security clearances and on their background investigations.      Once harvested, the data can be used to glean details about key government personnel and potential spy recruits, or to gain information useful for counter­intelligence. Records in OPM’s database of background investigations, for instance, could contain a complete history of where an individual has lived and all of his or her foreign contacts in, say, China. “So now the Chinese counterintelligence authorities know which American officials are meeting with which Chinese,” a China cyber and intelligence expert said.      The data could help Chinese analysts do more effective targeting of individuals, said a former National Security Agency official. “They can find specific individuals they want to go after, family members,” he said.      The trend has emerged and accelerated over the past 12 to 18 months, the official said. An increase in Chinese capability has opened the way “for bigger data storage, for bigger data theft,” he said. “And when you can gain it in bulk, you take it in bulk.”      The Chinese government, he said, is making use of Chinese companies that specialize in aggregating large sets of data “to help them in sifting through” the information for useful details. “The analogy would be one of our intelligence organizations using Google, Yahoo, Accenture to aggregate data that we collected.”      China on Friday dismissed the allegation of hacking as “irresponsible and unscientific.”      Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Beijing wanted to cooperate with other nations to build a peaceful and secure cyberspace.      “We wish the United States would not be full of suspicions, catching wind and shadows, but rather have a larger measure of trust and cooperation,” he told a regular news briefing,      OPM disclosed that the latest hack of one of its systems exposed personal data of up to 4 million current and former employees — the largest hack of federal employee data in recent years.      It is possible that officials as senior as Cabinet secretaries had their data exposed, a congressional aide said on a briefing call with government officials Friday.      U.S. officials privately said China was behind it. The stolen information included Social Security numbers and performance evaluations.      [What to do if you are a federal worker]      “This is an intelligence operation designed to help the Chinese government,” the China expert said. “It’s a new phase in an evolution of what they’re doing. It certainly requires greater sophistication on their part in terms of being able to take out this much data.”      Barger’s firm has turned up technical evidence that the same Chinese group is behind the hacks of Premera Blue Cross and Empire BlueCross, which were discovered at roughly the same time earlier this year.      The first OPM incident has been linked to the health-care hacks by Barger and another security researcher, John Hultquist, senior manager for cyberespionage threat intelligence at iSight Partners. Hultquist said the same group is responsible for all of them, and for other intrusions into commercial databases containing large sets of Americans’ personal information.      “They would leverage this data to get to diplomatic, political, military and economic intelligence that they typically target,” said Hultquist, who declined to comment on who was behind the attacks.      Though much Chinese cyber­espionage is attributed to the People’s Liberation Army, these hacks, Barger said, appeared to be linked to the Ministry of State Security, which is a spy agency responsible for foreign espionage and domestic counterintelligence.      Other Chinese entities, including the military, may also be involved in the campaign, analysts said.      Chinese government hackers “are like a vacuum cleaner” in sucking up information electronically, said Robert “Bear” Bryant, a former top counterespionage official in the government. “They’re becoming much more sophisticated in tying it all together. And they’re trying to harm us.”      [Why the Internet’s massive flaws never get fixed]      Security researchers have pointed to a cyber tool or family of malicious software called Derusbi that has been linked exclusively to Chinese actors. One group that has used Derusbi is Deep Panda, a name coined by the firm CrowdStrike, which has linked that group to the Anthem hack.      Disclosed in February, that incident exposed the Social Security numbers, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses and member IDs of tens of millions of customers. No medical data such as diagnosis or treatment information was compromised, the company said.      Researchers note that in contrast to the hacks of Home Depot and Target, personal data that might have been stolen from OPM, Anthem and the other companies has not shown up on the black market, where it can be sold to identity thieves. That is another sign, they said, that the intrusions are not being made for commercial purposes.      “Usually if there’s a criminally or financially motivated breach like that, we see the data making its way into the black market soon after that,” Barger said.      The big-data approach being taken by the Chinese might seem to mirror techniques used abroad by the NSA, which has come under scrutiny for its data-gathering practices under executive authority. But in China, the authorities do not tolerate public debate over the proper limits of large-scale spying in the digital age.      “This is what all intelligence services do if they’re good,” said the China cyber expert. “If you want to find a needle, first you have to gather a haystack of needles.”      The massive data harvesting “reflects a maturity in Chinese” electronic intelligence gathering, the expert said. “You have to put in place structured data repositories. You have to have big-data management tools to be able to store and sift and analyze.”      Barger said that “with a large pool of data, they can prioritize who is the best to target electronically and who is the best to target via human recruitment.”      The U.S. official noted that the Chinese “would not take [the data] if they did not have the opportunity to aggregate it.” And, he added, “they are taking it.”      Simon Denyer in Beijing contributed to this report. ||||| The U.S. suspects that Chinese hackers stole the personal records of four million people, the latest in a series of cyberspying accusations the two countries have lobbed at each other.

WASHINGTON—Government officials were scrambling Friday to gauge the extent of information gained in a suspected hacking of millions of government workers’ personnel files, including whether sensitive security data was compromised.      “I don’t think we can tell you with a whole lot of detail precisely what was taken,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, adding the breach may have resulted in a “substantial amount’’ of data stolen from government computers.      ... ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"China has been building massive databases of Americans’ personal information by hacking government agencies and US healthcare companies as a high-tech tactic to achieve espionage goals, according to US officials and analysts.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Etty had planned for a burial in York Minster, but neglected to cover the necessary costs in his will. With Yorkshire local government in political and financial chaos in the wake of the bankruptcy of George Hudson, there was no political will to organise a public subscription or to waive the fees, and as a consequence Etty was buried in the churchyard of St Olave's Church, his local parish church. On 6 May 1850 the contents of his studio were auctioned, in a total of 1034 lots including around 900 paintings; some of these paintings were incomplete studies later completed by other artists to increase their value. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, his works fetching huge sums on resale. He continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some, with Charles Robert Leslie observing in 1850 \\"It cannot be doubted that the voluptuous treatment of his subjects, in very many instances, recommended them more powerfully than their admirable art; while we may fully believe that he himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\".Six months after William's death, Betsy Etty married chemist Stephen Binnington, a distant relation of the Etty family. She moved into his house in Haymarket, and some time after his death moved to 40 Edwardes Square, where she died in 1888 at the age of 87. While Etty did have admirers, the patchy quality of his later work meant that he never acquired the circle of imitators and students that could have led to him being seen as the founder of the English realist movement, now considered to have begun in 1848 with the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais, two of the three founders of the Pre-Raphaelites, were heavily influenced by Etty's early works but recoiled from his later style. Holman Hunt recollected that \\"in my youth [Etty] had lost the robustness he once had [...] the paintings of his advanced age cloyed the taste by their...

Gluing leather to the cover inserts","output":"To glue leather to cover inserts, follow these step-by-step instructions: 1. Gather the materials: First, you'll need to have all the necessary materials. This includes the leather, cover inserts (such as cardboard or other material), glue specifically designed for leather (e.g. contact cement or leather glue), a brush, scissors, a ruler, a pen or pencil, and a clean cloth. 2. Measure and cut the leather: Measure the size of your cover inserts and add an extra margin for the edges – typically around 1/2 to 1 inch. Mark these dimensions on the backside of the leather using a pen or pencil, and then cut the leather to size using the scissors. 3. Prepare the surfaces: Clean both the leather and the cover insert surfaces to ensure they are free from dust or debris. Wipe down the surfaces with a clean cloth, if needed, to remove any lingering contaminants. 4. Apply the glue: Using a brush, apply a thin, even layer of glue on both the leather and the cover insert. Be sure to cover the entire surfaces, including the edges. When using contact cement, allow each surface to dry until the glue becomes tacky, but not wet – this usually takes around 15 minutes. For other types of leather glue, read and follow the manufacturer's instructions for application and drying time. 5. Position the leather: Carefully align the leather piece with the cover insert, ensuring that the edges match up and taking into consideration any extra margin needed for folding or trimming. Starting from the center and working outwards, press the leather onto the cover insert firmly, so the adhesive bonds to both surfaces. 6. Secure the edges: To create a professional finish, fold and glue the edges of the leather to the backside of the cover insert. Apply additional glue if needed to ensure a secure bond. Use a clean cloth or your fingers to press the leather down, ensuring a tight fit and removing any air bubbles. 7. Let it dry: Allow the glued surfaces to dry thoroughly. Depending on the type of glue used, this may take between 1 to 24 hours. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for optimal drying time. 8. Clean up: Once the glue is completely dry, clean up any excess glue or residue with a damp cloth. Be cautious not to get the leather too wet, as this could damage the finish. 9. Inspect and finish: Check your work for any imperfections, such as air bubbles or uneven edges. If needed, you can carefully trim the edges of the leather with a sharp knife to achieve a clean, professional look. By following these steps, you should be able to successfully glue leather to the cover inserts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read this article and answer this question Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan , was an Irish Jacobite and soldier, belonging to an Anglo-Norman family long settled in Ireland. Sarsfield gained his first military experience serving with an Anglo-Irish contingent of the French Army during the 1670s. When James II came to the throne he was commissioned in the English Army, and served during the suppression of Monmouth's Rebellion in 1685. During the Glorious Revolution of 1688 he remained loyal to James and led an English cavalry detachment at the Battle of Wincanton, the only military engagement of the campaign. In 1689 Sarsfield accompanied James to Ireland and served in the Jacobite Irish Army. After an early setback at Sligo, he became one of the celebrated Jacobite leaders of the war, noted in particular for Sarsfield's Raid shortly before the Siege of Limerick in 1690. James rewarded him by making him an Earl in the Peerage of Ireland. After the war's end following a second siege of Limerick in 1691, he led the Flight of the Wild Geese which took thousands of Irish soldiers into exile in France where they continued to serve James. After a planned invasion of England had to be abandoned following a French naval defeat in 1692, Lord Lucan  served in Flanders and was killed at the Battle of Landen in 1693. What title was Patrick Sarsfield given?","output":"Patrick Sarsfield was given the title \\"1st Earl of Lucan.\\" This means he was the first person in his family to have that important title.

She took her professional pseudonym from Billie Dove, an actress she admired, and the musician Clarence Holiday, her probable father. At the outset of her career, she spelled her last name \\"Halliday\\", the birth surname of her father, but eventually changed it to \\"Holiday\\", his performing name. The young singer teamed up with a neighbor, the tenor saxophone player Kenneth Hollan. From 1929 to 1931, they were a team, performing at clubs such as the Grey Dawn, Pod's and Jerry's on 133rd Street, and the Brooklyn Elks' Club. Benny Goodman recalled hearing Holiday in 1931 at the Bright Spot. As her reputation grew, she played in many clubs, including Mexico's and the Alhambra Bar and Grill, where she met Charles Linton, a vocalist who later worked with Chick Webb. It was also during this period that she connected with her father, who was playing in Fletcher Henderson's band.  Late in 1932, at the age of 17, Holiday replaced the singer Monette Moore at Covan's, a club on West 132nd Street. The producer John Hammond, who loved Moore's singing and had come to hear her, first heard Holiday there in early 1933. Hammond arranged for Holiday to make her recording debut, at age 18, in November 1933, with Benny Goodman. She recorded two songs: \\"Your Mother's Son-in-Law\\" and \\"Riffin' the Scotch\\", the latter being her first hit. \\"Son-in-Law\\" sold 300 copies, but \\"Riffin' the Scotch\\", released on November 11, sold 5,000 copies. Hammond was impressed by Holiday's singing style and said of her, \\"Her singing almost changed my music tastes and my musical life, because she was the first girl singer I'd come across who actually sang like an improvising jazz genius.\\" Hammond compared Holiday favorably to Armstrong and said she had a good sense of lyric content at her young age.  In 1935, Holiday had a small role as a woman abused by her lover in Duke Ellington's short Symphony in Black: A Rhapsody of Negro Life. In her scene, she sang \\"Saddest Tale\\".

Math problem: Solve 9*s = 8*s + 5 for s. What is the solution?","output":"To solve the given equation 9*s = 8*s + 5 for s, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the variable (s) on one side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 8*s from both sides of the equation to eliminate s from the right side. 9*s - 8*s = 8*s - 8*s + 5 Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation. On the left side, we have: (9 - 8)*s = 1*s On the right side, we have: 0 + 5 = 5 Now the equation becomes: 1*s = 5 Step 3: Solve for the variable (s). As we have 1*s on the left side, this means that the equation is already isolated, and we can find the value of s directly. 1*s = 5 To find the value of s, we will divide both sides of the equation by 1. s = 5 / 1 This simplifies to: s = 5 So, the solution to the equation 9*s = 8*s + 5 is s = 5."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The coal mine is operated by a group of dedicated miners under the supervision of five exceptionally devoted supervisors.  One fateful night, the town decides to throw a lively dance party, a long-held tradition of the townspeople to celebrate the onset of spring. As the people in town prepare for the festivities, miners continue working on a regular shift, unaware of the true extent of the revelry that awaits them above ground.  The anticipation and excitement of the dance are contagious, and the coal mine supervisors find themselves grappling with their responsibility to the miners and their desire to partake in the celebration. As they initially try to maintain a balance, they eventually succumb to the enticing atmosphere and leave the mine in the hands of the Miners' Captain, a highly respected member of the workforce. With the supervisors away, one by one, the miners begin to hear the distant music and laughter from the party and decide to join the celebration while the Miners' Captain continues to work. The night is filled with alcohol, merriment, and, surprisingly, heartfelt connections - as townspeople mingle with the miners, building friendships and even sparking romances. However, the night takes a tragic turn when a dangerous explosion occurs in the coal mine. With only the Miners' Captain remaining in the mine, the town's tension reaches a breaking point, and the real question begins to emerge: how many supervisors had abandoned their duties, leaving the miners and the Captain in the hands of danger? As the story unravels, the truth gradually surfaces, unveiling how the disaster unfolded - from negligent supervisors to the miners' choices of disregarding safety precautions. As relationships develop and fractures occur among the town's people, the movie ultimately delves deep into themes of responsibility, loyalty, and the complex minefield of human desires. In the end, the town mourns the loss of their beloved Miners’ Captain while reflecting upon their values and priorities. The tragedy forces everyone to confront the power of choices and consequences, leaving the surviving supervisors to grapple with their guilt and remorse over prioritizing the dance over their duties in the mine. The Unseen Dance explores the intricate interplay between responsibility, temptation, and the consequences of the choices we make – all while shedding light on the importance of balancing work, community, and our personal desires."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After Keith Barker's breakthrough at 76-2, Ireland and England international Rankin then took three wickets in 24 balls to leave Notts on 125-6. The whole of the evening session was lost when the rain arrived at tea. Notts' only bright spot was opener Jake Libby, who lasted over three hours for a determinedly gritty 59. Both teams made one change from their last Championship match, in the pace bowling department. The Bears brought in Mark Adair for only his second Championship game in place of Oliver Hannon-Dalby, while Nottinghamshire's Luke Fletcher replaced Harry Gurney (bruised heel). After choosing to bat, Notts moved slowly in the morning session as the ball swung in humid conditions, and reached 71-2 at lunch from 32 overs. The impressively economical Rikki Clarke broke through in the ninth over when he hit Steve Mullaney's off-stump before Michael Lumb, having made just 10 in 62 minutes, misread spinner Jeetan Patel's arm-ball to be trapped lbw. After facing 117 balls to bat through the session for 37, Libby speeded up a little after lunch. But, after Brendan Taylor lofted a catch to long leg, Riki Wessels edged a brute of a ball from Rankin to wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose. Then, after seeing Samit Patel also get caught behind, Libby, who started this season on loan with Northamptonshire, became the third player to be caught by Ambrose off the bowling of Rankin. It earned the Irishman impressive figures of 3-25 from his 14 overs. Warwickshire fast bowler Boyd Rankin told BBC WM: \\"I'm pleased with how I bowled. I've been feeling pretty good in the last few weeks. I bowled pretty well against Lancashire but just didn't get wickets. \\"We kept them to two runs per over pretty much all the whole time. All the guys bowled well but it was just my day to take a few wickets. \\"The pitch is quite slow and it's not really doing much off the deck. It is a little bit tacky but hopefully it will flatten out a bit for when we come to bat.\\" Notts head coach Mick Newell told BBC Radio Nottingham: \\"I thought there'd be a bit more pace in the pitch. It was quite difficult to score off the medium quick bowlers, then Boyd Rankin stepped it up a little bit. \\"He was quicker than everybody else. He bowled a very good spell in the middle of the afternoon which put under some serious pressure. \\"Jake Libby batted very well. He started very well for Northants.

Sefton (William Holden) is a POW who has profitably wagered with his fellow American prisoners that these escapes would fail.The POWs fear there may be an informer in their midst, but who is it? As it becomes clearer and clearer to his fellow inmates that Sefton has considerable contact with his German captors, his fellow POWs mistakenly conclude that he is the informer and they turn on him, including physically beating him and helping themselves to some of his belongings.Sefton understands in full that to clear his name, he must determine the identity of the real informer, and he is, eventually, able to work out that Price (Peter Graves), whose English is impeccable, is a German informant masquerading as an American POW. Written messages, Sefton discovers, are being smuggled by Price to the Germans through a hollow chess piece on the chessboard in the barracks, wth phony air raid drills staged to enable the Germans to retrieve these messages undetected.Now realizing that Price has figured prominently in the death of the Americans that have attempted escape, Sefton plots revenge, and, after exposing Price's true identity to his fellow POWs, he maneuvers to force Price to make an unauthorized exit from the barracks. To the guards manning the tower, Price's exit looks like an American escape attempt, and they shoot him, much to the dismay of Stalag Commandant Von Scherbach (Otto Preminger).The diversion created by the shooting incident gives Sefton a chance to escape, and he takes with him a brave lieutenant (Don Taylor) who has recently been captured.

And I was wondering What will happen to Jordan? A:","output":"Based on the given information, it is not possible to predict the exact outcome of the situation for Jordan. However, given that Robin has expressed interest in Jordan and asked him out on a date, there are a few possible scenarios that may take place: 1. Jordan accepts Robin's date invitation: If Jordan is also interested in Robin, he might agree to go out on the date. In this case, both individuals would have the opportunity to get to know each other better and explore their potential for a romantic relationship. This could lead to the development of a strong connection or, alternatively, they might discover that they are better suited as friends. 2. Jordan declines Robin's date invitation: In the event that Jordan is not interested in Robin or is currently involved in a relationship, he could decline the invitation. This could potentially result in disappointment for Robin, but ultimately, it is necessary for both parties to respect each other's feelings and boundaries. 3. Jordan is undecided: If Jordan is unsure about his feelings or is hesitant about pursuing a relationship, he might need some time to think about Robin's proposal.

Short movie review: sixties-style slickness  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Based on the given short movie review, it's not entirely clear whether the critic is thinking positively or negatively about the movie. The term \\"sixties-style slickness\\" can be interpreted in a couple of ways. However, before diving into the interpretations, let's look at the context behind the phrase. The sixties were a period known for radical change in terms of politics, culture, and fashion. This era brought about vibrant patterns, bold colors, and innovative designs, all of which contributed to the term \\"sixties-style.\\" \\"Slickness,\\" on the other hand, generally implies a sense of smoothness or polish. It can either be impressive and sophisticated or superficial and contrived, depending on the connotation. Now, considering the phrase \\"sixties-style slickness\\" in a movie review, it could be perceived in either a positive or negative light based on the critic's intent. Interpretation I, negative: In a negative context, the critic may be implying that the movie's style, visual appeal, or atmosphere is overly polished and superficial, perhaps even to the point of becoming cliché or outdated. In this case, the critic could be viewing the movie as trying too hard to tap into the nostalgia of the sixties without genuine depth or substance, thus resulting in an underwhelming cinematic experience. Interpretation II, positive: Conversely, the critic may be praising the movie for successfully capturing the distinctive charm and visual panache of the sixties era. This would mean that the \\"slickness\\" perceived in the film refers to a well-crafted, polished, and visually engaging production. Through this lens, the critic could be admiring the movie's ability to evoke a nostalgic feel while still presenting a dynamic and compelling narrative. In conclusion, it is difficult to assert with certainty whether the critic is thinking positively or negatively of the movie just by the phrase \\"sixties-style slickness.\\" However, by considering both possible interpretations and understanding the context behind the term, we can infer that the critic might be expressing either dissatisfaction with the movie's superficiality or admiration for its well-crafted visual style. Further context, such as a longer review or more information about the critic's usual preferences, would be necessary to accurately determine their stance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Keeping your arms extended in front, pushing your hips back, and bending your knees to a 90 degree angle is essential for correct squat and lunge form. a. Stretching the bottom of feet with the heel flat on the floor while rotating forward doesn't seem related to squats or lunges.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Bears traveled to the newly opened University of Phoenix Stadium to play the Arizona Cardinals, their former cross-town rivals. While many expected the game a lop-sided affair in favor of the 5-0 Bears, the Cardinals led the Bears before stumbling in the game's last quarter. The game marked the Bears' first Monday Night Football appearance since the 2003 NFL season, and second overall prime-time appearance of the season. The game started on an auspicious note for the Cardinals, as Rex Grossman faced a quick three and out after failing to connect to Bernard Berrian on a deep pass. The Cardinals responded offensively when rookie quarterback Matt Leinart threw two touchdowns in the first quarter. As Neil Rackers helped bolster the Cardinals lead with a set of field goals, Grossman continued to struggle and committed four turnovers in the first half alone. By half time, the Cardinals were leading the Bears by a score of 20-0, which was the largest deficit they had faced all season at that point. The Bears finally got on the score board in the third quarter when Robbie Gould kicked a 23-yard field goal. However, Rackers responded again to boost the Cardinals lead back to twenty points. By the game's third quarter, many had assumed the Cardinals had grasped their second win of the season, and the undefeated Bears would be forced to face defeat. However, in the dying minutes of the third quarter, the Bears' defense made a series of staunch defensive plays that allowed them to rally back. First, rookie defensive end Mark Anderson sacked Leinart, causing him to fumble. The loose ball was picked up by Mike Brown, who returned it for a 3-yard touchdown. Later, Brian Urlacher stripped the ball from running back Edgerrin James, and Charles Tillman recovered the football and returned it for another touchdown. The Bears, now only trailing by six points, took the lead when rookie punt returner Devin Hester returned a punt for an 83-yard touchdown. The Cardinals had one final attempt to win the game, but Rackers missed a 40-yard field goal attempt, allowing the Bears to kneel the clock out.

China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.  - Asia Television (also known as ATV, stylised \\"aTV\\" since 8 October 2007) was a television broadcasting company based in Hong Kong. Established as the first television service in Hong Kong as Rediffusion Television() on 29 May 1957, it shifted to terrestrial television on 30 November 1973, and was renamed Asia Television on 24 September 1982. ATV operated two main over-the-air channels: the Cantonese-language ATV Home, and ATV World.    What entity does 'tvbs' has the relation 'instance of' with? A:","output":"'TVBS' is an 'instance of' a Satellite television channel and nationwide cable TV network. It is a specific example, or instance, of a broader category which includes other television broadcasters that provide their content via satellite or cable TV networks. TVBS is notable for being established by TVBI Company Limited, a subsidiary of Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) in Hong Kong, and ERA Group of Taiwan, and for becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of TVB of Hong Kong in early 2005. TVBS has been operational since September 28, 1993 and is an important part of Taiwan's media landscape. This media entity, like other terrestrial and digital broadcasting networks, operates by transmitting its broadcasting signal across a large geographic coverage, thanks to the technology of satellite transmission and cable distribution.  Moreover, a satellite television channel and nationwide cable TV network like TVBS operates around the concept of broadcasting television programs that are relayed from a communications satellite orbiting the Earth directly to the viewer's location. Meanwhile, the concept of a cable TV network involves the distribution of content via coaxial or fiber-optic cables. TVBS, therefore, demonstrates the characteristics of these concepts, making it an instance of the said category. Hence, TVBS is a significant expression of the continued innovation and evolution of television broadcasting, signifying the transition from traditional terrestrial broadcasting to more efficient and expansive relay methods."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

It’s a leaflet. Stop trying to trick us! The newspaper-leaflet has become a common electoral trope of late. In fact, during last year’s council elections, Conservatives in Haringey adopted a rather recognisable design for theirs. We get it. We really do.

Article: A new study has found that it may be possible to train people to be more intelligent, increasing the brainpower they had at birth. Until now,it has been widely assumed that the kind of mental ability that allows us to solve new problems without having any relevant previous experience--what psychologists call fluid intelligence--is innate and cannot be taught(though people can raise their grades on tests of it by practicing). But in the new study,researchers describe a method for improving this skill,along with experiments to prove it works. The key, researchers found, was carefully structured training in working memory--the kind that allows memorization of a telephone number just long enough to dial it.This type of memory is closely related to fluid intelligence,so the researchers reasoned that improving it might lead to improvements in fluid intelligence. First they measured fluid intelligence of volunteers using standard tests.Then they trained each in a complicated memory task--the child's card game,in which they had to recall a card they saw and heard.During the course, they needed to ignore irrelevant items, monitor ongoing performance,manage two tasks at the same time and connect related items to one another in space and time. The four groups experienced a half-hour of training daily for 8, 12, 17 and 19 days, respectively.To make sure they were not just improving their test-taking skills,the researchers compared them with control groups that took the tests without the training. The results, published Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,were striking.Improvement in the trained groups was a lot greater.Moreover,the longer they trained, the higher their scores were.All performers,from the weakest to the strongest,showed significant improvement. \\"Our results show you can increase your intelligence with proper training.\\" said Dr Jaeggi, a co-author of the paper.\\"No one knows how long the gains will last after training stops,\\" he added, \\"and the experiment's design did not allow the...

We are given the equation: -28687*k - 56 = -28680*k Our goal is to find the value of k. To do this, we'll follow these steps: 1. Add 28680*k to each side of the equation: -28687*k + 28680*k - 56 = -28680*k + 28680*k This simplifies to: -7*k - 56 = 0 2. Add 56 to each side of the equation to isolate the term with k: -7*k - 56 + 56 = 0 + 56 This simplifies to: -7*k = 56 3.

In order to better understand this, let's delve deeper into the context and historical background that surround Khedive Ismael and his intentions. Khedive Ismael, who ruled Egypt between 1863 and 1879, was an ambitious leader with a vision to modernize Egypt and bring it up to par with the advancements happening in Western Europe. He had a grand vision for Egypt's infrastructure, economy, and culture and pursued a policy of modernization and reform during his reign. Ismael's plans included the expansion of railways, telegraph lines, irrigation projects, the construction of the Suez Canal, and the modernization of Egypt's educational system. These projects were seen as a way to transform Egypt into a global power and elevate the living conditions of its people. To finance these ambitious projects, Ismael sought external funding from European powers, primarily Britain and France. Initially, these powers were more than willing to support Ismael's vision, seeing the potential for their own financial gains and political influence in the region. However, over the course of his reign, Ismael found himself stuck in a financial quagmire, largely due to soaring debts, cost overruns, and mismanagement of funds. As Egypt's debt situation worsened and the risk of financial collapse loomed, the European powers that once readily supported Ismael's vision grew increasingly concerned. They insisted that in order to continue financing these grand projects and avoid defaulting on their loans, it was necessary for them to take direct control of key Egyptian institutions and bring in their advisors to oversee financial and administrative matters. This demand eventually culminated in the Dual Control Agreement of 1876, which put Egypt's finances under the joint control of Britain and France, with their representatives overseeing the revenues. This move was seen as an infringement on Egyptian sovereignty and greatly diminished Khedive Ismael's authority. The British and French advisors primarily focused on ensuring Egypt's financial stability and the repayment of debts, which meant that some of Ismael's grand plans were either scaled back or abandoned altogether. In conclusion, based on the given premise, it is clear that Khedive Ismael had ambitious plans and a vision for Egypt's modernization and overall development. However, his reliance on foreign financing and the financial crisis that ensued eventually led to the European powers taking control of key Egyptian institutions, limiting his ability to fully realize his grand plans and vision for Egypt."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Civil rights violations, personal injury, discrimination on national origin, retaliation, harassment, fraud, attempted murder, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and conspiracy to defraud. 2,000 decillion (2,000,000,000,      000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000). Pro Se      Although, surprisingly, the complaint appears to be frivolous, Mr. Purisima does seem to have gotten his math right, although he could have simplified the demand a little. According to this very helpful big-number page, a “decillion” in American usage means a 1 followed by 33 zeroes. “2,000 decillion” therefore could of course be written as a 2 followed by 36 zeroes, which is in fact what Anton has in parentheses. So good work there.      But it turns out that a 1 followed by 36 zeroes is an “undecillion.” (This is a little embarrassing, since I’ve been going around using that term to refer to any number that is not a decillion, but I guess that was causing a lot of confusion anyway.) So he could have just demanded “two undecillion dollars,” and (after a little research) everybody would still have known what he was talking about. Sure, it would be more fun to call it “two octillion gigadollars,” but that’s getting a little ridiculous.      Okay, it’s a lot more fun to call it “two octillion gigadollars,” as confirmed by an ongoing experiment in which I say that out loud in my office and then laugh at it.      Not that it matters, because these demands have long since outstripped the total amount of money in the world. That was already the case back in 2008, when we were only talking about quadrillions. See “Katrina Victim Sues for Three Quadrillion Dollars,” Lowering the Bar (Jan. 12, 2008). At that time, I calculated that the plaintiff was essentially demanding the entire U.S. gross domestic product for the next 228 years (give or take), and that if he were paid in pennies (as he should have been) it would take 301 stacks of pennies, each stack high enough to reach Saturn, to satisfy the judgment.      Less than two years later, Dalton Chiscolm decided it would take a lot more than that to send a message to Bank of America, which he sued for 1.784 septillion dollars (a.k.a. 1,784 billion trillion dollars, I think). “If he thinks Bank of America has branches on every planet in the cosmos,” Reuters then quoted a math professor as saying, “then it might start to make some sense.”      That remained the record-holder despite John-Theodore: Anderson’s (stupid punctuation in original) effort in this 2010 case, in which he started out demanding a relatively restrained 918 billion for breach of contract but then got mad and amended his complaint to make it 38 quadrillion. That still only put him in second place, though.      All of them have now been eclipsed by Anton, of course, who is also seeking punitive damages, I guess in case an undecillion-dollar judgment is not enough to send a message to the various defendants. Exactly what each of them did is not entirely clear, although the plaintiff claims a dog bit him on the middle finger and that he’s routinely overcharged for coffee at LaGuardia Airport, among other things. (Also, some Chinese people took his picture without permission.)      The complaint does allege that the defendants’ acts caused damages that “cannot be repaired by money” and are “therefore priceless.” Granted, no amount of money can truly compensate a plaintiff for what he or she has lost, but two octillion gigadollars would be a pretty good start. ||||| We've encountered plenty of lawsuits about nothing and lawsuits that might as well have been about nothing, but a lawsuit filed this week by a Manhattan man may take the cake for greatest lawsuit about nothing. Anton Purisima is suing NYC, Au Bon Pain, Hoboken University, LaGuardia Airport, the MTA, and (literally) thousands more people for 2,000 decillion, which up until today, we thought was only used as a joke amount. And it's apparently over a dog bite.      Lowering The Bar has an excerpt from the suit (note: the \\"Does 1-1000\\" refers to a thousand 'John Does') from the 62-year-old Purisima, who has previously sued the People's Republic of China, several major banks (including Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, and Wachovia), and a whole lot of other people:      Anton Purisima v. Au Bon Pain Store, Carepoint Health, Hoboken University Medical Center, Kmart Store 7749, St. Luke's Emergency Dept., New York City Transit Authority, City of New York, NYC MTA, LaGuardia Airport Administration, Amy Caggiula, Does 1-1000, Case No. 1:14 CV 2755 (S.D.N.Y. filed 4/11/2014). Civil rights violations, personal injury, discrimination on national origin, retaliation, harassment, fraud, attempted murder, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and conspiracy to defraud. 2,000 decillion (2,000,000,000,      000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000). Pro Se      So what inspired this historic lawsuit? Purisima claims that his middle finger was bitten off by a \\"rabies-infected\\" dog on a city bus; then a \\"Chinese couple\\" took photos of him as he was being treated; he's routinely overcharged for coffee at LaGuardia Airport (not sure how this is related, but it's in there); and there are other additional damages that \\"cannot be repaired by money\\" and are \\"therefore priceless.\\"      Except it's not priceless, because he's valued it at two undecillion dollars, or \\"two octillion gigadollars,\\" or more simply, the number 2 with 36 zeroes behind it. For some context, xkcd crunched the numbers, and concluded that this amount of money basically doesn't exist: \\"Even if Au Bon Pain conquers the planet and puts everyone to work for them from now until the stars die, they wouldn't make a dent in the bill.\\" Hell, even if you extracted every element from the Earth and purified and sold them, it wouldn't come close to the amount. Purisima could certainly teach a super-villain a thing or two about demands. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A man named Anton Purisima sued many people and places, like a store, a hospital, and a city, because he believes they did many wrong things to him. Some bad things that happened were a dog biting his finger and people taking his picture without asking. He asked for a very, very big amount of money called \\"two undecillion dollars.\\" This number has 36 zeros behind it, which is more money than exists in the whole world. But, it is not very likely that he will get all that money from the people he sued."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Question: Who flees on horseback after sentencing Miller? Movie title: High Noon Movie plot: In Hadleyville, a small town in New Mexico Territory, Marshal Will Kane (Cooper), newly married to Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly), is preparing to retire. The happy couple is departing for a new life, raising a family and running a store in another town; but word arrives that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), a vicious outlaw who Kane sent to jail, has been released, and is arriving on the noon train. Miller's gangâhis younger brother Ben (Sheb Wooley), Jack Colby (Lee Van Cleef), and Jim Pierce (Robert J. Wilke)âawait his arrival at the train station; it is clear that Miller intends to exact revenge. For Amy, a devout Quaker and pacifist, the solution is simpleâleave town before Miller arrives; but Kane's sense of duty and honor is strong. \\"They're making me run,\\" he tells her. \\"I've never run from anybody before.\\" Besides, he says, Miller and his gang will hunt him down anyway. Amy gives Kane an ultimatum: She is leaving on the noon train, with or without him. While waiting at the hotel for the train, she meets Helen RamÃ­rez (Katy Jurado), who was once Miller's lover, and then Kane's, and is leaving as well. Amy understands why Helen is fleeing, but the reverse is not true: Helen tells Amy that if Kane were her man, she would not abandon him in his hour of need. Kane's efforts to round up a posse at the tavern and the church are met with fear and hostility. Many townspeople believe that Kane's departure would defuse the situation; a gunfight in the streets would be bad for the town's reputation. Others are Miller's friends, and resent that Kane cleaned up the town in the first place. Kane's young deputy Harvey Pell (Lloyd Bridges), who is bitter that Kane didn't recommend him as his successor, says he will stand with Kane only if Kane goes to the city fathers and \\"puts the word in\\" for him. Kane rejects the quid pro quo, and Pell turns in his badge. Kane's old friends and allies cannot help him either: His predecessor, Marshal Howe (Lon Chaney Jr.) is old and arthritic; Judge Percy Mettrick (Otto Kruger), who...

Homer ( , \\"Hómēros\\") is the name ascribed by the ancient Greeks to the legendary author of the \\"Iliad\\" and the \\"Odyssey\\", two epic poems which are the central works of ancient Greek literature. The \\"Iliad\\" is set during the Trojan War, the ten-year siege of the city of Troy by a coalition of Greek states. It focuses on a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles lasting a few weeks during the last year of the war. The \\"Odyssey\\" focuses on the journey home of Odysseus, king of Ithaca, after the fall of Troy.  Many accounts of Homer's life circulated in classical antiquity, the most widespread being that he was a blind bard from Ionia, a region of central coastal Anatolia in present-day Turkey. Modern scholars consider them legends.  The Homeric Question—by whom, when, where and under what circumstances were the \\"Iliad\\" and \\"Odyssey\\" composed—continues to be debated. Broadly speaking, modern scholarly opinion falls into two groups. One holds that most of the \\"Iliad\\" and (according to some) the \\"Odyssey\\" are the works of a single poet of genius. The other considers the Homeric poems to be the result of a process of working and re-working by many contributors, and that \\"Homer\\" is best seen as a label for an entire tradition. It is generally accepted that the poems were composed at some point around the late 8th or early 7th century BC. The poems are in Homeric Greek, also known as Epic Greek, a literary language which shows a mixture of features of the Ionic and Aeolic dialects from different centuries; the predominant influence is Eastern Ionic.

I know that I’m sensitive to shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate (also known as SLS, it’s the ingredient that makes shampoos, shower gels and soaps lather) but I’m also sensitive to some other ingredients in shampoos too – mainly fragrances. I had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop®, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn’t always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos – and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it. The shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it’s a nice one so it doesn’t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application – the second application lathers a lot more easily. I definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I’ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I’ve used it – the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too. But where this shampoo is outstanding is the way it makes my scalp feel – my scalp feels soothed and calm and there’s no hint of itching. I’ve been using Lavera Sensitive Shampoo for over a year now and I wouldn’t change it for the world, it’s definitely one of the best shampoos for a sensitive itchy scalp.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Creed family—Louis, Rachel, and their children Ellie and Gage—move from Chicago to rural Ludlow, Maine, after Louis is offered a job as a doctor with the University of Maine. They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery (misspelled \\"sematary\\") in the forest behind the Creed's new home. On his first day at work, Louis encounters Victor Pascow, a jogger who has been mortally injured after being hit by a truck. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before he dies, calling Louis by name despite the fact they have not previously met. That night, Pascow comes to Louis as a ghost and leads him to the Pet Sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is \\"sour\\". Louis awakens, assuming it was a dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt. During Thanksgiving while the family is gone, Ellie's cat, Church, is run down on the highway. Realizing that Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the cemetery and deep into the woods, where they reach an ancient Micmac burial ground. Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone else about what they have done. The next day a reanimated Church returns to the house, a shell of what he was before; he stinks, moves sluggishly, and is vicious towards Louis. Jud explains that as a boy he himself revived his beloved pet dog in the Micmac ground, and that although the cat might be different, it will save Ellie the grief of losing her favorite pet. Sometime later, the young Gage is killed by a truck along the same highway. The family is devastated, and Jud anticipates that Louis is considering burying his son in the Micmac ground, although Louis denies it. Jud believes that introducing Louis to the ritual ground aroused the malevolent forces present there, which caused Gage's death.

Question: \\"Which came earlier, Islam or the Kushan Empire?\\"  Context: \\"The Kushan Empire, a collection of Yuezhi tribes, took control of the region in the first century CE and ruled until the 4th century CE during which time Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Manichaeism were all practiced in the region. Later the Hephthalite Empire, a collection of nomadic tribes, moved into the region and Arabs brought Islam in the early eighth century. Central Asia continued in its role as a commercial crossroads, linking China, the steppes to the north, and the Islamic heartland.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Based on the given context, the Kushan Empire came earlier than Islam. The Kushan Empire was established in the first century CE and ruled until the 4th century CE. During this time, a variety of religions were practiced, including Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Manichaeism. However, Islam was not introduced to the region until the eighth century CE when Arabs moved into the region. The Kushan Empire, formed by a group of Yuezhi tribes, was significant during the early centuries, having a strong influence throughout their rule on the culture and religion of the region. Their reign saw the fusion of the Greco-Buddhist culture, which significantly influenced the development of the arts and philosophies in the region. This era also saw the prevalence of several religions, indicating the Empire's religious tolerance. Later, the Hephthalite Empire succeeded the Kushan Empire. They were a collection of nomadic tribes and continued to assert their influence over the region. However, despite the change of rule, one element remained constant in Central Asia— its role as a commercial crossroads. It continued to link the widely scattered realms of China, the northern steppes, and what would soon become the Islamic heartland. The introduction of Islam to this region did not occur until the early eighth century with the arrival of the Arabs. Following this, the religion of Islam began to spread, taking root not only in Central Asia but also across various parts of the world. Islam began in the 7th century in Mecca, a city in present-day Saudi Arabia, and was propagated by the Prophet Muhammad. Its core tenets are based on the Quran, regarded as the verbatim word of God.  All in all, the sequence of these historical periods clearly indicates that the Kushan Empire predated the advent of Islam. Despite the different timescales and main religions, both periods had a profound impact on the region and played a significant part in shaping its historical and cultural landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Even if you are naturally shy, these three tricks will help you to quickly build a new social circle in any new city. 1. Take pictures One of the great things about taking pictures at an event or a party is that it gives you an excuse to get in touch with the person later. Everybody loves seeing pictures of themselves, and it's very easy after taking a picture to say \\"If you'd like I can email it to you\\". This can be the seed that leads to new connections. 2. Eat alone in public You might feel self-conscious eating by yourself but it has an important benefit: you are much easier to approach  when you are alone. People may be afraid of disturbing you or being rude if you talk with someone else. Bring a book or newspaper to read. Plus, having an interesting book with you will give others an excuse tostart a conversation if they've read it. 3. Join a class, sports team, or club Yoga, salsa dancing, volleyball, Toastmasters (a public speaking club), a class for work, etc. Choose a new hobby or continue an old one! These are all great places to meet new people, primarily because you will be made to see the same people over and over again in the class. You will automatically make friends with them if you have a common interest and are made to see each other again. The writer wants to tell you   _  . A) how to make as many friends as you can B) how to make friends in a new city quickly C) how to build a social circle D) how to start a conversation with others The answer to this question is:","output":"B) how to make friends in a new city quickly. Now let's discuss these three tricks in detail: 1. Take pictures: In today's digital world, taking pictures has become an integral part of our lives. It not only helps us keep memories of the events and gatherings we attend but also serves as an excellent conversation starter. When you take pictures of people at an event or a party and offer to share those pictures with them later, it gives you a reason to start a conversation. In turn, it offers an opportunity to get to know the person better and develop a bond. Furthermore, the joy people experience from seeing photos of themselves creates a positive association with you, which can ultimately lead to strong connections in your new social circle. 2. Eat alone in public: When you are new to a city, it can be intimidating to eat alone in public places. However, as mentioned in the tip, eating alone can make you more approachable. People are usually more inclined to strike up a conversation with someone who is alone compared to someone who is with a group of friends. To make yourself feel more comfortable, bring a book or newspaper to read while eating. This way, you have something to engage in if no one approaches you, and if someone does, the book or newspaper can serve as a conversation starter. 3. Join a class, sports team, or club: Another effective way to build a social circle in a new city is by joining a class, sports team, or club. Engaging in activities that interest you not only helps you stay productive but also puts you in a position where you will meet like-minded people. It's much easier to make friends when you share a common interest, as you'll have something to talk about and bond over. Moreover, the structure of classes or clubs usually facilitates repeated interactions with the same group of people. As you continue attending the sessions and interacting with others, you are more likely to develop friendships naturally. In conclusion, building a new social circle in a new city can be a challenge, especially for those who are shy. However, by using these three tricks—taking pictures at events, eating alone in public, and joining classes, sports teams, or clubs—you can quickly make new friends and establish a strong support network. These methods can also help improve your confidence and social skills, making it easier for you to navigate new social settings in the future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Which type of substance is considered a proton donor in a reaction?   A: Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the concept of a proton donor. A proton donor in a reaction is a substance that donates a proton (H+) to another substance. This process is commonly related to acid-base reactions, where the substance donating the proton behaves as an acid.  Step 2: Identify proton donor characteristics. To be considered a proton donor, a substance must be able to lose a proton (H+) and form a bond with another substance. This usually implies that the substance has one or more hydrogen atoms that are relatively easy to be removed during a reaction. Step 3: Respond with the appropriate type of substance. Considering the characteristics of a proton donor, it can be concluded that the type of substance that is considered a proton donor in a reaction is an acid.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Who do Mrs. Travers and Foljame regard as their masters? , can you please find it?   In 1874, Disraeli's ambitious foreign policy, aimed at creating a British empire, is voted down by the House of Commons after a speech by his great rival, William Gladstone. Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe. Disraeli was not fooled; he has hired Foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. When Foljambe asks Charles if Myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, Charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that Foljambe has guessed correctly. Mrs. Travers orders Foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters. Disraeli soon discovers what has happened. When he decides to send an agent to the khedive immediately, Clarissa suggests he send Charles. Charles persuades the khedive to accept Myers' cheque in exchange for the shares, also proving his own worth to Clarissa.

Here is a news article: My name is Julie, I'm 28, female, and live in Clearwater, Florida, USA. And Cholinergic Urticaria has destroyed my life completely. I developed it exactly 3 years ago, in March 2013. After 3 years of physical and mental torture, pain, stress, anguish, heartache, no income, no help, no support, and no cure, I'm not sure how much more a person is expected to suffer daily like this. I've lost everything. I can't take it anymore and I'm begging for help. I've lost everything. Please.      I've lived in Florida for eight and a half years now. Three years ago, in March 2013, I was working at a gymnastics gym for my fourth year in a row, and I was also a dance teacher. And I loved my life. And out of nowhere, I developed a rare skin condition called Cholinergic Urticaria. I am allergic to my own sweat. (And tears.) Me, out of all people. Someone who was so physically active everyday. And loved being out in the sun. I had to quit my jobs; my passions. And having my passions just stripped from me out of the blue one day, along with my whole life as I knew it, I cannot describe to you the depths of depression that exist when your life is just, taken from you. And you may think, 'oh big deal' but you dont realize how much your body sweats until you become allergic to it. I would say its one step shy of being allergic to breathing or blinking! Bodily functions you have no control over. And to add insult to injury, when you get sick, you find out who your true friends are. And that turned out to be nobody, sadly. People tell me to move up North, hah! As if that would make a difference. I get hives trying to shower. I break out if I even try to vacuum, in air conditioning! And the hives have gotten worse with each passing year. I've had times where 100% of my body is covered in painful itchy hives. It is very hard to find any doctor who has even heard of CU. And I have no medical insurance, so it's usually anywhere from 200 to 350 (US dollars) to make a new patient appointment. And every medication, lotion, or remedy I've found online, does absolutely nothing to treat it. When I try to find answers online it usually just says, \\"there has been very little research on CU since it is such a rare condition.\\" And for two and a half years now, I have applied for government, social security disability benefits/assistance, and I have been denied each time. Justice for all, right? I guess not. The judge stated that, \\"This does not affect my daily life.\\" Are you kidding me? This has DESTROYED my life! It has destroyed me too. I stopped living three years ago. Our judicial system in the US is so blind if they cannot see how obvious it is, that someone with CU is unable to perform daily tasks like a healthy person can, or work a normal job. Though I continue to be denied for my legal right for help? Isn't this why the Americans with Disabilities Act was established? To help people like me, who have worked hard my entire life since the day I was legally able to? That's ten years of my life that I have put in hard work wherever I was employed. And I'm a perfectionist so I really did work myself to the bone at every job I ever had, even though I received such little in return for my efforts. I know ten years is not a very long time, but I have no control over when I developed my disabilities. Yes, I have more illnesses than just CU and it's an everyday struggle. Especially because nobody has ever reached out a hand to help me. Even though I am now facing homelessness. I am outraged at our legal system here in the US, which is why I have turned to the internet now for help. When I went to trial to fight for my disability income rights, I was forced to go without representation, and was denied. I didn't know that I had any other option at the time because the judge said that they will not reschedule a new trial. So I feel I was taken advantage, because I was told I could either proceed without a lawyer, or simply be denied. And I had been waiting years for this court date, and both my lawyers didn't bother to show up. Not a single person in that courtroom told me there was any other option other than waiving my right to an attorney in order to proceed with the trial. But, now that I spoke to a real, legit lawyer, I am well aware how unfairly I was treated in my trial process. Because in the US, it is a Constitutional right that you are guaranteed representation for any trial. I also wasn't allowed to submit pictures. In fact, I couldn't even go up to the judge and show him my arms covered in hives, because he wasn't even in the room! He was on a screen via skype! And the only medical records they obtained were from the free clinic, (which is a joke) that contained so much false information that it sent me into a panic attack! (For example, it said I went back to work, I never went back to work!) I have not worked in three years because it is physically impossible for me. I wake up covered in hives everyday, even though I have the air conditioner on. I have layed in bed for the last three years straight to avoid sweating, and it breaks my heart every single day. I miss my old life so much. One without itching and without pain. I even dream about it. But when I wake up, only then does it turn into a nightmare. To know that my life will never be rhe same again. These everyday hives are so unbearable that I scratch my skin open and still continue to scratch because it just itches so bad. And after laying in bed all day everyday for 3 years now, I can barely stand or walk for more than a minute or two. My back has just given out. Especially since I went from being 100lbs to 200lbs from being almost completely immobile, unable to exercise, and so severely depressed that I cope with food. There is also added anxiety due to a number of things, one being that an allergist believes I can go into anaphylactic shock at any moment and die. But I can't afford an epi-pen. It saddens me so much to think about my life 3 years ago, compared to what Ive become now. Im unrecognizable. So I also developed Agoraphobia. Which means I almost never leave my apartment. Only for doctor appointments. Because when I see myself in store glass windows or doors, I can't even believe it's me. And people can be so cruel. People have made horrible comments about my weight gain, and it makes me feel worthless. And people have physically moved away from me in the store because they think I have some kind of contagious rash. It makes me feel like I'm some kind of monster. I went from being an outgoing, friendly, happy person, to someone who, has cried everyday for three years, has no friends or family, and never leaves my apartment. No man wants me once I tell them about my CU. It's like I'm damaged goods. I went from being a gymnast and a dancer, to not being able to walk through the grocery store, during the day, without receiving hurtful stares. It is just as emotionally painful as it is physically. I am a great person, and in this shallow, media infused society that we live in, we are judged by our looks. No matter how amazing of a person we might be. I am screaming out for help and no one even bats an eyelash. At least if I was approved for disability assistance I could stop eating free meals at the churches and wouldn't be facing homelessness. I am scared to death of what is going to happen to me because of that fact that I cannot work and therefore cannot afford the cost of living. And the thought of living on the streets of Florida in 100+F temperatures, just makes me start to panick. Just imagining how severe my hives would get, I would probably die. But which one sounds better to you? Death or living in Hell everyday? Im not suicidal, but just how much is a person supposed to take living like this everyday? I'm at my three year mark, and I'm at my breaking point both mentally and physically. Can anyone help me? ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| A Florida woman is speaking out about her rare condition, which has left her unable to leave the house during the day.      Julie Reid said she developed a devastating immunological condition called cholinergic urticaria, which causes her skin to become hypersensitive to emotional stress and exercise. If she sweats, cries or simply takes a hot shower.      \\"It's torture living like this, it's torture,\\" Reid said in an interview with ABC's Tampa Bay affiliate WFTS. \\"I just feel like a monster now.\\"      She said she developed the immunological condition three years ago when she was working at a gymnastics gym. On a website to draw attention to her case, Reid said she has gained significant amount of weight and had to quit her job because the sweat would cause her to break out in massive hives for hours or days. She told WFTS she doesn't leave the house during the day over fear she could sweat and break out into hives.      \\"I went from being a gymnast and a dancer, to not being able to walk through the grocery store, during the day, without receiving hurtful stares,\\" Reid said on her website. \\"It is just as emotionally painful as it is physically.\\"      Reid could not be immediately reached by ABC News for further comment.      The disease often comes on spontaneously, according to the National Organization for Rare Diseases, and doctors can only offer supporting medications such as antihistamines to patients. The disease will usually stop just as suddenly as it started, though there is no timeline for when it might end, according to the organization.      \\"I cannot describe to you the depths of depression that exist when your life is just, taken from you,\\" Reid said on her website. You don't \\"realize how much your body sweats until you become allergic to it. I would say it's one step shy of being allergic to breathing or blinking!\\"      Reid said without a job she has had difficulty paying for doctors appointments and has become depressed about her inability to return to her old life.      \\"I'm allergic to myself,\\" she said. ||||| CLEARWATER, Fla - Julie Reid doesn't recognize her face in the mirror.      \\"It's torture living like this, torture,\\" Reid said.      The 28-year-old Clearwater transplant suffers from Cholinergic Urticaria, a rare hypersensitive skin condition that causes her to break out in hives all over her body because she is allergic to her own sweat and tears.      The hives can last anywhere from an hour to several days. It is a condition that came on suddenly two years ago.      \\"It itches like crazy, I scratch my skin open,\\" Reid said.      Her condition came on without warning. Now Reid, who made a living as a gymnastics and dance instructor, can now longer follow her passion.      Being outside is not possible either. The Florida heat and sun are just too much for her.      \\"Any physical activity I do, I develop hives everywhere,\\" she said.      Reid told ABC Action News she slipped into a deep depression and struggles to get out of bed.      Over the past three years, she has put on more than 100 pounds. She admits she's turned to eating food to cope with her condition.      \\"I used to be so beautiful, now I look like a monster,\\" she added.      Reid has not left her apartment during the daytime hours in the past three years. She claims she has developed agoraphobia and fears to leave the house and deal with public scrutiny.      \\"I just stay in bed and cry and cry,\\" she said.      Unable to work, she's lost her health insurance. She says she's also been denied disability.      \\"It's destroyed my life. I have no, I have nothing, I have nothing, no friends, no furniture, no help, no family here,\\" she said.      She spends hours online searching for a cure but her condition is not curable.      According to Reid, one doctor who previously treated her told her she could go into anaphylactic shock and requires an Epipen. She can't get it because she cannot afford it.      Reid has no furniture in her apartment. She's sold it all to try and make ends meet and to pay for doctor visits.      Fearful of her mental condition and emotional state, Reid reached out to ABC Action News for help. She is hoping someone out there will see her story and help her.      She has documented her journey with a personal website, click here to view it. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Julie, a 28-year-old woman from Clearwater, Florida, suffers from a rare and debilitating skin condition called Cholinergic Urticaria. This condition, which Julie developed in March 2013, makes her allergic to her own sweat and tears, causing her to break out into painful, itchy hives whenever she sweats, cries, or even showers. As a former gymnast, dancer, and gymnastics coach, Julie loved her active lifestyle, but her condition has forced her to quit her passions and stay at home to avoid triggering the painful hives. Despite trying numerous medications, lotions, and remedies, none have relieved Julie's symptoms, and her condition is not well-understood due to its rarity. With no medical insurance, she has found it difficult and costly to get medical help. Furthermore, her applications for government disability benefits have been repeatedly denied, even though her condition severely impacts her daily life. Julie's condition has not only affected her physically but also emotionally, leading her into deep depression and agoraphobia. As a result, she rarely leaves her apartment during the day and has gained significant weight due to a combination of inactivity and emotional eating. Additionally, the condition has taken a toll on her personal relationships, leading to social isolation. Unfortunately, cholinergic urticaria does not yet have a cure. The National Organization for Rare Diseases states that the disease often appears and disappears suddenly, but there is no indication of when it might end. As Julie's condition continues to impact her daily life, she has turned to the internet for help, hoping that sharing her story will raise awareness and potentially lead to the assistance she desperately needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Most cases of food poisoning can be handled at home. Symptoms can begin within hours and last for hours or days and even longer in some cases.  Mildly contaminated foods, or some types of contaminants, may not cause the symptoms to start for several days, or even longer. When the onset of symptoms is delayed, the duration of the problem can last for days to weeks. Chronic symptoms should be promptly evaluated by a doctor especially if you are having hematemesis or hematochezia, which is bloody vomit or diarrhea, respectively. The symptoms of food poisoning include nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramps, sweating, and fever. You may want to let your stomach settle for an hour or so, but then you need to start introducing fluids to prevent dehydration. Take small sips of whatever liquid you can most easily tolerate, and continue to drink as much as possible throughout the day.  Sip on water or suck on ice chips. Taking small sips of water may help calm nausea and will provide your body with a small and steady dose of this essential liquid. If your stomach is not ready for liquid, then try putting ice chips in your mouth and let them dissolve. Try sucking on a ginger candy or drink some ginger tea. Ginger can help with digestion and treat stomach upset, diarrhea, and nausea. Diarrhea and vomiting also cause your body to lose essential electrolytes. A good way to replace the lost electrolytes is to sip on a caffeine-free sports drink (not an energy drink) once you can hold it down.  Other products are available for adults and children that help to replenish fluids and restore electrolytes. These products are called electrolyte replacement drinks. Types of sports drinks include Gatorade and Powerade, to name a few. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist for a specific recommendation. Sometimes a little carbonation may actually help reduce symptoms of nausea. Try sipping on ginger ale or other clear carbonated beverages over ice. Sip on clear broth, such as chicken, vegetable, or beef, once your stomach has settled enough and you are not likely to trigger the nausea and vomiting.  Starting with broth is a good way to help replenish fluids and begin to introduce nutrients back into your body. Move on to foods that are bland, low-fat, and easily digested. Some examples include saltine crackers, toast, and gelatin. Back away from these solid foods if your nausea returns. Some beverages should not be used while are trying to restore the fluids you lost during your illness. Some liquids pull water from your body tissues and contribute to the problem of dehydration.  Alcoholic beverages are not to be used while you are still sick. Avoid caffeinated beverages including coffee, tea, colas, or energy drinks. Fruit juices and fruit drinks contain carbohydrates, are low in sodium, and may aggravate your upset stomach. Avoid dairy products and spicy drinks or foods until you are feeling better. Summary:","output":"1. Allow stomach to settle for an hour before starting to drink fluids. 2. Start by taking small sips of water or sucking on ice chips to prevent dehydration. 3.

RJ has contracted Stephen King Syndrome - make 3 pages of babble where 1 paragraph of literature would do. Seriously, the plot slows down even more than before. There is more plot movement in any 2 chapters of the first 3 books than in this entire volume. RJ must be paid by the word and Tor is trying to make this series go on forever. Don't get me wrong, I like the story, but it could have been done in 4 books, and done well. But Jordan/Tor have decided to milk this out and make it a lifetime project. Don't waste your money buying this book now - wait for the next book and buy THIS book at the used book store for 99 cents. If you don't die of old age waiting first.","output":"The given review is largely negative, indicating that the book suffers from numerous issues such as overly wordy writing, a slow plot, and a drawn-out series with the potential to be condensed. The reviewer suggests that RJ, the author, has contracted \\"Stephen King Syndrome,\\" which is their way of expressing that the book contains too much unnecessary content. In addition, the reviewer states that this particular volume has less plot progression compared to earlier books in the series. While the reviewer does mention liking the overall story, they seem exasperated with the author and publisher for stretching the series out, to the point of recommending waiting for the next book's release and buying this one at a significantly reduced price at a used bookstore. Taking this review into account, it is likely that this review would decrease the chances of you buying the product. The detailed issues brought up by the reviewer may lead potential buyers to reconsider their purchase, especially if they prefer a more concise and well-paced read. However, it's important to consider other reviews as well and not base the decision solely on this single negative review.

Nine families displaced by a fire at Alamo Hills Apartments in March filed lawsuits Wednesday against the apartment complex. They allege that the complex could have done more to protect belongings they were forced to abandon in the aftermath of the blaze. Bernard Dempsey Jr., an attorney with Western Michigan Legal Services, the group that represents the tenants, said Alamo Hills gave the displaced families very limited opportunity to remove belongings. \\"They were given three days to get their stuff out, and if they couldn't get moved out in three days, their stuff was discarded,\\" Dempsey said. \\"Alamo Hills just threw it out.\\" Others, he said, lost possessions to looters after the March 23 blaze, which left 78 people temporarily homeless. According to the lawsuit, the tenants were prohibited from entering their apartments to retrieve possessions and were promised that the complex would provide security. A spokesperson for PM One, the company that manages Alamo Hills, could not be reached for comment. Nine separate suits were filed in 8th District Court, which handles civil claims of less than 25,000. \\"We're asking for the reimbursement of the value of their property and a small amount for stress -- 3,000 on top of their out-of-pocket expenses for their lost stuff,\\" Dempsey said. \\"They're not looking to get rich off this.

Article: Most schools forbid chewing gum, but in a few years they might consider changing that rule. Why? Scientists are finding evidence that gum chewing may be good for your health. It may even help improve your test scores. This exciting research is just beginning. And in the meantime, companies are also experimenting with adding vitamins, minerals, medicines, and other substances that could give gum the power to cure headaches and fight everything from serious diseases to bad breath. Other researchers are finding that gum might work better than a pill to deliver medicines and other substances into the bloodstream. That's because the lining   of our cheeks can absorb certain substances more quickly than our stomachs and intestines   can. That discovery could help other researchers develop medicine-containing gums that fight colds, ease headaches, battle nervousness, and more. Scientists might even create antimicrobial   gums that cure bad breath. Those projects may take years, but gum scientists have already had at least one recent success: They've created a gum that could help us stay awake. Researchers have produced a gum called Stay Alert. Each stick has as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. It can take an hour for the caffeine in coffee to have its full effect, but the caffeine in Stay Alert _ in just a few minutes. The gum is easy to transport and it's stable in cold and hot climates. Unlike a pill, it doesn't require water to swallow. Those qualities make it easy for soldiers to use. For now, Stay Alert is available only to the military  . The manufacturer may one day offer it for sale to the public. People who work at night, such as truck drivers and medical personnel who ride in ambulances, might benefit from a product like Stay Alert. Question: It can be inferred from the passage that   _  .

What is the answer for the question: What kingdom converted to Christianity before Alodia? from the following article ?  John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century.","output":"The kingdom that converted to Christianity before Alodia, as mentioned in the provided text, is Nobadia. Nobadia converted in 543, before Alodia requested a bishop for the Christianization of their people in 580."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

She had been working on a doctorate in English, but once she married Richard (Gregg Edelman) and had their daughter, the presently five-year-old Lucy (Sadie Goldstein), she set aside her research. Now she spends her days taking Lucy to a local park along with three other stay at-home mothers: the severe and judgmental Mary Ann (Mary B. McCann) and more timid Theresa (Trini Alvorado) and Cheryl (Marsha Dietlein). They enjoy ogling from a distance Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), the handsome and well built father who brings his son, Aaron (Ty Simpkins), to the park. When their children use the same swing set, Sarah and Brad have an opportunity to talk to one another, titillating the other women. But when they, on a lark, hug and kiss, the women immediately take their children out of the park and refuse to associate with Sarah anymore.Both Brad and Sarah have unhappy home lives. Brad has yet to pass the Massachusetts state bar exam and doesn't even want to be a lawyer. However, his bossy wife, Kathy (Jennifer Connelly), pushes him to succeed. She makes documentaries for public television for a living. They live a bit beyond their means, forcing them to accept financial support from Kathy's mother. Their sex life is non-existent because Kathy is too self-involved in her career and being a mother. When he is supposed to be studying for the bar exam, Brad instead sits and watches teenagers skateboard outside his house, fantasizing about being young and carefree again. One night, an acquaintance, Larry (Noah Emmerich), persuades Brad, who played quarterback on his high school football team, to join his amateur football team, the Guardians.Larry is a former police officer forced to retire a few years earlier when he accidentally shot a teenager who robbed a store.

Johnson is a justice on California's Second District Court of Appeal. Lash and Johnson are co-chairs of the California Commission on Access to Justice. The full report can be viewed at (www.calbar.org). In her year-long odyssey through the California justice system, Katherine, a 35-year-old single mother with three children, experienced failure at every turn. Leaving her abusive husband, she moved into the only apartment she could afford, and soon discovered a broken toilet and non- working oven, rats and roaches, and a fourthfloor landing with no railing. She began withholding rent pending repairs her landlord refused to make, but then her Medi-Cal benefits were cut off when she could not provide rent receipts. She lost health care for her children and herself, although she is a borderline diabetic in need of medication and her children were suffering from rat bites. Katherine tried to seek help through the courts. Representing herself at an administrative hearing, she lost her appeal to restore Medi-Cal benefits because she did not have proper documentation of the rent account. When she went to a courthouse to file a complaint against her landlord, she found the process so confusing that she gave up and went home. According to \\"The Path to Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\" prepared by the California Commission on Access to Justice, Katherine is just one of 4.6 million poor Californians whose basic civil legal needs -- often involving such critical needs as housing, health care, education, employment, safety and transportation -- are not being addressed. California has a critical dearth of legal services for the poor, and, as this report makes clear, it is imperative that the state join with the federal government and private funders to increase resources so that all Californians, regardless of income, have equal access to our justice system. Our justice system is predicated on the assumption that both parties will be represented by lawyers who act as gatekeepers and guides through a complex legal system that would otherwise be inaccessible to many of us. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable members of our society are the least able to afford legal services. California does have a strong network of legal aid organizations that try to help meet the needs of the poor, but there's just one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people. We may promise \\"justice for all,\\" but for those who can't afford a lawyer, that promise is often a lie. In its new report, the Commission on Access to Justice notes some significant steps toward providing equal access to justice for all Californians.  Question: \\"Why was Katherine unsuccessful in representing herself?\\" Response: \\"She did not produce the proper documents\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question. Katherine was unsuccessful in representing herself because she did not bring the proper documentation to the administrative hearing, causing her to lose her appeal to restore her Medi-Cal benefits. Additionally, when she attempted to file a complaint against her landlord, the process was too confusing for her, leading her to give up and go home. These two factors contributed to her unsuccessful attempts at self-representation, making it even more difficult for her to address her various legal needs in an already challenging environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: Who brings something to Colorado to be looked at? is inside the article: In the South Seas, a volcano explodes, eventually causing North Pole icebergs to shift. Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir.  Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls.  Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis.  He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow.  He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop.  Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis.  Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the people of an Eskimo village spot the mantis in the sky, and although they hurry to their boats to escape, it swoops down and kills several men., can you guess it ?

Charley's old best friend, Edward \\"Evil Ed\\" Lee, informs him that many students have gone missing, including their other childhood friend, Adam Johnson. When Charley goes home after school, his mother, Jane, introduces him to Jerry Dandrige, their new neighbor. Fed-up and angry with Ed after he claims that Jerry is a vampire, Charley tells him that he's crazy and that he doesn't want to be friends anymore. On his way home, Ed is confronted by Jerry, who claims that he has been watching Ed and has been aware of Ed watching him. Jerry soon chases Ed into a nearby pool and convinces him into believing that his life would be much better if he was a vampire. Ed succumbs and willingly allows Jerry to bite him. The next day, Charley realizes that Ed is missing and decides to investigate, starting to believe Ed's claims when he discovers video recordings of objects moving on their own, with Ed's voiceover revealing that he is recording Jerry to prove that his reflection doesn't show up in recordings.

Article: Have you ever imagined what human beings will look like in the future? Well, now you don't have to. According to AsapScience, a Canada-based video channel that touches on many different science topics, humans will be very different creatures 1,000 years from now. Artificial intelligence, genetic engineering and climate change will work together to change our bodies greatly, according to a video recently published by the channel. We could, for instance, develop red eyes as our DNA changes, and have darker skin because of global warming. The video painted a picture of a future world in which our bodies are part human, part machine. Nanobots, or tiny robots, will be put into our bodies, improving our abilities. \\"No longer will we be limited by our own physiology. We will truly become a mixture of biology and machine on the inside,\\" says the video. Meanwhile, designer babies will cause future generations to grow into intelligent, attractive people. As global warming takes hold, humans will also be skinnier and taller, as this body shape deals with heat better. In fact, Cadell Last, a researcher at the Global Brain Institute located in Belgium, believes change may happen even faster than this. As he said in a paper recently published in Current Aging Science, mankind is already going through a major evolutionary change. In less than four decades, Last claims, we will live longer, have children in old age and need artificial intelligence to finish daily tasks. \\"Your 80 or 100 is going to be so radically different than your grandparents,\\" Last said. Instead of living fast and dying young, he believes humans will live slow and die old. \\"The biological clock isn't going to be around forever,\\" he added, and said that people could pause it for some time using future technology. Just a few hundred years ago, most humans were working in the fields, while nowadays more and more are getting an education. These are just predictions, and no one can be sure how human beings will evolve in the future. But with such large... Question: Which of the following would Cadell Last probably agree with?

This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".

During Leopold's illness performances were impossible, so Wolfgang turned to composition. According to the writer and musician Jane Glover, Wolfgang was inspired to write symphonies after meeting Johann Christian Bach. It is not clear when this meeting occurred, or when Wolfgang first heard J. C. Bach's symphonies, although he had played the older composer's harpsichord works in his May 1764 royal recital. Wolfgang soon completed his Symphony No. 1 in E flat, K. 16, and started his No. 4 in D major, K. 19 (which Zaslaw concludes was more likely composed, or at least completed, in The Hague). The D major symphony has, in Hildesheimer's words, \\"an originality of melody and modulation which goes beyond the routine methods of his [grown-up] contemporaries\\". These are Wolfgang's first orchestral writings, although Zaslaw hypothesises a theoretical \\"Symphony No. 0\\" from sketches in Wolfgang's musical notebook. Three lost symphonies, identified in the Köchel catalogue of Mozart's works only by their incipits (first few bars of music), may also have originated from the London period. Other works composed by Wolfgang in London include several instrumental sonatas, the jewel of which, according to Hildesheimer, is the C major sonata for piano, four hands, K. 19d. A set of violin sonatas, with extra flute and cello parts, was dedicated to Queen Charlotte at her request, and presented to her with an appropriate inscription in January 1765.

Which of the two areas had less dense water?","output":"Area A, situated at the mouth of the Danube River, had less dense water compared to Area B. This is because Area A experienced high levels of water stratification due to the fresh water discharged by the river. Freshwater has a lower density than saltwater, as it does not contain dissolved salts that contribute to the increased density in saltwater.  When fresh river water meets and mixes with saltwater from the sea, it results in a less dense layer sitting above a denser, more saline layer. This stratification creates distinct layers within the water column, which reduces the mixing of the two layers. In contrast, Area B, situated 35 miles south, had water that was less stratified and more oxygenated, implying a greater mixing of water layers and possibly a higher salt content. Consequently, Area A's water was less dense than that of Area B due to the presence of freshwater from the Danube River."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Having spent more than a decade as a jazz artist, I've garnered some insights. As a youngster growing up in New Orleans, surrounded by the city's sounds and rhythms, I was influenced by a wide variety of music: brass bands, blues, ragtime, R&B, soul, rock 'n' roll, Dixieland and more. I played the percussion in my family's band, switching to piano at age 11. Since then, music has been a part of my everyday life. I've had the good fortune to play with inspiring artists across many genres -- Wynton Marsalis, Prince, Busta Rhymes among them. What's given me the foundation to be able to join such varied musicians is my jazz training. Jazz is subtle, emotional and accommodating. It is intellectual and sometimes even scientific. Most genres of music are not nearly as multidimensional, which in part is why the art form has such a small audience. In stark comparison to pop music, contemporary jazz seems too circuitous for most listeners to enjoy casually. The challenge for the contemporary jazz musician, as I see it, is making this subtle and complex art palatable to the greater public. Jazz is complex. Some of the greatest musical minds of all-time were jazz artists. They were able to master their instruments, redefine music theory and repeatedly innovate the already formidable body of work present before them. Many of them did so while navigating through the tumultuous social climate from which the music was birthed. John Blake: Dave Brubeck, ambassador to a new America. As a performer, part of my job is to take the audience on a musical journey to somewhere they've never been. The Stay Human movement I've started is about experiencing music -- not about it being on a stage and untouchable, but something that you viscerally experience on the subways and streets. Stay Human has grown to be more than a band, and has become a local movement that is expanding and shifting the way people experience jazz. We're trying to harness all of the musical elements that I grew up absorbing in New Orleans, and couple them with contemporary mainstream sounds. I want people to feel and hear jazz as they never thought it could be played. In the midst of the \\"plug in/tune out\\" nature of modern day society, we believe that the human interaction of a live musical performance can uplift humanity. Stay Human can happen anywhere. Not only in a music hall or official venue, but on streets and subways or among unsuspecting (and often pleased) patrons at a restaurant. We refer to these moments as a #loveriot and anyone can join. Keeping the Jazz Fest alive. At the core of the experience is the band, a group of my friends who are all world-class, Juilliard-trained musicians in their 20s. The music is central to the experience, but it isn't just about the music. Ultimately, it's about people from all walks of life coming together to share an authentic and transformative moment through the power of music. Maya Angelou once said, \\"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\\" Jazz is a tradition. The way jazz musicians walk, talk and greet each other, and the way they play is very distinct. To be a jazz artist is to be a part of a lineage. To play jazz is to contribute to world history. To be a part of this tradition means that you are challenged to transform other people with the sound of your instrument. You are challenged to swing. You are challenged to contribute to the body of work established by some of the greatest artistic minds of all time, work that includes these treasures:. • A performance of \\"Fine and Mellow\\" by Billie Holiday, Lester Young and others from a CBS television broadcast in New York on December 8, 1957. It is generally considered one of the greatest moments for jazz ever broadcast on live television. • \\"It Don't Mean A Thing\\" by Duke Ellington features catchy vocals, hard swing, jazz violin and awesome horn section parts that epitomize what the jazz tradition is all about. • \\"Every Time We Say Goodbye\\" Ray Charles and Betty Carter from their album together. Exquisite! • \\"I'm Just a Lucky So and So\\" from the album by Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. It is a supreme example of the blues with utmost sophistication and feeling. The way Duke accompanies Satchmo is masterful, and the personality of the two of them signifies what jazz is all about. Gene Seymour: Brubeck, jazz master with a big heart. As an artist, it is exciting to explore the sound of your identity. Jazz music teaches you about who you are by exploring the humanity of others. It accommodates who you are. The inimitable genius Charlie Parker stated it best when he said, \\"Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art.\\" Jazz is an experience. Jazz is wonderful because it's all about the moment, and I firmly believe in creating unforgettable experiences. With the Stay Human band, it's never only about the stage.

His eyes awoke with a passionate, determined flame, though the only light came from the glutted moon. Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.  The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.  A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.  I am facing a new situation today: Peter decided to sugar mangoes, ginger, pineapples, peaches to preserve them for next spring. He also bought blueberries and raspberries to eat fresh.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which fruit had a lower sugar content, mangoes or blueberries? Answer:","output":"Based on the background article, sugaring is used as a food preservation method where the food is packed with pure sugar to create an environment hostile to microbial life. However, the article does not directly provide any information on the sugar content of mangoes and blueberries. To answer the question \\"Which fruit has a lower sugar content, mangoes or blueberries?\\", we would need to look beyond the information available in the article and examine the natural sugar content of these two fruits. Mangoes are tropical fruits known for their sweetness and juicy pulp. They contain natural sugars like sucrose, fructose, and glucose. On average, a medium-sized mango (around 200 grams) contains approximately 45 grams of sugar. Blueberries, on the other hand, are small, round berries that are generally less sweet compared to mangoes. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and they also contain natural sugars such as fructose, glucose, and traces of sucrose. A 200-gram serving of blueberries (approximately equal in weight to the medium-sized mango) contains about 30 grams of sugar. Comparing the sugar content of the two fruits, we can conclude that blueberries have a lower sugar content than mangoes. It is essential to keep in mind that this information is not directly available in the background article, and the natural sugar content of fruits is distinct from the sugar content involved in the sugaring process mentioned in the article."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Becky Barrow. PUBLISHED:. 18:34 EST, 1 October 2012. |. UPDATED:. 19:02 EST, 1 October 2012. The pensions revolution affecting up to 11million workers began yesterday. It is the biggest shake-up of pensions for more than a century and was hailed by ministers as ‘a truly radical social change’. For the first time, every boss will be forced to pay into a pension for their workers, who will be automatically signed up to the scheme. Pensions Minister Steve Webb, pictured, said the start of auto-enrolment, whereby for the first time every boss will be forced to pay into a pension for their workers, is a 'major milestone' Yesterday the first workers were ‘enrolled’ into the new pension schemes, with around 800,000 expected to be signed up before Christmas. Most workers aged between 22 and state pension age who are not members of a pension scheme will be signed up to a pension by their boss, known as automatic enrolment. Only the lowest earners, whose annual salary is £8,105 or less, will be exempted from the scheme. Workers who are auto-enrolled will join either a company scheme or the National Employment Savings Trust, known as NEST. At present, the majority of private sector workers do not put any money into a pension. If they do have a pension pot, it is worth an average of just £26,000. Under the new scheme, if a 30-year-old saved £50 a month, the pot would be worth around £90,000 at the age of 65, if the fund grew by 7 per cent a year. A £90,000 pension pot buys a 65-year-old man a pension of about £4,850 per year. A £26,000 pot buys an annual pension of about £1,500. The scheme was suggested by Lord Turner in 2005 when he was asked by the Labour government to try to solve Britain’s pensions crisis, but the launch has been a long time coming. Pensions Minister Steve Webb said yesterday that the start of auto-enrolment represents ‘a major milestone’ for workers as well as the Government’s attempt to solve the crisis. ‘Few policies affect as many people and this will be a truly radical social change,’ he said. Under the new scheme, if a 30-year-old saved £50 a month, the pot would be worth around £90,000 at the age of 65. ‘I’m determined to make sure that pensions are no longer seen as the preserve of the few.’ He said it made a break from many other Government reforms which he described as ‘just awful and horrible’. Mr Webb hailed the shake-up as the biggest pensions revolution since state pensions were introduced by a 1908 Act of Parliament. The CBI, Britain’s biggest business lobby group, said it is the start of ‘a new dawn for pension savers’ which it said will ‘tackle the ticking retirement time bomb’. Workers will pay into their pension – but so will their boss and the Government will also make its own contribution through tax relief. Contributions will begin low but will rise to 4 per cent of salary from workers, 3 per cent from their boss and 1 per cent from tax relief in October 2018, making a total of 8 per cent of salary. Workers will have the right to opt out immediately if they do not want to save into a pension for whatever reason, but bosses have no right to encourage, or even force, them to opt out. The Government admits it expects around a third of workers will opt out, with many expected to say they simply cannot afford to save at the current time. Britain’s biggest companies will be the first to enrol their workers, a process which began yesterday, followed by smaller businesses over the next six years. In October, around 380,000 workers will be signed up, followed by a further 420,000 in November, and workers will continue to be signed up over the next few years. Between February and May next year, around 6.5million will be automatically enrolled. Nobody can escape, from Tesco having to enrol workers who are not currently in the supermarket’s pension scheme to a couple who employ a nanny to look after their young children. An advertising campaign featuring TV stars such as Theo Paphitis and Nick Hewer was launched recently to raise awareness of the shake-up. Stephen Gay, director of savings at the Association of British Insurers, said: ‘Automatic enrolment is an opportunity not to be missed. ‘It cannot be stressed enough how important it is to save for retirement. ‘The fact that we are living longer is great, but we can no longer have our heads in the sand about how we fund our income in retirement. ‘The state pension is a foundation, but most people need more and the earlier people start to save the easier they will find it to build enough savings for their later life.’ The shake-up comes after official figures showed the number of private sector workers with a company pension scheme has collapsed to its lowest level since records began in 1953. Of the country’s 23.9million private sector workers, only 2.9million are paying into a company pension scheme. At their peak in 1967, there were 8.1million members. Highlights:","output":"1.

You can make people happier, healthier and more hard-working just by touching their arms or holding their hands. Doctors say that body contact is a kind of medicine that can work wonders. When people are touched, the quantity of hemoglobin  -a type of matter that produces the red color in blood increases greatly. This results in more oxygen reaching every part of the body and the whole body benefits. In experiments, bottle-fed baby monkeys were separated from their mothers for the first ten days of life. They became sad and negative. Studies showed the monkeys were more probable to become ill than other babies that were allowed to stay with their mothers. Human babies react in much the same way. Some years ago, a scientist noticed that some well-fed babies in a clean nursery became weak. Yet babies in another nursery were growing healthily, even though they ate less well and were not kept as clean. The reason, he concluded, was that they often had touches from nurses. Experiments show that most people like being touched. And nearly all doctors believe touch helps to reduce patients' fear of treatment. Of course there is time when a touch is not welcome. But even if we don't like being touched, a smile can make us feel better. Smiling increases blood flow and starts the production of \\"happy brain\\" chemicals. So let's have a big smile and don't forget to keep in touch. Question: According to the passage   _  .

HMS Bulwark brought more than 400 people to safety after they were found 40 miles from the Libyan coast in inflatable boats. The European Commission has proposed a scheme to offer 20,000 refugees the right to resettle in the EU. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Theresa May has suggested that some rescued migrants should be returned home. The BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said a further 150 migrants had been transferred to HMS Bulwark from an Italian coastguard vessel and the ship would now head to Sicily. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the Royal Navy had rescued about 600 people so far this month. The Ministry of Defence said HMS Bulwark had been alerted to four 30ft boats in potential distress, each carrying about 100 people including pregnant women and children. Captain Nick Cooke Priest, commanding officer of HMS Bulwark, said people on the \\"precarious\\" boats were suffering from dehydration and injuries. \\"The weather at the moment is extremely hot so my ship's company and I are very pleased that we were able to bring them to safety,\\" he said. To help combat the migrant crisis, the European Commission has proposed the new resettlement scheme, which will take place over the next two years. By the end of May, it also plans to introduce a temporary mechanism for distributing thousands of migrants already in Europe among EU member states. But Mrs May said offering resettlement regardless of circumstances to migrants rescued from the Mediterranean would encourage more to make \\"perilous journeys\\". This was why the UK was not backing a resettlement quota plan, she said. Mr Fallon said HMS Bulwark had already proved to be an \\"invaluable asset in assisting with the Mediterranean migrant crisis\\". \\"The ship is providing medical assistance, food, water and dry clothes to those in need and will transfer them safely to land as soon as possible,\\" he said. The UN estimates that 60,000 people have already tried to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa this year. More than 1,800 migrants have died - a 20-fold increase on the same period in 2014. France, Germany, Italy and some other countries have backed the quota proposal, but a majority of EU governments would have to agree for it to become law. As things stand, the UK could decide to opt in to the scheme, but could not be compelled to join, as it has the power to opt out of justice and home affairs policies set by the EU - and asylum decisions are included in that opt-out. The Home Office has instead urged the EU to focus on combating people traffickers.","output":"HMS Bulwark rescued over 400 migrants near the Libyan coast, amid ongoing discussions in the EU regarding a proposal to offer 20,000 refugees resettlement rights and the distribution of migrants among EU member states."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Joe lived in East Antarctica while his buddy Jim lived in West Antarctica. They were both into collecting rare specimens of plants and wildlife.  They would often complain about the weather.  Which friend experienced warmer weather? Answer:","output":"To determine which friend experienced warmer weather, we need to compare the climates of East Antarctica and West Antarctica. Step 1: Understand the general climate conditions of Antarctica Antarctica is the coldest continent on Earth, with the South Pole located in East Antarctica. The coastlines of both East Antarctica and West Antarctica have milder climates due to proximity to the surrounding ocean, while the continent's interior experiences more extreme cold temperatures. Step 2: Compare East Antarctica's climate with West Antarctica's climate East Antarctica is larger, higher, and colder than West Antarctica. It is predominantly made up of a high, ice-covered plateau, with average temperatures ranging from -20°C to -60°C (-4°F to -76°F). It can reach even lower in the interior. Coastal regions of East Antarctica tend to be slightly warmer but still cold, ranging from -10°C to -40°C (14°F to -40°F). West Antarctica, on the other hand, has a more varied landscape and generally milder climate. The Antarctic Peninsula, located in West Antarctica, has the mildest climate on the continent, with coastal summer temperatures ranging from -2°C to 2°C (28°F to 36°F) and winter temperatures ranging from -15°C to -20°C (5°F to -4°F). The interior of West Antarctica is colder than the coastal areas, but still generally warmer than East Antarctica. Step 3: Determine which friend experienced warmer weather Based on the comparative climates of East and West Antarctica, it is clear that Jim, living in West Antarctica, experienced warmer weather than Joe, who lived in East Antarctica."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:At countless UN climate meetings, Mr De Brum was a passionate champion of the rights of small island states. He was instrumental in securing the \\"high ambition coalition\\" of rich and poor countries that was pivotal to a deal in the French capital. Mr De Brum died at his home in Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands. Born near the end of WWII, Mr De Brum grew up in an era when the tiny Pacific state was being used to host a number of US nuclear bomb tests. When he was nine years old he witnessed one such detonation, while fishing with his grandfather around 200 miles away. The resulting destruction of the atolls, the evacuation of many islanders as a result of the atomic tests became a hotly contested political issue. The islander's push for independence and compensation played a large part in Tony De Brum's political awakening. As one of the Islands' first university graduates, Mr De Brum was heavily involved in the negotiations with the US that resulted in an agreement on independence and compensation signed in 1986. However it was the threat of rising seas and a changing climate became the key issues of his time as a Marshall Islands foreign minister. In the Paris climate negotiations, his warm, personal and relaxed style was very much in contrast to the stiffer, greyer faces of some teams. He used his charm to build strong personal relationships with many of the political leaders from rich and poor countries alike. This helped create the \\"coalition of high ambition,\\" a group that ultimately involved around 100 nations, including the US, the EU, African, Caribbean and island states. This alliance of rich and poor proved critical in pushing the deal through. The biggest win from Mr De Brum's perspective, was that the Paris agreement committed to  the goal of keeping global temperature increases close to 1.5C - \\"1.5 to stay alive,\\" was a phrase often used by Mr De Brum. Tributes to the former minister have been led by the Marshall Islands' President Hilda Heine. \\"The very existence of the Paris Climate Agreement owes a lot to Tony De Brum,\\" she wrote in a statement. \\"He was a giant of history, a legend in every meaning of the world and a custodian of our shared future.\\" Others took to Twitter to extend their sympathies.

Security at the events was heightened after attacks in Tunisia, France and Kuwait on Friday. The Sun also reported that so-called Islamic State had planned to target a parade in Merton, South London. The newspaper said IS had plotted to detonate a pressure cooker bomb, but the plot failed after it informed police and security services. Police did not confirm the Sun's report but said it was \\"helpful\\" when journalists shared information that could indicate terrorist activity. Speaking in Guildford, Mr Cameron said: \\"Today, we celebrate our brave servicemen and women who work so hard to keep our country safe.\\" Defence Secretary Michael Fallon and Vice Chief of the Defence Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach also attended the event. The Duke of York took the salute on the parade route on behalf of the Queen and Royal Family, as the Red Arrows staged a flypast. More than 150 events took place across the country to mark the seventh annual celebration. Mr Fallon told the BBC Armed Forces Day was a \\"huge opportunity to salute the armed forces for the service and the sacrifice they make on behalf of us all and also to pay tribute to families who support them\\". Earlier the PM chaired an emergency Cobra meeting to look at the UK's response to the attack in Tunisia. At least five Britons have been confirmed dead by the Foreign Office following the attack on Friday, but Mr Cameron warned the public must be prepared for a high British death toll. The Tunisian health ministry said eight Britons had been identified among the dead. Following the Cobra meeting Mr Cameron said: \\"Let's be clear. There's no doubt we face a very severe threat in our country and we have done for many months and many years. \\"But today is about paying tribute to our armed forces and their families who do so much to keep us safe and we should proceed with those events.\\" Meanwhile, the Sun reported that an IS leader in Syria unwittingly recruited an undercover investigator from the newspaper to carry out the attack in Merton. The Sun described the alleged plot as a \\"suicide\\" attack, saying IS was intending to strike soldiers from the unit of murdered soldier Lee Rigby. It alleged an IS leader, who it said was originally from Birmingham, told the investigator: \\"It will be big. We will hit the kuffar (unbelievers) hard InshAllah. Hit their soldiers in their own land.\\" The Merton parade was to be targeted because it was closest to the barracks in Woolwich where Fusilier Rigby, was murdered in May 2013, the newspaper said. Fusiliers from his regiment were to be among some 250 marchers, it added. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: \\"The police, together with our security partners, remain alert to terrorist threats that may manifest here or where individuals overseas may seek to direct or inspire others to commit attacks in and against the UK. \\"It is always helpful when journalists share with us information, as The Sun did in this case, that could indicate terrorist or criminal activity.\\" Summary:","output":"A big celebration was held for our brave servicemen and women, and everyone was extra careful to keep everyone safe after some recent attacks in different countries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In Euclidean geometry, an isosceles trapezoid (isosceles trapezium in British English) is a convex quadrilateral with a line of symmetry bisecting one pair of opposite sides. It is a special case of a trapezoid. Alternatively, it can be defined as a trapezoid in which both legs and both base angles are of the same measure. Note that a non-rectangular parallelogram is not an isosceles trapezoid because of the second condition, or because it has no line of symmetry. In any isosceles trapezoid two opposite sides (the bases) are parallel, and the two other sides (the legs) are of equal length (properties shared with the parallelogram). The diagonals are also of equal length. The base angles of an isosceles trapezoid are equal in measure (there are in fact two pairs of equal base angles, where one base angle is the supplementary angle of a base angle at the other base).

Please answer the following question: -  Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed -   What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step in the process of fossil formation, known as fossilization, typically begins with the death or deposition of an organism or its remains in a suitable environment that promotes preservation. This step is crucial in ensuring that the organism's remains have the best chance of undergoing the subsequent processes that ultimately lead to the creation of a fossil. There are several factors that contribute to a suitable environment and influence the chances of fossilization: 1. Rapid burial: Upon the death of an organism, its remains become susceptible to decay from exposure to elements, scavengers, or decomposition by microorganisms. In order to minimize the risk of destruction, rapid burial by sediments or other materials is essential. This may occur in various settings, such as riverbanks, lake bottoms, ocean floors, or sand dunes, where the remains can be quickly covered by sediments or other organic materials. 2. Anoxic conditions: The initial setting of burial plays a significant role in preserving the remains. In anoxic (or low-oxygen) conditions, the rate of decomposition is considerably slowed, allowing for the preservation of soft tissues in addition to hard parts such as bones, shells, or teeth. This can occur in deep oceanic environments, stagnant water bodies, or within certain types of sedimentary deposits. 3. Low-energy environment: A low-energy environment, meaning one where there is little physical disturbance due to water currents, wind, or other forces, is also important in promoting fossil preservation. Such an environment reduces the likelihood that the remains will be moved, damaged, or destroyed during the burial process, allowing for proper preservation. Some examples of low-energy environments include deep ocean floors, lagoons, or quiet lakes and ponds. 4. Geological stability: Over long periods, the remains of the organism must be protected from external forces to preserve their structural integrity. These external forces include factors such as erosion, tectonic activity, and extreme changes in temperature and pressure. Geological stability is necessary for maintaining the integrity of the remains as they gradually transform into fossils. 5. Early mineralization: In some cases, the early stages of fossilization can begin even before the organism is completely buried. This often occurs when the remains become infiltrated with mineral-rich waters that deposit minerals within the cellular structure of the organism, thus aiding the preservation and providing a scaffold for later stages of mineralization. In summary, the first step in the process of fossil formation often begins with the death or deposition of an organism or its remains in a suitable environment that promotes preservation, ensuring that the remains have the best chance of undergoing the subsequent processes leading to the creation of a fossil. Rapid burial, anoxic conditions, a low-energy environment, geological stability, and early mineralization all play a crucial role in this complex and fascinating process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Philip Alfred Mickelson (born June 16, 1970), nicknamed Lefty, is an American professional golfer. He has won 43 events on the PGA Tour, including five major championships: three Masters titles (2004, 2006, 2010), a PGA Championship (2005), and an Open Championship (2013). Mickelson is one of 16 players in the history of golf to win at least three of the four majors. He has won every major except the U.S. Open, where he has finished runner-up a record six times. Mickelson attended Arizona State University in Tempe on a golf scholarship and became the face of amateur golf in the United States, capturing three NCAA individual championships and three Haskins Awards (1990, 1991, 1992) as the outstanding collegiate golfer. With three individual NCAA championships, he shares the record for most individual NCAA championships alongside Ben Crenshaw. Mickelson also led the Sun Devils to the NCAA team title in 1990. Over the course of his collegiate career, he won 16 tournaments.  Mickelson was the second collegiate golfer to earn first-team All-American honors all four years. In 1990, he also became the first with a left-handed swing to win the U.S. Amateur title. Mickelson secured perhaps his greatest achievement as an amateur in January 1991, winning his first PGA Tour event, the Northern Telecom Open, in Tucson. At age 20, he was only the sixth amateur to win a tour event and the first in over five years after Scott Verplank at the Western Open in August 1985. Other players to accomplish this feat include Doug Sanders (1956 Canadian Open) and Gene Littler (1954 San Diego Open). With five holes remaining, Mickelson led by a stroke, but made a triple-bogey and was then three behind. The leaders ahead of him then stumbled, and he birdied 16 and 18 to win by a stroke. To date, it is the most recent win by an amateur at a PGA Tour event.  That April, Mickelson was the low amateur at the Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia. With his two-year PGA Tour exemption from the Tucson win, he played in several tour events in 1992 while an amateur but failed to make a cut.

He is remembered mostly for his spectacular demonstrations of rocket propulsion that earned him the nickname \`\` Rocket Fritz '' . Opel was born in Rüsselsheim and educated at the technical university of Darmstadt . After graduation , he was made director of testing for the Opel company and also put in charge of publicity . In the 1920s , he became interested in using rockets in publicity stunts for the company and sought advice from Max Valier of the newly formed Verein für Raumschiffahrt ( VfR - \`\` Spaceflight Society '' ) and Friedrich Sander , a pyrotechnics manufacturer from Bremerhaven . On 15 March 1928 Opel tested his first rocket - powered car , the RAK.1 , and achieved a top speed of 75 km / h ( 47 mph ) in it , proving the feasibility of the concept of rocket propulsion . Less than two months later , he reached a speed of 230 km / h ( 143 mph ) in the RAK.2 , driven by 24 solid - fuel rockets . Later that same year , he purchased a sailplane named the \`\` Lippisch Ente '' ( Ente is \`\` duck '' in German ) from Alexander Lippisch and attached rocket motors to it , creating the world 's first rocket plane on 11 June . The aircraft exploded on its second test flight , before Opel had had a chance to pilot it himself , so he commissioned a new aircraft , also called the RAK.1 , from Julius Hatry , and flew it at Frankfurt - am - Main on 30 September 1929 . In the meantime , another mishap had claimed the RAK.3 , a rocket - powered railway car powered by 30 solid - fuel rockets which had reached a speed of 254 km / h ( 157 mph ) . Also in 1928 , Opel built and test ran a rocket - powered motorcycle called the Monster . Opel left the family firm and Germany after 1929 .

Summarize the following: Apply some glue to the side of the teardrop, from the bottom point up to where it starts to curve into a dome. Press your first petal, tabbed side down, into the glue. Continue gluing the petals, one by one, until you complete your first row. Hot glue sets quickly, so work only one petal at a time. If you look at your teardrop, you will see some gaps between the petals. Fill those gaps with glue, then press more petals into the glue. Coat the bottom portion of the teardrop with glue. Wrap the fringe around it, with the jagged side facing up. The bottom edge should extend past the bottom of the tear drop and onto the stem. Cut off any excess fringe hanging off the side. Gently pinch the bottom part of the fringe, then twist it slightly around the wire. If you need to, secure the twisted part to the wire with a strip of florist's tape. Begin wrapping from the base of the fringe, where the pinched/twisted part is. Continue wrapping all the way to the bottom of the stem. Place the bottom point of the leaf against the stem and pinch it. Give it a slight twist, then secure it with green florist's tape. Repeat this step for all of the leaves you made. You can have them as close together or as far apart as you want. Some daisies are open all the way while others are closed. You can leave your daisy closed, if you want to, or you can gently pull down on the petals to open it up.

Please answer the following question: As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study.

However, his world is suddenly destabilised by a series of unexplained murders (including Harold's best friend, Colin) and exploding bombs from an unknown foe. He and his henchmen try to uncover his attackers' identity whilst simultaneously trying not to worry their American visitors, who Harold believes will not go into business with him if they think he's not in full control of his affairs. The situation worsens when a pub in which they are about to have dinner at is blown up and Harold's partner, Victoria, tells the Americans that they are under attack from an unknown enemy. She suspects that Harold's right hand man, Jeff, knows more than he has been letting on about the attacks, while Jeff simultaneously starts to fear that Harold might be onto him and tries to prevent people from talking through intimidation. After some detective work, Harold confronts Jeff, who confesses that he sent Harold's friend Colin on a job to Belfast to deliver money raised by Irish Navvies (construction workers) to the IRA. When Harold discovers Jeff accepted a job to deliver funds to the IRA, he becomes extremely angry and vows to destroy the IRA in London. Jeff advises against this and explains that the IRA aren't just annoyed about some of the money which had gone missing, but also wrongly hold Harold responsible for the murder of three IRA men.

Since we do not have any information about Parviz Sorkhabi, determining their credibility is not possible. 2. Context and Relevance - A review should offer insights and opinions relevant to the subject being reviewed. This could involve sharing personal experiences, comparing it to other cases, or analyzing its features. Unfortunately, this review only has a name and does not provide any context, making it impossible to assess its relevance. 3. Detail and Substance - A useful review typically contains specific information about a product or service, providing potential users with a better understanding of what they can expect. Once again, the given review does not have any substance or specific details about the subject. 4. Coherence and Clarity - Effective reviews are well-organized, making it easier for readers to understand the points being made.

After several small tests to determine Rodrigo's trustworthiness, he suggests a partnership, to which Rodrigo quickly agrees. Although Rodrigo distrusts Richard greatly, he agrees to partner him on a gigantic scam, provided he gets a percentage of the money gained to help his ailing father, who is in trouble because of his gambling debts.   Richard accepts, and they plan to sell a fraudulent version of a silver certificate currency note to William Hannigan, a rich collector who is in town. Gyllenhaal plays Gaddis' sister Valerie, a concierge at a hotel.  When Hannigan takes a fancy to the uptight but very sexy Valerie, Gaddis is forced to pull her into the scam, the price of which is Richard's admission to their brother Michael that he has cheated him out of his share of their inheritance. The plot twists constantly as each of the characters becomes more deeply invested in the scam, and the ever-deceitful Richard tries to cheat Rodrigo, Valerie and Michael out of their share of the take. In the twist ending, it is revealed that all the major players involved, including Rodrigo and Hannigan, were playing a confidence game against Gaddis from the very beginning, so that Valerie and Michael could rightfully take their share of their inheritance.

The move prompted howls of protests from supporters of the whistleblowing organization as well as American conservatives, who have found ammunition in a trove of private Democratic National Committee emails released in recent weeks by Assange's outfit. Ecuadoran officials and their counterparts in the State Department have denied that the move to cut off his Internet access was prompted by U.S. government pressure, as my colleague Nick Miroff reports.      But all was not quite lost for Assange. On Wednesday morning, Bobby Mair, a Canadian comedian based in the British capital, appeared outside the Ecuadoran Embassy with a megaphone and a sign around his neck that read “Julian Assange's personal Internet service.” He then proceeded to shout out headlines and tidbits of global information into what presumably is Assange's window.

Midway through releasing a series of damaging disclosures about U.S. presidential contender Hillary Clinton, WikiLeaks founder... (Associated Press)      QUITO, Ecuador (AP) — WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is finding himself in open conflict with his Ecuadorean protectors as the group's latest dump targeting Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign runs afoul of the South American government's goal of warming up to Washington.      Ecuador's move to cut off his internet access at its embassy in London was a stinging rebuke from leftist President Rafael Correa, who in 2012 heralded Assange as a digital-age Robin Hood and granted him asylum over protests from the United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden, where he faces allegations of rape.      Correa's government said Tuesday that WikiLeaks' publication of a trove of damaging emails from Clinton's campaign had impacted the U.S. election in violation of Ecuador's traditional respect for other nations' sovereignty.      Analysts say Correa is unlikely to now kick Assange out into the streets of London where he faces certain arrest. But allowing him to keep leaking secrets from the embassy risks putting the small Andean nation unwittingly on Russia's side of a brewing cyber-battle with the United States, Ecuador's top trade partner, at a time of deep economic stress.      \\"Before, the costs for Ecuador of hosting Assange were minor,\\" said Santiago Basabe, a political analyst at the Latin American School of Social Sciences in Quito. \\"But they are growing bigger now because they involve questions of U.S. national security, its tense relations with Russia and the presidential elections.\\"      The cascade of disclosures of Democratic operatives' hacked emails, including this week's publication of Clinton's speeches to Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs, has been hailed by Republican candidate Donald Trump as evidence of his rival's dishonesty. However, U.S. intelligence agents say the hack is the work of the Kremlin, although it's not clear how the files ended up with WikiLeaks.      Regardless, Ecuador has plenty of reasons to try to curry favor with Washington.      The oil-dependent, dollarized economy is fighting a recession made worse by low crude prices, a destructive earthquake in April and a strong U.S. dollar. Adding to the uncertainty is Correa's imminent departure from office after a decade in power that provided a sense of stability after years of coups and revolving-door presidencies.      Analysts say whoever wins February's election — Correa's preferred successor currently leads polls — is almost certain to turn to the International Monetary Fund for a bailout. In such a scenario the support of the Washington, the biggest shareholder in the IMF, will be key in determining how severe an austerity program is required.      \\"Assange has inserted Ecuador in the U.S. presidential campaign and exposed it to retaliation in case Clinton wins,\\" said former Foreign Minister Mauricio Gandara, adding that the publication of stolen documents is considered a crime in Ecuador.      Correa, who in 2009 closed the only U.S. military base in South America and two years later expelled the U.S. ambassador, still peppers his speeches with anti-Yankee harangues in the mold of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.      But with Venezuela in economic freefall and ideological allies losing power in countries like Argentina and Brazil, Correa has quietly extended an olive branch to the Obama administration and sought to deepen commercial ties. This week he's hosting a U.S. trade delegation.      Correa also praised Clinton in an interview last month with Moscow-based broadcaster RT.      \\"For the good of the United States and the world, and for my personal appreciation of her, I'd like to see Hillary win,\\" he said.      Tensions between Assange and his hosts have surfaced before. In 2013, Correa criticized him for shooting a video from the embassy mocking Australian politicians during a political campaign.      On Tuesday, Ecuador said WikiLeaks' \\"journalistic activities\\" would not be affected by the \\"temporary restrictions\\" on Assange's communications.      Assange accused Ecuador of bowing to U.S. pressure and alleged that Secretary of State John Kerry discussed the issue with Correa last month in Colombia, something both Washington and Quito deny.      It seems unlikely he will submit to the internet ban quietly. Over the weekend WikiLeaks released three lines of code it described as \\"pre-commitments,\\" labeling them \\"John Kerry,\\" ''Ecuador,\\" and \\"FCO\\" — an apparent reference to Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Pre-commitments are cryptographic functions that can be used to verify the integrity of material released subsequently.      Security experts interpreted that as a warning to the named parties that WikiLeaks has ammunition in reserve that could embarrass his hosts as well.      For most Ecuadoreans, Assange's case seems like a Hollywood spy movie with little bearing on their daily life. But even Correa's opponents have shown little enthusiasm for revoking the Australian's asylum.      \\"We can't just throw him out of the embassy from night to day because he could be exposed to risks,\\" opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Lasso said last month, even while arguing that Assange was breaking the conditions of his asylum.      ___      AP writers Joshua Goodman in Bogota, Colombia, and Raphael Satter in Paris contributed to this report. ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Arkin and Robert Windrem      Quiet pressure from the U.S. government played a role in Ecuador’s decision to block WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange from using the internet at Ecuador’s London embassy, U.S. officials told NBC News.      “It was a bit of an eviction notice,” said a senior intelligence official.      Ecuador's government said Tuesday it had partly restricted internet access for Assange, the founder of anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, who has lived in the South American country's London embassy for more than four years. A source familiar with the situation says the Ecuadoran government has been frustrated with Assange and his presence at the embassy in London for months and has been considering how best to proceed.      The action came after U.S. officials conveyed their conclusion that Assange is a willing participant in a Russian intelligence operation to undermine the U.S. presidential election, NBC News has learned. U.S. intelligence officials believe Assange knows he is getting the information from Russian intelligence, though they do not believe he is involved in helping plan the hacking, officials told NBC.      “The general view is he is a willing participant in the Russian scheme but not an active plotter in it. They just realized they could use him,” said a senior intelligence official.      “It was a bit of an eviction notice.”      WikiLeaks has been posting the private emails of Clinton adviser John Podesta and other Democratic officials that the U.S. says were hacked by, or on behalf of, Russian intelligence agencies. WikiLeaks said Assange’s internet access was cut off Sunday. In a statement, Ecuador said the decision was its own.      “Ecuador, exercising its sovereign right, has temporarily restricted access to part of its communications systems in its UK Embassy,\\" the statement said.      \\"The Ecuador government respects the principle of non-intervention in other countries' affairs, it does not meddle in election processes underway, nor does it support any candidate specially.\\"      A senior administration official said that the U.S. did not push Ecuador to cut Assange off from the internet: \\"Reports that the U.S. government, to include the Intelligence Community, pressured the Ecuadorian government to interrupt internet service within Ecuador's embassy in London are not accurate.\\"      The State Department said it did not pressure Ecuador or play any other role in blocking Assange's internet access.      \\"While our concerns about WikiLeaks are longstanding, any suggestion that Secretary (John) Kerry or the State Department were involved in shutting down WikiLeaks is false,\\" State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement.      However, U.S. intelligence officials told NBC that a message was conveyed to Ecuador that it should stop allowing Assange to carry water for Russian intelligence agencies, and that Ecuador, though run by a leftist, anti-American government, was receptive.      The U.S. moves come as bipartisan concern is growing about the alleged Russian interference amid a daily release of Podesta emails.      Marco Rubio, who is running to retain his Florida Senate seat after losing the Republican presidential primary to Donald Trump, urged members of his party not to seek to capitalize on emails stolen by Russian spies.      \\"As our intelligence agencies have said, these leaks are an effort by a foreign government to interfere with our electoral process, and I will not indulge it,” Rubio told ABC News. \\"Further, I want to warn my fellow Republicans who may want to capitalize politically on these leaks: Today it is the Democrats. Tomorrow it could be us.\\" ||||| Summary:","output":"The Ecuadorian Embassy in London has cut off WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange's internet access, so Canadian comedian Bobby Mair offered to read him highlights of the internet through a megaphone.

However, in predominant Protestant usage, the term is not seen as referring to a member of a distinctive priesthood called \\"priests,\\" but instead terms such as \\"minister\\", \\"pastor\\" and \\"elder\\" are used.  - A ritual \\"is a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, and objects, performed in a sequestered place, and performed according to set sequence.\\" Rituals may be prescribed by the traditions of a community, including a religious community. Rituals are characterized but not defined by formalism, traditionalism, invariance, rule-governance, sacral symbolism, and performance.  - Sacrifice is the offering of food, objects or the lives of animals to a higher purpose, in particular divine beings, as an act of propitiation or worship. While \\"sacrifice\\" often implies ritual killing, the term offering (Latin \\"oblatio\\") can be used for bloodless sacrifices of food or artifacts. For offerings of liquids (beverages) by pouring, the term libation is used.  - The Poles (; singular masculine: \\"Polak\\", singular feminine: \\"Polka\\") are a nation and West Slavic ethnic group native to Poland. The population of Poles in Poland is estimated at 37,394,000 out of an overall population of 38,538,000 (based on the 2011 census). Poland's population inhabits several historic regions, including Greater Poland, Lesser Poland, Mazovia, Silesia, Pomerania, Kuyavia, Warmia (Ermland), Masuria, and Podlachia.  - Latin or Roman script is a set of graphic signs (script) based on the letters of the classical Latin alphabet, which is derived from a form of the Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, used by the Etruscans. Latin script is used as the standard method of writing in most Western and Central European languages, as well as in many languages in other parts of the world.  - Old High German (OHG, , German abbr. \\"\\") is the earliest stage of the German language, conventionally covering the period from around 700 to 1050 AD. Coherent written texts do not appear until the second half of the 8th century, and some treat the period before 750 as \\"prehistoric\\" and date the start of Old High German proper to 750 for this reason. There are, however, a number of Elder Futhark inscriptions dating to the 6th century (notably the Pforzen buckle), as well as single words and many names found in Latin texts predating the 8th century.  - Polish (\\"jzyk polski\\", \\"polszczyzna\\") is a West Slavic language spoken primarily in Poland and is the native language of the Poles. It belongs to the Lechitic subgroup of the West Slavic languages. Polish is the official language of Poland, but it is also used throughout the world by Polish minorities in other countries. It is one of the official languages of the European Union. Its written standard is the Polish alphabet, which has 9 additions to the letters of the basic Latin script (\\"\\", \\"\\", \\"\\", \\"\\", \\"\\", \\"ó\\", \\"\\", \\"\\", \\"\\"). Polish is closely related to Kashubian, Silesian, Upper Sorbian, Lower Sorbian, Czech and Slovak.  - Franz Scholz ( 10 December 1909 -- 1 September 1998 ) was a German priest and professor of theology from Breslau , Silesia . He had eight brothers and two sisters . His youngest brother Gerhard is now 86 . He studied at Breslau 's Catholic St. - Matthias - Gymnasium , then Caritas Science at Freiburg .

But if you ask a doctor, he can see a whole lot more. Everything from poor diet and stress to serious kidney   problems can be revealed by a glance at your fingernails. There are about 30 different nail signs that can be associated with medical issues, though may indicate more than one problem, according to Dr.Amy Derick, a clinical instructor of dermatology at Northwestern University. Here are five of the things a doctor can tell about your health based on your fingernails. 1. People who aren't eating well and lack vitamin or dietary may have thinner than normal nails, which are more likely to break. 2.Horizontal   lines are associated with serious physical stress. They frequently occur in people who have gone through chemotherapy .They can also occur after some illnesses, injuries, or with severe malnourishment .Interestingly, there may be an altitude connection too. They've also been found in people who dove 1,000 feet and others who participated in an Everest exploration. 3. Vertical  lines, however, are generally not such a big deal. Some people are more genetically prone to them than others, but they're commonly associated with aging. 4. When people lack iron, their nails can turn spoon-like. Instead of curving down and covering the finger normally, they 'll start to rise up on the sides and front, like the part of a spoon that holds liquid. 5. Kidney and liver problems can create \\"half-and-half nails\\", where one part of the nail is white and the other part dark or pink, according to Derick. Doctors note that because disease diagnosis is complex and some symptoms can be associated with different diseases, you should always see a medical professional if you are concerned about something you notice. What is the main idea of the passage? A) Doctors can tell us something about our health by looking at our nails. B) We should see a doctor if we find nails in bad condition.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Charlie  for the following movie plot:  Arthur Goldman is Jewish and a Nazi death camp survivor. Now a rich industrialist, he lives in luxury in a Manhattan high-rise. He banters with his assistant Charlie, often shocking him with his outrageousness and irreverence about aspects of Jewish life. One day, Israeli secret agents kidnap Goldman and take him to Israel for trial on charges of being a Nazi war criminal. Goldman's trial forces his accusers to face not only his presumed guilt, but their own as well. At the end it appears that Goldman falsified the dental records which the Israelis used to identify him in order to bring about the trial. When the deception is revealed by the Israeli prosecutor, Goldman is left standing in the trial court's bulletproof glass box, a broken man. The stress shatters his mental health, and he becomes catatonic. He then relives in his mind a Nazi firing squad execution and dies.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). Palindromes have been of interest to linguists, mathematicians, and recreational puzzle enthusiasts for many centuries. The palindrome \\"A man a plan a canal Panama\\" was attributed to Leigh Mercer, a British wordplay expert, and first appeared in the November 13, 1948, issue of \\"Notes and Queries,\\" a scholarly journal for the discussion of historical and etymological topics. This particular palindrome is remarkable because of its length, coherence, and historical significance. The phrase itself references the construction of the Panama Canal, an artificial waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The canal's construction was a challenging and ambitious project, involving many people, notably the French engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps and the American President Theodore Roosevelt, as well as a significant amount of planning and engineering expertise. A closer look at the palindrome reveals a logical progression of ideas that makes it more meaningful than many other examples of palindromes, which are often nonsensical or purely pattern-based: - \\"A man\\" can represent the individuals responsible for the canal's creation, such as the aforementioned visionaries, politicians, and engineers. - \\"A plan\\" signifies the immense strategic efforts and various planning phases involved in such an ambitious endeavor. - \\"A canal\\" denotes the actual physical construction and existence of the Panama Canal. - \\"Panama\\" is the geographical location where the canal was built, a vital link between two major oceans. Given this context, \\"A man a plan a canal Panama\\" is not only an impressive palindrome but also a succinct summary of the significant human effort required to make the Panama Canal a reality. In summary, the phrase \\"A man a plan a canal Panama\\" is a celebrated example of a palindrome, a linguistic construction that reads the same forward and backward. It provides a meaningful, albeit condensed, account of the Panama Canal's development and exemplifies the ingenuity and expertise of those behind its creation, making it a noteworthy example of playful yet purposeful language use."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

CHAPTER 30  She's a winsome wee thing, She's a handsome wee thing, She's a bonnie wee thing, This sweet wee wifie of mine. --BURNS  'Look here, Amy,' said Guy, pointing to a name in the traveller's book at Altdorf.  'Captain Morville!' she exclaimed, 'July 14th. That was only the day before yesterday.'  'I wonder whether we shall overtake him! Do you know what was this gentleman's route?' inquired Guy, in French that was daily becoming more producible.  The gentleman having come on foot, with nothing but his knapsack, had not made much sensation. There was a vague idea that he had gone on to the St. Gothard; but the guide who was likely to know, was not forthcoming, and all Guy's inquiries only resulted in, 'I dare say we shall hear of him elsewhere.'  To tell the truth, Amabel was not much disappointed, and she could see, though he said nothing, that Guy was not very sorry. These two months had been so very happy, there had been such full enjoyment, such freedom from care and vexation, or aught that could for a moment ruffle the stream of delight. Scenery, cathedrals music, paintings, historical association, had in turn given unceasing interest and pleasure; and, above all, Amabel had been growing more and more into the depths of her husband's mind, and entering into the grave, noble thoughts inspired by the scenes they were visiting. It had been a sort of ideal happiness, so exquisite, that she could hardly believe it real. A taste of society, which they had at Munich, though very pleasant, had only made them more glad to be alone together again; any companion would have been an interruption, and Philip, so intimate, yet with his carping, persecuting spirit towards Guy, was one of the last persons she could wish to meet; but knowing that this was by no means a disposition Guy wished to encourage, she held her peace.  1.

There is currently no precise test with the diagnosis typically based on the pattern of symptoms and response to therapy over time. A diagnosis of asthma should be suspected if there is a history of: recurrent wheezing, coughing or difficulty breathing and these symptoms occur or worsen due to exercise, viral infections, allergens or air pollution. Spirometry is then used to confirm the diagnosis. In children under the age of six the diagnosis is more difficult as they are too young for spirometry. When should you suspect asthma?","output":"You should suspect asthma if there is a history of: 1. Recurrent wheezing: Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound made while breathing, particularly during exhalation, and is a common symptom of asthma. 2. Coughing: A persistent or recurrent cough, especially during the night or after exercise, may indicate asthma. 3. Difficulty breathing: Experiencing shortness of breath or trouble breathing, especially during activities or at night, could be a sign of asthma. Additionally, if these symptoms occur or worsen due to certain triggers, it further supports the suspicion of asthma. These triggers may include: 1. Exercise: If symptoms are triggered or worsened by physical activity, it may be a sign of exercise-induced asthma. 2. Viral infections: Asthma symptoms can be triggered or exacerbated by respiratory infections, such as the common cold or flu. 3. Allergens: Exposure to allergens like pollen, pet dander, or dust mites can provoke asthma symptoms in some individuals. 4. Air pollution: Airborne irritants and pollutants, such as smoke or smog, can worsen asthma symptoms. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional if you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms for proper diagnosis and management.

It wasn't so secret about a week ago when I discovered his public profile on Instagram, where he was posting dramatic photos and soulful \\"Versagrams\\" (graphical text messages), for all the world to see. One moment he was in love, the next full of despair. I was stunned. My 11-year-old son has never let on that he is remotely interested in girls. Not a word. And he's not exactly the middle school kid with swagger. He's a relatively shy guy. Yet, his Instagram avatar was boldly flirting with a girl, prolifically posting inside jokes about his crush and inviting commentary not only from his school friends, but also from a far-flung social network of kids from Connecticut to New Jersey who I am certain he's never met in person. His phone was beeping nonstop for three days, with a stream of frenzied text messages and Instagram posts. Something big was going on. My son wanted to ask a girl out. Did she like him, too? He wasn't sure, but from what I saw online, this was hardly confidential information. His plan for asking her out was getting circulated in cyberspace and he had several kids weighing in on both the strategy and his likelihood for success. He was fully exposed on multiple virtual platforms, and that was terrifying to me. He clearly didn't understand the full impact of online activity. What should I do? Young people and social media: Docs examine pitfalls. When my son was sleeping, I was checking the text messages and followed the Instagram updates -- after all, this wasn't really sneaking if my son maintained a public profile. But what could I say? Should I tell him that I am monitoring his moves? Was my looking at text messages the same as reading a diary? Was I violating my son's privacy and simply making too much of this? My husband told me to back off, that our son was merely a kid with a crush who needed to experience this rite of passage on his own, without a hovering mother. But I wasn't so sure. Like many parents, I am struggling with the boundaries of monitoring my kids' online activities. Is it an invasion of our children's privacy to intercept or check their text messages, or have the rules changed for parents because of the pure power and danger of technology? Am I justified in cyberstalking my own son? A first crush is hard enough, but I am trying to protect him from the embarrassment that can come from exposing this personal experience online. Adults know that a careless e-mail, text message, tweet or photo posting can cost someone not only their reputation, but also their career. The scandal over former CIA Director David Petraeus' extramarital affair apparently started with an e-mail breach. If the CIA director can get sloppy with personal e-mails, how can we trust a kid to handle these tools any better? How to raise a winning child. Experts say that it's important for parents to proactively monitor their kids' online behavior. \\"It's snooping only if we don't tell them we're doing it,\\" said Scott Steinberg the author of the best-selling \\"Modern Parent's Guide\\" series. \\"You need to have the discussion up front about why you are there and why you are monitoring their online activity. Passively knowing that a parent is present can alter kids' behavior online. Parents won't intrude on their kids' experience if they do it in a way that's upfront and straightforward.\\" Parenting in a post-Facebook era where a new, must-have, social media app is churned out every two minutes makes monitoring exhausting, if not impossible. But while I believe my son knows not to communicate with \\"strangers,\\" the way he's exposing his life in cyberspace is making me tense. But he's hardly alone. The photos and messages that his fellow tween friends post on Instagram alternate between silly and provocative. Maybe it's the digital photo-filters, but the girls seem sexy beyond their years. While it's our duty as parents to teach our kids responsibility with technology, how much can we interfere with their freedom of expression? Steinberg says it's important that parents are educated about what's out there and are on top of their kids' online behavior without getting totally crazy. He says that parents can't just hand their kids digital devices and expect that they understand netiquette. But at the same time, parents need to respect boundaries. Confessions of a busy mom: 5 lessons. \\"Just because you can see what's online doesn't mean that you should obsess over it and micromanage every text message,\\" Steinberg said. \\"There are boundaries for parents as well. And at the end of the day, you don't want to become paranoid. You really just want to open an honest dialogue and positive computing. You can't put your kid on a leash, virtual or otherwise.\\" After agonizing for a few nights over how to handle it all, I told my son that he needed to change his settings to private so pedophiles and other \\"creepy people\\" can't follow his posts. He's a clever kid and understood that I was on to him. It was an unspoken acknowledgment that I had seen what he was putting out there. So he's gone private. The settings are locked. I asked if I could follow him on Instagram and he immediately said no. Steinberg would say that parents need to \\"friend\\" their kids or follow them online. But what if they refuse? It's well known that kids can be stealth and may \\"friend\\" their parents on one site or app, but post on another. Parents can pull the plug on the technology perhaps for a little while, or you can sneak a peak at their phones and devices, like I do regularly now, without any guilt. Like CNN Living on Facebook.

She discusses the challenges of finding the right balance between respecting her child's privacy and ensuring that he is being responsible with technology. The author also cites the opinion of an expert, Scott Steinberg, who suggests that parents should proactively monitor their kids' online behavior but also have an upfront discussion with them about why they are doing it. Steinberg stresses the importance of parents being educated about what is out there and staying on top of their kids' online activities without obsessing over every detail.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. You are expected to classify the comment into two classes: threat and non-threat. Threat is a statement that someone will be hurt or harmed, especially if the person does not do something in particular. Q: Comment: Shouldn't you be shooting up a pizza place? A:","output":"This is a tricky question because it seems to reference violent activity (shooting), but the context is unclear. However, it does come across as offensive and could be interpreted as a veiled threat, especially if it's directed towards a specific individual. It doesn't directly state that the person \\"will\\" be harmed, so in the most strict interpretation, it might not be categorized completely as a threat. However, the violent undertone cannot be ignored. Step 1: Identify the context - In this step, we look for any sign of potential harm indicated either directly or indirectly. Here, although the harm isn't directly pointed out, the phrase \\"shooting up\\" carries a violent connotation, which indicates potential threat. Step 2: Determine the target - It is unclear who the target is. However, due to the violent nature of the comment, this could potentially be directed towards a specific individual, group, or entity. Step 3: Consider the intent - The user comment seems to be a rhetorical question with negative implications. In a certain context, it may be a sarcastic comment or a bully's remark, so the intention could be to intimidate or instigate a reaction. After detailed analysis on the given information, I would classify this comment as a 'threat' due to its violent connotation and potential harm that could happen in the scenario it describes. The classification also incorporates the potential for harm not only to a specific individual, but potentially any individual linked to the comment's scenario. The safety and mental health of the individuals using these platforms should be a top priority, and erring on the side of caution in situations with potential for harm is best."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

This option does not contribute significantly to the goal of making money. 4. \\"feel resentful\\" - Feeling resentful is an emotional state, not an action that would lead to making money.

Write a title for this article: British businessman Shrien Dewani left South Africa on Tuesday a day after being acquitted of arranging the murder of his wife on their honeymoon in Cape Town. Journalists witnessed Dewani board an Emirates flight to Dubai from Cape Town international airport. He is believed to be travelling via Dubai back to the UK, where he will pick up his life again four years after he was arrested at the request of the South African authorities who wanted to speak to him about his wife’s murder during their honeymoon. Dewani, 34, was escorted through the airport and ushered through security towards his flight. He looked calm and self-composed as he walked into the airport, wearing a tight white shirt and dark jeans, and stared resolutely ahead as police officers helped him through a waiting media scrum. Accompanied by his family and officials from the British consulate in Cape Town, Dewani did not check in directly, but walked straight though to international departures. About a dozen South African police officers were also present to ensure the Briton was able to enter the airport freely. He did not respond to journalists’ questions and stared ahead as photographers and TV crews jostled to take his picture. Dewani is free to return to the UK after the judge, Jeanette Traverso, dismissed the case against him on Monday, describing evidence against him as being “riddled with contradictions”. The collapse of the trial in Cape Town left his wife’s family devastated and Anni’s uncle, Ashok Hindocha, said they were exploring the possibility of taking legal action in the bid to find answers. Hindocha said the decision to halt the trial before Dewani gave evidence meant there were “holes to be filled” in the story about his niece’s final days. Speaking from Sweden, he told the Guardian: “We were hoping for closure. We still do not have that but hope that we will have it in the near future. We need to get the family together here and see what options we have, what possibilities we have to continue the process. “There is still determination to continue. Otherwise we will have sleepless nights for the rest of our lives. We choose determination.” The family will gather in Sweden over Christmas to plan their next moves. “We need to be together; we’ve been away from each other for a long time now – some of the family here, some in the UK, some in South Africa. All we’ve had is telephone contact. We really need to speak all together and speak to lawyers and see what options we have.” Hindocha said the family’s “number one” option was some sort of legal action in the UK. Hindocha said Dewani, whose legal team said in court that he was bisexual, had lied to the family and to Anni about his sexuality. “He lied the moment he told Anni that he loved her and they were in a serious relationship. He lied to the priest in India [where the couple married]. He should have spoken the truth and said: ‘Look Anni, I love you but I’m gay, bisexual.’ I think that is a crucial thing. When you go into a long-term relationship you must be honest.” Of the legal process in Cape Town, he said: “We didn’t get the full story out of South Africa. The judge wouldn’t allow it. There were crucial points to be debated.” He conceded there were holes in the evidence of taxi driver Zola Tongo. “But I’m sure many of those holes could have been filled if Shrien had been cross-examined. We never got the answers. We never got the chance to know. He’s never been cross-examined. The judge in South Africa bought everything that Shrien’s lawyer said.” Asked about what he thought of the image of Dewani leaving South Africa via Cape Town airport, Hindocha said: “We never said who is guilty, who is not guilty. Our objective has been that we want to know the truth. We did not get it from South Africa. We are hoping in the near future to get this truth.” Title:","output":"\\"Shrien Dewani Acquitted and Departs South Africa: Wife's Family Seeks Further Legal Action for Closure\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Information:  - William John Swainson FLS, FRS (8 October 1789  6 December 1855), was an English ornithologist, malacologist, conchologist, entomologist and artist.  - Nicholas Aylward Vigors (1785  26 October 1840) was an Irish zoologist and politician. He popularized the classification of birds on the basis of the quinarian system.  - William Sharp Macleay or McLeay (21 July 1792  26 January 1865) was a British civil servant and entomologist.  - Johann Jakob Kaup ( April 10 , 1803 - July 4 , 1873 ) was a German naturalist . A proponent of natural philosophy , he believed in an innate mathematical order in nature and he attempted biological classifications based on the Quinarian system .  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - Johann Jakob Kaup (10 April 1803  4 July 1873) was a German naturalist. A proponent of natural philosophy, he believed in an innate mathematical order in nature and he attempted biological classifications based on the Quinarian system. Biography. He was born at Darmstadt. After studying at Göttingen and Heidelberg he spent two years at Leiden, where his attention was specially devoted to the amphibians and fishes. He then returned to Darmstadt as an assistant in the grand ducal museum, of which in 1840 he became inspector. In 1829 he published \\"Skizze zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der europäischen Thierwelt\\", in which he regarded the animal world as developed from lower to higher forms, from the amphibians through the birds to the beasts of prey; but subsequently he repudiated this work as a youthful indiscretion, and on the publication of Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" he declared himself against its doctrines. The extensive fossil deposits in the neighbourhood of Darmstadt gave him ample opportunities for palaeontological inquiries, and he gained considerable reputation by his \\"Beiträge zur näheren Kenntniss der urweltlichen Säugethiere\\" (18551862). He also wrote \\"Classification der Säugethiere und Vögel\\" (1844), and, with Heinrich Georg Bronn, \\"Die Gavial-artigen Reste aus dem Lias\\" (18421844).  - The Quinarian system was a method of zoological classification which had a brief period of popularity in the mid 19th century, especially among British naturalists. It was largely developed by the entomologist William Sharp MacLeay in 1819. The system was further promoted in the works of Nicholas Aylward Vigors, William John Swainson and Johann Jakob Kaup. Swainson's work on ornithology gave wide publicity to the idea. The system had opponents even before the publication of Charles Darwin's \\"On the Origin of Species\\" (1859 ) which paved the way for evolutionary trees.  - Natural philosophy or philosophy of nature (from Latin \\"philosophia naturalis\\") was the philosophical study of nature and the physical universe that was dominant before the development of modern science. It is considered to be the precursor of natural science.    What object entity has the relation of 'date of death' with the subject 'johann jakob kaup'?

Riparian areas refer to the interface between the land and a river or stream. These areas are characterized by moist and fertile soil, making them an ideal location for a wide variety of plant species to thrive. Beavers depend on an abundance of woody vegetation, such as willows and cottonwoods, for both food and building materials for their dams and lodges. When wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park in the 1990s, it resulted in what is called a \\"trophic cascade.\\" Trophic cascades occur when the presence or absence of a top predator, such as the wolf, has a direct or indirect impact on other species' populations within an ecosystem. One of the significant impacts of this cascade was on the grazing behavior of elk, which are the primary prey of wolves. Before the reintroduction of wolves, large elk populations overgrazed the riparian areas, consuming nearly all of the young trees and shrubs. This intense grazing pressure led to a decrease in habitat quality and food availability for animals like beavers. However, once wolves were reintroduced, they began to prey on the elk and also altered their grazing patterns. Elk now spent less time in riparian areas to avoid being ambushed by wolves. This allowed the vegetation to recover, providing beavers with more food sources and building materials for their dams and lodges. Furthermore, the presence of beaver dams can create wetland habitats that support diverse plant and animal communities, which can benefit a variety of species, including the wolves themselves. In this way, the relationship between wolves and beavers in Yellowstone National Park is mutually beneficial and highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced ecosystem with the presence of top predators. In conclusion, the statement accurately describes the indirect role wolves play in helping beavers eat well within Yellowstone National Park. The presence of wolves protects riparian areas from overgrazing by elk, allowing for the recovery of vital plant species that serve as the primary food source for beavers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article using the following points: 'He took me with the vulgarity of a soldier', says former colleague Anne Mansouret. Three years later her daughter Tristane Banon claims he tried to rape her like 'rutting chimpanzee' Was delay in coming forward down to her mother's relationship with the 'Great Seducer'? Article:","output":"Title: The Dark Side of the 'Great Seducer': Unraveling the Alleged Misconduct and its Impact on the Involved Parties Introduction: The recent surge of voices in the media and society has brought attention to the disturbing behavior of a man known as the 'Great Seducer'. His tumultuous relationships with women have raised concerns about the abuse of power and the culture of silence surrounding such incidents. In a shocking revelation, former colleague Anne Mansouret and her daughter Tristane Banon have described their encounters with the 'Great Seducer' in vivid, unsettling detail. This article will delve into their experiences and discuss the possible reasons for the delay in coming forward. Anne Mansouret's experience: In a candid interview, Anne Mansouret revealed the harrowing account of her encounter with the 'Great Seducer’. Mansouret expressed her shock and shame at the treatment she received, stating that \\"he took me with the vulgarity of a soldier.\\" The crude and forceful nature of the encounter left Mansouret feeling violated and humiliated. Such behavior from a powerful and influential figure in society is deeply troubling and raises questions about the ethics and integrity of powerful men. The fact that Mansouret suffered in silence for years highlights the fear that victims often feel when they consider confronting their abusers. Tristane Banon's allegations: Three years later, Mansouret's daughter, Tristane Banon, claimed to have faced a similar encounter with the 'Great Seducer'. In a chilling account, Banon described her alleged attacker as behaving like a \\"rutting chimpanzee\\" during her attempted rape. The graphic nature of her description underscores the horrifying nature of the experience. The fear and trauma experienced by Banon, and the knowledge of her mother's disturbing encounter, seemingly created a barrier that prevented her from coming forward earlier. This delay in reporting the incident reveals the complex emotions and complications that victims of abuse often face. The role of power dynamics and silence: The troubling aspect of these incidents is not just the violence and aggression perpetuated by the 'Great Seducer', but also the silence that surrounded these events for years. It raises vital questions about the role power dynamics play in preventing victims from speaking up and seeking justice. In the case of Anne Mansouret and Tristane Banon, one might argue that their delayed disclosure was influenced by the 'Great Seducer's' powerful position in society, as well as the fear of judgment and disbelief. This stifling impact on victims further perpetuates the culture of silence, which allows such behavior to continue unchecked. Conclusion: The shocking accounts of Anne Mansouret and Tristane Banon expose the darker side of the 'Great Seducer' and, on a broader scale, the darker side of power and privilege. As society grapples with allegations against influential figures, it is vital to break the silence and give a voice to victims. The stories of Mansouret and Banon serve as a harrowing reminder of the abuse that can occur in power dynamics, and the importance of empowering victims to come forward. Through the sharing of their experiences, they aim to shed light on the issue and, in turn, pave the way for other victims to overcome their fear and silence. As awareness grows, we must hold those who perpetuate such behavior accountable and cultivate a culture that supports and uplifts the voices of all victims."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Well-placed sources told BBC economics editor Robert Peston a decision to end the Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) would be made by the ECB's governing council later on Sunday. Greek banks depend on ELA funds daily. Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said his government would consider overnight what measures to take \\"to minimise the burden on our people\\". Cutting the ECB lifeline could push Greece out of the euro. Such an ECB cut would mean \\"Europe has failed\\", Mr Varoufakis told the BBC's World this Weekend. It would mean Europe had \\"failed in its duty to preserve in parallel a democratic process and a monetary union\\", he said. \\"It is a dark hour for Europe.\\" The lenders have \\"not met Greece even a quarter of the way\\", he complained. The government would consider \\"what can be done to minimise the burden on our people from Europe's refusal to grant us democratic rights\\". A BBC reporter in Athens says long queues are forming at bank ATMs. The EU-IMF bailout for heavily indebted Greece expires on Tuesday and talks have broken down. Greek banks would find themselves in serious straits as soon as Monday if the ECB cut the ELA funding, Robert Peston says. Greece will probably have to announce a bank holiday on Monday, pending the introduction of capital controls, he says. It is one of the most momentous decisions the ECB has ever faced, since the euro was launched on 1 January 1999. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the ECB \\"is independent but... I don't think it can cut off rations [for the Greeks]\\". He said \\"it's the Greek nation that is suffering\\". Capital controls are restrictions on how much customers can withdraw from banks. Until now, the Greek government has signalled that it does not want to impose such controls. In recent weeks, Greeks have withdrawn billions of euros from banks. A Greek withdrawal from the euro - known as \\"Grexit\\" - is not inevitable, says Robert Peston, as the eurozone did resolve Cyprus's banking crisis in 2013 and the country stayed in the euro. Capital controls were imposed on Cypriot banks, and remained in place for a long time - the last restrictions were only lifted in April this year. Greece's situation is more difficult, our editor reports. Capital controls are seen as an important step towards leaving the euro, because the single currency's rules require free movement of capital. But Greece could remain in if its government and the bailout providers - the EU and IMF - can restart constructive negotiations, he reports. A country on the brink - chief correspondent Gavin Hewitt writes: It is the most important decision in the ECB's history. A withdrawal of funding could plunge Greece into chaos and yet the ECB cannot break its own rules by funding a banking system where the country is heading for a default. Alexis Tsipras has gambled both with his future and that of his country. He committed Greece to a vote, but only after the current bailout has expired, so leaving Greece vulnerable and exposed. Read Gavin's analysis in full here. What are the Greek papers saying? On Saturday eurozone finance ministers - the Eurogroup - refused to extend Greece's desperately-needed bailout beyond Tuesday. The ministers blamed Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's surprise call for a referendum on 5 July on the bailout conditions. The final €7.2bn (£5bn; 8bn) of Greece's second bailout has been frozen since last summer, as lenders demanded more Greek progress on deep economic reform. Without more lending to Greece the country will default on a €1.6bn repayment due to the IMF on Tuesday. Under the rules governing the euro, the ECB's emergency lifeline could not be continued if the ECB considered Greek banks to be insolvent. Robert Peston says that with Greece no longer participating in a formal rescue programme, the solvency of the Greek state would be in doubt, as it is so intimately linked to the banks' solvency. Mr Tsipras's leftist Syriza government rejects the bailout terms, after five years of lender-imposed austerity that has increased Greek unemployment and cut pensions and welfare benefits. Greece has endured five years of recession, and total output (GDP) has shrunk by 25%. A summary of the above article is?","output":"The European Central Bank (ECB) faces a crucial decision regarding whether to end the Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) for Greece, as Greek banks heavily depend on these funds daily.

Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis stated that if the ECB cut the ELA funding, it would mean \\"Europe has failed\\" and it would be a \\"dark hour for Europe.\\" With the EU-IMF bailout set to expire on Tuesday and talks having broken down, this has led to significant uncertainty regarding Greece's financial stability.

In today's fast-paced world, taking the time to care for our plants during holidays can prove to be quite challenging. However, if we can devise simple yet effective ways to look after our green companions while we are away, the mutual benefits can make it all worthwhile. Firstly, ensuring that your plants receive the right amount of water during your absence is of utmost importance. There are numerous ways to achieve this, such as creating a simple self-watering system using a bottle filled with water and a piece of string to keep the soil moist. Alternatively, you can also invest in a drip irrigation system with a timer to water the plants at a predetermined interval. Secondly, maintaining suitable temperature and humidity levels for your plants is crucial. By placing them in a location that offers optimal conditions, such as near a window or a landing, you can ensure their well-being even when you aren't present to monitor them. Additionally, investing in a smart thermostat can help regulate temperature and humidity levels, enabling you to control environmental factors remotely. Another aspect to consider is sufficient lighting for your plants. Placing them near a window that receives ample sunlight will help them thrive while you're away. However, if this is not feasible, purchasing an automatic timer for an artificial light source can ensure that your plants receive the necessary amount of light during your absence. It is also beneficial to prepare your plants for your holiday by taking care of their pruning, fertilizing, and pest control needs well ahead of time. This can minimize the chances of them developing problems while you're away. Taking these measures also gives your plants the required energy and health to sustain themselves during the period of your absence. In conclusion, by ensuring that your plants are well taken care of during your holiday, the help becomes mutual. A healthy, vibrant indoor garden not only brings a sense of calm and serenity to your home but also purifies the air, improving overall indoor air quality. By making caring for your plants during your holiday super easy through methods such as self-watering systems, optimal placement, and smart environmental controls, you can return to a beautiful, thriving indoor garden that nourishes your physical and mental well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Answer the following question: What were the names of the two towns that have become known as Weymouth?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of Wyke Regis. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole. Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area. King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645.  In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower.

Write the answer: Which American writer and poet left an unfinished work called Cantos","output":"Ezra Pound, an American writer and poet, left behind an unfinished work that came to be known as \\"The Cantos.\\" Born on October 30, 1885, in Hailey, Idaho, Ezra Weston Loomis Pound was a significant figure in the early modernist movement in poetry, playing a crucial role in the development of Imagism and Vorticism. Throughout his career, he was known for his distinctive style and his ability to synthesize elements from various cultures and traditions. \\"The Cantos\\" is considered one of Pound's most ambitious and enigmatic works. It is a collection of long poems that the poet worked on, on and off, for over five decades, beginning in 1915 and continuing until his death in 1972. The poems that comprise \\"The Cantos\\" can be seen as a series of interconnected fragments, in which Pound sought to create a grand synthesis of world history, culture, and mythology. The epic poem remains unfinished, as Pound did not complete it before his death. The 120 extant cantos are often divided into three distinct sections, each with its unique focus and themes: 1. The \\"Ur-Cantos\\" (Cantos I-XVI): In the initial cantos, Pound explores various historical figures and moments from the past, such as the troubadour poets, the Renaissance, and Thomas Jefferson. These cantos revolve around the theme of creative influence and how different cultures have shaped one another throughout history. 2. The \\"Pisan Cantos\\" (Cantos LXXIV-LXXXIV): Pound wrote these poems while he was detained in a U.S. Army Disciplinary Training Center near Pisa, Italy, during World War II. He spent his time there in rather harsh conditions, including living in an open cage, which greatly affected his mental and emotional state. The \\"Pisan Cantos\\" contain references to various historical and literary figures, personal experiences, memories, and thoughts on war and politics. These cantos are often considered some of Pound's most poignant and personal work. 3. The \\"Latter Cantos\\" (Cantos LXXXV-CXX): The final cantos are more fragmented and experimental, as Pound's health began to deteriorate towards the end of his life. He wrote these after his release from St. Elizabeth's Hospital, where he had been admitted for mental illness following his arrest for treason during the war. The themes in these cantos cover a diverse range of topics such as economics, politics, mythology, and art. Despite its unfinished state, \\"The Cantos\\" is widely regarded as a core part of Pound's literary legacy. While it remains a complex and enigmatic work, the poem showcases the poet's profound knowledge, keen insights, and innovative approach to form and content. The Cantos gives readers a view into the vast intellectual landscape that shaped Ezra Pound's worldview.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? is little else to recommend \`\` never again .","output":"The given review seems to express a negative opinion of the movie \\"Never Again.\\" Based on the phrasing, \\"is little else to recommend,\\" we can infer that the reviewer believes that there are not many aspects of the movie that are worth recommending or praising. In other words, the reviewer likely found the film to be lacking in various aspects, such as story, characters, performances, or cinematography. It's essential to examine this statement more closely to better understand the implied negativity in the review. By using the qualifier \\"little else,\\" it suggests that there might be a few redeeming qualities in the movie, but they are not significant enough to create a positive overall impression. The word \\"recommend\\" is also important, as it conveys the message that the reviewer does not feel confident suggesting others watch this movie, which consequently indicates dissatisfaction or disapproval. When reviews are concise like this one, it makes it somewhat challenging to decipher the full extent of the reviewer's opinion or determine precisely what they disliked or found lacking in the film. However, despite the brevity of the statement, it is still clear from the wording used that the reviewer's opinion of \\"Never Again\\" leans heavily towards the negative side. In sum, the reviewer appears to be disappointed with the movie and unwilling to recommend it to others, suggesting that they found the film to be unsatisfactory or underwhelming."},{"instruction":"Q: What is the term for electric current that keeps reversing direction?

I normally do not post certain types of things on my blog or on social media, like political messages, but today I feel compelled. I’ve been thinking for the last few days about the most recent school shooting in Parkland, and my overwhelming emotion right after grief is rage. I am so angry it makes me cry and for those of you out there who know me, angry-cry is the end-stage, top-of-the-gauge level of angry for me. I am angry that as a nation, we continue to wring our hands and bemoan each mass shooting but we don’t take any action to stop the next one. I am angry that our elected officials have failed us in the most spectacular way possible by being unable to work together or to set aside special interests to protect the lives and safety of Americans, including our most vulnerable citizens, our children. I am angry that time and time again, we the people and our elected officials weigh the value of human lives against countless other things (Second Amendment, special interests, party disagreements, inertia, whatever) and the value of human life comes up short in the calculations. I am angry at myself for believing at any point in the last several years that I could trust lawmakers to address this epidemic and I am angry at myself for feeling so helpless that I have not personally taken action. This stops now. I am angry that in 2012, 20 6-7 year old children and 6 adults were murdered in Sandy Hook and in the 5+ years since, we have done nothing meaningful to stop this. To me, this is tantamount to saying that we as a nation are OK with this. I don’t think we are, but that’s the message we’re sending if we don’t force our government to do something.

Read this article and answer this question The PRI, or Institutional Revolutionary Party is one of the major lasting legacies of the Mexican Revolution; its first iteration was the Partido Nacional Revolucionario founded in 1929 under Northern revolutionary general and president of Mexico  Plutarco Elías Calles, following the assassination of president-elect  Álvaro Obregón in 1928. The establishment of the party created an enduring structure that managed not only presidential succession but also groups with competing interests. Initially, Calles remained the power behind the presidency during a period known as the Maximato, but his hand-picked presidential candidate, Lázaro Cárdenas, won a power struggle with Calles, expelling him from the country. Cárdenas reorganized the party that Calles founded, creating formal sectors for interest groups, including one for the Mexican military. The reorganized party was named Party of the Mexican Revolution.  In 1946, the party again changed its name to the Institutional Revolutionary Party. The party under its various names held the presidency from 1929 to 2000 and since 2012, is the party again in power. How many years before 2005 did the PRI hold the presidency?","output":"To find out how many years before 2005 the PRI held the presidency, we need to first identify the years the PRI controlled the presidency.

Option A: 126  Option B: Rs.121  Option C: 165  Option D: 134  Option E: 123 A:","output":"To find the interest gained, first, we need to calculate the compound interest for each deposit separately. For the deposit made on 1st January, the interest will be calculated for a full year.  For the deposit made on 1st July, the interest will be calculated for 6 months, or half-yearly. Given that the bank offers a 5% compound interest calculated on a half-yearly basis, and the interest rate for half a year would be 5%/2 = 2.5%. Now, let's calculate the interest for each deposit: 1. For the first deposit (Rs. 1600) on 1st January (1 year = 2 half-years): Applying the formula for Compound Interest: A = P × (1 + r/100)^n A = 1600 × (1 + 2.5/100)^2 A = 1600 × (1.025^2) A = 1600 × 1.050625 A = 1681 Interest = A - P = 1681 - 1600 = Rs. 81 2. For the second deposit (Rs. 1600) on 1st July (6 months = 1 half-year): A = 1600 × (1 + 2.5/100)^1 A = 1600 × 1.025 A = 1640 Interest = A - P = 1640 - 1600 = Rs. 40 Now, add the interest amounts: Total interest = Rs. 81 + Rs. 40 = Rs. 121 So, the correct answer is Option B: Rs.121."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Garland was born Frances Ethel Gumm on June 10, 1922, in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. She was the youngest child of Ethel Marion (nee Milne) and Francis Avent \\"Frank\\" Gumm. Her parents were vaudevillians who settled in Grand Rapids to run a movie theater that featured vaudeville acts. She was of Irish, English, and Scottish ancestry, named after both of her parents and baptized at a local Episcopal church. \\" In 1938, she was cast in her most memorable role, as the young Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz (1939), a film based on the 1900 children's book by L. Frank Baum. In this film, she sang the song with which she would be identified, \\"Over the Rainbow\\". Although producers Arthur Freed and Mervyn LeRoy had wanted her from the start, studio chief Mayer first tried to borrow Shirley Temple from 20th Century Fox, but they declined. Deanna Durbin was then asked, but was unavailable, resulting in Garland being cast.  Garland was initially outfitted in a blonde wig for the part, but Freed and LeRoy decided against it shortly into filming. Her blue gingham dress was chosen for its blurring effect on her figure, which made her look younger. Shooting commenced on October 13, 1938, and was completed on March 16, 1939, with a final cost of more than US2 million. With the conclusion of filming, MGM kept Garland busy with promotional tours and the shooting of Babes in Arms, directed by Busby Berkeley. Rooney and she were sent on a cross-country promotional tour, culminating in the August 17 New York City premiere at the Capitol Theater, which included a five-show-a-day appearance schedule for the two stars. Garland was forced into a strict diet during filming; she was given tobacco to suppress her appetite.  The Wizard of Oz was a tremendous critical success, though its high budget and promotions costs of an estimated 4 million (equivalent to 70.4 million in 2018), coupled with the lower revenue generated by discounted children's tickets, meant that the film did not make a profit until it was rereleased in the 1940s and in subsequent rereleases. At the 1939 Academy Awards ceremony, Garland received her only Academy Award, a Juvenile Award for her performances in 1939, including The Wizard of Oz and Babes in Arms. Following this recognition, she became one of MGM's most bankable stars. Did she sing any songs?","output":"Yes, in the film The Wizard of Oz (1939), Garland sang the song \\"Over the Rainbow,\\" with which she would be identified."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As they uncover the hidden connections between their past crimes, they form an unlikely alliance to bring down the mastermind behind the organization that has wronged them and take vengeance upon its diabolical members. Act I: The movie begins with the introduction of Dick Collins, a notorious convicted murderer currently serving time in a maximum-security prison. Dick was a successful lawyer until he was accused of committing a gruesome murder of a high-profile judge, something he claims he didn't do. At the same prison, Samuel Blackwood, a charming yet dangerous criminal with a long rap sheet, has just been transferred to the same facility. Samuel, once a prominent figure in the city's crime scene, was convicted for the murder of his business partner – a crime he confesses to but maintains was a necessary act of self-defense. In prison, both Dick and Samuel feel an unexplainable connection between their crimes. After a violent and distrustful encounter in the prison yard, they are both ushered into a secret meeting that challenges their understanding of reality. They learn that, despite their different backgrounds, they are both victims of a cruel manipulative game orchestrated by a malevolent organization known as the Shadow Syndicate. Act II: The Shadow Syndicate, led by the enigmatic Mr. Gray, is comprised of highly skilled criminals, corrupt politicians, and other influential figures. The organization has ruled the city from the depths of its shadows for decades. Together, Samuel and Dick forge a plan to expose the powerful members of the Syndicate and bring down its malicious operations. Through hidden letters and code deciphering, they uncover that the murders they were convicted for were masterminded by the Syndicate to facilitate a rapid ascent in the criminal world and city politics. As this realization sinks in, the two convicted murderers vow to take vengeance upon the Syndicate, even if they must risk their own lives to do so. Act III: Facing danger from within the prison, Samuel and Dick use their unique skillsets - Samuel's criminal savvy and Dick's legal expertise - to orchestrate a daring prison break. Together, they navigate the treacherous streets of the city and infiltrate the Shadow Syndicate's hidden headquarters. During a thrilling climax, the two former convicts face down the hostile members of the Syndicate and ultimately confront the enigmatic Mr. Gray. In a critical revelation, the duo uncovers that the Syndicate was on the verge of a dangerous new plot that would have far-reaching consequences on the city. Epilogue: With the demise of the Shadow Syndicate and Mr. Gray's capture, Samuel's and Dick's crimes finally find public redemption and their names are cleared. Though they are offered the chance to start over, they remain wary, knowing that the city has many lurking shadows. The duo forms an unlikely partnership and vows to use their newfound freedom to continue protecting their city, as they know that darkness can never be completely eradicated. Beyond Shadows dives deep into themes such as trust, redemption, and the darkest corners of human nature. With its intriguing characters and unforgettable plot twists, the movie becomes a memorable ride that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

That's where the similarities ended. I was tall and she was small. My thick black hair had been recently cut short into an untidy style. Her natural blonde hair flowed to her waist and looked great. I was 12 and one of the oldest in the class while she was 11 and the youngest. I was awkward and shy. She wasn't. I couldn't stand her, considering her my enemy. But she liked me and wanted to be friends. One day, she invited me over and I said yes--I was too shocked to answer any other way. My family had moved six times in six years, and I had never managed to develop any friendships. But this girl who wore the latest fashions wanted me to go home with her after school. She lived in a fun part of town that had two pizza places, an all-night bookstore, a movie theater and a park. As we walked from the school bus stop through her neighborhood, I tried to guess which house might be hers. Was it the white one with the perfect lawn or the three-story house with a front porch? I got very surprised when she led me into an old apartment building. She lived on the fourth floor in a two-room place with her mother,her stepfather, her two brothers and her sister. When we got into the room she shared with her sister, she took out a big case of Babies, which was my next surprise. I had never played with them. We sat on the floor,laughing as we made up crazy stories about the Babies. We found out that we both wanted to be writers when we were older and both had wild imaginations. We had a great day that afternoon. Lisa was loved by the whole neighborhood. The bookstore owners lent her fashion magazines; the movie theater gave her free tickets...

A: be greeted by people at their new apartment complex  B: be shunned by everyone in the city  C: be told to go back to the country A:","output":"As Remy adapts to living in the big city, they will face various experiences that will shape their life in their new environment. Among the possible outcomes, the one that resonates best within the context is answer A: being greeted by people at their new apartment complex. The transition from a rural lifestyle to an urban one can be challenging, but Remy's new neighbors may help ease the shift. Moving into an apartment complex is a prime opportunity for Remy to meet a diverse range of people who might be open and welcoming. After all, apartment complexes are often home to individuals from all walks of life, each with their unique experiences and backgrounds. In the early days of settling in, Remy might start meeting their neighbors in shared spaces such as the laundry room, gym, or by simply crossing paths in the common hallway. These encounters could lead to polite greetings, small talk, and, eventually, an invitation to a social gathering or community events hosted within the complex. As Remy continues to build connections with their neighbors, they might find it easier to ask for recommendations on local places to visit, such as restaurants, parks, and other attractions. This type of engagement helps Remy grow their social network and make new friends, making the big city feel a bit more familiar and welcoming. By participating in group activities and events, Remy can gradually overcome their nervousness about meeting people in the city. Meanwhile, they will discover that living in a big city offers numerous opportunities to connect with others, whether that be through local clubs, social meetups, or volunteering at community organizations. In summary, being greeted by people at their new apartment complex (answer A) seems to be the most suitable answer based on the context. Such encounters play an essential role in helping Remy adapt to their new urban surroundings, making connections, and thus mitigating their anxiety over meeting new people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Iris, a young woman caring for her sick brother Raleigh, is unable to afford his treatment costs. Her brother's oncologist, Dr. Barden, introduces Iris to Shepard Lambrick, a philanthropist, who offers her a deal: if she wins a parlor game at a dinner party, his charitable foundation will pay for Raleigh's leukemia treatment and locate a bone marrow donor for him immediately. Dr. Barden was a former winner of the game. Iris reluctantly accepts. The next day at Lambrick's manor, Iris is introduced to his son Julian and the other contestants: Lucas; Travis, a war veteran; Linda, an elderly, paralyzed woman; Peter, a gambling addict; Cal; Amy; and Conway, an alcoholic debtor. A steak and fois gras dinner is served but, Iris, a vegetarian, initially declines to eat it. Shepherd then offers her 10,000 to compromise her principles, and so she eats the steak. When Shepard realizes Conway is a recovering alcoholic, he offers Conway 10,000 to drink a glass of wine. When Conway declines he then offers him 50,000 to drink an entire decanter of Scotch. Conway accepts the 50,000 and reluctantly drinks the Scotch. After dinner ends, the game begins. Shepard reveals it to be a version of the party game \\"Would you rather...?\\", in which players must choose between two options. Shepard gives his guests the opportunity to leave without playing, but everyone stays. After Shepard's butler, a former MI5 agent named Bevans, wheels in an electric shock machine, the drunken Conway attempts to leave but is shot dead. Each contestant is then forced to choose between shocking themselves or another person. Each player has 15 seconds to make their choice. Iris, Cal and Lucas (after nodding his consent to Travis) shock themselves. All survive, and nobody is eliminated. In the second round, each contestant must choose between stabbing someone in the thigh with an ice pick or whipping Travis three times with a sjambok.

Movie plot title: Atom Age Vampire Movie plot: When a singer (Susanne Loret) is horribly disfigured in a car accident, a scientist (Dr. Levin, played by Alberto Lupo) develops a treatment which can restore her beauty by injecting her with a special serum. While performing the procedure, however, he falls in love with her. As the treatment begins to fail, he determines to save her appearance, regardless of how many women he must kill for her sake. Despite the implication of its American title, the film does not feature an actual vampire. The titular Seddok is actually the brilliant but deranged scientist Dr. Levin, mutated by a chemical formula created using radiation. Dr. Levin studied the effects of radiation on living tissue in post-Hiroshima Japan, and created an imperfect and teratogenic serum, \\"Derma 25\\", which he later refined into the miraculous healing agent \\"Derma 28\\" which he uses to treat the heroine. When his supply of Derma 28 runs out, he realizes he must kill to obtain more, and injects himself with Derma 25 in order to become monstrous and remorseless, so that he may seek these victims without hesitation. Because many of the murders take place near the docks where shiploads of Japanese refugees are arriving, and leave behind the victims' bodies with holes in the neck where Dr. Levin has extracted the glands, the refugees claim that a vampire (whom they call \\"Seddok\\", though this is not a Japanese name) is responsible for the attacks. During a meeting with police, a restored-to-humanity Dr. Levin speculates that the Hiroshima survivors' tales of a mutated killer are due to psychological strain from the radiation damage to their bodies...but also wonders aloud whether the \\"vampire\\" these witnesses describe might simply be a disturbed man wishing to be normal again.

Michael Green, 74, made two 999 calls after his neck became wedged against the furniture at his home in Leicester in September. Despite his distressed state, relatives said, it took crews nearly 90 minutes to respond, by which time he was dead. Ambulance bosses said the calls were correctly handled but Mr Green's family said they will go to the ombudsman. Mr Green suffered from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and pancreatitis. In recordings released to his family by East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS), Mr Green can be heard groaning with pain in the first call. When told an ambulance may take four hours, he responds: \\"Oh dear, the trouble is me neck's going dead with being stuck on the chair, I think I need somebody quick.\\" He told the call handler he had already been stuck for about five hours. In a second call, 40 minutes later, he tells a different operator during the course of the call: \\"I feel like I'm going numb. \\"I've changed now... I'm not right...

Article:Dozens of firefighters tackled the blaze, which broke out overnight on the roof of the riverside mansion in the centre of the French capital. The building was being renovated after its purchase by a Qatari prince in 2007. Located on the World Heritage-listed Seine embankment, the mansion was once home to the 18th Century philosopher Voltaire. It took six hours for the fire brigade to put out the blaze, which started in an area below the rooftop which emergency services found difficult to access. A large portion of the roof has been destroyed. A spokesman for the fire service, Lieutenant Colonel Pascal Le Testu, said 650 square metres (7,000 sq ft) of the roof had gone, along with a section of a central staircase. Some of the brickwork on the front of the building has collapsed. Renowned fresco ceiling paintings by Charles Le Brun in the Gallery of  Hercules were also \\"severely damaged by smoke and water\\", Lt Col Testu said. About a dozen neighbours were evacuated, and one firefighter was slightly injured. The mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoe, said the fire had shocked and saddened him.

More than 26,000 people have gone missing in Mexico over the past six years as violence surged and the country's government cracked down on drug cartels. Mexico's Interior Ministry announced the staggering statistic on Tuesday but noted that authorities don't have data about how many of the disappearances are connected with organized crime. The 26,121 disappearances occurred during former President Felipe Calderon's six-year administration, which ended on December 1 when Enrique Pena Nieto assumed the presidency. Pena Nieto's government has formed a special working group to focus on finding the missing, said Lia Limon, deputy secretary of legal matters and human rights for Mexico's Interior Ministry. Locating people \\"is a priority for this government,\\" Limon told reporters. The release of the government statistics Tuesday comes several days after a report from Human Rights Watch said Mexican security forces were connected with the disappearances of at least 149 people during Calderon's tenure. \\"President Pena Nieto has inherited one of worst crises of disappearances in the history of Latin America,\\" Jose Miguel Vivanco, the organization's Americas director, said in a statement. In the northern Mexican state of Coahuila alone, officials reported nearly 2,000 disappearances between 2006 and 2012, Human Rights Watch said. Rights groups and activists have long said that forced disappearances are among the most troubling problems Mexico faces and have cautioned that reliable statistics are hard to come by because many such cases are unreported. The human toll of Mexico's drug war. Limon said Tuesday that the data federal authorities have don't specify what caused the disappearances. She said the list could include people who have emigrated out of the country or fled because of family conflicts, in addition to people who were kidnapped. Authorities will need several weeks to release data about the number of disappearances since Pena Nieto took office, she said, due to \\"inconsistencies\\" in the data. Critics have accused Mexico's government of not doing enough to find the missing and punish those responsible. In many instances, families frustrated with a sluggish response from authorities have searched themselves for missing loved ones. Read more: The 'open wounds' of Mexico's drug war. In October 2011, Calderon said the \\"very high\\" number of missing people was a growing concern. He listed them among the victims of violence that he described as \\"open wounds\\" in Mexican society. \\"We don't know the size of the problem,\\" the president said during a speech inaugurating a new prosecutor's office aimed at helping victims. Human Rights Watch said last week that it sees a ray of hope in the new administration. \\"The Pena Nieto government has been very open so far about acknowledging the scale of the problem and the work that remains for them,\\" said Nik Steinberg, a Mexico researcher for the organization. \\"The real question will be: are they ready to investigate and prosecute these cases?\\" Mexican blogger vows to fight despite threats.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation in this scenario, where the bread has more dust on it, can be classified as indirectly impacting a step of the process. Allow me to explain this in detail. To revisit the process, the stages are: 1. Bread is exposed to the elements. 2. Bread absorbs water from the air. 3. Bread absorbs warmth from the air. 4. Dust particles with mold spores fall on bread. 5. Mold spores start to consume the bread for energy. 6. Mold colonies grow until they are visible. In this particular scenario, the increased amount of dust on the bread does not directly impact any of the six mentioned steps. Nonetheless, it does have an indirect effect on Step 4, \\"Dust particles with mold spores fall on bread.\\" While step 4 itself is not altered, the increased dust levels on the bread may potentially lead to a higher concentration of mold spores present on the bread's surface. This is due to the fact that dust can carry and deposit mold spores on various surfaces, including the bread in question. The higher concentration of mold spores on the bread surface, as a result of the increased dust, may in turn accelerate the rate at which the mold spreads on the bread, which could lead to faster mold growth in steps 5 and 6. Although, the approximate rate and extent of this influence may vary based on multiple external factors such as the specific types of mold spores present and the overall environmental conditions. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of having more dust on the bread can be classified as indirectly impacting a step of the process, specifically Step 4. Analogously, this increased dust presence may accelerate the mold growth rate on the bread, though the overall outcome will still be mold development and the eventual visibility of mold colonies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"\\"Never ever had anybody ask me how do you exit? <everyone laughing> It's just done for you.\\"\\" said in French?","output":"To translate the English sentence \\"Never ever had anybody ask me how do you exit? <everyone laughing> It's just done for you.\\" into French. We need to respect the sentence structure, idiomatic expressions, the nuances of the joke, and the informal tone in French. The steps are: 1. Translating it word by word  2. Checking if the translation makes sense or if it can be improved to sound more natural in French. Word for word translation: \\"Jamais personne ne m'a demandé comment sortez-vous? <tout le monde rigole> Ça se fait just pour toi.\\" Modification in order to bring more sense and naturality: \\"Personne ne m'a jamais demandé comment on part? <tout le monde rit> Ça se fait tout seul.\\" So, the finished translation is: \\"Personne ne m'a jamais demandé comment on part? <tout le monde rit> Ça se fait tout seul.\\" Here is a step-by-step justification of the translation: - \\"Never ever\\" was translated to \\"Jamais\\" but it doesn't really feel natural in French, so we modified it by \\"Personne ne m'a jamais\\" which means \\"Nobody ever asked me\\". - \\"Had anybody ask me\\" was translated to \\"Personne ne m'a demandé\\". This construction is more natural in French while keeping the meaning of the original sentence. - \\"How do you exit?\\" was translated into \\"Comment sortez-vous?\\". Again we must find a more natural way to say this in French, so we modified it by \\"comment on part?\\", which means \\"how one leaves?\\". - \\"Everyone laughing\\" is translated as \\"tout le monde rit\\", maintaining the format in the original. - \\"It's just done for you.\\" was translated into \\"Ça se fait jusque pour toi.\\" - However, this is a word-for-word translation and doesn't sound natural in French. So, it was modified to \\"Ça se fait tout seul\\", which literally means \\"It's done by itself\\". This is a better translation since it gives the feeling that the action is automated or happens naturally without human intervention, which is the point of the original English sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3]  Now, I have a new situation: Deep lake presents geothermal activity, while Shallow lake has mixing of saline water with fresh water. Deep lake had more instances of divers having problems because of thermoclines.  Answer this question please: Which lake has colder water the bottom? A:","output":"Based on the scenario provided, it is likely that the Shallow lake with the mixing of saline and fresh water has colder water at the bottom.  In the given background, it is stated that thermoclines occur where there are sudden changes in temperature. One such example provided is when cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea. In this case, the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, resulting in a layered structure where the temperature actually rises as a diver descends. Such a scenario is described for the Shallow lake which has a mixture of saline and fresh water, hinting at a probable thermocline situation where the temperature at the bottom is colder than at the surface. On the other hand, the Deep lake is identified as being exposed to geothermal activity. According to the background provided, in lakes where geothermal activity is present, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This is due to heat from the Earth's interior warming the water from the bottom up, leading to convection currents.  Therefore, despite the Deep lake having more instances of divers having problems due to thermoclines, its bottom water temperature is likely warmer due to geothermal inputs. Hence, it should be the Shallow lake that has colder water at the bottom because of the layered structure created by the mixing of saline and fresh water. However, it is essential to consider that are other factors that can influence water temperature such as the overall climate, the season, the amount of sunlight it receives, wind, etc. A precise answer would require more specific data about the lakes."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question.

The Lions opened the scoring in the first quarter via a 27-yard field goal from Matt Prater. Detroit extended their lead in the second quarter via a one-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford to Theo Riddick. The Saints reduced the Lions lead to seven points via a 40-yard field goal from Wil Lutz.

The Lions added two field goals from Prater in the third quarter, from 32 yards and 27 yards out, extending their lead to 19-6. The Saints opened the scoring in the fourth quarter with a one-yard touchdown run from John Kuhn. The Lions responded on the next drive with a 66-yard touchdown pass from Stafford to Golden Tate, which was followed by a failed two-point conversion. Matt Prater finished the scoring with a 52-yard field goal, giving the Lions a 28-13 win. This marked the first game all year in which the Lions never trailed in the fourth quarter, and their first game of 2016 to be decided by more than seven points.
