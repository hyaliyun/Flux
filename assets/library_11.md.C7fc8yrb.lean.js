Make use of the article to answer the questions. Canberra ( or ) is the capital city of Australia. With a population of 403,468, it is Australia's largest inland city and the eighth-largest city overall. The city is located at the northern end of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), south-west of Sydney, and north-east of Melbourne. A resident of Canberra is known as a \\"Canberran\\". Although Canberra is the capital and seat of government, many federal government ministries have secondary seats in state capital cities, as do the Governor-General and the Prime Minister.  The site of Canberra was selected for the location of the nation's capital in 1908 as a compromise between rivals Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's two largest cities. It is unusual among Australian cities, being an entirely planned city outside of any state, similar to Washington, D.C. in the United States, or Brasília in Brazil. Following an international contest for the city's design, a blueprint by American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was selected and construction commenced in 1913. The Griffins' plan featured geometric motifs such as circles, hexagons and triangles, and was centred on axes aligned with significant topographical landmarks in the Australian Capital Territory.  The city's design was influenced by the garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation. The growth and development of Canberra were hindered by the World Wars and the Great Depression, which exacerbated a series of planning disputes and the ineffectiveness of a procession of bodies that were created in turn to oversee the development of the city. The national capital emerged as a thriving city after World War II, as Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies championed its development and the National Capital Development Commission was formed with executive powers. Although the Australian Capital Territory is now self-governing, the Commonwealth Government retains some influence through the National Capital Authority. 1.

Problem:Artificial neural networks are powerful pattern classifiers; however, they have been surpassed in accuracy by methods such as support vector machines and random forests that are also easier to use and faster to train. Backpropagation, which is used to train artificial neural networks, suffers from the herd effect problem which leads to long training times and limit classification accuracy. We use the disjunctive normal form and approximate the boolean conjunction operations with products to construct a novel network architecture. The proposed model can be trained by minimizing an error function and it allows an effective and intuitive initialization which solves the herdeffect problem associated with backpropagation. This leads to state-of-the art classification accuracy and fast training times. In addition, our model can be jointly optimized with convolutional features in an unified structure leading to state-of-the-art results on computer vision problems with fast convergence rates. A GPU implementation of LDNN with optional convolutional features is also available Solution:","output":"Part #1: Generate a headline for a given text Usage: \\"New Neural Network Architecture Surpasses Traditional Methods in Accuracy and Training Speed\\" This headline communicates the main idea of the text, which is the development of a novel neural network architecture that provides better accuracy and faster training times than previous methods.

Context: TL:DR: I un-professionally get mad at a customer and verbally slam the door on her way out. I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'. All I say is ‘Good’ and move on to the next customer. Hitler-lite phones my corporation to voice a complaint, so a suit comes out and asks the team who did it, I fess up so I can save the time and not have a reason to hate one of my co-workers.

Since this picture is classified a \\"pure entertainment\\" work and since there are already many comments on it, I'd like hereby to address something relevant to the abuse of humour. We can see that Marlon Wayans is playing the joker role in this film. Certainly as long as he has been involved in the casting job, he has always been acting as a little man-an actor can change his customary dress but can hardly change his physical appearance-and the latter one can be an advantage when necessary. However far away from what I expected, I saw an image very disguising, pretending to expose different aspects of the baby life by mistake of a forty-year- old criminal. And with a ridiculous happy ending. So what is the point? Many elements are mixed up, some principal ones are violence, sex and criminal activities, amongst which the story is badly composed and to some extent, lack common sense: where is Vanessa when the peace of her house is violated and her husband's life being pursued? In addition the diamond is even bigger than the world's No.1 Cullinan! But the most sickening facet is the continuous attempt to make up the little man as a superman by showing his physical weak points. And they call it humour. A diamond is precious, hard and fragile; it cannot be cut by any other material but only be conquered by the hot blood of a male goat. Hence it's no more a diamond but pieces of debris.

Neil was filled with anxiety when Eric showed up, because","output":"Neil was filled with anxiety when Eric showed up, because there was a long history of unresolved conflicts and underlying tensions between the two of them, dating back to their days in high school. Even though they were once inseparable childhood friends, their relationship had been strained over the years due to lingering resentment, petty jealousies, and deep-seated insecurities that were never fully addressed, and now threatened their already fragile friendship. During their high school years, Eric had been a popular and charismatic individual, always at the center of attention and drawing in others with his seemingly magnetic personality. Neil, on the other hand, was more quiet and introverted, often feeling overshadowed by Eric's larger-than-life persona. Whenever they hung out together, Neil couldn't help but compare himself to Eric's seemingly effortless ability to engage and charm everyone they met, leading to a gnawing sense of inadequacy that continued to grow over time. Instead of confronting these feelings head-on, Neil had always avoided discussing the issue with Eric, burying his emotions deep within in hopes that they would eventually fade away. However, this eventually led to a festering bitterness that would manifest in passive-aggressive behaviors and snide remarks, pushing the friends further apart as they reached maturity and ventured off to college. Eric, for his part, had always been somewhat oblivious to Neil's internal struggles, assuming that their relationship was still strong despite the changes they were both going through. Unbeknownst to him, these misunderstandings only fueled Neil's anxiety, validating his belief that Eric just didn't care or understand the emotional turmoil he was experiencing. On this particular day, Eric had unexpectedly shown up at Neil's home, planning to surprise his old friend with an impromptu reunion. He was completely unaware of the emotional bombshell that was about to detonate, unfazed by the subtle signals of distress that Neil was sending out. As Neil stood there, feeling the weight of years of unspoken hurt and regret bearing down on him, the anxiety was nearly palpable, threatening to consume him whole. The impending confrontation between Neil and Eric had the potential to mend or irreparably damage their friendship, depending on how they both managed to navigate their emotions and the delicate situation at hand. Neil realized that he had a choice: he could finally face the pain of the past and work towards resolution, or allow the anxiety and resentment to continue to dictate his interactions with Eric, potentially ending their friendship for good. As they exchanged tense greetings and started to catch up on each other's lives since they last saw one another, Neil couldn't help but feel a heavy pit in his stomach. It was now or never. He had to find the courage to confront and resolve the issues that had haunted their friendship for so long, or else he might lose Eric forever."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

No one smiled a greeting, and they appeared uninterested in Soapy. One little girl in particular moved like a wisp   in the background. The staff informed me that she had been there for over a month and had not spoken the entire time. Her mother said she had talked at one time but not in recent memory. I didn't want to imagine what could have happened to rob this little girl of the natural curiosity and enthusiasm so natural to childhood. Spreading a blanket on the floor, I sat down and put Soapy on the blanket. As the silent child circled past me, I told the group that Soapy would come to talk to them if they sat on his blanket. Several children did this, including the silent girl. She sat rigidly at the edge of the blanket, legs held stiffly out straight in front of her. She was staring hard at Soapy. It appeared that he kept making eye contact with her. She didn't reach out to him or encourage him in any way. Rather she sat tensely, just staring. Finally Soapy came to a stop about two inches from her. He quietly reached out and laid his chin on her knee. I was astonished. While a common behavior for dogs, this is not a behavior exhibited by rabbits, especially not by this rabbit. The child did not reach out to touch Soapy. Instead, she slowly leaned toward him. When her face was within inches of his, she carefully reached out and circled him with her arms. So softly that no one in the room could hear, she began to talk.

Which animal has species called Grevy's, Cape Mountain and Plains, amongst others?","output":"The animal that has species called Grevy's, Cape Mountain, and Plains, among others, is the zebra. Zebras are part of the Equidae family, which also includes horses and asses. They are native to Africa and are particularly known for their striking black and white striped coats, which may play a role in camouflage, temperature regulation, or social interactions. Each zebra species has distinct features, habitats, and conservation statuses. 1. Grevy's Zebra (Equus grevyi): Also known as the imperial zebra, Grevy's zebra is the largest of the three zebra species. They are found in the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Kenya and Ethiopia. Grevy's zebras have thinner, tighter stripes, large rounded ears, and a white belly. They prefer to live in grassland and savannah habitats. This species is known for being more solitary than the other zebras, with male territories often excluding other male zebras. Grevy's zebra is listed as endangered, with habitat loss, competition for resources with livestock, and reduced water availability being significant threats to their populations. 2. Cape Mountain Zebra (Equus zebra zebra): The Cape Mountain zebra, a subspecies of the mountain zebra (Equus zebra), is found in South Africa. It mainly inhabits the mountainous regions of the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. They are smaller than the other zebra species, and their stripes are narrower and more numerous. Cape Mountain zebras have a distinct dewlap, which is a fold of skin hanging from the throat area. Threats to this subspecies include habitat loss due to agricultural expansion and competition for resources with domestic animals. While their population was once severely reduced, successful conservation efforts have helped the Cape Mountain zebra recover to a point where they are now classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. 3. Plains Zebra (Equus quagga): The Plains zebra, also known as the common zebra or Burchell's zebra, can be found throughout much of eastern and southern Africa. They are the most widespread and numerous of zebra species, inhabiting various environments such as grasslands, savannahs, and open woodlands. Plains zebras have broad stripes that are not as tightly spaced as those of Grevy's zebra, yet not as wide as the stripes on mountain zebras. These zebras are highly social animals and are known for forming harems, which are smaller family units within a large social group called a dazzle. Plains zebras serve as an essential prey species for many predators, such as lions, hyenas, and wild dogs. Currently, they are listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, with their populations mainly affected by habitat loss, poaching for their skins, and competition with livestock for resources. In conclusion, the animal with species called Grevy's, Cape Mountain, and Plains, amongst others, is the zebra. These three species and subspecies exhibit intriguing adaptations to their environments, social behaviors, and various conservation statuses, making them integral components of Africa's diverse and mesmerizing ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Negative The sentiment of the sentence \\"so devoid of artifice and purpose\\" can be perceived as negative for the following reasons: 1. The use of the word \\"devoid\\" has a negative connotation. It means to completely lack or be empty of something. In this context, it means the subject lacks artifice and purpose, both of which can be considered essential qualities in certain situations. 2. \\"Artifice\\" generally refers to cleverness, skill, or ingenuity. In some cases, it could also refer to an artistic or creative ability. A lack of artifice implies that the subject being described is not skillful or intelligent. This could be interpreted as a criticism or a negative quality. 3. \\"Purpose\\" means having a reason, objective, or a goal. When something or someone lacks purpose, it implies that there is no clear direction or motivation driving them. This absence of purpose can be seen as a negative trait because it suggests aimlessness, lack of ambition or focus, and an overall sense of emptiness. 4. The structure of the sentence conveys a sense of disappointment or dissatisfaction. The use of \\"so\\" emphasizes the extent to which the subject is devoid of artifice and purpose, highlighting the negative sentiment further. In summary, the sentiment of this sentence is perceived as negative because it implies a lack of desirable qualities like artifice and purpose, suggesting a sense of emptiness, dissatisfaction, and disappointment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Sonar, Highlight, and Banjo: The New Wave of Social Apps Revolutionizing Local Connections Introduction: The South by Southwest (SXSW) conference is known for being the launchpad for innovative and groundbreaking apps and technologies. This year was no exception, as three new social apps took the event by storm: Sonar, Highlight, and Banjo. These apps are changing the way we connect with people locally by showing us who's nearby, what they're up to, and who we might be interested in meeting. In this article, we'll delve deeper into the features and capabilities of these apps, showcasing why they were all the buzz at SXSW. Sonar: Discovering Hot Spots and Potential Connections Sonar's primary function is to help you discover what's happening around you and show you the interesting people nearby. The app achieves this by analyzing social media data to identify hot spots – locations where many people are gathering or engaging in similar activities. These hot spots can range from trendy restaurants to popular events. What sets Sonar apart is its ability to suggest connections based on shared interests, friends, and social media connections. By using Sonar, you can find people around you who might be potential friends, acquaintances or business contacts. This allows for a more organic and efficient approach to networking and meeting new people. Highlight: Finding Common Ground with Nearby Users Like Sonar, Highlight is designed to notify you of people who are nearby. However, Highlight focuses on identifying people who share your interests, rather than simply providing a list of nearby individuals. Using your social media profiles and keywords, Highlight analyses mutual interests and notifies you when someone with shared interests is in close proximity. This feature is particularly useful for bridging the gap between online and offline connections, allowing users to connect with like-minded individuals in real life, in a more natural and authentic way. Banjo: Gaining Insights on Nearby User-Generated Content Banjo takes a slightly different approach to local social connections, offering users full access to the content that nearby users are sharing. By integrating with various social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram, Banjo displays an aggregated feed of tweets, photos, and other shared content from people in your immediate area. This open and transparent access to local content allows users to get a sense of the activities, thoughts, and feelings of their neighbors and local community. Banjo users can gain insight into what's happening around them and become more aware of local happenings and conversations. Conclusion: The introduction of Sonar, Highlight, and Banjo has undoubtedly disrupted the social app scene, demonstrating the power and potential of localized connections. By enabling users to discover hot spots, connect with like-minded individuals, and access local content, these new wave social apps have revolutionized the way we connect with the people around us. Thanks to these apps, we can now look forward to a more enhanced, personalized, and engaging offline social experience, bridging the divide between our online and real-world connections. It is no wonder that these innovative apps were the talk of the town at this year's SXSW."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Steve and Chris sit down at a new cafe that just opened up in town after hearing rave reviews of it at work. They look at the menus trying to decide what to order when a waiter shows up and asks if they would like anything to drink. Steve says he would like a glass of water that has molecules far apart. Chris orders water with molecules closer together. The waiter looks at them with a rather confused look and asks them to please elaborate.  But I can use this background: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C.  What is an answer for this question: Whose cup of water is more dense? A:","output":"Based on the given background information, we can analyze Steve and Chris's requests to understand which of their cups of water will be more dense. Liquid water is a fluid in which the hydrogen bonds constantly break and reform, allowing the water molecules to move past one another. When the temperature of water decreases, the molecular action slows down and the molecules move closer together, causing the density of the liquid to increase. For most liquids, density increases continuously until the liquid freezes, resulting in a denser solid state compared to the liquid state. However, water deviates from this behavior and reaches its maximum density at 4°C. Beyond this point, as the temperature drops further and water starts to freeze, its density will actually decrease. This is because the structure of the ice lattice causes the water molecules to be positioned further apart than when they were in liquid state. Now, considering Steve's and Chris's requests: 1. Steve asks for a glass of water with molecules far apart. 2. Chris asks for a glass of water with molecules closer together. Recalling that water has higher density when its molecules are closer together, and given that it has its maximum density at around 4°C, Chris's cup of water would ideally have a temperature close to 4°C. In contrast, Steve's request for water with more widely separated molecules would correspond to either warmer water (above 4°C, as the molecules have more energy and move further apart) or frozen water (ice). Based on the information provided, Chris's cup of water would be more dense, considering that his request corresponds to water molecules being closer together, which indicates a lower temperature around 4°C where water reaches its highest density. On the other hand, Steve's water would either be warmer or in a frozen state, both of which would have less density compared to Chris's water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentenced to a 12-month community order and 100 hours of unpaid work. Article:","output":"Title: Born Lucky: Samantha Jordan's Fortune and Fall from Grace On Samantha Jordan's 21st birthday, she received a life-changing sum of money from her father, Mike 'Flash' Jordan. It's a story that could have been a fairytale come true for many, but for Ms. Jordan, it quickly turned into a cautionary tale. As the daughter of a prominent British wrestler featured on ITV's World of Sport, Samantha found herself thrust into the spotlight, surrounded by well-wishers and envious onlookers. But as the story unfolds, we learn that the true wonders of wealth often come with a price. Mike \\"Flash\\" Jordan: A Wrestler in the 1980s As her father appeared in the spotlight during bouts televised on ITV's World of Sport in the 1980s, Samantha's inheritance was bound to be a significant one. Fans who adored the larger-than-life wrestling star naturally assumed that his fortune would be passed on to his only child. Raised in a world of sports and media fanfare, Samantha's newfound wealth should have been a blessing—she could have used it to improve her life and that of her family, perhaps even branching out and establishing her own name independently of her father's fame. Unfortunately, Samantha took a different path. Misguided Decisions: Blowing Through Her Inheritance The financial windfall that Samantha received from her father was far from small; it was, for many, a life-changing sum of money. And yet, instead of using her newfound wealth to build a future for herself and her loved ones, Ms. Jordan chose a different path. She set about \\"blowing\\" the vast sum on wild parties, ill-advised schemes, and luxurious vacations with friends. As the money continued to dwindle, so too did the number of her friends, revealing the harsh reality that the connectedness and loyalty of many were thinly-veiled attempts at profiting from her wealth. In time, Samantha faced the inevitable truth that the fortune she had been given was gone. With no financial cushion left underneath her, the fall was abrupt and painful. As her finances dwindled, so had her opportunities for redemption and personal growth. Facing the Consequences: A Community Order and Unpaid Work Samantha Jordan's mismanagement of her inheritance led her down a path that ultimately resulted in legal consequences. Her actions saw her sentenced to a 12-month community order and 100 hours of unpaid work—punishment, some would say, for the impropriety with which she treated the largesse she had been bestowed. The moral of Samantha's story serves as a reminder to us all: with great wealth comes great responsibility. While the windfalls we receive in life may not always be as life-changing as an inheritance from a famous wrestler, it is the choices we make and the actions we take with those opportunities that define our character. Samantha's cautionary tale offers a salient lesson: the security and blessings of wealth are far from guaranteed. When confronted with newfound means, we must take care to ensure that we remain grounded in our integrity and dedication to ourselves and those around us. For it is those truly valuable qualities that cannot be exhausted—and it is those that shall carry us through, even if fortune ultimately turns against us."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Popular playground shut after a single complaint children played too loudly. Council then reopened site and recorded playing noise at 57 decibels. Sound level is equivalent to a normal conversation or quiet laughter.","output":"Title: Bakewell Recreation Ground: A Playground of Sound Introduction: Bakewell Recreation Ground in Derbyshire, a beloved destination for many families, found itself in an unexpected predicament in June when it was temporarily closed following a single noise complaint. However, joy and excitement resumed as the playground reopened and the council found that the noise level of children playing was merely 57 decibels, equivalent to a normal conversation or quiet laughter.  Body: After receiving the initial complaint regarding the noise produced by children playing, the local council was forced to temporarily close Bakewell Recreation Ground to determine if the complaint held any merit. Many residents were dismayed by the decision, as it threatened to deprive nearby families of a favorite spot for bonding and outdoor fun. The council promptly took action by reopening the site and recording the playing noise to determine if the volume was indeed disruptive for the surrounding residents. To their relief, they found that the noise rested comfortably at 57 decibels, well within the range of a typical conversation or even quiet laughter.  To add context, the noise level in question would be comparable to ambient coffee shop chatter or gentle music played in the background. The World Health Organization defines noise levels below 60 decibels as safe and not harmful to human health In fact, 57 decibels arguably poses no significant risk to the well-being and peace of the local community. Conclusion: As the temporary closure of Bakewell Recreation Ground proved to be an unnecessary measure, the council has since reassured residents of the playground's compliance with acceptable noise levels. Families can now return to enjoying their time playing, laughing, and bonding, secure in the knowledge that their beloved playground poses no threat to the community's peace and well-being.

Question: \\"How is zinc added to soil?\\"  Context: \\"Zinc deficiency is crop plants' most common micronutrient deficiency; it is particularly common in high-pH soils. Zinc-deficient soil is cultivated in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India, a third of China, and most of Western Australia, and substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas. Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease. Zinc is primarily added to the soil through the weathering of rocks, but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion, mine waste, phosphate fertilizers, pesticide (zinc phosphide), limestone, manure, sewage sludge, and particles from galvanized surfaces. Excess zinc is toxic to plants, although zinc toxicity is far less widespread.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Zinc plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and productivity of crop plants. Due to its importance, farmers and agricultural experts have adopted various methods to add zinc to the soil, especially in regions experiencing zinc deficiency. The process of adding zinc to the soil can be achieved through both natural and artificial means, as explained below. 1. Natural weathering of rocks: As mentioned, the primary natural source of zinc comes from the weathering of rocks. The naturally occurring zinc-bearing rocks gradually break down over time, releasing zinc ions into the soil. This process enables the soil to absorb and redistribute the essential micronutrient to plants' root systems. 2. Fossil fuel combustion: Humans have unintentionally contributed to the addition of zinc to soils through the combustion of fossil fuels. The burning of coal, oil, and gas releases zinc into the atmosphere, which eventually settles onto the Earth's surface and mixes with the soil. 3. Mine waste: Mining operations, especially those involving zinc-containing ores, generate waste which often contains high concentrations of zinc. When this waste is deposited or improperly managed, it can cause zinc to enter the soil. 4. Phosphate fertilizers: Zinc is often introduced to soil through phosphate fertilizers. Some phosphate fertilizers contain trace amounts of zinc as an impurity. When these fertilizers dissolve in the soil, the zinc becomes available to plants. 5. Pesticides: Zinc-based pesticides, such as zinc phosphide, are sometimes applied to agricultural land for pest control. Once these pesticides degrade or interact with the soil, they release zinc ions that can be taken up by plants. 6. Limestone: Agriculturists might apply limestone to the soil to adjust its pH levels, which can influence the availability of zinc. However, the addition of limestone is a double-edged sword, as it could sometimes reduce the availability of zinc by forming insoluble complexes. 7. Manure and compost: Nutrient-rich farmyard manure, green manures, and compost can also be used to improve the zinc content of soil. As organic matter decomposes, it releases zinc and other nutrients that become available to plant roots. 8. Sewage sludge: Treated sewage sludge, also known as biosolids, could serve as a source of zinc. The safe application of these materials can help restore the soil's nutrient content, which includes adding zinc to the soil. 9. Zinc-containing soil amendments: Farmers may turn to direct soil amendments, such as zinc sulfate, zinc oxide, and chelated zinc compounds, to manage zinc deficiency. These amendments can be applied via broadcast application, band placement, or foliar sprays. 10. Particles from galvanized surfaces: Zinc can also make its way into soil through the erosion or flaking of particles from galvanized surfaces, such as roofs or fences. The zinc particles, over time, find their way into the soil. It is essential to monitor the levels of zinc in the soil to avoid toxicity, as excessive amounts can harm plant growth and quality. Soil testing, plant tissue analysis, and visual observation of plant symptoms can help determine the appropriate amount of zinc to be added to maintain optimum levels for healthy, high-yielding crops."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

OPT: + yes; + it is not possible to tell; + no;","output":"In understanding whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the meaning and relationship between the statements. The premise states that \\"It is slow-moving,\\" while the hypothesis asserts that \\"The thing moves slow.\\" From a linguistic and logical standpoint, these two statements convey similar information, with only slight variations in structure and phrasing. The premise, \\"It is slow-moving,\\" implies that an unspecified object or entity possesses the property of slow motion or progresses at a sluggish pace. This statement essentially characterizes the subject based on its movement speed. On the other hand, the hypothesis, \\"The thing moves slow,\\" asserts that a specific object (referred to as 'the thing') exhibits slow movement. It may be worth noting that the hypothesis uses a slightly more informal phrasing with the term \\"moves slow\\" compared to the more formal expression \\"slow-moving\\" in the premise. By examining the content and meaning of both statements, we can determine that they are essentially conveying the same idea - an object or entity displaying slow movement. Thus, it can be argued that the premise does entail the hypothesis. Based on this analysis, the appropriate option would be: + yes; As the information in both statements reflects the same concept or belief, it would be accurate to conclude that the premise implies and leads to the hypothesis, even though there are minor differences in the structure and phrasing of the two statements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Countless homes were destroyed and lots of people became homeless after the earthquake which is believed to have a magnitude of 7. The quake was not as serious as the 7.9-magnitude earthquake in 2008 that left more than 70,000 people dead in the Wenchuan area. But villagers who work in Chengdu, about 100 miles away, hurried back home Sunday morning, many on foot, the lucky ones on motorbikes, to check on their homes. Song Yuanqing, 43, a worker, arrived back after a 22-hour trip and found his house was still there but had already been very unstable . \\"We would like to do something, but we can't do anything,\\" Mr. Song said as he sat with neighbors around an outdoor fire built by the village leader in his backyard. In all, the government sent about 7,000 soldiers and People's Armed Police officers to the earthquake-hit area. By Saturday evening, there were so many rescue workers in the area that the government asked volunteers to stop coming. Li Keqiang, China's prime minister, flew to the area and slept in a tent on Saturday evening in Lushan County.

Given the question: During the 1670s, the Dutch tradesman Antony van Leeuwenhoek, shown in Figure below , used microscopes to observe many microbes and body cells. Leeuwenhoek developed an interest in microscopy and ground his own lenses to make simple microscopes. Leeuwenhoek was so good at making lenses that his simple microscopes were able to magnify much more clearly than the compound microscopes of his day. His microscope's increased ability to magnify over 200x is comparable to a modern compound light microscope. Compound microscopes , which are microscopes that use more than one lens, had been invented around 1595 by Zacharias Jansen, a Dutch spectacle-maker. Several people, including Robert Hooke, had built compound microscopes and were making important discoveries with them during Leeuwenhoek’s time.  John is interested in the history of science. He went to a science museum to learn more about microscopes. First he saw a Leeuwenhoek microscope, which was labeled as item A, then he saw a compound microscope of Leeuwenhoek's time, which was labeled as item B.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was his final major compositional project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, though he never published it. During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945. Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh. After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that is made into a statue in the grotto? ?  With the garden project well in hand, Ammanati turned his attentions to creating a large courtyard immediately behind the principal façade, to link the palazzo to its new garden. This courtyard has heavy-banded channelled rustication that has been widely copied, notably for the Parisian palais of Maria de' Medici, the Luxembourg. In the principal façade Ammanati also created the finestre inginocchiate (\\"kneeling\\" windows, in reference to their imagined resemblance to a prie-dieu, a device of Michelangelo's), replacing the entrance bays at each end. During the years 1558–70, Ammanati created a monumental staircase to lead with more pomp to the piano nobile, and he extended the wings on the garden front that embraced a courtyard excavated into the steeply sloping hillside at the same level as the piazza in front, from which it was visible through the central arch of the basement.  On the garden side of the courtyard Amannati constructed a grotto, called the \\"grotto of Moses\\" on account of the porphyry statue that inhabits it. On the terrace above it, level with the piano nobile windows, Ammanati constructed a fountain centered on the axis; it was later replaced by the Fontana del Carciofo (\\"Fountain of the Artichoke\\"), designed by Giambologna's former assistant, Francesco Susini, and completed in 1641.In 1616, a competition was held to design extensions to the principal urban façade by three bays at either end. Giulio Parigi won the commission; work on the north side began in 1618, and on the south side in 1631 by Alfonso Parigi.  During the 18th century, two perpendicular wings were constructed by the architect Giuseppe Ruggeri to enhance and stress the widening of via Romana, which creates a piazza centered on the façade, the prototype of the cour d'honneur that was copied in France.  Sporadic lesser additions and alterations were made for many years thereafter under other rulers and architects.To one side of the Gardens is the bizarre grotto designed by Bernardo Buontalenti.

Released in September 1980, Never for Ever saw Bush's second foray into production, co-producing with Jon Kelly. Her first experience as a producer was on her Live on Stage EP, released after her tour the previous year. The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on Never for Ever is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker \\"Violin\\" to the wistful waltz of hit single \\"Army Dreamers\\". Never for Ever was her first album to feature synthesisers and drum machines, in particular the Fairlight CMI, to which she was introduced when providing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel's eponymous third album in early 1980. It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status, and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at the top. The top-selling single from the album was \\"Babooshka\\", which reached number five in the UK singles chart. In November 1980, she released the standalone Christmas single \\"December Will Be Magic Again\\", which reached number 29 in the UK charts. September 1982 saw the release of The Dreaming, the first album Bush produced by herself. With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. The Dreaming received a mixed reception in the UK, and critics were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created to become \\"less accessible\\".

Turkish troops patrol near the border with Iraq on Monday. President Bush chatted by phone with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, while separately two senior Iraq national government figures met with the head of the country's Kurdish region. The diplomatic moves came after Turkish warplanes pounded Kurdish separatist targets in northern Iraq on Saturday and Sunday as well as last week. Bush and Erdogan talked about the dangers of the Kurdish separatist rebels along the Turkish-Iraqi border, the White House confirmed. National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said they discussed their common efforts to fight terrorism, and the importance of the United States, Turkey and Iraq working together to confront the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. Bush has vowed to help Turkey fight PKK rebels. The PKK has spent two decades fighting for autonomy for Kurds in southeastern Turkey, with some of its attacks launched from inside northern Iraq. The United States and European Union consider the group a terrorist organization. Last week, Turkey's ambassador to the United States, Nabi Sensoy, said his country's maneuvers against Kurdish militant targets in northern Iraq were based on intelligence provided by the United States. In the Kurdish Iraq city of Sulaimaniya, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, who is Kurdish, and Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, who is Sunni Arab, met with Kurdish Regional Government President Massoud Barzani. Iraqi Kurdish officials, while critical of the PKK, have denounced the Turkish bombing campaign. Last week, Barzani snubbed visiting U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in protest of the attacks. \\"We have vehemently condemned the bombardment.

Context: WASHINGTON — In 2004, Desmond Meade, while serving a 15-year prison sentence for a drug offense in Florida, got a break. An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support.

Instructions: In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words. Input: The present complexity in designing web applications makes software security a difficult goal to achieve. An attacker can explore a deployed service on the web and attack at his/her own leisure. Moving Target Defense (MTD) in web applications is an effective mechanism to nullify this advantage of their reconnaissance but the framework demands a good switching strategy when switching between multiple configurations for its web-stack. To address this issue, we propose modeling of a real-world MTD web application as a repeated Bayesian game. We then formulate an optimization problem that generates an effective switching strategy while considering the cost of switching between different web-stack configurations. To incorporate this model into a developed MTD system, we develop an automated system for generating attack sets of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) for input attacker types with predefined capabilities. Our framework obtains realistic reward values for the players (defenders and attackers) in this game by using security domain expertise on CVEs obtained from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). We also address the issue of prioritizing vulnerabilities that when fixed, improves the security of the MTD system. Lastly, we demonstrate the robustness of our proposed model by evaluating its performance when there is uncertainty about input attacker information.

Write an article based on this \\"The \\"world's saddest polar bear\\" has been moved from a Chinese shopping mall and sent back to the ocean park where he was born.\\" Article:","output":"Title: \\"The Realm of Freedom: The World's Saddest Polar Bear's Return to the Ocean Park of His Origin\\" The headlines exploded with the news that the \\"World's Saddest Polar Bear,\\" as he had been chillingly dubbed, had finally been moved from the distressing confinement of a Chinese shopping mall to the freedom of the ocean park where he was born. This transfer was an endeavour pursued by a multitude of animal rights activists who tirelessly campaigned for his release, drawing worldwide attention to the plight of captive animals used as public entertainment. The saga of the \\"World's Saddest Polar Bear\\" began when he was first placed within Grandview Mall in Guangzhou, China. His home, a small, glass-enclosed space devoid of any natural elements, earned him his dreary moniker. This was a far cry from the vast, icy wilderness typical to polar bear habitats, and many who heard of his story had their hearts collectively pierced by his pitiful reality. Videos and images of the polar bear, named Pizza, living his days out in poor conditions, separated by glass from the bustling shoppers outside, were quick to circulate around the world. They painted a disturbing picture of an animal projected into a situation that conflicted dramatically with his natural instincts. The impact was immediate and profound. There was a surge of public outrage, spurring many advocates and groups to galvanize their efforts in campaigning for Pizza's removal from the mall. The primary argument resting at the heart of Pizza's case was the glaring disparity between his captive conditions and the natural habitat of a polar bear. Polar bears are highly adapted for life in the Arctic, home to some of the harshest conditions on the planet, with vast expanses of ice and snow, freezing temperatures, and a wealth of marine life for sustenance. Captivity, particularly in a shopping mall environment, is unable to even remotely replicate such specialized conditions, leading to detrimental physical and mental health effects on these animals. Non-governmental organizations such as Humane Society International (HSI) and Animals Asia rallied to appeal the Chinese authorities and the public, pushing for Pizza's return to his birthplace, an ocean park, a more suitable environment for him. Countless petitions were circulated, gathering millions of signatures, and pressure was continuously applied to the concerned parties to ensure the wellbeing of Pizza. Finally, all the hard work paid off. To the relief of many around the world, Pizza was removed from the shopping mall and transported back to his birthplace, the ocean park. His return was hailed as a moment of victory for animal rights, a testament to the power of collective effort, compassion, and advocacy. While his new abode may not perfect replicate the vast Arctic wilderness, it provides a significantly better environment for a polar bear's general wellbeing. Launching from this significant victory, animal rights advocates continue their work globally, hoping to shed light on other animals living in less than ideal conditions and effecting change where possible. The saga of the \\"World's Saddest Polar Bear\\" serves as an alarming reminder of the uncomfortable intersection between wildlife and commercial-centric human activities. It has reignited discourses on animal rights, captivity, welfare, and conservation, sparking renewed global empathy for animals trapped in conditions unfit for their survival and well-being. Pizza’s story is an impetus prompting us to strive towards more ethical interactions with wildlife, ensuring animals have the care, respect, and freedom they truly deserve."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Available choices: (1). no (2). yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"The answer to these two questions would not necessarily be the same. These questions tackle different perspectives on the U.S. involvement in the Middle East, and resulting answers may vary or be nuanced.  To answer each question in more detail: Question 1: Should the U.S. be involved in the Middle East? The United States' involvement in the Middle East is a complex issue with various arguments for and against. Proponents of U.S. involvement in the region argue that it is in America's best interest to ensure regional stability, protect allies, and secure resources like oil. They point to the risks of not intervening in the region, which may include encouraging terrorism and worsening humanitarian crises. On the other hand, critics argue that U.S. involvement does more harm than good, often leaving the region more unstable in the long run. They say that America should focus on its domestic issues and not interfere in Middle Eastern affairs. Furthermore, some argue that U.S. presence contributes to anti-American sentiment, exacerbating tensions and conflicts. Question 2: Why is the U.S. so involved in the Middle East? Historically, U.S. involvement in the Middle East is rooted in various factors, such as economic interests, geopolitical concerns, and ideological motivations. These factors include: 1. Resources: The Middle East is rich in natural resources, particularly oil. Access to these resources has been a significant driving force behind American policy in the region, with the goal of ensuring continued access to oil for the U.S. and its allies. 2. Geopolitical strategy: Throughout the Cold War and even afterwards, the U.S. aimed to ensure that no hostile power could control the Middle East, as this would pose a threat to American interests. As such, the U.S. has sought to counterbalance or weaken potential adversaries like Iran and Syria. 3. Terrorism: After the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. has focused on combating terrorism and its roots in the Middle East. This has led to military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq and ongoing efforts against groups like ISIS. 4. Humanitarian concerns: The Middle East faces numerous humanitarian issues, such as refugee crises, civil wars, and dictatorship. Advocates for U.S. involvement argue that America has a responsibility to alleviate human suffering and promote democracy in the region. 5. Support for allies: The U.S. has close ties with some key regional allies, including Israel and Saudi Arabia. Supporting these countries in their disputes and conflicts has resulted in deeper American involvement in the region. In conclusion, the answers to question 1 and question 2 are not the same, as the first question seeks to determine whether U.S. involvement is justifiable, while the second question addresses the reasons behind its current involvement. Each question can yield nuanced answers based on the perspectives and specific factors being considered."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Melissa's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she's just discovering her sexuality with boys.

It's up to the local town sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his annoying mystery-loving goody two-shoes daughter, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday the 13th part 3), to get to the bottom of these killings. This film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and less on the killings themselves and thus is able to differentiate itself from a lot of it's '80's Slasher brethren. It doesn't hurt that Alesia has a great body (I feel the need to stress the obvious with stating that the actress is over 18 and thus convey that i'm not overly perverted). On the downside, the movie is hampered with a few plot points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary, a grating theme some that is used a bit too often, and an ending that is a tad anti-climatic.

However, the film faces criticism for a few underdeveloped and unnecessary plot points, an overused grating theme song, and an anti-climactic ending.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Donald Trump Tops GOP Field in New Hampshire, Second in Iowa: Poll Donald Trump isn’t just the leading Republican candidate in the national polls – a barometer of name recognition – he is now looking strong in the early presidential nominating states where voters are paying attention. An NBC News/Marist poll released Sunday found the New York developer in first place among New Hampshire GOP primary voters and two percentage points behind Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in Iowa. Mr. Trump carries 21% of the New Hampshire GOP primary electorate, a decisive lead over second-place Jeb Bush, who had 14%, the poll found. In Iowa, Mr. Trump is at 17%, with Mr. Walker at 19%. The poll found a strong early showing in New Hampshire for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who at 7% is in fourth place among GOP voters there. Mr. Kasich, who formally launched his presidential campaign Monday, has just 2% support in Iowa, good for 11th place among the 17 Republican candidates tested. Until now, Mr. Trump had been in the lead of national polling but Mr. Walker and Mr. Bush led opinion surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire, home to the nation’s first two presidential nominating contests. Mr. Trump campaigned Saturday in Oskaloosa, Iowa, where he attacked the Wisconsin governor for the first time. Mr. Trump said “the gloves are off” after a fundraiser for Mr. Walker called Mr. Trump “DumbDumb” in an invitation to an event later this week. Mr. Trump’s polling rise comes as he seems to have weathered the initial public storm over his belittling of Sen. John McCain’s war record. The NBC/Marist poll was conducted before and after Mr. Trump said Mr. McCain “is not a war hero.” Mr. Trump’s standing in Iowa increased after he made the incendiary remark, though he lost ground in New Hampshire, according to the poll. Perhaps working in Mr. Trump’s favor is that twice as many Republican voters in both Iowa and New Hampshire said they’d prefer a GOP nominee who shares their positions on issues over one who has the best chance of retaking the White House for the party. The polling landmines for Mr. Trump are the same as they have been. Some 44% of the Iowa Republican electorate and 53% of the New Hampshire GOP voters have an unfavorable view of him, far more than the other leading candidates tested. Mr. Bush is next with about one-third of GOP voters in each early state viewing him unfavorably. Among Democratic presidential candidates the NBC/Marist poll found Hillary Clinton with a commanding percentage in Iowa (55%) over challengers Bernie Sanders (26%) and Martin O’Malley (4%). If Vice President Joe Biden was included, Mr. Sanders’s share dropped to just 7%. Mr. Biden hasn’t ruled out a presidential campaign but has done nothing to organize a run. Mrs. Clinton’s lead in New Hampshire is smaller – just 47% to 34% over Mr. Sanders. The NBC/Marist poll surveyed 919 registered voters in Iowa. The New Hampshire poll surveyed 910 registered voters. Each took place from July 14-21 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. ______________________________________________________ Politics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

The polls indicate that Trump is gaining strength in key early presidential nominating states. In New Hampshire, Trump holds 21% of the GOP primary electorate, significantly ahead of Jeb Bush at 14%. In Iowa, Trump is only 2 percentage points behind Walker, having 17% to Walker's 19%. Trump's rise in the polls seems to have outlasted the initial backlash over his comments about Senator John McCain's war record. However, a significant portion of the Republican electorate in both states hold an unfavorable view of Trump, which could impact his long-term prospects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Complete the following sentence. Every time that Jessica would go tanning her skin would break out, unlike Sarah since","output":"Every time that Jessica would go tanning her skin would break out, unlike Sarah since Sarah's genetic makeup and skincare routine were better equipped to handle the exposure to the sun and the potential side effects. Sarah, being blessed with a more resilient and less acne-prone skin type, could spend time under the sun without experiencing the same negative repercussions as Jessica. One of the primary factors that contributed to this stark difference between Jessica and Sarah's experience with tanning is the variation in their skin type. While Jessica's skin leans more towards the sensitive and oily side, making her more susceptible to breakouts and irritation, Sarah's skin composition is more balanced and less reactive to external factors. This means that Sarah's skin can better tolerate the heat, UV rays, and potential bacteria build-up that may accompany the tanning process. In addition to their genetic difference, another factor that impacts their experiences is their individual skincare routines. Jessica might not follow a strict pre-and post-tan care regimen, which would include exfoliating, cleansing, and moisturizing her face and body to reduce the chances of skin congestion and breakouts. In contrast, Sarah might be more attentive to her skincare needs, ensuring that she uses quality products and thoroughly cleanses her skin to minimize any adverse reactions to tanning. Furthermore, the overall health and lifestyle choices of both individuals can also play a significant role in their response to tanning. Jessica might have a diet that is high in processed and sugary foods, which could increase inflammation levels in her body and exacerbate her skin's response to acne and irritation. Alternatively, Sarah might focus on consuming a balanced and nutrient-dense diet, which would support her overall skin health and boost her immune system's ability to combat any potential bacterial infections associated with tanning. Lastly, it is essential to consider factors such as proper sun protection usage and the choice between outdoor sun tanning or an indoor tanning bed. It could be that Sarah opts for the safer option of using self-tanning products or takes precautionary measures, such as wearing sun protection and limiting her exposure to harmful UV rays while tanning outside. Jessica, on the other hand, might be more careless with her sun protection measures or prefer using tanning beds, which can have negative consequences for her skin and increase the likelihood of breakouts and irritations. In conclusion, several factors contribute to the contrasting experiences of Jessica and Sarah when it comes to tanning. Their genetic makeup, skincare routines, overall health and lifestyle choices, and sun protection practices all play a role in either mitigating or exacerbating the potential adverse effects on their skin. It's essential for Jessica to recognize the triggers behind her breakouts and adjust her approach to tanning accordingly, while Sarah should continue maintaining her skincare practices and taking precautionary measures to ensure her skin remains healthy and radiant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Besides news reports that tend to focus on war or election, Americans generally don't hear much about people in other countries. One reason may be that very little foreign-language literature is translated into English. In the United States, just a few of the titles, mainly translations of foreign novels, short stories, or poetry, make it into English. However, a number of efforts have taken root to try to bring more global literature to US audiences. Ks5u The online magazine of international literature, Words Without Borders, was founded by Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. The nonprofit site, now in its fifth year, offers modern writing from places such as Argentina, China and Italy, often for the first time in English. It gets about 200,000 page views per month and counts roughly 8,000 subscribers  , more than one-quarter of whom live in the US. \\"There's a wave of interest right now,\\" says Jill Schoolman, publisher of Archipelago Books, a small nonprofit press in Brooklyn, N.Y., opened in 2003 to publish world literature in translation only. \\"People are hungry for ideas from other countries.\\"  Rainmaker Translations, a Las Vegas-based nonprofit, was formed two years ago to support the publication of more top-quality global writing here in the US. They put out their first three titles, translated from Arabic, Chinese and Russian, in the spring of 2006 and plan to aid up to four more in the coming year. In March, the Center for the Art of Translation, a nonprofit started in 1994 in San Francisco, will publish Two Lines World Library, focused on writing from some particular areas published over the last several decades. Dalkey Archive Press, a century-old nonprofit publisher in Champaign, Illinois, has upped the number of translations on its publication list since 2003, from 25 percent to nearly 80 percent.               In recent years, more nonprofits have applied to the National Endowment for the Arts for help to publish literary translations. The agency is also trying to increase the availability...

A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year. Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious. The probability of transmission from one person to another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others. The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active (\\"overt\\") TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others.

The connection shared by grandparents and grandchildren is something very special and despite the changing family situation, it still remains strong across generations. For most of us, our grandparents were our first best friends, the ones with whom we shared our secrets and our pain.  In majority of the cases, grandparents would have babysat their grandchildren while parents were busy working and didn't have much time for their children. Even as a kid grows up, the love and affection for grandparents never dies, and for many teens, visiting grandparents or living with them in the same house is a pleasure. Kedar Patwary, a mass communication student, says, \\"I often end up having long conversations with my grandfather about the evolution of Indian society and I really admire him for the patience with which he answers all my questions. \\"  Many teenagers feel that their parents treat them as grown-ups, while their grandparents give them much freedom.  Leela Narayanan, a grandmother. says that she loves to  her grandchildren and cook favorite dishes for them. She further adds that her eldest granddaughter, who is now 19, was brought up by her till she was four and the closeness they shared remains the same even now.  At times, the gap m generations plays a negative role, when grandparents find it difficult adjusting to the modern lifestyle. Technology is what works against this relationship.

Your task is to classify whether the given answer is correct or not by providing \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\", based on the article. Problem:Article: Some years ago industries had more freedom than they have now, and they did not need to be as careful as they must today. They did not need to worry a lot about the safety of the new products that they developed. They did not have to pay much attention to the health and safety of the people who worked for them. Often new products were dangerous for the people who used them; often conditions in the work place had very bad effects on the health of the workers. Of course sometimes there were real disasters which attracted the attention of governments and which showed the need for changes. Also scientists who were doing research into the health of workers sometimes produced information which governments could not ignore. At such times, they inquire into the causes of the disasters or the problems. New safety rules were often introduced as a result of these inquiries; however. the new rules came too late to protect the people who died or who became seriously ill. Today many governments have special departments which protect customers and workers.In the U.S, for example, there is a department which tests new airplanes and gives warnings about possible problems. It also makes the rules that aircraft producers must follow. Another department controls the foods and drugs that companies sell.

Steel's base metal is iron, which is able to take on two crystalline forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one at the center of each of the six faces of the cube. Carbon, other elements, and inclusions within iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that otherwise occur in the crystal lattices of iron atoms.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.

I asked him about the most vivid memory of his life. One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work! It was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation. We all point fingers and blame one another for societal problems but never act upon it. If this man, a true Indian, would have just blammed the truck driver and went on his way, would the road still be cleared? The next time we point fingers at someone for a social cause, we must keep in mind that that someone is an Indian just like us. Will a true Indian point fingers at an Indian?

Here are possible answers to this question: - detestable - enabled - effusive - weird - accidental  I believe the correct choice is \\"accidental\\", here's why: A:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"accidental.\\" An oil spill, especially one considered the \\"biggest ever,\\" typically results in devastating environmental and economic consequences. Therefore, labeling it as \\"accidental\\" suggests that it was an unintended event and not a deliberate act. Let's briefly analyze the other options: - Detestable: This can be an appropriate descriptor from an emotional perspective, as oil spills are generally seen as environmentally harmful and undesirable. However, it doesn't give information about whether it was intended or not. - Enabled: This term generally means to provide someone or something with the means or ability to do a particular action. In this context, it does not make sense, as it doesn't describe the nature of the oil spill. - Effusive: This is an adjective used to describe someone who expresses their emotions in an unrestrained or excessively enthusiastic manner. It has no direct relation to an oil spill and doesn't fit in the context. - Weird: This word is typically used to describe something unusual, strange, or unexpected. Although an oil spill might be unexpected, \\"weird\\" does not convey the nature of the event in an informative way. In conclusion, \\"accidental\\" is the most appropriate choice because it highlights that the oil spill was unintentional, providing valuable context about the incident.

No Bacon is a type of salt-cured pork that typically comes from one of two parts of the pig: the pork belly or the back. Bacon made from the pork belly is typically fattier and more flavorful, while back bacon, also known as Canadian bacon or sometimes rashers, is leaner and comes from the loin of the pig. The statement provided - \\"If used, sodium polyphosphates are added to improve sliceability and reduce spattering when the bacon is pan-fried\\" - does not directly answer the question about what part of the pig bacon comes from. Instead, this statement discusses the use of sodium polyphosphates in the production of bacon and their role in improving the product's properties, specifically sliceability and reduced spattering during cooking.  These sodium polyphosphates are a type of food additive that acts as an emulsifier, helping to improve the texture and appearance of the bacon. They can also help bacon retain moisture, preventing it from drying out when cooked. However, their inclusion in the production process is unrelated to the specific part of the pig from which bacon is sourced. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'No,' as the statement provided does not address the specific part of the pig that bacon comes from. Instead, a more appropriate answer would be: Bacon is typically derived from two parts of the pig: the pork belly or the back.

Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that laboratory tests on popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans. E-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals. Known as \\"e-cigarettes,\\" the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals, spiced with flavors such as chocolate, cola or bubble gum. While manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a \\"healthy way\\" to smoke, federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user. \\"The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public,\\" said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, commissioner of the FDA. CNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere, one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes, after the FDA announcement, and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment. Because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user. That is why the FDA began to test them. The FDA's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes. In releasing its information, the FDA did not identify the two companies, but said in one sample, diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected. Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them, the FDA said. The FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008. To date, 50 shipments have been stopped. The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\"We know very little about these devices, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California, \\"but to say they are healthy -- that's highly doubtful.\\"  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Battery operated,flavoured spices\\" correctly answer the question \\"Describe some characteristics of e-cigarettes.\\"?","output":"The response \\"Battery operated, flavored spices\\" partially answers the question \\"Describe some characteristics of e-cigarettes.\\" A more accurate and detailed response would be: \\"E-cigarettes are battery-operated devices containing cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: One of the best ways to keep your liver healthy is to eat a balanced diet that is low in trans fats and fructose (as in \\"high fructose corn syrup\\").  These substances are found in many processed foods, including chips, soda, fried foods, etc., and have both been shown to contribute negatively to liver function.  Processed foods also include a host of other chemicals to maintain freshness and appearance, which your liver has to work to filter out. Your best bet for maintaining liver (and overall!) health is to minimize your consumption of prepackaged and processed foods, and prepare food from scratch using fresh ingredients whenever possible. Organic food is produced using minimal pesticides in the case of produce, and minimal or no added hormones or antibiotics, in the case of animal products.  This translates to less chemicals and additives that your liver has to filter out. It is important to note that organic foods still may contain some residual pesticides, and the jury is still out on how much of a health benefit they provide.  However, if you can afford to go organic, it certainly won't harm your liver, and you will be helping the environment, as well. A recent study published in Hepatology found that coffee drinkers, including those who drank decaf, were up to 25 percent less likely to have abnormal liver enzyme levels.  Researchers do not yet know why this is the case, but drinking coffee may be helping your liver out. Regular exercise not only helps you maintain a healthy body weight, it does good things for your liver, as well.  Studies have shown that just 150 minutes of activity per week (that’s just 1/2 an hour, five days per week) is enough to improve liver enzyme levels, and overall liver function. It can also reduce your chances of developing fatty liver disease. As if you didn't have enough reasons to quit already: numerous studies have shown that smoking drastically increases the risks of contracting both cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, and liver cancer. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that is usually caused by a virus.  There are three main types of hepatitis: A, B, and C, and all are contagious, however hepatitis C is usually only spread by sharing intravenous needles.  Vaccines are available for hepatitis A and B.  Practice good hygiene: remember to wash your hands after using the restroom or changing a baby's diaper. Hepatitis B is commonly spread through unprotected sex, so always wear a condom. Do not share drug needles with another person, or come in contact with another person's blood.

Many people travel by train, and they often bring suitcases with them to carry their belongings for the journey. The ticket office at a train station is where passengers purchase tickets for their trips. Hence, the presence of both a ticket office and people with suitcases would be most commonly found at a train station. In contrast, the other options are less likely to fit the description: - Hotel: While people with suitcases can be found at hotels, typically there is no ticket office for transportation services. - Opera house: Though there may be a ticket office for purchasing show tickets, it is unlikely to see people with suitcases at an opera house, as the primary purpose is attending a performance, not traveling. - End of line: This term could refer to the last stop on a train or bus route. However, it doesn't necessarily imply the presence of a ticket office. - City: While suitcases and ticket offices may be found in a city, the term 'city' is too broad, and a train station would be a better, more specific answer to the question.

On September 30, 1581, Nobunaga launched his own invasion of Iga on a much larger scale. The immediate trigger for this second invasion was a visit by two residents of Iga the month before to Nobunaga's stronghold in Azuchi during which the men offered to serve as guides for an invasion of the province. Nobunaga agreed and rewarded the men. By this time Oda was at the height of his power. He controlled most of central Japan, including all of the territories that bordered Iga. He was therefore able to assemble a large army which attacked the province from all directions: 1. 10,000 men under the command of Nobukatsu and Tsuda Nobusumi entering from Ise  to the southeast.2. 12,000 men under Niwa Nagahide and Takigawa Kazumasu entering from Tsuge to the northeast.3. 7,000 men under Gamō Ujisato and Wakisaka Yasuharu entering from Tamataki to the north.4. 3,700 men under Tsutsui Junkei entering from Kasama to the southwest.5. 7,000 men under Asano Nagamasa entering from Hase to the southwest.6. 2,300 men under Hori Hidemasa entering from Tarao to the northwest. Against this large army of 42,000 men, the Iga defenders only totaled 10,000 at most, and these were spread throughout the province. The Oda forces advanced, torching castles, shrines, and temples, and meeting relatively little resistance. The most significant military actions were the siege of Hijiyama Castle, which had become the rallying point for the northern Iga forces, and the siege of Kashiwara Castle in the south. With the surrender of the forces in Kashiwara Castle on October 8, organized Iga resistance came to an end.

Question: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

Write a summary based on this article: The mayor says his series of ordeals will make him more sympathetic to other people’s troubles. “It’s going to make me a better mayor,” he said. (Dayna Smith/For the Washington Post)      Fairfax City Mayor R. Scott Silverthorne was riding high last spring, basking in the success of a popular new park he had championed in the quiet bedroom community 20 miles west of the District.      He had weathered public criticism over the city’s decision to sell land it owned in Loudoun County without a public bidding process, and he was busy weighing whether proposals for new businesses and homes would detract from the community’s small-town charm.      When he noticed a small lump on his neck one morning, Silverthorne chose to ignore it. The lump would turn out to be the first in a series of challenges that demanded his attention and would end up changing his life.      In late June, Silverthorne was laid off from his job as a director of recruitment with the National Association of Manufacturers. By September, he owed about 58,000 to various creditors and filed for federal bankruptcy protection. A few weeks later, the bank foreclosed on Silverthorne’s five-bedroom house. The mayor moved into a nearby townhouse with a friend.      Meanwhile, the lump in his neck had grown bigger and become painful. Friends noticed that he was losing energy and had lost 35 pounds. In late October, Silverthorne visited an oncologist, who diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the neck, a sometimes aggressive but nonlethal form of cancer.      Fairfax Mayor Scott Silverthorne watches video of a previous city council meeting while being treated for cancer in Fairfax, Va. (Dayna Smith/For the Washington Post)      Reaction in the town of 23,500 has ranged from sympathy to questions about whether Silverthorne should give up his mayoral duties to focus on his health and financial stability.      “It’s been a terrible year for me,” Silverthorne said. “There’s no question about it. I can try to sugarcoat it as best I can, but the facts speak for themselves.”      As a boy, Silverthorne learned politics through watching his father, the late Frederick W. Silverthorne, who was mayor of Fairfax City in the late 1970s and early 1980s.      In dealing with cancer, the 50-year-old Democrat used as a role model a Republican political leader from across the Potomac River: Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who since June has waged a very public battle with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.      “I thought he handled it with class,” Silverthorne said of Hogan, whose cancer is in remission. “Very dignified.”      [Hogan: ‘I never expected to be in this position’]      Like Hogan, Silverthorne announced his diagnosis on television — in his case at the start of a city council meeting broadcast live on the city’s government access TV station on Nov. 17, Silverthorne’s 50th birthday.      Former Fairfax City police chief Rick Rappoport, right, shares a laugh with city councilmember Jeff Greenfield, center, and Scott Silverthorne, the city mayor, who has been undergoing treatment for a cancerous tumor. (Dayna Smith/For the Washington Post)      “Every party has a pooper, and tonight that pooper is going to me,” Silverthorne began, after the Pledge of Allegiance. He then relayed the details of his prognosis and his intention to seek a third term in office in the spring.      “I’m not looking for your sympathy,” Silverthorne added. “But I do believe in the positive power of prayer.”      Complete strangers emailed their get-well wishes, Silverthorne said. People showed up at council meetings to express their support.      “You’re getting a lot of prayers out here,” Allen Griffith, a local advocate for the homeless, told the mayor during a city council meeting this month. “We’re thinking of you, sir. Get well.”      Sounding sheepish, Silverthorne replied: “I really am grateful.”      Jeff Greenfield, a city council member who grew up on the same Fairfax City block as the mayor, said the outpouring is to be expected in a close-knit city where many families have stayed for generations.      “We rally behind people in a time of need, and the mayor is no different in that regard,” Greenfield said, describing how the community supported his family when his daughter underwent a series of heart surgeries years ago.      At the same time, the mayor’s critics are raising questions about aspects of his situation, especially his financial problems, which he has not discussed much in public.      “A lot of people have asked me: ‘Is it true the mayor lost his home in foreclosure? Is it true the mayor is in bankruptcy?’ ” said Nancy Loftus, a city council member and frequent critic of Silverthorne, especially on the 2014 land deal with Loudoun.      [Residents say they didn’t have enough voice in 30 million land deal]      She predicted that the mayor’s situation could become a campaign issue next year, although she also said she thought Silverthorne’s illness might leave people unwilling to openly question him.      Silverthorne admits to battling nausea from his medical treatments but said that he’s fully capable of remaining at the city’s helm. He’s looking for work, he said, and recently applied to become a substitute teacher with Fairfax County’s public school system. The pay isn’t much, but it’s more than the 541 per month he receives as mayor. He said he thinks his combination of ordeals will only make him more sympathetic to other people.      “It’s going to make me a better mayor,” he said.      During a recent chemotherapy session, the mayor ticked off plans to bring high-density developers to Fairfax City and talked about whether the community of shopping centers and Civil War monuments could become a magnet for millennials.      “If I could use this time period to cajole and arm-twist, where people are hopefully going to say: ‘Well, we don’t want to go against Scott right now because he’s not feeling well’?” Silverthorne said, as nurses helped other patients nearby. “At the end of the day, the mayor has the bully pulpit, and I should use it.”      Correction:      Earlier versions of this story incorrectly described the type of cancer that Fairfax Mayor Scott Silverthorne has. It is squamous cell carcinoma of the neck. The article has been corrected. ||||| R. Scott Silverthorne has appointed Jeffrey C. Greenfield as Acting Mayor for the City of Fairfax and has announced his resignation effective at noon on Thursday, August 12, 2016.      Silverthorne served nine full terms on the City Council, from 1990-2008, and a partial term from 2011-12. In 2016, he was elected to his third term as Mayor.      As Mayor, Silverthorne has pursued opportunities to make local government more efficient. Specifically, he facilitated a review of regulatory burdens for starting or expanding businesses within the city and has been a strong advocate for a vibrant business community. Silverthorne supported strategic economic development initiatives; he worked closely with residents and businesses to grow our local economy keeping the city competitive while maintaining the unique character and nature that makes Fairfax attractive to families. Silverthorne’s efforts included the continued revitalization of the historic downtown and the redevelopment of aging commercial centers throughout the city.            Silverthorne has been a champion for quality of life issues as well. Under his tenure, parks, recreation and cultural activities in the city flourished. Silverthorne was the lead sponsor of the city's successful open space referendum in 2000, which created a dedicated funding source for the preservation of open space and added an additional 45 acres of open space for future generations. Under Silverthorne’s leadership, and with the support of members of the City Council, the city developed the central Old Town Square Park. Situated in the heart of the city’s historic downtown, Old Town Square provides a place for social interaction, business promotion, and civic pride.            He also recognizes the importance of connecting communities. As Mayor, he strongly supports building more trails and sidewalks to encourage a more walkable, pedestrian-friendly community promoting a healthy lifestyle and cultivating a more livable city.            A native of Fairfax, Silverthorne received a degree in business administration in 1988 from Radford University. |||||","output":"Fairfax City Mayor R. Scott Silverthorne began his time in office with significant successes, such as the creation of a new park and weathering criticisms over a land sale. However, a series of personal challenges would prove to test and ultimately change him. Ignoring a small lump on his neck, Silverthorne continued his work while facing a layoff from his job as a director of recruitment for the National Association of Manufacturers. His debt reached 58,000, leading to bankruptcy and the foreclosure of his home. Eventually, the ignored lump on Silverthorne's neck became larger and painful, prompting an oncologist visit that led to a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the neck, a nonlethal but sometimes aggressive form of cancer. As he went public with his diagnosis and received support from the community, some town residents questioned if Silverthorne should step down from his mayoral duties to focus on his health and financial stability. Despite these challenges, Silverthorne determined that remaining in office would be best and that his experiences would enable him to better understand and empathize with the troubles of others. He continued to pursue improvements for Fairfax City while undergoing cancer treatments, focusing on revitalizing the historic downtown area, promoting economic development, and ensuring growth without sacrificing the small-town charm of the community. During his tenure, Silverthorne has advocated for quality of life improvements, more efficient local government, and economic incentives for businesses. Through his personal struggles, he has remained confident in his ability to serve Fairfax City and believes that his ordeals will ultimately make him a better mayor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: Three men were wounded in the shooting at a crowded bar in Olathe on Wednesday night and one of them later died. A barman told local media a man used racial slurs before opening fire. Two of the victims, including the deceased, are Indian. Adam Purinton, 51, has been charged with premeditated first-degree murder and the FBI is investigating a motive. Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, died while his friend Alok Madasani, 32, remains in hospital in a stable condition. The two men were engineers at US technology company Garmin and studied in India, according to their social media profiles. The other injured man, Ian Grillot, 24, had apparently intervened to stop the violence, according to witnesses. Speaking from his hospital bed to local TV News channel KMBC, he brushed aside suggestions that he was a hero. \\"I was just doing what anyone should have done for another human being,\\" he said. \\"It's not about where he's from or his ethnicity. \\"We're all humans. So I just felt I did what was naturally right to do.\\" Mr Purinton is accused of shooting customers at Austin's Bar and Grill as they watched the University of Kansas basketball team play on television. A bystander told the Kansas City Star that just before opening fire the gunman shouted: \\"Get out of my country.\\" The suspect allegedly fled on foot and was arrested five hours later at an Applebee's restaurant just over the state border, 80 miles (130km) away in Clinton, Missouri. The Kansas City Star reported that he told a staff member at the dining chain he needed a place to hide because he had killed two Middle Eastern men. A barman there tipped off police that he had a customer who had admitted shooting two men and the officers arrived to detain the suspect. Olathe Police Chief Steve Menke declined to comment on the reports of racial abuse but said his force was working with the FBI \\"to investigate any and all aspects of this horrific crime\\". The killing dominated news bulletins in India and social media, where some blamed Donald Trump's presidency. Siddharth, an Indian actor who uses one name, tweeted to his 2.6 million followers: \\"Don't be shocked! Be angry! Trump is spreading hate. This is a hate crime! RIP #SrinivasKuchibhotla.\\" Mr Madasani's father, Jaganmohan Reddy, also called it a hate crime, adding that such incidents had increased in number following Mr Trump's election. Mr Kuchibhotla was from the Indian city of Hyderabad. His parents, Madhusudhan Rao and Vardhini Rao, were too stunned by news of his death to comment, the Associated Press reported. The Indian external affairs ministry said two Indian consulate officials from Houston and Dallas have been sent to Kansas City to meet Mr Madasani and arrange the repatriation of Mr Kuchibhotla's body. The US Embassy in New Delhi decried the shooting. \\"The United States is a nation of immigrants and welcomes people from across the world to visit, work, study, and live,\\" said Charge d'Affaires MaryKay Carlson. \\"US authorities will investigate thoroughly and prosecute the case, though we recognise that justice is small consolation to families in grief.\\" Summary:","output":"In a place called Olathe, there was a very sad event where a man named Adam Purinton hurt three people in a crowded bar using a gun. One of those people, named Srinivas Kuchibhotla, did not survive. Another person, Alok Madasani, got hurt too but is in the hospital getting better. A third person, Ian Grillot, tried to help stop the bad man and also got hurt. After this, Adam ran away but got caught later by the police. Some people think this bad action happened because of angry feelings about where the two first men were from and also think it might be connected to the president, Donald Trump."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The match is the term that refers to the entire playing time of tennis. A match is comprised of either the best of three sets, or the best of five sets (depending on your league). Each set is played best out of six games. One player serves per game. A game is generally won when a player (or team if you are playing doubles) wins four points. A point is started when one player serves, and the opponent hits it back and the point continues in a back and forth manner until one player hits it out or in the net. Keep in mind that a game might take seven points, or more, to end if, for instance, one player wins three points and another wins four. Each point is given its own value for each player:  1st point won is \\"15 points\\" 2nd point won is \\"30 points\\" 3rd point won is \\"40 points\\" 4th point won makes GAME (signifying the end of the game) During each game, it is the server’s job to call out the score so that the opponent can hear it (unless you are actually playing in a professional setting in which they have a score keeper). You are always supposed to say your score, followed by your opponent’s score. For example:  If you have won two points and your opponent has won one, you would call out “30-15”. If your opponent has won three points and you have won one, you would call out “15-40”. Each set is played until one player or team (if you are playing doubles) has won six games. At the beginning of your serve, you must always call out the number of games each player or team has won, starting with your score. For example: If you have won four games, and your opponent has won two, you would call out “4-2” before beginning your “service game” (the game you serve the ball in, rather than receive). This refers to both games and sets. Here are some examples:  If you both have a score of 40 to 40, then you have to win two points in a row in order to win the game. (See Step 3 below for more details). If you both have won 5 games, and the score is 5 to 5, then you will need to win two more games in a row to make it 7-5 in order to win the set. If it is 5 to 5 and you win the next game, the score becomes 6-5. If you lose the next game and the score is 6-6, you will need to win 8 to 6 in order to win the set. Some sets have had scores of 12 to 10 or even higher. Depending on the league you are playing in, you will either need to win three out of five sets, or two out of three sets. However, like with games and sets, you must win by two. That means that matches can sometimes be five out of seven sets, or even seven out of nine sets if you and your opponent keep tying. On a scorecard, you should write the score of each set down. You should always write your score first. For example, if you won the match, your scorecard might look like this: 6-3, 4-6, 6-2. That means that you won the first set 6 games to 3; you lost the second set 4 games to 6; and you won the third set 6 games to 2. Summary:","output":"A tennis match consists of either the best of three or best of five sets, depending on the league, with each set comprising six games. A game is usually won by the player or team (in doubles) who scores four points first, using the scoring system of 15, 30, 40, and game. The server calls out the scores, and one must win by two points in case of a tie at 40-40. Each set is won by the player or team with six games, but again, the winner must have at least a two-game lead. In case of score ties such as 5-5, players need to win two consecutive games to secure a set. Matches can sometimes extend beyond the standard best-of if both players keep tying, requiring a two-set lead to declare the winner. Scores are recorded on a scorecard, with the player's score always written first, for example, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, indicating the player won the first, lost the second, and won the third set."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sir Julian Sorell Huxley FRS (22 June 1887 - 14 February 1975) was a British evolutionary biologist, eugenicist, and internationalist. He was a proponent of natural selection, and a leading figure in the mid-twentieth century modern synthesis. He was secretary of the Zoological Society of London (1935-1942), the first Director of UNESCO, a founding member of the World Wildlife Fund and the first President of the British Humanist Association. Huxley was well known for his presentation of science in books and articles, and on radio and television. As the 1930s started, Huxley travelled widely and took part in a variety of activities which were partly scientific and partly political. In 1931 Huxley visited the USSR at the invitation of Intourist, where initially he admired the results of social and economic planning on a large scale. Later, back in the United Kingdom, he became a founding member of the think tank Political and Economic Planning.  In the 1930s Huxley visited Kenya and other East African countries to see the conservation work, including the creation of national parks, which was happening in the few areas that remained uninhabited due to malaria. From 1933 to 1938 he was a member of the committee for Lord Hailey's Africa Survey.  In 1935 Huxley was appointed secretary to the Zoological Society of London, and spent much of the next seven years running the society and its zoological gardens, the London Zoo and Whipsnade Park, alongside his writing and research. The previous Director, Peter Chalmers Mitchell, had been in post for many years, and had skillfully avoided conflict with the Fellows and Council. Things were rather different when Huxley arrived. Huxley was not a skilled administrator; his wife said \\"He was impatient... and lacked tact\\". He instituted a number of changes and innovations, more than some approved of. For example, Huxley introduced a whole range of ideas designed to make the Zoo child-friendly. Today, this would pass without comment; but then it was more controversial. He fenced off the Fellows' Lawn to establish Pets Corner; he appointed new assistant curators, encouraging them to talk to children; he initiated the Zoo Magazine. Fellows and their guests had the privilege of free entry on Sundays, a closed day to the general public. Today, that would be unthinkable, and Sundays are now open to the public. Huxley's mild suggestion (that the guests should pay) encroached on territory the Fellows thought was theirs by right.  In 1941 Huxley was invited to the United States on a lecturing tour, and generated some controversy by saying that he thought the United States should join World War II: a few weeks later came the attack on Pearl Harbor. When the US joined the war, he found it difficult to get a passage back to the UK, and his lecture tour was extended. The Council of the Zoological Society--\\"a curious assemblage... of wealthy amateurs, self-perpetuating and autocratic\\"--uneasy with their secretary, used this as an opportunity to remove him. This they did by abolishing his post \\"to save expenses\\". Since Huxley had taken a half-salary cut at the start of the war, and no salary at all whilst he was in America, the Council's action was widely read as a personal attack on Huxley. A public controversy ensued, but eventually the Council got its way.  In 1943 he was asked by the British government to join the Colonial Commission on Higher Education. The Commission's remit was to survey the West African Commonwealth countries for suitable locations for the creation of universities. There he acquired a disease, went down with hepatitis, and had a serious mental breakdown. He was completely disabled, treated with ECT, and took a full year to recover. He was 55.","output":"This text is about Sir Julian Sorell Huxley, a British evolutionary biologist, eugenicist, and internationalist."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: Why are the doctor at the hospital swapping heathy village children for university children? Because of the poor bloodlines and genetic mutations in the faculty's inbred offspring The answer is:","output":"Title: The Innocence Swap In the idyllic rural settlement of St. Clair, children are known to embody an unparalleled vitality and health, attributed to their simplistic, nature-rich lifestyle. The tranquility of St. Clair stands in contrast to the frenzied urban life of Cardson University, where distinguished professors and faculty members reside with their progeny. The tragedy, however, lies in the defective genetic infrastructure of these offspring due to undisclosed generational inbreeding, leading to dire results. Dr. Adrianne Fields, an acclaimed geneticist and a Cardson University faculty member, stumbles upon this disheartening secret. Watching the children of her highly-respected peers suffer, Dr. Fields grows desperate. She devises a plan, shrouded in secrecy and ethical complexity, propelled by her firm belief that she's enhancing the lives of both sets of children. So begins the daring exchange of healthy children from the verdant village of St. Clair for these genetically compromised 'university children.' The plot intensifies as Dr. Fields and her team at the County General Hospital facilitate this illicit swap, creating an elaborate illusion of relocation programs and scholarships, covering the children's sudden adjacency switch without raising suspicions. She justifies her ethically questionable act by offering advanced education opportunities for the village children. However, a movie is incomplete without unexpected twists and hurdles. Jessica Ross, an investigative journalist and a native of St. Clair, starts noticing a pattern; her curiosity piqued by the sudden exodus of village children to the city's university and, more bizarrely, the influx of unfamiliar children with unique health conditions to St. Clair. She begins digging deeper, piecing together the dark puzzle Dr. Fields carefully designed to stay hidden. As Jessica edges closer to unravelling the truth, uncovering the tainted bloodline of the University's families, the film takes a thrilling turn. Exposed to an immense threat, Dr. Fields now races against time to ensure the plan's execution while evading detection.  Parallely, we delve into the lives of the swapped children, resulting in an emotional rollercoaster, showcasing their struggles to adjust in unfamiliar environments, their longing for home, and their perspectives. And while St. Clair's children benefit from advanced education, their rich health, too, slowly starts to deteriorate due to the city life's strain. The climax builds up as Jessica entraps Dr. Fields into a corner, revealing her controversial actions to the world. A dramatic trial unfolds, questioning medical ethics, the right to a better life, and the extent to which genetic superiority overshadows basic human rights. As the verdict is announced, the movie leaves audiences questioning - Who was in the wrong? The doctor who wanted better lives for children or the system that failed to protect their innocence? In the final scenes, the children return to their original families, the village children bringing back new knowledge and perspectives, and the university children happier for having known a healthier way of life. Ultimately, \\"The Innocence Swap\\" is a cinematic exploration of ethics, responsibilities, society, and – most importantly – love that knows no genetics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 3: Analyze synonyms and vocabulary. The terms \\"breakup\\" and \\"separation\\" are used synonymously in both sentences to represent the end of their previous band. In Sentence 1, \\"forming a new band\\" is used, while in Sentence 2, \\"founding a new band\\" is used. Both phrases indicate the same action—starting or creating a new band. Considering the similarities in the main ideas, vocabulary, and synonymous terms used, I conclude that these sentences mean the same thing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As a result, group Alpha experienced mild allergy symptoms, while group Beta continued experiencing severe allergy symptoms and remained hospitalized.  Which group experienced a runny nose?  Hint: Allergy symptoms can range from mild to severe. Mild symptoms might include itchy eyes, sneezing, and a runny nose. Severe symptoms can cause difficulty breathing, which may be life threatening. Keep in mind that it is the immune system and not the allergen that causes the allergy symptoms. Allergy symptoms can be treated with medications such as antihistamines. Severe allergic reactions may require an injection of the hormone epinephrine. These treatments lessen or counter the immune system’s response. A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that group Alpha, who experienced mild allergy symptoms, experienced a runny nose. This conclusion can be drawn from the details given in the hint, which specify that mild symptoms might include itchy eyes, sneezing, and a runny nose. Since group Alpha's response to the new allergy medicine was characterized as mild, it can be inferred that they encountered one or more of these described symptoms. In contrast, group Beta continued to suffer from severe allergy symptoms, resulting in their hospitalization. Severe symptoms typically involve difficulty breathing and can be life-threatening, as mentioned in the hint. Although it is possible that group Beta also experienced a runny nose, the focus for them was likely on more severe and dangerous signs of allergies. It is important to note that in both groups, the immune system is responsible for the symptoms experienced, rather than the allergen itself. In both mild and severe cases, the immune system overreacts to the allergen, triggering symptoms that manifest either as mild annoyances or severe reactions requiring medical intervention. The newly discovered allergy medicine seemed to have had differing levels of efficacy for the two groups – while it lessened group Alpha's symptoms to a milder state, it failed to provide significant relief to group Beta, whose members remained hospitalized. This could indicate that the medication may be more effective for certain individuals or types of allergies, or that some cases may be more resistant to treatment. In summary, it is likely that group Alpha experienced a runny nose, as mild symptoms including a runny nose were observed in their response to the allergy medication. In contrast, group Beta's focus was on their severe and potentially life-threatening symptoms, with the possibility of a runny nose being a secondary concern."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At least 65 people have been found dead, all apparently shot in the head, and all with their arms tied behind their backs, Reuters reports. The death toll could rise as high as 80, the rights group said. It's unclear which faction in the country's ongoing civil war killed them. The incident comes as Syrian rebels scored a major victory today, taking a government intelligence compound in the eastern city of Deir al-Zor after five days of fighting, and freeing at least 11 prisoners held within, the AP reports. The government responded with a series of airstrikes in an attempt to drive the rebels out. According to Reuters, the rebels included fighters from the al-Nusra Front, an Islamist group with ties to al-Qaeda. Expand this summary.","output":"The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported a devastating event it refers to as a \\"new massacre\\" taking place near Aleppo, a city in Syria, raising concerns about the ongoing violence and turmoil in the region. The death toll from the massacre is estimated to be at least 65 people, with the possibility of rising as high as 80 individual fatalities. Tragically, all victims seemed to have been shot in the head, with their hands bound behind their backs, indicating a cruel and targeted execution. At this time, it remains uncertain which faction, or group, involved in Syria's ongoing civil conflict is responsible for the killings. The civil war, which began in 2011, has continued to cause widespread destruction and suffering among the Syrian population. In addition to the heinous atrocities occurring near Aleppo, Syrian rebels have recently achieved a significant victory, taking control of a government intelligence compound located in the eastern city of Deir al-Zor. The seizure of the compound took five days of relentless fighting, culminating in the successful release of at least 11 prisoners who had been detained within the facility. News agencies, such as Reuters, reveal that the rebels comprised various groups, including fighters from the al-Nusra Front, an Islamist organization with known connections to al-Qaeda. This group has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United Nations, the United States, and other countries, and is suspected of playing a role in various acts of violence throughout Syria. In response to the rebel's advances, the Syrian government launched a series of airstrikes to counter the attacks and regain control of the lost territories. However, the outcome of these efforts remains unclear, as both sides continue to wrestle for dominance across the country. As the civil war in Syria enters its eleventh year, the situation remains dire, with hundreds of thousands of people killed, and millions displaced from their homes. International efforts at resolving the conflict have so far been unsuccessful, with the future of the country hanging in the balance. The horrific acts of violence, such as the massacre near Aleppo and the escalating battles between Syrian rebels and government forces, serve as painful reminders of the human cost and devastating consequences of the ongoing conflict. The international community must urgently address the humanitarian crisis that persists in Syria, as well as work towards finding a lasting, peaceful solution to the continuing civil war. This includes providing crucial support for those affected by the violence and facilitating conditions for dialogue and negotiations between the opposing factions. In summary, the recent reports of a new massacre near Aleppo further highlight the brutality and complexity of the Syrian civil war, while the battles between the government forces and rebel groups, including those affiliated with al-Qaeda, continue to plague the war-torn nation. The international community must persist in its efforts to aid the Syrian people and bring about an end to the violent conflict that has wrought so much pain and suffering on the population."},{"instruction":"You are given a statement written in Hindi.

Write some highlights for the following article: Furious activists fighting against anti-Semitism have demanded that a French hamlet changes its name from 'Death to Jews'. Anger against the small settlement of La-Mort-aux-Juifs - which has a population of less than 20 and is around 60 miles south of Paris - comes amid increasing claims of anti-Jewish prejudice in France. The Simon Wiesenthal Centre, an. internationally renowned Jewish pressure group, has now sent a letter to. France's Interior Minister to complain about the hamlet's name, and. express shock that nothing has previously been done to address its. controversial moniker. Controversial: Anger against the small settlement of La-Mort-aux-Juifs (pictured) - which has a population of less than 20 and is 60 miles south of Paris - comes amid increasing claims of anti-Jewish prejudice in France. Shimon. Samuels, director of the SWC, said he was 'shocked to discover the. existence of a village in France officially called 'Death to Jews'. Referring. to the Second World War Nazi Occupation and the French collaborator. government, Mr Samuels added: 'It is extremely shocking that this name. has slipped under the radar in the 70 years that have passed since. France was liberated from Nazism and the Vichy regime.' Local police and the national railway, the SNCF, assisted the Nazis during the Holocaust, which saw about 76,000 French Jews murdered. Many more were persecuted in major cities, including Paris, where 'round-ups' were regularly carried out by the Nazis. But the deputy mayor of the village of Courtemaux - population 289 - which has jurisdiction over 'La-Mort-aux-Juifs', said nobody had anything to be ashamed of. 'It's ridiculous. This name has always existed,' said Marie-Elizabeth Secretand, in an interview with France's national news agency, AFP. 'No one has anything against the Jews, of course. It doesn't surprise me that this is coming up again.' History: Local police and the national railway, the SNCF, assisted the Nazis during the Holocaust, which saw about 76,000 French Jews (pictured) murdered. Changing the name would require a decision by the municipal council, and Ms Secretand said this was unlikely to be successful. 'Why change a name that goes back to the Middle Ages or even further?,' she said. 'We should respect these old names. 'A previous municipal council, at least 20 years ago, already refused to change the name of this hamlet, which consists of a farm and two houses.' The Israeli offensive against Gaza, in which hundreds of civilians including young children have died, has led to claims of increased anti-Semitism in France. Others say that the increasing electoral success of the far-right National Front, whose founder Jean Marie Le Pen is a convicted anti-Semite, is another reason why Jews are feeling unsafe. There are currently around 500,000 Jews in France, but many are expressing a desire to emigrate to places where they will feel more secure. Castrillo Matajudios - which means 'Castrillo Kill Jews' - is a Spanish village which voted to change its name in May. Highlights:","output":"Activists are asking for a small French hamlet called \\"Death to Jews\\" to change its name because it is not nice to Jewish people.

A group that helps protect Jewish people sent a letter to someone important in France to ask them to change the name.

Use a parchment paper: Before you start baking, cut a piece of parchment paper that is the same size as the bottom of your pan.

When you finish baking, the parchment paper will help to keep your pan clean because most of the food will stick to the paper instead of the pan. 2. Grease your pan: Before you put your baking mixture into the pan, gently spread butter, oil, or cooking spray evenly onto the bottom and sides of the pan. This will help to create a slippery, non-stick surface that makes it easier to clean after baking. Both of these methods can help to make a pan easier to clean, but using parchment paper might be a little bit more helpful because it can prevent more food from sticking to the pan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context:  Sir Henry Joseph Wood  (3 March 1869 – 19 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of promenade concerts, known as the Proms.  He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company.  He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music.  When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood...  answer the following question:  Where did the man who was born in modest circumstances to perform the Proms after the 1941 bombing?

News article: Jimmy Savile abused children across six decades at 14 hospitals including Great Ormond Street and a children's hospice, according to a police report. He also carried out 14 alleged assaults at schools.      Commander Peter Spindler of the Metropolitan police said Savile used his fame and celebrity status to \\"hide in plain sight\\", adding that he had \\"groomed the nation\\".      The report into his activities reveals his offending spans from 1955-2009. Most of his victims were children – 73% – and he committed most of the offences when he was aged between 40 and 50.      Spindler said the report \\"paints a stark picture emphasising the tragic consequences of when vulnerability and power collide. His offending footprint was vast, predatory and opportunistic\\".      Some of the hospitals where the TV and radio presenter abused children are: Leeds general infirmary, Great Ormond Street, Exeter hospital, Saxondale mental health hospital in Nottinghamshire, and Wheatfield hospice in Leeds, a Sue Ryder hospice for dying children.      According to the report, called Giving Victims a Voice, 450 victims have come forward to allege incidents, and Savile committed 214 criminal offences in 28 areas of England and Wales.      Savile offended while working at the BBC between 1965 and 2006, the year he sexually assaulted a teenage girl at the final recording of Top of the Pops. Most of the victims were aged between 13 and 16.      Savile raped 34 people, including 28 children. He used every opportunity and every institution to which he had access because of his fame to target young people.      Fifty-seven of the allegations took place in 14 hospitals and a hospice in the UK. He assaulted 16 victims at Leeds general infirmary, one at Great Ormond Street hospital and he assaulted someone who was visiting a dying child at the Sue Ryder Wheatfield hospice in Leeds. At Great Ormond Street the child Savile abused died, but someone who witnessed what happened came forward.      He also assaulted children and young girls 33 times in TV and radio studios and there were 14 assaults in schools. Savile was invited into the schools – which have not been named – by children who wanted to appear on Jim'll Fix It, police said.      The youngest of Savile's victims was an eight-year-old boy who he touched sexually, and his last victim was a 46-year-old woman who was assaulted in 2009.      DS David Gray, who led the inquiry, said: \\"He has spent every minute of every working day thinking about this. Whenever an opportunity came along he took it. He picked on vulnerable victims and he was clever enough to choose people who he knew would not speak out.\\"      Gray said he expected the number of crimes recorded to rise above 214.      The Crown Prosecution Service said in a separate report released on Friday that had police and prosecutors taken a different view to allegations from four women as recently as 2007 Savile may have been brought to justice.      The director of public prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, issued a statement on Savile's offending. He said the report by Alison Levitt QC on the CPS's handling of cases brought before it had concluded the investigations into four complaints from women by Surrey and Sussex police could have been dealt with differently.      \\"Whilst most of the complainants continue to speak warmly of the individual officers with whom they had contact, most of those spoken to by Ms Levitt QC have said that, had they been given more information by the police at the time of the investigation, and in particular had each been told that she was not the only woman to have complained, they would probably have been prepared to give evidence.      \\"Having spoken to the complainants, Ms Levitt QC has concluded that, although there are a number of imponderables, had the police and prosecutors taken a different approach a prosecution might have been possible in relation to three of the four allegations.\\"      The CPS review revealed how Savile had batted away the allegations made by four women in 2007-08 of past abuse. He told Surrey police in 2009 that the sexual assault complaints against him were \\"invented\\" and an \\"occupational hazard\\" for a famous entertainer.      Savile made the comments when he was interviewed under caution. He told police he had a \\"policy\\" for dealing with sexual assault complaints made against him and that he had sued five newspapers in the past. A police log of the interview records Savile as saying: \\"If this [these allegations] does not disappear then my policy will swing into action.\\"      His offending took place predominantly in Leeds and London, his home town and his main work location respectively.      Gray said Savile was not part of a paedophile ring but detectives were investigating whether he was part of a loose network of paedophiles who knew each other and took advantage of their position to sexually abuse children.      The report said the institutions and agencies that missed past opportunities to stop Savile must do all they can to ensure their procedures for safeguarding children are as robust as possible.      \\"Only then can the victims who have come forward be reassured that it is unlikely to happen again.\\"      Gray said: \\"The offences started before he was a BBC celebrity but it seems clear that his peak offending coincided with his peak status.\\"      He said Savile did not order victims to be silent, he just abused them then discarded them. \\"His force of personality was powerful. He dismissed his victims afterwards; he did what he wanted to do then just discarded them and they were too frightened to speak out.\\"      The prime minister's spokesman said: \\"These are further appalling allegations. What is required is that every organisation involved has to investigate what has gone on and get to the bottom of it.      \\"There are a series of investigations that were already ongoing into a number of hospitals. The Department of Health had already announced that Kate Lampard QC was overseeing those and she will also report to the secretary of state on what lessons can be learnt for the health system as a whole.\\" ||||| Image caption Sexual abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile emerged after his death      Adults and children, including a boy of eight, were abused by Jimmy Savile, a report detailing allegations over 50 years has revealed.      Police and the NSPCC outlined offences by the late presenter at venues including 13 hospitals and a hospice.      Some 214 crimes were recorded across 28 police force areas, including 34 of rape or penetration, the report said.      The CPS apologised for missing the opportunity to prosecute Savile in 2009, while he was still alive.      The Metropolitan Police said the victims' accounts painted a \\"compelling picture of widespread sexual abuse by a predatory sex offender\\", and Cdr Peter Spindler, who is leading the investigation, said Savile had \\"groomed the nation\\".      The NSPCC said Savile had been one of the most prolific sex offenders in its 129-year history.      'Sincere apology'      The former BBC presenter of Top Of The Pops and Jim'll Fix It, who also worked as a Radio 1 DJ and received a knighthood in 1990, died aged 84 in October 2011 - a year before the allegations were broadcast in an ITV documentary.      Revelations that Savile had sexually abused children prompted hundreds of victims to come forward, including those who said they were attacked on BBC premises and a number of other institutions.

The 30-page document detailed a number of findings, including:      Savile offended at 13 hospitals, including Great Ormond Street, with one offence recorded at Wheatfields Hospice in 1977      A total of 14 offences were recorded in relation to schools      Savile's youngest victim was an eight-year-old boy, and the oldest was a 47-year-old woman      The earliest allegation is from 1955 in Manchester and the last is from 2009      Offences were carried out at the BBC between 1965 and 2006, including at the last Top of the Pops recording      Peak offending took place between 1966 and 1976      A total of 450 people have made sexual abuse allegations against Savile since October - of whom 73% were under 18, with most aged 13 to 16      There is \\"no clear evidence\\" he operated in paedophile ring, although \\"whether he was part of an informal network\\" is still being investigated      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt: \\"We want to know that we have the right procedures in place\\"      In response to the report, the BBC said it was \\"appalled\\" some of the offences were committed on its premises and restated a \\"sincere apology to the victims of these crimes\\".      The report also revealed 16 offences were committed at Leeds General Infirmary between 1965-95 and 22 at Stoke Mandeville Hospital between 1965-88.      One offence was committed at each of the following hospitals - Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital, St James Leeds Hospital, High Royds Psychiatric Hospital, Dewsbury Hospital, Wycombe General Hospital, Great Ormond Street Hospital in 1971, Ashworth Hospital, Exeter Hospital, Royal Portsmouth Hospital, St Catherine's Hospital in Birkenhead, and Saxondale Mental Health.

He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the scale of the challenge for the NHS's investigation into Savile's abuse on its premises was \\"absolutely huge\\" because it would cover a period of about 40 years.      Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called for \\"a proper overarching review led by child protection experts into why everyone failed to stop Savile and what should be done now\\".      \\"A myriad of small reviews and inquiries into how it could happen in different hospitals or the BBC are just not enough,\\" she said.      The Crown Prosecution Service also published a review of a decision in 2009 not to charge Savile with sexual offences in relation to four complaints made to police in Surrey and Sussex.      It said further action might have been possible had \\"police and prosecutors taken a different approach\\", prompting director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer to apologise on behalf of the CPS and say the report represented a \\"watershed moment\\".

BBC media correspondent Torin Douglas said the main target for victims making compensation claims would be the Savile estate. The BBC could also be targeted, he added.      Operation Yewtree has three strands - claims against Savile, claims against Savile and others, and claims against others. The report marks the end of the investigation into claims against Savile.      The allegations against Savile prompted a series of investigations, including three at the BBC and another by the Department of Health into his role at Broadmoor.      The Dame Janet Smith Review, which is looking into the culture and practices of the BBC while Savile was an employee, said it had now been contacted by more than 350 people. The investigation is ongoing. ||||| FILE - In this Dec. 17, 1986 file photo, disc jockey Jimmy Savile is pictured at Madame Tussauds museum in London, England. British police say the late entertainer Jimmy Savile committed more than 200... (Associated Press)      All fell victim to the late British entertainer Jimmy Savile, police said, describing him Friday as a sexual predator who used his fame to find victims and deliberately targeted individuals who would not speak out against him.      A three-month police investigation yielded a staggering litany of sexual crimes: 214 offenses, including 34 rapes, over more than half a century, the majority of the victims under 18. Police say they expect the number of offenses to rise as more allegations are investigated.      A police report published Friday describes a \\"prolific, predatory sex offender\\" whose celebrity unlocked the doors of institutions across Britain, from hospitals where he served as a charity fundraiser to schools whose pupils eagerly watched his television programs _ and even to the prime minister's country house, where he dined with Margaret Thatcher.      \\"It could be said that he groomed a nation,\\" said Cmdr. Peter Spindler, head of the Metropolitan Police specialist crimes unit. \\"He was hiding in plain sight, but none of us were able to do anything about it.\\"      The catalog of abuse provides the fullest accounting yet of the allegations against Savile, a cigar-chomping, platinum-haired TV and radio personality who died in October 2011 at age 84. Savile's elaborate funeral reflected his status as a popular entertainer and tireless charity worker, but a documentary broadcast late last year pulled the mask away, claiming that he was a serial sex offender who traded on his celebrity to prey on vulnerable children.      The subsequent police investigation more than bore out those allegations. Detectives initially believed there were between 20 and 25 victims. So far, 450 have come forward with claims against Savile _ a scale of abuse police called \\"unprecedented in the U.K.\\"      Child welfare experts say Savile's fame helped him achieve that grim distinction.      \\"Savile cunningly built his entire life around gaining access to vulnerable children,\\" said Peter Watt of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.      Savile set himself up as a sinister Pied Piper; children came to him. He hosted the long-running BBC music show \\"Top of the Pops,\\" which saw everyone from the Rolling Stones to the Sex Pistols perform before an audience of excited young people. Police say victims were assaulted in dressing rooms or groped during filming breaks. One victim was a teenager who said she was assaulted at the last-ever recording of the show in 2006, when Savile was nearly 80.      Savile also hosted \\"Jim'll Fix It,\\" a BBC TV show on which he granted the wishes of young viewers who wrote in with cherished plans. Police said Savile would sometimes visit the letter-writers' schools, and some of the offenses took place there.      \\"He could do anything he wanted,\\" said Detective Supt. David Gray, who led the police investigation. \\"He could turn up at a school and say \`Is anyone interested in meeting me?'\\"      He often visited a school for troubled girls, where pupils were allegedly offered cigarettes and trips in Savile's car in return for sex. The flamboyant star often drove a convertible Rolls-Royce.      \\"He only picked on the most vulnerable,\\" Gray said. \\"He was clever enough to know the ones less likely to speak out against him.\\"      Savile also was a fundraiser for hospitals, including Leeds General Infirmary in his northern England home town and the Stoke Mandeville spinal injuries center in southern England. Police said he committed 50 assaults at 14 medical establishments, including a cancer hospice and several psychiatric hospitals. Among his victims were ill youngsters confined to bed.      Savile's charitable work raised his profile and credibility. Recently released records show he lobbied Thatcher for government donations and tax breaks for charities.      \\"I find it quite scary that people who had the power to stop him didn't use that power ... and he went on to do the most horrific things to people in the most awful circumstances,\\" said Caroline Moore, who says Savile abused her as she recovered from a spinal operation at Stoke Mandeville in 1971.      Some Savile victims did speak out. Several women went to police to report Saville in 2003, 2007 and 2008, and senior prosecutor Alison Levitt said Friday that the entertainer could have been brought to justice while he was alive, if officials had pursued the allegations more vigorously.      The BBC _ which has been strongly criticized for dropping an investigation into Savile's crimes shortly after this death _ and several health bodies are holding their own inquiries into how Savile was able to get away with decades of abuse.      Peter Saunders of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood said authorities must be more prepared to listen to children who say they have been abused.      \\"I want us to forget Jimmy Savile. He is not worthy of memory,\\" Saunders said. \\"But I want us to remember his many victims.\\"      ___      Jill Lawless can be reached at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"The late British entertainer, Jimmy Savile, has been described by Metropolitan Police as one of the most prolific sex offenders in its history.

The plot focuses on their efforts to take down a notorious criminal organization. Step 2: Establish the central conflict The team has been chasing a dangerous criminal mastermind for some time, but all their efforts have been undermined by an unidentified mole within their ranks. The mole consistently leaks vital information and puts all their operations at risk. Step 3: Develop a subplot Costigan has been working on a separate investigation, trying to identify the mole. He starts becoming suspicious of Sullivan due to his odd behavior, frequent late-night phone calls, and mysterious rendezvous with unidentified individuals. Step 4: Plan the climactic rooftop confrontation Costigan follows Sullivan to a remote rooftop one night, where Sullivan meets with the criminal mastermind. Costigan witnesses them exchanging sensitive information. Armed with this knowledge, Costigan confronts Sullivan about his actions. Step 5: Reveal the mole's identity At the climactic rooftop confrontation, Costigan details his investigation and the evidence he has gathered against Sullivan.

The court acknowledges Sullivan's remorse and contributions in bringing down the criminal organization, granting him a reduced sentence. The team forgives Sullivan, understanding the difficult circumstances he faced. The story ends with a message of redemption and the importance of not letting one's past dictate their future.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Snejana Farberov. PUBLISHED:. 02:25 EST, 5 December 2013. |. UPDATED:. 02:39 EST, 5 December 2013. The father of a 6-year-old victim of the Sandy Hook school shooting appeared on Piers Morgan Live today to talk about the looming one-year anniversary of the tragedy – and the pain of celebrating the holidays without his child. Neil Heslin, whose son, Jesse Lewis, was shot dead in the December 14, 2012, massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, said that he expected Christmas spent without his boy to be just as difficult this year as the year before. ‘I will probably take the Christmas tree down that I never took down from last year,’ Heslin said. In mourning: Neil Heslin, whose son, Jesse Lewis, was shot dead in the December 14, 2012, massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, spoke about his life since the tragedy. Portrait of grief: Neil Heslin, father of six-year-old Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victim Jesse Lewis, holds a picture of him with Jesse as he testifies during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on 'The Assault Weapons Ban of 2013' He explained that he and Jesse set up the tree after Thanksgiving and were planning to decorate it on the weekend of the shooting. With Jesse not there to trim it, the bare tree has been standing in the Heslin household ever since the shooting. Mr Heslin also addressed the controversial decision to release today the harrowing audio recordings of 911 calls made during the massacre, saying he wished they remained sealed. ‘It’s just a sad reminder of what happened and clearly the day is etched in my mind, December 14th,’ he said. The grieving man compared the heart-breaking experience of losing a child to an amputation. Mr Heslin, pictured in March during a pro-gun control event in New York, said he could not bring himself to take down last year's tree that he and his son (right) had set up just before the school shooting. Hero: Scarlett Lewis, mother of Sandy Hook victim Jesse Lewis, said that her son yelled for his classmates to run away before Adam Lanza shot him in the head. Controversial move: Mr Heslin criticized the decision to release the audio recordings of 911 calls made during the December 14, 2012, tragedy. ‘I guess the best description I could give is it's like losing a leg and an arm and not being able to support yourself,’ Neil Heslin told the interviewer. On the event of the anniversary, Mr Morgan also spoke to Marsha Lanza, the aunt of the 20-year-old gunman, Adam Lanza, who revealed that the massacre has 'shaken their family to the core.' Different perspective: Adam Lanza's aunt, Marsha Lanza (right) said that the massacre has shaken their family to the core and that she too knows what it means to lose a child. Speaking from her home in Florida, Mrs. Lanza, who is married to the brother of Adam's father, recalled how. she first learned of the tragedy in Newtown. Monster: Adam Lanza, 20, killed his mother and then opened fire inside the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, killing 26 people, among them 20 children. The woman said that when she saw an early news report about the school shooting on TV, she thought to herself, 'Oh no, not another one,' not knowing at the time the identity of the killer. When she learned that it was her nephew who murdered 20 children and six adults before turning the gun on himself, Marsha Lanza said she was shocked and immediately called her husband. In the candid conversation about the tragedy, Adam Lanza's aunt said she is no stranger to loss and knows all too well how the victims' families feel. ‘My heart goes out to each and every family that has lost a child,’ she said. ‘Personally, I have lost two sons. I know what you feel, I know what you’ll feel five years from now and 10 years from now.’ She added: 'You can't dwell on the bad times...you will endure.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"This article is about a man named Neil Heslin, who lost his son, Jesse Lewis, in a very sad event called the Sandy Hook school shooting. The Sandy Hook shooting happened on December 14, 2012, in a place called Newtown, Connecticut. A man named Adam Lanza hurt a lot of people and many children lost their lives that day. Neil Heslin talked about how much he misses his son, especially during special times like Christmas. He and Jesse had set up a Christmas tree before the shooting, but after Jesse was gone, Neil couldn't bring himself to take the tree down. In the article, Neil also talks about how sad it was to hear the record of phone calls made during the Sandy Hook shooting, as it brought back very sad memories. The article also mentions Adam Lanza's aunt, Marsha Lanza, who is also saddened by the shooting and has experienced the loss of her own children. She understands the pain of the families who lost their loved ones during the Sandy Hook tragedy. In summary, the article talks about the difficult feelings and emotions experienced by those affected by the Sandy Hook school shooting, and how they remember and miss their loved ones."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1982 & loved it then. About 4 years later I had the privilege of seeing Luciano Pavarotti sing at the Metropolitan Opera house in New York (in Tosca) so seeing the ending of this film reminds me very much of that great night. What's not to like about this film? The music is brilliant and Pavarotti (Fini) was at his best and still looked great. The story is actually very funny in parts & the 'food fight' scene is still one of the funniest I have ever seen. The hot air balloon flight over the Napa valley was beautiful & so was the song he sang \\"If we were in love\\" (one of the few times Pavarotti sang in English). And hearing the duet of Santa Lucia gorgeous. Get real folks, this was a film about an opera singer called Georgio Fini who just happened to be played by Pavarotti. Kathryn Harrold & Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles. I am VERY glad that I still have this almost worn out VHS tape of this movie but I would love this to be released on DVD especially now that Pavarotti is no longer with us because I think this includes the best performance of Nessun Dorma sung by him still on film today!","output":"To analyze the sentiment of this review, I will break it down into segments and look for positive, negative, and neutral expressions. 1. \\"I remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1982 & loved it then.\\" - Positive sentiment (shows appreciation) 2. \\"About 4 years later I had the privilege of seeing Luciano Pavarotti sing at the Metropolitan Opera house in New York (in Tosca) so seeing the ending of this film reminds me very much of that great night.\\" - Positive sentiment (shows admiration and a positive memory) 3. \\"What's not to like about this film?\\" - Rhetorical question, implying positive sentiment 4. \\"The music is brilliant and Pavarotti (Fini) was at his best and still looked great.\\" - Positive sentiment (praising music and Pavarotti's performance) 5. \\"The story is actually very funny in parts & the 'food fight' scene is still one of the funniest I have ever seen.\\" - Positive sentiment (enjoyment of the story and humor) 6. \\"The hot air balloon flight over the Napa valley was beautiful & so was the song he sang 'If we were in love' (one of the few times Pavarotti sang in English).\\" - Positive sentiment (appreciation of the visuals and the song) 7. \\"And hearing the duet of Santa Lucia gorgeous.\\" - Positive sentiment (appreciation of the music) 8. \\"Get real folks, this was a film about an opera singer called Georgio Fini who just happened to be played by Pavarotti.\\" - Neutral sentiment (clarifying the premise of the film) 9. \\"Kathryn Harrold & Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles.\\" - Positive sentiment (praising the other actors) 10. \\"I am VERY glad that I still have this almost worn out VHS tape of this movie but I would love this to be released on DVD especially now that Pavarotti is no longer with us because I think this includes the best performance of Nessun Dorma sung by him still on film today!\\" - Positive sentiment (appreciation and desire for the film to be released on DVD, praises Pavarotti's performance) In summary, this review expresses an overwhelmingly positive sentiment, with the reviewer praising multiple aspects of the film including the music, story, humor, visuals, and performances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In recent years there was a high demand for massively distributed databases with high partition tolerance but according to the CAP theorem it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide consistency, availability and partition tolerance guarantees. A distributed system can satisfy any two of these guarantees at the same time, but not all three. For that reason many NoSQL databases are using what is called eventual consistency to provide both availability and partition tolerance guarantees with a reduced level of data consistency. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What explains the difficulty in a system containing availability, consistency, and partition tolerance guarantees?","output":"The difficulty in achieving a system that provides availability, consistency, and partition tolerance simultaneously lies in the inherent trade-offs between these properties, as stated by the CAP theorem. The CAP theorem was proposed by Eric Brewer in 2000 and later proven by Seth Gilbert and Nancy Lynch from MIT in 2002. To better understand this difficulty, let's define each of the CAP properties: 1. Consistency: Every node in a distributed system sees the same data at the same time. This means that after a write operation, all subsequent read operations should return the updated value, ensuring that all operations follow a linear order. 2. Availability: Every request to the system receives a response, indicating either success or failure. In simpler words, the system should always be operational and responsive to requests regardless of any failures encountered. 3. Partition tolerance: The system continues to function even if the network is divided into two or more isolated partitions due to communication failures or network issues. The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can meet at most two of these three requirements simultaneously. The reason for this difficulty is the underlying trade-offs necessary to ensure each property which often conflict with one another. Let's analyze these trade-offs: 1. Consistency vs Availability: In a distributed system, when a client writes a piece of data, this data must be propagated across all nodes in the system to guarantee consistency. However, this propagation takes time and will often require acknowledgment from each node to ensure data stability. During this time, if any part of the system becomes unavailable due to a network failure or node crash, the system can't guarantee complete and up-to-date data to all clients, leading to inconsistency. 2. Consistency vs Partition tolerance: To maintain consistency across all nodes, the system must enforce strict control over data flow and updates. However, in the presence of network partitions, ensuring that all nodes have the same data can be challenging. If the system prioritizes consistency, it might have to sacrifice availability by blocking some operations or allowing only partial functionality, which can be detrimental during a partition. 3. Availability vs Partition tolerance: If a system aims for high availability, it must continue to operate under network partition conditions. If a partition occurs, the system has two options: either block operations until the partition is resolved (harming availability) or continue to operate independently in both partitions, which may result in inconsistent data once the partition is resolved. Due to these trade-offs, it is difficult to create a system that guarantees availability, consistency, and partition tolerance simultaneously. As a result, modern distributed systems and databases often choose to adopt an \\"eventual consistency\\" model, which prioritizes availability and partition tolerance and works to provide a flexible degree of data consistency. This approach enables systems to be more resilient in the face of network failures and scale effectively across a large number of nodes. However, it comes at the cost of relinquishing the guarantee of immediate consistency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

The film version of the speech is heavily condensed, with much of the original vulgarity removed. Following the humiliating American defeat at the Battle of the Kasserine Pass in 1943, Patton is placed in charge of the American II Corps in North Africa. Upon his arrival, he enforces discipline amongst his troops, e.g. fining a cook 20 for not wearing his army issue leggings. Patton is then summoned to a meeting with Air Marshal Coningham of the Royal Air Force, where he claims that the American defeat was caused by lack of air cover. Coningham promises Patton that he will see no more German aircraft - but seconds later the compound is strafed by Luftwaffe planes. Patton then defeats a German attack at the Battle of El Guettar; his aide Captain Jenson is killed in the battle, and is replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Codman. Patton is bitterly disappointed to learn that Erwin Rommel, Commander of the German-Italian Panzer Army, was on medical leave due to having diphtheria, but Codman reassures him that: \\"If you've defeated Rommel's plan, you've defeated Rommel\\". After success in the North Africa campaign, Patton and Bernard Law Montgomery plan the Allied invasion of Sicily. Patton's proposal to land his Seventh Army in the northwest of the island with Montgomery in the South-East (therefore potentially trapping the German and Italian forces in a pincer movement), initially impresses their superior General Alexander, however Eisenhower rejects it in favour Montgomery's more cautious plan, which places Patton's army in the South-East, covering Montgomery's left flank. Whilst the landing is successful, the Allied forces become bogged down, causing Patton to defy orders and push his army northwest to Palermo, and then to the port of Messina in the northeast, narrowly beating Montgomery to the prize, although several thousand German and Italian troops are able to flee the island.

News article: Please enable Javascript to watch this video      One Whittier police officer has died and another officer was wounded following a Monday morning shootout with a recently paroled \\"known gang member\\" who is suspected of the fatal shooting of another man hours earlier, authorities said.      The police shooting, which also left the suspect injured, occurred around 8:30 a.m. in the area of Colima Road and Mar Vista Street in Whittier, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said in a news release.      The officer killed was identified Monday afternoon as Keith Boyer, a veteran of the Whittier Police Department.      “He was the best of the best,” Whittier police Chief Jeff A. Piper said.      Piper teared up as he described Boyer, saying the two had played music together and had been friends for a quarter-century.      The other officer, who is expected to survive, is Officer Patrick Hazell, Piper said.      Boyer was killed when he and Hazell were responding to a traffic collision, sheriff's Lt. John Corina said.      The gunman had rear-ended a car and then got out of his vehicle and asked the occupants of a car he hit to help him push his vehicle out of the road and around the corner onto Mar Vista Street, a sheriff's news release stated.      When the officers got there, they first went to talk to the occupants of the vehicle that was rear-ended, who in turn pointed them to the suspect's vehicle. The officers then went around the corner to that car and made contact with the driver, asking him to get out of the car. They were going to pat him down to check for weapons when the gunfire began, Corina said.      \\"When they're doing that, that's when he pulls out a gun and he engages them in a gunfight. And that’s when both officers get shot, and the suspect gets shot,\\" Corina said.      It was not known how many shots were fired during the close-range gun battle, which took place in what Corina described as a \\"nicer area\\" of Whittier.      Once other officers arrived on scene, the shooter was taken into custody. He was driving a stolen car and was a known gang member from Los Angeles with an extensive rap sheet, Corina said.      Authorities have identified the 26-year-old Hispanic suspect, but have not named him yet.      He was released from custody about a week before Monday's shooting and was on parole, Corina said, calling it an \\"early release.\\" It's not yet known why he was released or what charge he had been serving time for.      The car had been stolen out of East Los Angeles, where the suspect may have been involved in another killing earlier Monday morning, Corina said.      \\"Unbeknownst to the Whittier police officers, when they went to pull the car over, they had a murder suspect ... in a stolen car,\\" Corina said.      Witnesses have identified the suspect as being responsible for that other killing, which was also a shooting, Corina said. The lieutenant did not provide many details about the earlier killing, but said investigators had been told the victim was a male relative of the suspect.      The family of the victim said the suspect was the man's cousin.      The man's killing occurred about 5:30 a.m. in the 1400 block of Volney Drive, the Sheriff's Department said later Monday in a brief news release.      Shortly after the police shooting, aerial video from Sky5 showed a Whittier police SUV with shattered rear and passenger windows. A sedan directly in front of the SUV had front-end damage, and a firearm was visible on top of its trunk.      Corina said it appeared the suspect had been armed with a semi-automatic handgun.      “It’s extremely tragic,\\" Corina said. \\"You’ve got a couple officers who just responded to a traffic accident, and they think they’re there to help out people involved in a traffic accident. Next thing they know, they got this guy shooting at them. He shoots both of them and kills one of them.”      After identifying Boyer as the victim, Piper said he'd seen an increase in violence against officers during arrests. He referred to ballot-box propositions that he said were increasing crime.      \\"Everybody needs to know what these officers are dealing with on a daily basis,\\" Piper said. \\"You have no idea how it's changed in that last four years. ... People don't want to follow rules. People don't care about other people. ... This is a senseless, senseless tragedy that did not need to be.\\"      Sheriff Jim McDonnell spoke alongside Piper, also remarking on early release and rehabilitation programs.      \\"We're putting people back on the street that aren't ready to be back on the street,\\" McDonnell said.      Speaking at a news conference shortly before 2 p.m., Corina told reporters the injured officer was in stable condition. The suspect, he added, was in the intensive care unit; video from the scene showed him conscious and handcuffed. while being placed into an ambulance.      In the afternoon, hundreds of law enforcement officers accompanied the Boyer's body in a procession from UC Irvine Medical Center to the Orange County coroner’s office. After a van holding the officer’s remains arrived at its destination, fellow officers lined up and saluted the flag-draped casket as it was wheeled inside.

Corina said the two Whittier officers responded to the scene. They ordered the suspect out of the car.      Corina said officers went to check the suspect for a weapon because they could see he had tattoos over his face and neck and had \\"gang attire.\\"      \\"As they went to pat him down for any weapons, that's when he pulled out his gun and that's when he started shooting,\\" Corina said.

Corina said the officers, who were wearing protective vests, didn't know the car was stolen or that the driver may have been involved in criminal activity.      Authorities said the suspect was released on parole about a week ago. Officials did not reveal details on his conviction or his parole.      \\"I won't speak about the suspect, because frankly I don't think he's worth speaking about,\\" Whittier police Chief Jeff Piper said.

Aristotle (; , , \\"Aristotélēs\\"; 384–322 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects – including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government – and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC.  Teaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies. He established a library in the Lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books, which were written on papyrus scrolls. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of Platonism, but, following Plato's death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism. He believed all peoples' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception. Aristotle's views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works. 1.

Often, the first single of an album is one that the artist, producer, or recording company believes has the potential to gain significant attention or success. These songs are usually part of the album from which they were released. Therefore, it is not only typical but also logical for \\"Goodbye on a Bad Day\\" to be included in the \\"Chase the Sun\\" album. Furthermore, it is common in the music industry for an album to comprise the singles that have been released out of it. It's part of the allure of an album - a compilation of an artist's latest works including the singles that might have already been popular on music charts. Moreover, these singles often serve as promotional factor for the album, increasing its commercial appeal and marketability. In this case, it seems that \\"Goodbye on a Bad Day\\" did create an impact given the fact that it reached #28 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.

The music was composed by KJ Joy and lyrics was written by Sathyan Anthikkad. In this sentence, it is clear that KJ Joy is responsible for composing the music, while Sathyan Anthikkad is responsible for writing the lyrics. The roles of the two individuals are articulated without any confusion. However, it should be noted that there is a minor grammatical error in this sentence to make it more accurate, it should say \\"...and lyrics *were* written by Sathyan Anthikkad.\\" 2. The music was written by KJ Joy and the lyrics by Sathyan Anthikkad composed. In this sentence, it appears that KJ Joy is given credit for writing the music, which could potentially imply that they are responsible for both the composition and the lyrics because \\"writing\\" is often associated with lyrics in popular music. Moreover, the latter part of the sentence \\"... the lyrics by Sathyan Anthikkad composed\\" is not only grammatically incorrect but it also creates confusion as to who performed which role. To accurately convey the same meaning as in the first sentence, it should be restructured as follows: \\"The music was composed by KJ Joy, and the lyrics were written by Sathyan Anthikkad.\\" This corrected sentence provides a clear understanding that KJ Joy is the composer, while Sathyan Anthikkad is the lyricist.

Article: Protect both your hardware and yourself by taking care of any electrical components. Shut off your computer first, then unplug the keyboard from it. If you're using a wireless keyboard, remove the batteries.  Unplug the power cord if you're working on a laptop. Touch a key to make sure the computer is completely off. If you have a non-USB keyboard, always turn off the computer before unplugging the keyboard. The keys on most modern keyboards fit over small clips and are easy to remove. Wedge a flathead screwdriver or butter knife underneath the corner of a key and lightly pry it up. Then, try to pull the key straight up with your fingers. You may need to wiggle it or pry up the opposite side to slide it off its clip.  Take a quick picture of the keyboard with your phone before pulling off the keys. It will help you put the keys back in the correct order later. For an easy way to remove keys, get a wire keycap puller. Find one online or at an electronics store. If you're unsure about removing keys, consult your owner's manual or call the manufacturer. Find out their recommendations for key removal and cleaning. Flip the keyboard over and look for screws. Some keyboards consist of faceplates bound together. If the keyboard has screws, remove the bottom faceplate to wash it separately. Check for hidden screws underneath the keyboard's labels. If you can't remove the keys, you usually can remove the faceplate. Take the keys off afterward, if possible, to give the faceplate a more thorough cleaning. Set out a towel next to the sink. Run warm water from the faucet as you gather the keys into a colander. Then, hold the colander underneath running water, swirling the keys around by hand to rinse them. With a colander, most water and debris rinses off right away. When you're done, set the keys on a towel to finish drying. If rinsing isn't enough to clean the keys, try using a liquid dish soap. Fill a bowl with warm water, then mix in 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of dish soap to create soapy water. Denture tablets are also very effective and can be used in place of soap. Move the faceplate into a colander or bowl. Try rinsing it out with warm water. Clear out stubborn debris with soapy water and a microfiber cloth. When you're done, set the faceplate aside to dry. If your keyboard is very grimy, soak the faceplate and keys in soapy water for up to 6 hours. Scrub and rinse off everything when you're done. Dampen a clean, lint-free cloth with isopropyl alcohol. Scrub the remaining faceplate to clear out as much debris as possible. Go around the stems that normally hold the keys in place. Make sure the cloth isn't dripping or else some of the moisture may reach the electronic components. Use an electronics cleaning brush from a general store to help remove tough debris. Finish cleaning out the keyboard by wiping away the remaining debris. The key stems are the little towers or clips perched on top of the keyboard. Wipe around the stems to remove debris on the faceplate. Then, dampen a cotton swab with a drop of cleaning solution to wipe off the top of each stem.  Change out the cotton swabs as they get dirty to avoid leaving any debris behind. Isopropyl alcohol dries quickly, so it's safer to use than water. Avoid using a lot of it. Dampen each swab lightly. Find a place on your countertop to put the computer parts. Lay out some towels, then arrange the components over them. Keep the parts exposed to fresh air to dry them out. Make sure the computer parts are in a secure spot so they don't fall on the floor or get lost. Keep them inaccessible to children or pets so they dry out fully. Reassemble the keyboard by reversing the steps you took when taking it apart. For most keyboards, you will need to connect the faceplates first. Screw them back together, then set the keys on top of the clips or stems. Usually, all you have to do is slide the keys onto the clips to snap them in place.  If your keyboard doesn't work, take it apart again. Make sure you assembled it properly and plugged in all of the cables. Consider calling a professional to give laptops a cleaning. A professional technician can take apart your laptop, find damaged parts, and clean electronic components safely. What is a summary?","output":"Summary: To clean a keyboard, turn off and disconnect your computer and remove the keyboard batteries if necessary. Remove the keys carefully using a screwdriver or keycap puller, and take a photo to help reassemble the keyboard later. If possible, remove the faceplate by unscrewing it. Clean the keys and faceplate using warm, soapy water or denture tablets, rinsing them thoroughly. Use isopropyl alcohol and a lint-free cloth to clean remaining debris from the keyboard's stems and faceplate. Allow all parts to dry completely in a safe area before reassembling the keyboard.

In other words, it is a generalizing statement about how we expect people to behave in society. The update provides additional contexts about the situation that might UNDERMINE or SUPPORT the generalization. An undermining context provides a situation that weakens the hypothesis. A supporting context provides a situation that strengthens the generalization.

Update: You just recently broke up. A:","output":"Part #1: Understand the hypothesis sentence Usage: The hypothesis sentence is \\"It's rude to date your ex's best friend.\\" This generalizes that in society, it is unacceptable or inappropriate to date the best friend of your former romantic partner. In this example, it sets the standard that, in most cases, dating your ex's best friend is seen as rude behavior. Part #2: Analyze the update Usage: The update is \\"You just recently broke up.\\" This information is a specific circumstance to consider when evaluating the hypothesis. In this case, the fact that the breakup was recent suggests that it would be highly inappropriate to date the ex's best friend, as feelings might still be fresh and it could cause emotional distress to the parties involved. Part #3: Determine if the update supports or undermines the hypothesis Usage: The update acts as a 'weakener' or 'strengthener.' In this example, because the recent breakup makes dating the ex's best friend even more inappropriate, the update functions as a 'strengthener' for the hypothesis. This is because it provides a situation where dating the best friend right after a breakup supports the generalization that it's rude to date your ex's best friend."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Will you watch the football live, and DVR the debate? Or, will you watch the debate live—and DVR the football? I’m just kidding: only lunatics and serial killers DVR football. But if you DVR the debate, do you watch it right after the football, or do you save it for later? Do you let your no-good football pals stay at the house to watch both? Another important question: can you eat wings during a debate? A more important question: does that mean you’re eating wings twice that night? This was inevitable, wasn’t it? In this historically madcap election season, it is only fitting that the presidential race would collide with America’s other overbaked news-hogging national spectacle: football. Two of the three scheduled debates between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will clash in prime time against the NFL—one debate versus an Atlanta vs. New Orleans Monday Night Football game, and another faces off with a Sunday evening Green Bay vs. New York Football Giants contest. Trump, in particular, is crabby about the conflict, saying he got a letter from the NFL calling the conflict “ridiculous.” (The NFL says it never sent Trump a letter on the matter.) If you’re a space alien watching this American election season from a faraway planet, you’re probably a little confused. How is this even a controversy? How could anyone possibly prioritize football over a presidential debate? To which I say: Allow me to introduce you to America. People in this country reschedule their own weddings in response to the NFL schedule. They induce labor to avoid a showdown with the Super Bowl. On Thanksgiving they actually sit down with people they love and try to watch the Detroit Lions. Football is our true national mania, our only shared religion, other than being rotten to each other on Twitter. TWTR 7.25 % I’m not going to tell you how to decide here. You know what’s more important to your life: Who is going to lead the free world for the next four years, or the Falcons in Week Three. But amid the clamor, I think we’re all missing a brilliant compromise: Hold the presidential debates during the games. Combine football—and politics —into the must-see television event of our lifetimes. Here’s how it can be done: 1. When they’re not playing football, go to Donald and Hillary. Everybody knows there’s a lot of down time in professional football games. A looottt of down time. Fun fact about football: It’s mostly people standing around. Perhaps the best-known story ever produced by the Journal’s sports department calculated that, on average, there is just 11 minutes of action in your standard three-hour NFL game. Eleven minutes! In terms of pace, an NFL game makes curling look hectic. All that downtime is a golden opportunity for the people at the RNC and DNC. Put Trump and Clinton on personalized football carts in opposite end zones, and every time there’s a break in the action, drive the candidates to midfield and go right into the debate. Two minutes of domestic or foreign policy: Go! As soon as the football is ready to return, and the whistle blows, motor Trump and Clinton right off the field. Or, if you want to make it really exciting, leave them both on the field. 2. Take advantage of awful instant replay delays. There’s no more agonizing moment in a football telecast than when the action stops and the officials order coffee and finger sandwiches and spend 18 minutes trying to sort out a mundane out-of-bounds play. This is another huge chance to bring out Trump and Clinton, and get their positions on the Supreme Court, health care, and military action abroad. If the moderator runs out of topics, simply go to Trump’s and Clinton’s thoughts on the ruling on the field, and whether it should or shouldn’t stand. You may think it’s ridiculous that an election could be decided on determining whether the Packers completed a pass, but elections have been decided over more trivial matters. 3. Bag the halftime show. Everybody knows that unless they employ Charles Barkley, halftime shows are completely the pits, so surrendering those 10 or so minutes to the debate would not be a great loss. Bring on Clinton and Trump to talk about the issues. Give them bonus points if they can deliver useless NFL gossip. Imagine a candidate carrying Ohio because they broke a Bengals quarterback change! You might think this is an obnoxious proposal, one that doesn’t confer enough respect on the seriousness of a presidential race. To which I say: I think this proposal confers exactly the right amount of respect upon this presidential race. Besides, the ratings would be huge. Huge! Don’t act above it all. Don’t act like you wouldn’t watch. Politicians come and go, but football is football.

We walked in just after noon and found only 2 other tables in the entire place to be occupied. Then when we got seated, we had a super weird start where we basically got juggled around with 3 separate waiters/waitresses coming up to our table. Luckily, it was smooth sailing after that and I was extremely surprised with Biscuits Cafu00e9.  The restaurant itself is located on the SE corner of Sahara & Durango. Inside, they've got a really big, spacious dining room and they seem to be doing a great job of keeping it clean and organized. Instead of getting too into detail on what it looks like, I'll shamelessly plug my first opportunity to try out the Yelp video function. ;) *Although you might have to go to the business photos on the mobile app to find it*  As far as the food goes, they have a fairly large menu with choices for both breakfast and lunch. I ended up going with the Zesty Chorizo omelette and was really impressed. The chorizo was cooked perfectly, had great flavor and just the right amount of spicy heat. All the other ingredients were fresh and aside from tasting great, the portions are huge. They literally put what looked to be an entire avocado inside the omelette and it's served with a side of your choice, and biscuits. The salsa appeared to be fresh made and was easily one of the best I've had in a breakfast joint. My only complaint on my plate would be the potatoes. They were cooked well and also served as a huge portion, but they were lacking in salt. If I were to order this omelette again though, I'd ask for extra cheese.   Now, with a name like Biscuits Cafu00e9...they better have some good biscuits! Were they the best I've ever had? Probably not. But they are solid and in my opinion, far superior to what you'll find in most other restaurants in town. Buttery, flaky and served with both fresh butter and jam. You can tell they are fresh made every day and even though I'm not usually one to get biscuits for breakfast, I'd make sure to get one every time I'm here. Biscuits and gravy fans will love the version here.  Aside from the weird start, the customer service is great too. I could be wrong, but it looks like a family run joint and even if they aren't, you can tell they put a lot of love into their food. As others have mentioned, it's only a matter of time before this place starts getting busy and you're waiting for a table. It may have started off bad and a dead restaurant at peak times, is almost always a red flag...but Biscuits Cafu00e9 is serving up huge portions of killer food at great prices, and I'll happily be a repeat customer! What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is mostly positive. Although the reviewer experienced a few initial issues, such as a lack of customers and a confusing start with multiple wait staff, they were ultimately impressed by the cleanliness and organization of the restaurant. They also praised the large, fresh portions of food and the quality of the biscuits. The customer service is described as great, and the reviewer expresses their intention to become a repeat customer.

Background: A disc jockey, often abbreviated as DJ, is a person who plays existing recorded music for a live audience. Most common types of DJs include radio DJ, club DJ who performs at a nightclub or music festival, and turntablist who uses record players, usually turntables, to manipulate sounds on phonograph records. Originally, the \\"disc\\" in \\"disc jockey\\" referred to gramophone records, but now \\"DJ\\" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any source, including cassettes, CDs, or digital audio files on a CDJ or laptop. The title \\"DJ\\" is commonly used by DJs in front of their real names or adopted pseudonyms or stage names. Context: Several techniques are used by DJs as a means to better mix and blend recorded music. These techniques primarily include the cueing, equalization and audio mixing of two or more sound sources. The complexity and frequency of special techniques depends largely on the setting in which a DJ is working. Radio DJs are less likely to focus on advanced music-mixing procedures than club DJs, who rely on a smooth transition between songs using a range of techniques. However, some radio DJs are experienced club DJs, so they use the same sophisticated mixing techniques.  Club DJ turntable techniques include beatmatching, phrasing and slip-cueing to preserve energy on a dance floor. Turntablism embodies the art of cutting, beat juggling, scratching, needle drops, phase shifting, back spinning and more to perform the transitions and overdubs of samples in a more creative manner (although turntablism is often considered a use of the turntable as a musical instrument rather than a tool for blending recorded music). Professional DJs may use harmonic mixing to choose songs that are in compatible musical keys.  Recent advances in technology in both DJ hardware and software can provide assisted or automatic completion of some traditional DJ techniques and skills. Examples include phrasing and beatmatching, which can be partially or completely automated by utilizing DJ software that performs automatic synchronization of sound recordings, a feature commonly labelled \\"sync\\". Most DJ mixers now include a beat-counter which analyzes the tempo of an incoming sound source and displays its tempo in beats per minute (BPM), which may assist with beatmatching analog sound sources.  In the past, being a DJ has largely been a self-taught craft but with the complexities of new technologies and the convergence with music production methods, there are a growing number of schools and organizations that offer instruction on the techniques. Question: What are the DJ Techniques talked about in the article?. Whats the answer?","output":"The DJ techniques mentioned in the article are: 1. Cueing: This is when DJs listen to the next song they want to play in their headphones before mixing it into the current playing music. This helps them to know when to start the next song for a smooth transition. 2. Equalization: DJs adjust the levels of different frequencies (like bass, mid, or treble) in the music to make it sound better or to blend it smoothly with another track. 3. Audio Mixing: This is when DJs blend two or more sound sources (songs) together to create a seamless flow of music. 4. Beatmatching: DJs match the beats or tempo of two songs to create a smooth transition between them. This keeps the music flowing and dancers dancing. 5. Phrasing: DJs make sure that two songs are not just matched in beats but also in their structure or phrases, so that the mix sounds good and seamless. 6. Slip-cueing: This technique helps DJs to start a song at the right moment, so it sounds in sync with the current playing song. 7. Turntablism: Some DJs use techniques like cutting, beat juggling, scratching, needle drops, and back spinning to create unique sounds and transitions between songs. This is more like using the turntables as a musical instrument. 8. Harmonic Mixing: DJs choose songs that are in compatible musical keys, so they sound good together when mixed. With the help of new technology, some of these techniques can be automated, like beatmatching and phrasing, making it easier for DJs to mix music smoothly."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

However, this premise does not provide information on why there is no slogan. Therefore, it does not directly or necessarily entail the given hypothesis, \\"Their slogan, \\"why not now?\\" Was deemed to be inflammatory and dropped from the ads.\\" The absence of a slogan could be due to various reasons, not just because it was inflammatory. The slogan could have been removed because it was not effective, because the company wants to update its image, there could have been copyright issues with this specific slogan, or it might be part of a new brand strategy to not use slogans, among many other possible reasons.  Therefore, it is not direct or inherent from the premise that the absence of the slogan is specific to it being deemed inflammatory and being dropped from the ads.

Tweet: What is it about mall shopping that makes my feet kill?   Choose your answer from: (a). negative. (b). positive.","output":"The sentiment of the tweet: \\"What is it about mall shopping that makes my feet kill?\\" can be classified as negative. For a comprehensive understanding, each part of the tweet needs to be analysed. The tweet is about a shopping experience at the mall. Typically, shopping might be seen as a positive activity, as it usually involves buying things that one needs or wants, and spending time in a mall can be a form of leisure activity or entertainment. But in this case, the user talks about his/her feet hurting - \\"makes my feet kill\\", which clearly implies discomfort or pain. Use of the word \\"kill\\" in the context of pain or discomfort is exaggerated language, typically used to express strong negative feelings.  Therefore, when analysing sentiment, we need to focus on the overall emotional tone behind the words. The phrase \\"makes my feet kill\\" expresses discomfort and dissatisfaction with the experience of mall shopping. Even though mall shopping might be a positive activity in some contexts, it isn't in this specific tweet due to the pain it seems to cause the person, which overshadows the potential benefits or enjoyment of the shopping experience. Hence, based on the analysis of the tone, context and language used in this statement, the sentiment of the tweet is negative. So, option (a). negative, is the correct choice.  It's important to remember that sentiment analysis, especially in the context of social media, involves some level of interpretation: sometimes people might be sarcastic or ironic, which can make it more challenging to correctly identify the sentiment. However, in the case of this tweet, there’s no discernable irony or sarcasm, just an expression of genuine discomfort, which means we can reasonably define this as a negative sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Rubio, Amid Planning, Is Yet to Commit on Immigration Bill Drew Angerer for The New York Times There are questions about whether Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, will ultimately sign onto the bill for a broad overhaul of immigration laws that he has been helping to draft. WASHINGTON — When Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, last appeared with a bipartisan group of senators to discuss their plans for a broad overhaul of the nation’s immigration laws, he looked optimistic, apple-cheeked — and slightly nervous. Given the disdain some conservatives reserve for Republicans who consort publicly with Democrats, he had reason to be. The next time Mr. Rubio is likely to appear with his colleagues in the eight-person bipartisan group could be an even bigger moment, when its members officially introduce joint immigration legislation this month. The probable tableau seems ready-made for problems in the 2016 Republican presidential primary fight in which many expect Mr. Rubio to partake: images of Mr. Rubio, smiling and celebrating alongside Democratic senators and maverick Republicans as he claims co-authorship of an overhaul of the nation’s immigration laws that many Republicans will reject. And so the question percolating on Capitol Hill has become: Will Mr. Rubio, an up-and-coming young conservative elected on a 2010 Tea Party wave, ultimately sign onto the immigration bill that he has been helping to draft ever since the November election? “We have to see if the Boy Wonder plays ball or not,” said Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, a pro-immigration group. For now, the answer — among members of the bipartisan group, immigration watchers and even Mr. Rubio’s own staff — is a tentative yes, even with Mr. Rubio increasingly urging caution about racing ahead with any immigration measure as the unveiling draws nigh. “We understand Marco is not going to be rushed into anything,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a member of the group. “But we don’t doubt his commitment to seeing this through at all.” In recent days, Mr. Rubio has begun to sound nervous again when it comes to the immigration legislation. He sent a letter to Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, counseling against “excessive haste” in changing immigration law. On Sunday, just moments before two of his fellow bipartisan group members were set to appear on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” he released a statement that warned, “No final agreement on immigration legislation yet.” Mr. Rubio finds himself in an extremely delicate position as a rising conservative hero and a proponent of immigration law changes. As much as the fate of the bipartisan group’s legislation hangs on Mr. Rubio, who is perhaps the only member of the group with the conservative credentials to sell the plan to skeptical voters, the fate of Mr. Rubio’s ambitions for higher office are also inextricably bound up with the immigration legislation and his base’s reaction to it. So far, Mr. Rubio has seen early success wooing grass-roots Republican voters. When he joined the bipartisan group late last year, after Mitt Romney lost the presidential election in part because he was overwhelmingly rejected by Hispanic voters, Mr. Rubio quickly went on a one-man blitz of conservative news media outlets, explaining his guiding immigration principles and winning plaudits from the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. “The argument is that it’s not conservative policy to have 11 million illegal immigrants in this country,” said Phil Musser, a Republican consultant and former executive director of the Republican Governors Association. “By showing up and by boldly deciding to engage people who have had their fingers in their ears on this issue, he’s been able to decalcify a process that’s been stuck for a long time.” He and his staff have studied the mistakes of the last attempt at immigration overhaul, in 2007, and have tailored their pitch to address conservative concerns. Mr. Rubio stresses that strict goals for border security must be met before any illegal immigrants can be put on a path to citizenship. And he talks of refining the current system — from increased enforcement to a workable plan for future legal immigrants — saying he wants to ensure the country does not face another wave of illegal immigrants down the road. “His emphasis on strong border security and enforcement is a big deal, and I think the Democrats are finally beginning to get that, and I think that is because of his strong leadership and communication skills,” said Mel Martinez, a former Republican senator from Florida who was part of the failed 2007 attempt at an immigration overhaul. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The news article highlights the uncertainty surrounding Senator Marco Rubio's commitment to a bipartisan bill for a broad overhaul of the U.S. immigration laws. Rubio, a Republican of Florida, has been helping draft the legislation since the November election. However, his decision to sign onto the bill may affect his conservative base and future political ambitions. As a rising conservative hero, Rubio is in a delicate position as both a proponent of immigration law changes and someone with higher political aspirations. His support for the immigration bill is crucial for its success, as he is capable of selling the plan to skeptical conservative voters. However, the fate of his ambitions for higher office is also intertwined with the bill and the base's reaction to it. Rubio has been advocating caution in the approach to the immigration measure, seeking strict goals for border security before allowing illegal immigrants a pathway to citizenship. He has also focused on refining the existing system to prevent future waves of illegal immigrants. The news article raises questions about whether Rubio will ultimately sign onto the immigration bill he has been helping to draft, with key stakeholders and his staff believing he will, albeit tentatively."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how deep can be drill for deep underwater Suggested answer: The riser allows for drilling fluids to move between the floor and the rig.

There are a few basic options when it comes to buying potatoes: baking, boiling, and all-purpose potatoes. All have different qualities when it comes to flavor and texture. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Potatoes cannot be boiled.","output":"No, the given sentence \\"Potatoes cannot be boiled\\" does not follow, given the preceding text. Instead, you should continue with steps on making simple mashed potatoes. Here's a detailed guide: 1. Choose your potatoes: As mentioned earlier, there are different types of potatoes, such as baking, boiling, and all-purpose potatoes. For making mashed potatoes, Yukon Gold, Russet, and all-purpose potatoes are ideal due to their high starch content and the ability to hold their consistency when mashed. 2. Wash and peel the potatoes: First, rinse the potatoes under cold running water to remove any dirt or debris. Then, using a vegetable peeler or a small paring knife, remove the skin from the potatoes. Rinse them again to remove any residual dirt. 3. Cut the potatoes: Cut the peeled potatoes into uniform, 1-inch cubes or chunks. This helps ensure that they cook evenly and at the same time. 4. Boil the potatoes: Fill a large pot with cold water approximately 2 inches above the potatoes. Adding a pinch of salt to the water is optional. Place the pot on high heat and bring the water to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low or low, maintaining a gentle simmer. Cook the potatoes for roughly 15-20 minutes, or until they are tender enough to be pierced easily with a fork. 5. Drain the potatoes: Using a colander, drain the potatoes and let them sit for a minute or two, allowing any excess water to evaporate. 6. Heat the butter and milk/cream: While the potatoes are boiling, heat about 1/4 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of milk or cream in a small saucepan over low heat. Once the butter has melted and the mixture is warm, set it aside. 7. Mash the potatoes: Use a potato masher, potato ricer, or a fork to mash the potatoes in a large mixing bowl until they reach the desired consistency. Avoid using a food processor, blender, or electric mixer, as they can cause the potatoes to become gummy or soupy. 8. Mix in the butter and milk/cream: While mashing the potatoes, slowly add in the warm butter and milk/cream mixture. Keep mashing until the potatoes are smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. 9. Serve and enjoy: Transfer the mashed potatoes to a serving dish and serve immediately. You can also add additional toppings such as chopped chives, grated cheese, or cooked bacon bits for extra flavor. Following these steps will result in a delicious, simple, and straightforward mashed potato dish, while also correcting the erroneous statement about boiling potatoes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: That's kind of what Mencap gave disabled voters, their families and carers the chance to do in a hustings with a difference in County Tyrone on Thursday. Rather than pitching questions to a panel of prospective politicians, the disability support charity called on constituents to chat to candidates over a cup of coffee. Seven election hopefuls put their points forward, with a bell ringing after 10 minutes to signal that it was time to switch to the next table for another conversation in a speed-date-style. Mencap's Barry McMenamin said the cafe-style chats gave people the chance to raise their issues directly with those hoping to win their vote. \\"Candidates go around the tables - the people with learning disabilities and their families are sitting at the tables,\\" he explained. \\"They are looking the candidates in the whites of their eyes and asking them: 'When you get to Stormont, what are you going to do for us?'\\" Health issues were high on the agenda, along with knocking down barriers to employment, and enabling easier transport to appointments and to work. Most families pointed out that the Western Health and Social Care Trust was \\"at the bottom of the barrel\\" when it came to disability funding, with the uncovering of a multi-million black hole in cash for support services. Bob Henry, who has two adult sons with disabilities, said they had \\"nobody to lobby for them\\". \\"What I see here in this area, people with a mental or learning disabilities are on the bottom rung of the ladder,\\" he added. \\"They don't get away from the bottom rung, because they're an easy target because they have no comeback, nobody to speak for them, nobody to lobby for them.\\" Joanne McDonald, who has a learning disability and works as an equality officer for Mencap in Omagh, said disabled people \\"need our voices heard\\". \\"Bear in mind that people with a learning disability do need access to the same services as everybody else,\\" she said. \\"But maybe we might need the right services in place that meet the needs of people with a learning disability, and don't forget about us.\\" \\"Listen to young people, because they are the future.\\" That was the message directed at politicians at the Upper Springfield mock assembly poll in west Belfast on Thursday night. About 60 children and teenagers from youth clubs in the area gathered at Whiterock Leisure Centre to speak to election candidates, before casting their votes for their favourites. Michael McAllister, a youth worker at the Upper Springfield Development Trust, said the event was organised because next week's election \\"is going to affect them\\", even though most won't be able to take part in it. \\"It's about politicians coming down to young people's level, and young people having their say,\\" he added. First up, the candidates made their opening pitches with their parties' priorities, but those lacked entertainment value for much of the audience, with some \\"near falling asleep in their seats\\", as Michael explained. But that soon changed, when the election hopefuls spoke to the young people in small groups to take questions on the issues important to them. And no topic was off limits, with children as young as 10 asking about Brexit and the Irish language, while others pushed for answers on LGBT rights and abortion reform. Seventeen-year-old Leah won't get to mark a real ballot paper on 2 March, but she said young people \\"need to get involved more\\" in politics. \\"In the future, they're going to be the people to make the world go around, so why not have their opinion when their young?\\" she asked. And her friend Chloe, who'll also miss out on a vote, urged those who don't intend to exercise their democratic right to think again. \\"Have a real good think about who you would love to vote for, and honestly, just go for it, give your point.\\" Watching on was Koulla Yiasouma, the Northern Ireland commissioner for children and young people, who said that just because younger people can't vote \\"doesn't mean they don't have a voice\\". \\"We have nearly 500,000 young people living in Northern Ireland - what happens in Stormont affects them very intimately, so it's absolutely right that they engage with the politicians,\\" she said. \\"These kids will remember what happened today, and when it is their turn to vote they will have built up those skills to take part in the democratic process.\\" And Michael said the candidates should leave the mock election with plenty on their minds. \\"Young people want to develop themselves, develop their area, they want to improve for the better,\\" he said. \\"But are they being left behind? That's the question the politicians need to ask themselves.\\" BBC News NI's Campaign Catch-up will keep you across the Northern Ireland Assembly election trail with a daily dose of the main stories, the minor ones and the lighter moments in the run up to polling day on Thursday 2 March.

Q: Greg Tenorly drove the familiar route from the church to his music studio, studying the homes along the way. He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling. His little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side. At least the soundproofing he had installed kept his neighbors from hearing his students. You can't teach music without hearing both beautiful sounds and sour notes.

Chinese art market ranked as world's fastest-growing in past 5 years.","output":"Title: Christie's Becomes First International Fine Art Auction House to Operate in Mainland China Introduction: Christie's, the prestigious London-based fine art auction house, recently made history by becoming the first international establishment of its kind to receive a license to operate independently in mainland China. This represents not only a remarkable opportunity for the company, but also highlights the tremendous growth potential of the Chinese art market. Breaking Barriers: For decades, the Chinese art market has been dominated by domestic auction houses. However, the granting of the license to Christie's signals a significant shift in the landscape, opening doors for international auction houses to tap into this emerging market segment. Christie's, founded in 1766 and known for auctioning some of the most famous and valuable pieces of art, now has a unique position in mainland China, with the opportunity to shape the future of the art market in the region. The Rise of the Chinese Art Market: The Chinese art market has been making considerable strides over the past few years. It is no coincidence that the country is now home to the world's fastest-growing art market, with some of the most affluent Chinese collectors driving up prices and fueling demand for rare and valuable artwork. A key reason behind the rapid growth of the market is the increase in disposable income and a growing middle class in China. As personal wealth has grown, so has the appetite for fine art as a form of investment, status symbol, and cultural preservation. The Chinese art market has expanded beyond traditional artwork to include modern and contemporary pieces by both domestic and international artists, attracting significant interest from wealthy Chinese millennials who are eager to engage with the global art scene. Christie's Expansion into China: With the receipt of this license, Christie's is well-positioned to seize a share of this lucrative market. Operating independently in the Chinese market will enable the auction house to maintain full control over its operations and adapt to the unique demands and preferences of Chinese collectors. The company is expected to expand its range of offerings and implement tailored marketing strategies targeting local art aficionados. This will likely involve focusing on high-quality Chinese art and antiques, contemporary art from China, and introducing works from abroad that cater to the tastes of the highly discerning Chinese collectors. As more international auction houses are also expected to enter the Chinese market in the future, it will be interesting to see how the competition between local and international players unfolds. Moreover, local auction houses will need to step up their game to compete with their international counterparts, which could potentially lead to more exciting developments and advancements in the local art scene. Conclusion: The granting of the license to operate independently in mainland China to Christie's marks a significant milestone in the world of fine art. It is a testament to the growth and importance of the Chinese art market, and the recognition by international players of its unlimited potential. This development will likely have wide-reaching implications for the global art market and further cement China's position as a major player in the international art scene, attracting even more attention from collectors, investors, and aficionados from around the world. As the first international fine art auction house to embark on this exciting journey, Christie's has the responsibility to set the bar high and establish a new benchmark in the Chinese and global art market."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Broncos' defense limited Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady to 188 yards passing and no touchdowns, but their defensive effort was wasted by a poor performance from their inconsistent offense. The Broncos' only scoring play was a 33-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus. In the first quarter, a fumbled punt by Jordan Norwood led to a 45-yard field goal by Patriots' placekicker Stephen Gostkowski. An interception off Broncos' quarterback Trevor Siemian by cornerback Logan Ryan resulted in the only touchdown of the game&#8212;a 1-yard run by Patriots' running back LeGarrette Blount in the second quarter.

Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: In the 1500s, South American fishermen said that the sea became warmer every few years. They gave this special event a Spanish name 'El Nino', meaning 'the baby'. It is called 'the baby' because it arrives around Christmas. El Nino is a huge area of warm water in the middle of cold water in the Pacific Ocean. It happens every two to seven years. It moves around the ocean and becomes bigger and smaller at different times. This warm water affects the weather. It is always raining over El Nino. El Nino contains a lot of energy. Scientists think this energy is formed when wind comes from the northern half of the world. The winds blow across warm sea water in the south. When the strong wind hits the warm water, violent weather happens. Scientists think that El Nino existed for many thousands of years. El Nino affects every person in the world because it affects the entire world's weather. It can bring the rain that farmers need. It can bring storms that destroy homes. It can mean that fishermen cannot catch fish, and it can bring floods. There is nothing we can do about El Nino. It is an event of nature. We can help the world's weather by trying to stop the greenhouse effect and air pollution. The most important job for scientists is to learn how to predict when El Nino is going to bring dangerous weather. Then, people can try to prepare for storms, floods and droughts. New technology like satellite pictures and temperature measuring equipment can help. Still, it is very hard to say when or where El Nino will cause damage.

If we find a bird nest, we will have a good place of observing   and knowing about birds. Birds sit on eggs and take care of their baby birds from April to June. Because the baby birds are too young to leave the nest, mothers often leave and come back to the nest during the time to look for food. So it is good to observe birds. When we observe birds, we'd better hide ourselves in a close place to the nest, and it's better to use binoculars . But how to make a bird nest? It's very easy.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Between banks and venture capital, some start-ups look to a pay-as-you-go model “We get five times the orders coming in, and our cash flow is low because we’re coming off our lowest selling point, which is winter,” owner Laura Howard-Gayeton said. “Last year, we realized we really needed a line of credit to draw on.” To fill the need, Laloo’s turned to Lighter Capital, a firm that provides a type of start-up funding known as revenue-based financing. The arrangement falls somewhere between traditional bank loans and venture capital: A firm invests a few hundred-thousand or million dollars into a start-up, and the start-up pays it back from its monthly earnings rather than through an IPO or exit. Howard-Gayeton said that her bank viewed Laloo’s as too much of a risk and that she didn’t have time to wait for a Small Business Administration loan to process. “While it’s not the cheapest money we could ever borrow,” she said, “for us, Lighter Capital was the most nimble, pain-free experience.” Lighter is one of about a hundred groups in the recently formed Revenue Capital Association. These firms tend to invest in businesses that venture capitalists and angels pass up, and that don’t qualify for — or don’t want — a bank loan. Jeff Schrock, the managing director of Seattle’s Union Bay Capital and a board member of the association, said the difference between his organization and a venture capital firm is, roughly, that the latter invests in a company or team, while a revenue-based firm invests in a product. “If you have a great product that has attractive unit-level economics, it works,” he said. “We are trying to grow businesses that are overlooked by capital markets — the hundreds of other gazelles in the herd that are fantastic businesses. There are a lot more of those than there are Googles and LinkedIns.” Gavino Morin, a founder of Hellfire Games in Austin, got a green light from Sony in 2010 to develop a new game and needed a fast, large influx of cash to hire programmers. He was hesitant to pursue a bank loan with fixed payments, however, because video game revenue can fluctuate. Instead, he went with Next Step Capital Partners, an Austin revenue-based financing firm. Like other entrepreneurs, Morin was attracted to the system because a revenue-based firm wouldn’t ask him to give away shares of his company. “This way, we don’t give up equity in the company,” he said, “and when it’s based on revenue, you build a lot more flexibility into your payment system.” In general, businesses backed by the arrangement pay a pre-determined percentage of their revenue — 3 to 5 percent, for example — to the investor until the entire principal is repaid, plus a return. The returns vary but are almost always higher than those of a typical bank loan: Lighter Capital, which makes investments of 100 to 250,000, said its return is usually 18 to 20 percent, but Schrock said he has seen returns of up to four times the original investment. Summary:","output":"Start-ups are increasingly turning to revenue-based financing as an alternative to traditional bank loans and venture capital. Firms such as Lighter Capital provide funding to start-ups, which is then repaid from the start-up's monthly earnings rather than through an initial public offering or exit. While returns on these types of arrangements can be higher than those of a typical bank loan, entrepreneurs are attracted to them because they do not involve giving up equity in the business. This model targets businesses that are often overlooked by venture capitalists or do not qualify for a bank loan, and has led to the formation of organizations such as the Revenue Capital Association, comprising around 100 groups."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Who is the writer that was healed by a tohunga? , can you please find it?   White Lies is a story about the nature of identity: those who deny it and those who strive to protect it. Paraiti is a medicine woman. She is the healer and midwife of her rural, tribal people - she believes in life. But new laws are in force prohibiting unlicensed healers. On a rare trip to the city, she is approached by Maraea, the servant of a wealthy woman, Rebecca, who seeks her knowledge and assistance in order to hide a secret which could destroy Rebecca's position in European settler society. If the secret is uncovered a life may be lost, but hiding it may also have fatal consequences. So Paraiti, Maraea and Rebecca become players in a head on clash of beliefs, deception and ultimate salvation.In the Extras of the DVD, Witi Ihimaera, tells how his mother took him to Paraiti, a tohunga/healer who cured him of a breathing problem. In writing the story, he wanted to honour the various tohunga in Maori life.   In 1907, the New Zealand government brought in  The Tohunga Suppression Act, thus outlawing natural healing for Maori. Some people believe the author of the book drew on the life of Anglo-Indian actress Merle Oberon, and the hiding of her true ethnic origin. Answer:","output":"The writer who was healed by a tohunga is Witi Ihimaera.

Where the jail that held Solomon Northup once stood, a state-of-the-art baseball stadium may soon rise. That's if the mayor of Richmond, Va., has his way.      But descendants of Northup -- whose astounding story served as the basis for the Oscar-winning film 12 Years a Slave -- are among those who oppose plans to develop Shockoe Bottom, a Richmond district that prior to the Civil War served as one of the country's busiest slave-trading centers. It was there that, in 1841, Northup was taken after being drugged by two vaudeville performers, later to be transported to New Orleans.      PHOTOS: '12 Years a Slave': Portraits of Solomon Northup's Descendants      The site once held over 90 slave dealers and the infamous Lumpkin's slave jail -- also known as \\"the Devil's half-acre\\" -- that held Northup at the start of his nightmarish voyage. All that now remains is a stretch of underdeveloped asphalt lots and grasslands, a less-than-desirable construction zone due in part to its proximity to the nearby Shockoe Creek.      As proposed by Richmond's mayor, Dwight Jones, the plan seeks to revive the moribund area by erecting a 56 million park for the Richmond Flying Squirrels, the local minor league team. Another 5 million has been earmarked for the creation of an adjacent slavery museum. The nearby slave burial grounds, discovered in 2011 and designated a historical landmark by the city, will not be affected by the construction -- but dozens of slave-trading sites will be destroyed to make way for the Flying Squirrels' dream home.      STORY: '12 Years a Slave': Solomon Northup's Descendants Gather for THR Photo Shoot, Reflect on His Legacy      One vocal opponent of the project is school psychologist Linsey Williams, who takes great pride in her connection to Northup, her great-great-great-great-grandfather. (Williams was contacted by The Hollywood Reporter to take part in our historic reunion of five generations of the Northrup family tree, but was unable to attend.)      \\"Most people of African descent in North America have had ancestors who came through that area as they were being sold to slave masters in the South,\\" she tells THR. \\"I think it's insensitive in allowing it to become secondary to a ballpark.\\" Williams has launched an online petition opposing the development and plans to join an April 3 protest held at the Lumpkin's site.      Richmond historical researcher Elizabeth Kambourian fears that unknown treasures may be lost in the process. \\"An archaeological dig at the Lumpkin's jail turned up a lot of artifacts and things of interest,\\" she says. \\"They need to do more exploration down there and they need to commemorate.\\"      VIDEO: '12 Years a Slave' Director Surprises Solomon Northup's Descendants During Emotional Photo Shoot      But not everyone opposes the project.

Kambourian isn't convinced: \\"I don't feel it's what is needed down there. There's a lot of museums in Richmond already.

Its genome has been sequenced by the United States Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute. The name \\"Selaginella\\" was erected by Palisot de Beauvois solely for the species \\"Selaginella selaginoides\\", which turns out (with the closely-related \\"Selaginella deflexa\\") to be a clade that is sister to all other \\"Selaginellas\\", so any definitive subdivision of the species leaves two taxa in \\"Selaginella\\", with the hundreds of other species in new or resurrected genera.  - A fern is a member of a group of about 10,560 known extant species of vascular plants that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers. They differ from mosses by being vascular, i.e., having certain tissue that conducts water and nutrients. They have branched stems and leaves like other vascular plants. These are \\"megaphylls\\", which are more complex than the simple \\"microphylls\\" of clubmosses. Most ferns are Leptosporangiate ferns, sometimes denominated the \\"true ferns\\": they produce what are called \\"fiddleheads\\" that uncoil and expand into fronds.  - Isoetales, formerly also written Isoëtales, is an order of plants in the class Isoetopsida. There are about 140-150 living species, all of which are classified in the genus \\"Isoetes\\" (quillworts), with a cosmopolitan distribution, but often scarce to rare. Living species are mostly aquatic or semi-aquatic, and are found in clear ponds and slowly moving streams. Each leaf is slender and broadens downward to a swollen base up to 5 mm wide where the leaves attach in clusters to a bulb-like, underground corm characteristic of most quillworts. This swollen base also contains male and female sporangia, protected by a thin, transparent covering (velum), which is used diagnostically to help identify quillwort species. Quillwort species are very difficult to distinguish by general appearance. The best way to identify them is by examining the megaspores under a microscope.  - The U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (DOE JGI), located in Walnut Creek, California, was created in 1997 to unite the expertise and resources in genome mapping, DNA sequencing, technology development, and information sciences pioneered at the DOE genome centers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Today the DOE JGI staff is composed of employees from Berkeley Lab, LLNL and the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. The DOE JGI also collaborates with other national labs such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).  - The Division Lycopodiophyta (sometimes called lycophyta or lycopods) is a tracheophyte subgroup of the Kingdom Plantae. It is one of the oldest lineages of extant (living) vascular plants and contains extinct plants like \\"Baragwanathia\\" that have been dated from the Silurian (ca. 425 million years ago). These species reproduce by shedding spores and have macroscopic alternation of generations, although some are homosporous while others are heterosporous. Most members of Lycopodiophyta bear a protostele, and the sporophyte generation is dominant. They differ from all other vascular plants in having microphylls, leaves that have only a single vascular trace (vein) rather than the much more complex megaphylls found in ferns and seed plants.  - A ligule (from \\"strap\\", variant of \\"lingula\\", from \\"lingua\\" \\"tongue\\")  is a thin outgrowth at the junction of leaf and leafstalk of many grasses (Poaceae) and sedges. A ligule is also a strap-shaped extension of the corolla, such as that of a ray floret in plants in the daisy family Asteraceae.  - Ambroise Marie François Joseph Palisot, Baron de Beauvois (27 July 1752, Arras  21 January 1820, Paris) was a French naturalist.  - The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is a Cabinet-level department of the United States Government concerned with the United States' policies regarding energy and safety in handling nuclear material. Its responsibilities include the nation's nuclear weapons program, nuclear reactor production for the United States Navy, energy conservation, energy-related research, radioactive waste disposal, and domestic energy production. It also directs research in genomics; the Human Genome Project originated in a DOE initiative. DOE sponsors more research in the physical sciences than any other U.S. federal agency, the majority of which is conducted through its system of National Laboratories.  - Selaginella selaginoides is a non-flowering plant of the spikemoss genus \\"Selaginella\\" with a wide distribution around the Northern Hemisphere. It resembles a moss in appearance but is a vascular plant belonging to the division Lycopodiophyta. It has a number of common names including lesser clubmoss, club spikemoss, northern spikemoss, low spikemoss and prickly mountain-moss. This plant has one close relative, \\"Selaginella deflexa\\", native to Hawaii. These two plants form a small clade that is sister to all other \\"Selaginella\\" species.  - Vascular plants (from Latin \\"vasculum\\": duct), also known as tracheophytes (from the equivalent Greek term \\"trachea\\") and also higher plants, form a large group of plants (c. 308,312 accepted known species ) that are defined as those land plants that have lignified tissues (the xylem) for conducting water and minerals throughout the plant. They also have a specialized non-lignified tissue (the phloem) to conduct products of photosynthesis. Vascular plants include the clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, gymnosperms (including conifers) and angiosperms (flowering plants). Scientific names for the group include Tracheophyta and Tracheobionta.  - A model organism is a non-human species that is extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena, with the expectation that discoveries made in the organism model will provide insight into the workings of other organisms. Model organisms are in vivo models and are widely used to research human disease when human experimentation would be unfeasible or unethical. This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms, and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course of evolution.  - The Isoetopsida is a class of Lycopodiophyta. All extant species belong to the genus \\"Selaginella\\" in the order Selaginellales or to the genus \\"Isoetes\\" in the order Isoetales. In the past, members of this group sometimes have been placed in the classes Isoetopsida, Selaginellopsida, or Lycopodiopsida. There are c. 700 species of \\"Selaginella\\" and 140-150 species of \\"Isoetes\\", with a cosmopolitan distribution, but often scarce to rare. Some botanists split \\"Isoetes\\" by separating two South American species into the genus \\"Stylites\\".  - The Lycopodiopsida are a class of plants often loosely grouped as the fern allies . Traditionally , the group included not only the clubmosses and firmosses , but also the spikemosses ( Selaginella and relatives ) and the quillworts ( Isoetes and relatives ) . However , the latter are now usually placed into a separate class , Isoetopsida . Clubmosses are thought to be structurally similar to the earliest vascular plants , with small , scale - like leaves , homosporous spores borne in sporangia at the bases of the leaves , branching stems ( usually dichotomous ) , and generally simple form . The class Lycopodiopsida as interpreted here contains a single living order , the Lycopodiales , and a single extinct order , the Drepanophycales .    What is the relationship between 'lycopodiopsida' and 'lycopodiophyta'? Answer:","output":"Lycopodiopsida and Lycopodiophyta both refer to the same group of plants, which is a tracheophyte subgroup of the Kingdom Plantae. These terms are used interchangeably to describe this group of plants, which is one of the oldest lineages of extant (living) vascular plants. They are characterized by their reproduction through shedding spores, macroscopic alternation of generations, and having microphylls, leaves with only a single vascular trace (vein), unlike the more complex megaphylls found in ferns and seed plants."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: Three males are walking across a field. Hypothesis: Three males are walking across a green field. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"We cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, as there is not enough information provided in the premise to support all elements of the hypothesis. Let's break down the key differences between the premise and hypothesis to analyze this further. Premise: Three males are walking across a field. Hypothesis: Three males are walking across a green field. The premise provides information about the situation in which three males are walking across a field, but it does not specify the color or any other characteristics of the field. The hypothesis, on the other hand, adds a detail that the field is green, which is not present in the premise.  To support the hypothesis, we would need additional information that confirms the color of the field as being green. Without this specific detail, we cannot draw a direct conclusion that the hypothesis is true based solely on the premise. If, for example, the premise stated, \\"Three males are walking across a green field,\\" the premise and hypothesis would match, and we could conclude that the hypothesis is true. In its current form, however, the premise provides incomplete information to confirm or deny the correctness of the hypothesis. Suppose the premise only mentioned that three males were walking across a field. In that case, the field could potentially be green, brown, yellow, or any other color depending on various factors such as the climate, vegetation, time of year, and geographical location. To conclude the hypothesis as true based on the premise, we would need information specifically regarding the field's color. In summary, while the premise of \\"Three males are walking across a field\\" does setup a similar scenario as the hypothesis, it does not provide enough details to confirm that the field is, in fact, green. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the hypothesis is true based on the given premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie plot title: Corso: The Last Beat Movie plot: The Beat Generationâs Gregory Corso became one of four in the inner circle of the Beats, along with Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs. Corso grew up in foster homes, on the streets of Little Italy and Greenwich Village. Corso was sentenced to Clinton State Prison for stealing a 50 suit to go on a date; there, protected by Mafia inmates, Corso read his way through a three-year sentence and ended up at Harvard. He eventually met Allen Ginsberg at a dyke bar in the West Village. After Allen Ginsbergâs death, Corso goes \\"On the Road\\" to rediscover his creative Muse. From Paris to Venice, Rome to Athens, Mount Parnassus to Jim Morrisonâs grave, Corso reflects on the early days of \\"Beats.\\" In high humor he reveals how \\"The Beats\\" emerged in Europe, and paved the way for youth culture, the sexual revolution and even hip-hop. Corso interrupts his tour to revisit Clinton State Prison and inspire young inmates. Returning to Italy, Corso muses on his lost mother, who he believes is dead and buried in Italy. In a stunning discovery, filmmaker Gustave Reininger finds Corso's mother not dead in Italy, but alive in Trenton, N.J. Corso meets his mother on film and discovers she is the Muse he has been seeking. He also discovers that his mother left him to escape the violence and sexual abuse of his father, who lied saying she had returned to Italy. Healing from a life of abandonment, emotional deprivation and abuse, Corso finishes his road trip on the Acropolis in Greece.A revitalized Corso returns to Greenwich Village, only to discover he is dying.

Background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it.  Paragraph: Usain was once a competitive swimmer, but he became bored with the sport and decided to start running very frequently instead. Usain tried to convince his brother, Asafa, to take up running as well. Asafa didn't really like running, though, so he hardly ran much at all.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will increase the strength of their cardiac muscles less? A:","output":"Asafa will increase the strength of his cardiac muscles less. Justification: The background information provided indicates that exercises like running cause the cardiac muscle to contract faster, thereby increasing its strength and efficiency. In the paragraph, Usain is described as running frequently while Asafa hardly runs at all.

Moscow (CNN)More than 1 million historic documents have been destroyed in a fire at one of Russia's largest public libraries, according to the Russian state news agency Tass.  The Russian emergency situations ministry says 147 firefighters struggled for 25 hours over the weekend to put out the blaze in the main library of the Institute for Research Information on Social Sciences in Moscow.  The fire, which ripped through the library Friday evening, destroyed 2,000 square meters (about 2,400 square yards) of the building and caused part of the roof to collapse, according to an official statement. The Russian emergency situations ministry said the fire was particularly hard to put out because of the high temperatures, narrow passageways and the risk of the building falling down.  Moscow's emergency ministry said the temperature inside the rubble of the library remains high and that there is still a threat that the building could collapse.  Vladimir Fortov, president of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti that the fire, which destroyed 15% of all the documents in the library, reminded him of the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine.  \\"It's a major loss for science.

When I hit about 35 I started having trouble with weight. The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down. I will say it is much harder in the winter for me then in the summer. Summer time I am naturally active. I ride bikes with my husband, swim, garden, mow about an acre of lawn. In the winter I can’t ride, swim, garden, or mow, and I hate exercise I don’t enjoy. Anyway the long answer to the defining moment but there it is just the same.

You are given a new situation: The marine biologists studied two areas of the Black Sea. Area A, situated at the mouth of the Danube River, which presented high levels of water stratification, because of the fresh water discharged by the river; and area B, situated 35 miles south, where the water was less stratified and more oxygenated.  and a hint : Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers.  Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]  Please answer this question : Which of the two areas was more oxygenated? The answer to this question is:","output":"Area B was more oxygenated.  To justify this answer, the given information is as follows: 1. Area A has high levels of water stratification due to the fresh water discharge by the Danube River. 2. Area B has less stratified water and is located 35 miles south. 3. Water stratification can create barriers to nutrient and oxygen mixing between the layers, leading to limited primary production and lower net productivity.  From the given information, it is clear that water stratification poses a barrier to oxygen mixing. Since Area A has high levels of water stratification, it is less likely to have efficient oxygen mixing, resulting in lower oxygen levels. On the other hand, Area B has less stratified water, which allows better mixing of oxygen between the layers, resulting in a more oxygenated environment. Thus, Area B is more oxygenated than Area A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you presented involves a change in plant acid levels in the soil and its potential effect on virus replication within a host body.  Based on the information provided, there does not seem to be a direct or clear connection between plant acid levels in the soil and the process of viral replication within a host organism. The virus replication process occurs within host cells and typically does not involve the external environment, such as plant acid levels in the soil. It is possible that changes in plant acid levels could have indirect effects on host organisms or their environments, which might ultimately influence their susceptibility to viruses. For example, altered plant acid levels could affect plant growth or food sources for various species, impacting their overall health. A weakened host organism might be more vulnerable to viral infections, meaning that although the specific process of viral replication remains unchanged, the host organism's weakened state could make it easier for the virus to spread.

Two white men, Brown and Hamilton, offer him short-term employment as a musician if he will travel with them to Washington, D.C. However, once they arrive they drug Northup and deliver him to a slave pen run by a man named Burch. Northup proclaims that he is a free man, only to be savagely beaten with a wooden paddle and then a leather belt. Northup is later shipped to New Orleans along with other captive African Americans. He is told by the others that if he wants to survive in the South, he must adapt to being a slave and not tell anyone he is a free man. A slave trader named Theophilus Freeman gives Northup the identity of \\"Platt\\", a runaway slave from Georgia, and sells him to plantation owner William Ford. Ford takes a liking to Northup and gives him a violin. However, tension grows between Northup and plantation carpenter John Tibeats which ends with Northup savagely beating and whipping Tibeats.

'So, back to the point,There are NO girls in the catalog! Oh, wait, sorry. There IS a girl in the catalog. SITTING in the STANDS,' she writes angrily. With pictures of girls sitting on the stands, Peterson says it makes it difficult for girls to break into sports generally associated with men. 'I think that girls should be treated as equally as boys are treated,' she writes.","output":"Title: The Story of McKenna Peterson: Battling Gender Stereotypes in the Sporting World Introduction In an era where every individual, irrespective of gender, aims to make an impact in various fields, one 12-year-old girl's voice reverberates across the nation to fight for gender equality in sports. McKenna Peterson, a young and passionate basketball enthusiast, took a stand and voiced her concerns about the representation of women in sports catalogs. In this article, we recount her courageous step, the implications of her fiery letter to Dick's Sporting Goods, and the pressing need to break away from gender stereotypes. The Fiery Letter by McKenna Peterson In a significant move, McKenna Peterson, an ardent basketball fan, decided to speak up when she found that women were notably missing in Dick's Sporting Goods Basketball 2014 catalog. Through her heartfelt and passionate letter, she expressed her anger about how girls were only shown sitting in the stands, illustrating the struggles they face while trying to break into sports that are traditionally associated with men. McKenna boldly states, \\"So, back to the point, There are NO girls in the catalog! Oh, wait, sorry. There IS a girl in the catalog. SITTING in the STANDS.\\" She further goes on to emphasize the importance of treating boys and girls equally in the world of sports. As she writes, \\"I think that girls should be treated as equally as boys are treated,\\" imploring the need for an unbiased representation of athletes in the media. The Representation Gap in Sports Marketing  McKenna Peterson's letter successfully highlighted the representation gap that exists in sports marketing. The unequal representation of female athletes in sports catalogs, advertisements, and promotional materials has long been an issue, fostering gender stereotypes and contributing to the misconception that certain sports are better suited for men.  This lack of diversity makes it challenging for young girls to find role models and aspire to excel in a male-dominated field. It also reinforces the archaic belief that women are only meant to cheer on the sidelines. By questioning these practices, McKenna sparked an essential conversation that needs the attention of both sports enthusiasts and industry leaders. Breaking Gender Stereotypes in Sports As we applaud McKenna Peterson's initiative in addressing the equality issue in sports, it is time for us as a society to work towards breaking these stereotypes. Encouraging and supporting female athletes at every level, from school teams to professional leagues, is vital for redefining gender norms and sports culture.  Companies like Dick's Sporting Goods and other sports brands must consider increasing their representation of female athletes in marketing materials and product endorsements. Additionally, empowering young girls to participate in diverse sports will lead to widespread acceptance and support for female athletes. Conclusion The courageous move by McKenna Peterson to voice her concerns about the lack of women players in sports catalogs signifies that change can begin at any age. By recognizing and addressing the inherent gender biases in the sports industry, we contribute to empowering girls, fostering fair representation, and inspiring future athletes to chase their dreams, regardless of their gender. It is our collective responsibility to confront these gender stereotypes and create a more inclusive sports environment for our future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"It is important to clarify the roles and situations of the individuals involved in the case before attempting to provide an answer. In this case, Jesse is a lawyer advising Tracy on a court case involving murder and a life sentence. Thus, Jesse's role is that of legal counsel and representation for Tracy, who is likely the defendant in the case. Based on the provided information, Jesse is not on trial, nor is Jesse implicated in the crime. As a lawyer providing legal representation and counsel, Jesse is fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Unless there is evidence suggesting that Jesse has acted unethically, illegally, or has been directly involved in the crime in question, there is no reason to believe that Jesse would be charged with any criminal wrongdoing. Now, let us consider the question: \\"What will happen to Jesse?\\" The focus of the question involves the fate of Jesse, not Tracy. Given the available information, it is not accurate to respond with \\"found guilty,\\" as this answer implies that Jesse is on trial for criminal charges, which is not the case. Jesse's professional role as a legal counsel does not automatically implicate him in his client's alleged crimes, especially without any evidence suggesting otherwise. A more appropriate answer to the question of what will happen to Jesse could be framed in terms of his professional involvement in the case, such as the possible outcomes of Tracy's trial, the potential impact on Jesse's career, or any risks associated with representing a client in a high-profile and serious case like this. For instance, if Jesse successfully defends Tracy and secures a favorable outcome, it could bolster his reputation within the legal community or lead to additional high-profile cases. Conversely, if Jesse is not successful in his defense, this could impact his career trajectory or possibly lead to negative public perception or scrutiny. Additionally, depending on the complexity and high-profile nature of the case, Jesse may face professional and personal challenges such as stress, long hours, and moral dilemmas. In conclusion, without any evidence that Jesse has acted unethically or unlawfully, or that he is implicated in the crime, the assertion that he would be \\"found guilty\\" is not a valid answer.

Output:","output":"Task explanation: In this task, you are asked to read a review about a place, specifically a Hawaiian restaurant, and provide a rating for the place based on the content of the review. The rating should be in the format of stars, ranging from 1 star (lowest) to 5 stars (highest). Guidelines:  1. Read the review carefully and pay attention to both positive and negative feedback. 2. Consider aspects like price, service, and portion sizes mentioned in the review. 3. Weigh the importance of each aspect and evaluate how it impacts the overall experience at the restaurant. 4. Keep in mind that different people might value different aspects more, so focus on providing a well-rounded rating that reflects the overall quality of the restaurant. 5. Based on your evaluation, decide on the appropriate star rating for the restaurant. Using the guidelines: 1. Read the review: \\"I would say that this is the best Hawaiian restaurant. Reasonable price and prompt service. Portions are massive. Too massive.\\" 2. The review mentions several positive aspects: being the best Hawaiian restaurant, reasonable price, prompt service, and massive portions. The only negative aspect is that the portions are considered too massive. 3. Price, service, and portion sizes are important aspects for a restaurant's quality. In this case, the price and service seem to be excellent. The portions being too massive could be seen as negative, but some people might still appreciate generous servings. 4. Considering the positive feedback outweighs the negative aspect, the overall rating should be rather high. 5. In conclusion, taking into account the overwhelmingly positive review, a 4.5 or 5-star rating would be appropriate. However, since the task requires using a whole star, you may round up or down depending on the impact you believe the \\"too massive\\" portion has. Let's round down to ensure the rating reflects this aspect. Output: 4 stars"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: \\"There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources, produce biomass, decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients... There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time... Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture... The impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change... Maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time.\\"  and the situation: Nicaragua is one of the most biodiverse countries in the Americas. They boast over five hundred species of birds, and thousands of species of plants. Across the pond in England the situation is completely different. Centuries of extensive farming, industrialization, and urban sprawls have made it one of the least biodiverse place on Earth.  Answer the following question: Would the ecosystem functions be less or more stable in Nicaragua than in England? Answer:","output":"The stability of ecosystem functions can be influenced by numerous factors, including biodiversity, environmental conditions, and human activities. Based on the background information provided, it can be inferred that the ecosystem functions in Nicaragua and England may exhibit differing levels of stability due to the substantial differences in biodiversity between the two countries. Nicaragua is one of the most biodiverse countries in the Americas, with a rich variety of flora and fauna inhabiting its diverse landscapes. The vast array of species provides a complex web of interdependencies among the organisms, enhancing the overall stability of the ecosystem functions. Higher levels of biodiversity contribute to the capture of biologically essential resources, increased biomass production, and more efficient decomposition and recycling of nutrients. Furthermore, greater biodiversity may lead to a higher likelihood of key species and diverse functional traits being present, which can positively influence the overall productivity and resilience of the ecological communities in the face of environmental changes. In essence, the high biodiversity in Nicaragua may form an ecosystem that is less susceptible to disturbances, more resilient to stressors, and better equipped to maintain optimal functioning through time. Conversely, England has experienced significant declines in biodiversity due to extensive farming, industrialization, and urban sprawl. As a result, the country ranks among the least biodiverse in the world. Reduced biodiversity can have detrimental effects on the stability of ecosystem functions, as the loss of species and functional diversity may compromise the ability of ecosystems to efficiently capture essential resources, produce biomass, and decompose and recycle nutrients. Additionally, less diverse ecosystems may be more vulnerable to environmental disturbances, less resilient to stressors, and may not have the necessary resources or mechanisms in place to maintain optimal functioning. Consequently, the low biodiversity in England might contribute to a less stable ecosystem compared to Nicaragua. In conclusion, it is reasonable to assert that the ecosystem functions in Nicaragua would likely exhibit higher levels of stability compared to those in England, mainly due to the stark contrast in biodiversity between the two countries. Nicaragua's rich biodiversity fosters resilience and strengthens the ability of ecological communities to maintain balanced ecosystem functions, whereas the lower biodiversity seen in England results in reduced stability and adaptability within their ecosystems. However, it is important to consider various contexts and factors contributing to the overall stability of ecosystem functions, as other elements such as regional climate, human activity, and unique habitat characteristics may also play a significant role in influencing ecosystem stability beyond the scope of biodiversity alone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you have proposed states that if the pancakes are larger, there will be less pancakes made. This hypothesis does have a direct effect on the process, as it changes the size of the pancakes being made, which in turn affects the number of pancakes produced from a given amount of batter. When making larger pancakes using the same process mentioned above, you will have to adjust certain steps: 1. Mix pancake mix with water: This step remains the same since you will still need to prepare the batter as per the instructions on the pancake mix. 2. Heat a griddle: There is no change in this step as well. 3. Pour a circle of batter in the griddle: You will need to pour more batter onto the griddle to make larger pancakes. This will require keeping the size of the circle consistent to ensure even cooking and desired thickness. 4. When most of the bubbles pop on the surface, flip: The time needed to cook the larger pancakes may slightly increase due to their size. Make sure to monitor the bubbles and the edges of the pancake so that you can flip it at the right time. 5. Cook to desired color: The cooking time on the second side may also increase a bit to reach the desired color and ensure the pancake is cooked through. 6. Apply butter, syrup, and enjoy: This step remains the same, with the consideration that you might require more butter and syrup for larger pancakes. The key effect of the perturbation hypothesis on the process is the possible increase in cooking time and the need to pour more batter onto the griddle for each pancake. As a result, the total number of pancakes produced from a given batch of batter will be reduced if they are made larger. This reduction in the number of pancakes supports the initial assumption made in the perturbation hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It does not have lead plumbing pipes or lead based paint.  Would house A less likely or more likely cause brain damage than house B? A:","output":"House A would be more likely to cause brain damage than House B due to the presence of lead plumbing pipes and lead-based paint.  Lead is a toxic substance that can cause severe health problems, particularly in children. Prolonged exposure to lead can lead to intellectual disabilities, behavioral problems, and other health issues, including damage to the brain and nervous system. In adults, lead exposure can also lead to fertility problems, high blood pressure, and kidney damage. House A, built in the 1920s, has both lead plumbing pipes and lead-based paint. As lead-containing materials deteriorate over time, lead particles from the pipes and paint may contaminate the water supply and become airborne as dust, posing a risk for occupants inhaling or ingesting the lead particles. This could lead to lead poisoning and an increased likelihood of brain damage. House B, on the other hand, is a more modern build and does not have lead plumbing pipes or lead-based paint. With the absence of lead in the construction materials, the risk of lead exposure significantly decreases, making it less likely to cause brain damage in comparison to House A.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the work that was criticised as old-fashioned?  Sir William Turner Walton, OM (29 March 1902 – 8 March 1983) was an English composer. During a sixty-year career, he wrote music in several classical genres and styles, from film scores to opera. His best-known works include Façade, the cantata Belshazzar's Feast, the Viola Concerto, the First Symphony, and the British coronation anthems Crown Imperial and Orb and Sceptre. Born in Oldham, Lancashire, the son of a musician, Walton was a chorister and then an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary Sitwell siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Façade, which at first brought him notoriety as a modernist, but later became a popular ballet score. In middle age, Walton left Britain and set up home with his young wife Susana on the Italian island of Ischia. By this time, he had ceased to be regarded as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, Troilus and Cressida, was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics at the time of their premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works. Walton was a slow worker, painstakingly perfectionist, and his complete body of work across his long career is not large. His most popular compositions continue to be frequently performed in the 21st century, and by 2010 almost all his works had been released on CD.

Options: a ) 2.8 % , b ) 3.0 % , c ) 3.2 % , d ) 3.4 % , e ) 3.6 % A:","output":"To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage of marbles from jar A that need to be moved to jar B to make both jars have the same number of marbles. Let's represent the number of marbles in jar B as x. Since jar A has 6% more marbles than jar B, we can represent the number of marbles in jar A as 1.06x. In order for both jars to have equal marbles, let's say, each jar will have y marbles. Therefore, we can write the following equation: 1.06x - m = y x + m = y Where m is the number of marbles to be moved from jar A to jar B. From the above two equations, we can substitute y: 1.06x - m = x + m Now, we need to solve for m: 0.06x = 2m m = 0.03x Now, to find the percentage of marbles from jar A that need to be moved to jar B, we need to divide m by the total number of marbles in jar A (1.06x) and multiply the result by 100: (m / 1.06x) * 100 = (0.03x / 1.06x) * 100 = (0.03 / 1.06) * 100 ≈ 2.83% Therefore, the answer is approximately 2.8%, which corresponds to option (a)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Look for a scent that adds to your style and complements your overall presentation. A great scent is one you don't mind smelling all day. It shouldn't be too strong, since some people are sensitive to overpowering smells. Experiment with different scents until you find a few you like. You can wear the same scent every day or rotate between a few.  Different scents are great for different occasions. A citrusy, floral, sweet scent might be great for daytime wear, while you might choose something musky and a bit stronger to wear at night. If you're looking for a more masculine scent, go for a cologne with notes of fir, cedar and sandalwood. Scents change depending on who is wearing them. They interact with your unique body chemistry and change a little throughout the day. It's something to keep in mind when you're picking out a scent - one that works for your friend might not smell the same way on you. You can also use a scent in the form of lotion or body oil, if you prefer. Solid perfume is another popular choice. Don't bathe yourself in your chosen scent. Use it strategically, so people nearby get small whiffs, but don't feel overwhelmed. A little goes a long way, especially if you're using real perfume. Put some on your wrists, neck, and behind your ears - that's probably all you need.  If you're using a spray bottle, don't spray it directly on your body at a close range. Hold the bottle several inches from your body and spray lightly, then move your wrist or other body part into the mist. Even if you're using scented lotion, you probably don't want to slather it all over your body. Just use it in a few places, like your hands and neck. Use an unscented lotion to moisturize the rest of your skin. If your shampoo doesn't have much of a smell, you might want to add a bit of scent to your hair. This is a nice, subtle way to keep you smelling great all day long. Rub a little perfume or essential oil between your palms, then smooth it gently through your hair. Alternatively, you could add a few drops of your favorite scent to your unscented shampoo or conditioner. It's not a good idea to wear 3 - 4 warring scents that leave a smelly trail in your wake when you walk down the hall. Instead of asking you the name of your perfume, people will pinch their noses when they see you coming! Just wear one main scent at a time.  That means that if you have a strongly-scented lotion, you shouldn't also wear perfume, and vice versa. Be sure you aren't accidentally wearing too many scents. Your deodorant, hairspray, and lip balm might all be scented. Try to choose unscented products and stick to one or two main scents. If you don't want to splurge on a bottle of perfume or cologne, you can make your own scent! Purchase a few different essential oils, like rose, lavender, lemongrass or vetiver, and use a few drops instead of perfume. You can even make your own perfume blend by mixing several different essential oils together until you come up with something you like.  To find essential oils, check out health food stores. They're usually in the body care section. You can dilute your essential oil mix with water or vodka so that it doesn't smell as strong. Put it in a spray bottle and use it on your body and hair. Summary:","output":"Choose a versatile scent that complements your style, taking into consideration its strength, your body chemistry, and occasion; use it strategically and avoid combining multiple scents, while also considering alternatives like essential oils or unscented products."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Locate a base sprite of the pokémon of your choice and copy it to your clipboard (or save it). Hypothesis: Pick a pokemon that is rainbow colored to make this easier.","output":"Based on the context provided, the hypothesis that picking a rainbow-colored Pokémon would make the recoloring process easier is not fully supported. In the context, it is suggested to choose Pokémon with simpler color schemes for recoloring, such as Voltorb, Oddish, and Wigglytuff. These Pokémon have relatively fewer colors and simpler designs in their appearances, which can make editing and recoloring more straightforward for beginners. A rainbow-colored Pokémon, on the other hand, would have a more complex color scheme with multiple color transitions and gradients. This could make the recoloring process more challenging for those who are new to sprite editing or inexperienced in color modification. In this case, it is important to practice with simpler Pokémon first to gain experience and familiarity with the process of recoloring before moving on to more intricate and complex designs. To summarize, the hypothesis generated from the context provided does not fully align with the suggestions made. The context recommends choosing Pokémon with simpler color schemes for beginners, making the process of recoloring easier and more manageable. Selecting a rainbow-colored Pokémon could potentially make the task more difficult due to the complexity of its design and the increased number of colors involved. Therefore, it is advisable to start with simpler Pokémon and gradually work towards more complex designs as one gains experience and mastery of the recoloring process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Horror-meister, Stephen King calls George Pelecanos \\"perhaps the greatest living American crime writer.\\" His stories are set in Pelecanos' hometown of Washington, D.C., but this is not the side of the U.S. capitol that you see portrayed on TV with white marble monuments, lawyers and lobbyists. Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal.

They find an isolated cabin in the woods, advertised as the perfect getaway spot and decide to rent it. Little do they know, the cabin's history is a dark one, and once inside, they find a mysterious book, the Naturom Demonto. The first half of the movie revolves around the group's initial curiosity about the book and the cabin. As they explore both, they realize that the book is written in an ancient language, and it contains sinister images and incantations. Several warnings are scribbled across the pages, which renders them hesitant to read it out loud. However, Kevin's curiosity gets the better of him, and he whispers one of the incantations, accidentally unleashing a powerful, dark force within the cabin. Following the incident, they start experiencing terrifying events. It starts small, like strange noises and shadows. However, soon it escalates to the members of the group finding themselves targets of the sinister forces present. It becomes evident that the spirits, awakened by Kevin, have possessed the cabin and its surroundings, leading to an intense game of cat and mouse.  The friends now search desperately for assistance to remove the curse. Their frantic research leads them to a mysterious local named Evelyn who seems to know everything about the cabin and the curse of Naturom Demonto. She has a history with the cursed book and reveals that her ancestors were the ones who crafted the Naturom Demonto centuries ago. They intended to use it as a weapon against their enemies, but they lost control of its power, causing the death of many innocent people. Evelyn explains that the only way to break the curse is by destroying the book. But this task is easier said than done, as the curse has spread through the woods, and the group confronts various supernatural hazards - some of which result in casualties amongst the friends. Jack, after a grim battle, eventually succeeds in destroying the book by hurling it into a bonfire. The friends mourn their losses, but it is here that the twist is revealed.  Evelyn, who had been presenting herself as an ally, is revealed to be the last surviving member of the coven responsible for creating the book. She had been feeding off the dark energy inside the book, waiting for the perfect time to harness its power. In a climactic showdown, the remaining friends have to tap into their inner strength to defeat Evelyn, who is hell-bent on unleashing evil upon the world. Ultimately, they manage to defeat her, utilizing the knowledge they learned about the curse during their ordeal.

Help as much as you can. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . .  that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... Question: After this semester, what class will David Meyer teach?

Today, we are going to learn about something that grown-ups like to do sometimes, called going to the sauna. The sauna is a warm and cozy room where people sit to relax and feel good. But after they leave the sauna, there are some important things they should do to take care of themselves. Let's find out what these things are! 1. Air Dry Your Skin When you come out of the sauna, your skin will be all warm and maybe a little sweaty. That's okay! The best way to help your skin feel all nice and fresh again is just to let the air outside the sauna dry your skin. This means not using a towel to dry off, but just waiting for the air to do the job. This way, your skin can go back to feeling cool and happy. 2. Drink Water Throughout the Day Playing and having fun can make you thirsty, right? Just like that, spending time in the sauna can make your body need more water. So, it's important to drink lots of water after visiting the sauna. Make sure to drink not only right after coming out, but also throughout the day. This will help your body stay healthy and strong. 3. Eat a Snack or Light Meal After you've spent some time having fun in the sauna, your body might need some energy! Instead of having a big meal, it's a good idea to have a small snack or eat something that isn't too heavy. You can choose fruits, nuts, or even a sandwich. This way, you can give your body the energy it needs without making it feel too full or tired. 4. Take It Easy the Rest of the Day Grown-ups sometimes need to relax too, just like you! After their time in the sauna, it's important for them to allow their bodies to rest. This means not doing things that are too hard or too tiring for the rest of the day. They can read a book, watch a movie, or just sit and chat with their friends. This way, their bodies can feel all refreshed and have lots of energy for another fun day! So, now you know what grown-ups should do after they have a fun time in the sauna. Remember, taking good care of our bodies is important for everyone, no matter how old we are! Maybe one day, when you're older, you can give the sauna a try too and follow these steps to make sure you feel great afterwards."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Summarize this article: Proposals for The Gate shopping centre in Durham include new retail, leisure and cinema outlets and student flats. Durham University said there was no need for extra accommodation beyond what was already planned elsewhere. Residents' groups and the City of Durham Trust also opposed the plans, which have attracted some support. Objections concern the location of bicycle racks, late-night noise and anti-social behaviour and the impact on the World Heritage Site. Supporters welcomed the redevelopment of a \\"neglected\\" area and said the effect of students would be felt less by residents on this site than elsewhere. But, in comments submitted to planners, the university said the development \\"would perpetuate an unbalanced residential population where one community group (in this case a temporary population of students) dominates to the exclusion of other types of resident\\". The 40-year-old shopping centre went into administration two years ago and was bought by London-based developer Clearbell Capital LLP for almost Â£12m. Councillors are recommended to approve the proposals at a meeting on 6 October.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  According to the City's 2013 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the largest employers in the city are: Major manufacturers in Grand Forks include wind turbine manufacturer LM Glasfiber and light aircraft manufacturer Cirrus Design. Major food producers include potato processor J. R. Simplot Company and the state-owned North Dakota Mill and Elevator which is the largest flour mill in the United States. Amazon.com and SEI Information Technologies both operate call centers in Grand Forks. Other large private employers in the city include the locally owned Alerus Financial branch of banks, Home of Economy, and the locally owned Hugo's chain of supermarkets.The retail and service sector is also an important part of the economy. The historic center of shopping in Grand Forks was the downtown area. Today, downtown is home to small shops and restaurants and south Grand Forks has become the major retail district in the city. Grand Forks has three large shopping centers. The oldest, Grand Cities Mall, is on South Washington Street and contains mainly small, locally owned stores as well as a Kmart. With about 80 stores, the area's largest indoor mall is Columbia Mall which is anchored by Scheels, Sears, J.C. Penney, and a small food court. The newest major shopping center in the city is the Grand Forks Marketplace power center mall which features SuperTarget, Best Buy, Lowe's, Gordmans, and several smaller stores.

Sources such as Wikipedia, Forbes, and business news websites usually have accurate and current information about company ownership.    2. Compare information found with the proposed answer: Once you have found who currently owns Popeyes, you could compare this information with the suggested answer. Depending on what you find, you could then conclude if the suggested answer is correct or not. Based on my current knowledge, Popeyes is owned by Restaurant Brands International, a company that also owns other food chains like Burger King and Tim Hortons.

Based on the premise \\"they used to have several places um that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all and they stopped doing it because they said it wasn't profitable\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Our community papers have been flourishing thanks to the new development.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the provided premise, it is difficult to conclude that the hypothesis \\"Our community papers have been flourishing thanks to the new development\\" is true. The premise states that several places were involved in the production of community papers but stopped because the activity was not profitable. This information suggests that the community papers may have encountered challenges or lacked enough demand to generate profits. To better assess the hypothesis that community papers are flourishing due to new development, it is crucial to consider several factors that can support or challenge the assertion. These factors may include: 1. Current circulation numbers and demand for community papers: A higher readership, growing demand, and an increased circulation of community papers may support the hypothesis that the community papers are thriving. 2. Advertising revenue and local business involvement: Community papers typically rely on local businesses for advertising revenues. If these revenues have increased, it can provide evidence that the papers are flourishing alongside the new development. 3. Quality and diversity of content: Greater coverage of local news, events, and stories, as well as higher-quality content that resonates with readers, can be seen as signs of a flourishing community paper. 4. Online presence and digital adaptation: The ability to adapt to online platforms and meet the changing reading habits of audiences can be an indicator of success and longevity for community papers. 5. Community engagement: A strong connection with the community and readership can contribute to the success of a community paper. Engaging in activities such as workshops, local events, and educational programs can indicate that the papers are flourishing. 6. Financial performance: If the community papers have shown improvements in financial performance, through increased subscriptions, advertising revenues, or additional funding sources, this may indicate that they are flourishing thanks to the new development. To make a more informed conclusion about the hypothesis, it would be necessary to gather information about these factors and analyze them in relation to the growth of the new development. However, the given premise, which mentions previously unprofitable paper production, does not provide sufficient evidence to definitively conclude that community papers are flourishing due to the new development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. When I was writing the manuscript for Florentine, I enlisted the help of an army of recipe testers — about 80 people from all over the world — to test every recipe thoroughly. Only one came back to me consistently with problems. From Minnesota to Melbourne, three testers wrote to me that their very first attempt at making Tuscan gnudi (ricotta and spinach balls that, rather than be encased in pasta like for ravioli, are simply dusted in flour) resulted in a pot of simmering water with “dissolved” gnudi. It reminded me of Pellegrino Artusi’s potato gnocchi recipe in his famous cookbook from 1891, where he interrupts the recipe instructions to mention a signora who, upon attempting to stir the gnocchi cooking in the pot, finds they have disappeared – O dove’erano andati? “Where did they go?” In the case of the gnocchi, there was too little flour used, according to Artusi. But in the case of the gnudi, I already had a hunch. I grilled all three testers on a number of various factors — was the water just simmering, not on a rolling boil (which can destroy delicate gnudi), did they drain the spinach very well, and equally the ricotta (one said she even drained it overnight)? Did they use “proper” ricotta? Aha. “Proper” ricotta. The kind that was only made a day or so earlier, the leftovers of the cheese-making process, the real deal. The kind that you can see in a deli counter, standing on its own, that gets cut into a big wedge and weighed when you order it. Not the kind you buy at the supermarket, in a tub, that so often is grainy, more like the consistency of yogurt, has no structure, and is full of unnecessary gums or additives. All my recipe testers had used the second kind — to be fair, some were new to the idea of buying ricotta and in their neighbourhood only had access to this. In that case, it would have probably been better to make your own, or choose another recipe. When does the author suggest to used the right type of ricotta? - Any time - it'll have better structure - not enough information - Only when needed - the ricotta in the tub is just as good - There is no right type of ricotta Answer:","output":"The author suggests using the right type of ricotta any time when making Tuscan gnudi. It is important to use \\"proper\\" ricotta, the real deal, which is made fresh, has a good structure, and is devoid of unnecessary additives or gums typically found in supermarket tubs of ricotta. According to the author, using the proper ricotta greatly impacts the outcome of the dish, ensuring the gnudi hold their shape and do not dissolve in the pot while simmering. The emphasis on choosing the right type of ricotta highlights the importance of using high-quality, authentic ingredients for a successful and delicious result."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Above image by Annie Fischinger (creative commons license)      Guest Post by Nathaniel J. Dominy, Professor of Anthropology and Biological Sciences, Dartmouth College; OpEd Project Public Voices Fellow (Full bio below this post)      Robert L. May graduated from Dartmouth College in 1926 and soon afterwards published a classic monograph of animal social behavior, Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer. May reported observations of reindeer disporting themselves and excluding an individual, Rudolph, for having a uniquely large, red nose. The radiance of this nose, which May described as “dazzling” in daylight and “glowing” at night, later proved advantageous on Christmas Eve, when thick Arctic fog disrupted the flight preparations of Santa Claus and his team of eight reindeer. Under these conditions, Rudolph’s nose produced sufficient light for safe aviation and the global distribution of gifts (Figure 1 below).      This account of Rudolph’s nose and its brilliance under specific atmospheric conditions is familiar to most biologists, but it is also viewed as a spurious anatomical novelty, which could explain why the sensory ecology of luminescent noses is practically unstudied.      New findings on the color vision of reindeer may elucidate the potential selective advantages of a luminescent nose. For example, it was discovered recently that the vision of Arctic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) is sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light, a rare trait among diurnal mammals. The ecological function of this visual sensitivity is uncertain, but it could enhance the ability of reindeer to detect objects that absorb UV light, such as predators and plant foods, against a background of snow cover, which reflects UV light to different extents. The potential fitness benefits of discriminating UV-absorbing targets could be greatest in mid-winter, when the sun is low on the horizon and high atmospheric (Rayleigh) scattering produces UV-enriched light.      Still more surprising is the unparalleled plasticity of reindeer eyes, which change color seasonally. The tapetum lucidum of the retina (the reflective tissue responsible for “eye shine”) shifts from a rich golden color during the summer months to a deep blue color during the winter months, perhaps to increase visual sensitivity to shorter (bluer) wavelengths under dim (mesopic) conditions. Taken together, these recent findings point to a specialized visual system and ecology that is strikingly suboptimal for late-December fog.      Light transmission in fog      Fog is an aggregation of suspended water droplets or ice crystals immediately above the surface of the Earth. It forms when moist air is cooled below its dew point or frost point and some of the water vapor condenses; and, by definition, human visibility is < 1000 m. Robert May described ground fog “as thick as white fizz” and near zero visibility (it was “dark and drear“), which suggests one of two possible fog types: radiation fog or ice fog. Radiation fog is produced when the ground cools the air above it by contact. Ice fog occurs when warm air interacts with extremely cold air and the water vapor sublimates, or changes directly into a solid, to form tiny ice crystals suspended in the air.      The opacity of fog is wavelength-dependent. Longer (redder) wavelengths travel farthest, but the distance varies as an inverse function of droplet size. If the droplet sizes exceed the wavelength of light, then Mie scattering extinguishes all light regardless of wavelength.      Such scatter prevails in most fog types, rendering them optically opaque, but a red luminescent nose is predicted to outshine any other kind of nose,      with greater transmission in ice fog (typical ice particles: < 10 μm) than radiation fog (typical droplet sizes: 10-20 μm). To explore the extent to which Rudolph’s nose might be optimized for vision in fog, it is necessary to know the spectral composition of the radiant light.      The color of Rudolph’s nose      A clue to the color, or chromaticity, of Rudolph’s nose emerged in Barbara Hazen’s (1958) adaptation of May’s original work. In this version, Rudolph hides behind a holly hedge so that “his bright red nose blended in with the bright red berries.” Figure 2 (below) illustrates this episode and the reflectance spectra of ripe holly fruits (Ilex aquifolium). If we assume that such spectra are representative of Arctic holly fruits, and we assume a similar radiant spectrum from Rudolph’s nose, then we can estimate radiant light with spectral peak of ca. 700 nm. Such a peak is not only supremely red, but also the maximum redness visible to most mammals.      Such conjecture on the color of Rudolph’s nose is necessarily speculative, but it does suggest a nose that is optimized for light transmission in fog, particularly in late December when reindeer eyes are sensitized to seeing blue wavelengths that attenuate rapidly in fog.      Reindeer, then, appear to have greater need for a red fog light than other mammals, which could explain why Rudolph’s nose was so effective for aviation in thick fog.      Expected increases in efficiency and safety during long-distance flight could confer fitness benefits; however, these advantages may be offset by high thermal costs. The noses of reindeer have a rich microvascular system and are therefore quite warm, a trait that prevents freezing but results in substantial heat loss. Excessive heat radiation in his glowing nose could put Rudolph at risk of hypothermia under cold weather conditions.      It is therefore imperative for children to provide high-calorie foods to replenish Rudolph’s low energetic reserves on Christmas Eve.      On balance, the selective advantages of a red luminescent nose appear to outweigh the costs, which raises questions about the frequency of the trait in the population. It may be on the rise; however, the frequency of fog is decreasing worldwide, a pattern that may offset the occasional selective advantages of a luminescent nose. Another hypothesis holds that Rudolph’s red nose is infected with nasal parasites and simply inflamed. Such contrasting hypotheses invite testing, and it is hoped that future research on the optical properties of Arctic light and fog will shed, dare I say, new light, on the extraordinary biology and sensory ecology of reindeer.

Filed under: satire, holiday spirit      Nathaniel Dominy is a Professor in the Departments of Anthropology and Biological Sciences at Dartmouth College. His research is focused on the functional ecology and anatomy of humans and nonhuman primates, with a specific interest in how these organisms discern, acquire, and assimilate edible tissues. The present blog post, his first, was motivated by his four-year-old daughter, Eleanor, who asked, “Why don’t all reindeer have glowing noses?” ||||| Here are the scientific benefits of Rudolph’s red nose      by Brian Galloway      Rudolph the Red-Nosed reindeer absolutely had a very shiny nose, but did it really help him find his way through a foggy Christmas Eve sky?      The study was recently published in the journal Frontiers For Young Minds, a journal focused on answering questions aimed at children in hopes of stimulating an interest in science. Nathaniel J. Dominy is a professor of Anthroplogy at Dartmouth who claims Rudolph’s effectiveness comes from the Arctic reindeer’s special vision.      Dominy claims that “New findings about the color vision of reindeer could hold important clues about the value of a luminescent nose.” Reindeer can see in the ultraviolet spectrum which is invisible to humans, but it helps reindeer spot important things such as predators and food.      This is important because the sun’s position in the sky during an arctic winter casts much more UV-light than normal, so being able to see UV rays would allow Rudolph to lead the sleigh more effectively.      The reindeer’s eyes also adjust to see different types of light depending on the season—yellows and reds during the summer and blues during the winter. Fog would block out most blue light, so Rudolph’s red nose is necessary to see through the fog.      Such a vascular nose would lose heat very quickly in the cold winter air, so Dominy claims in a statement that “it is imperative for children to provide high-calorie foods to help Rudolph replenish his energetic reserves of Christmas Eve.”      So please don’t forget to put out some Christmas cookies for Santa and his team of reindeer. Dominy claims that the frequency of foggy weather is declining worldwide due to climate change, but there’s still a chance that Rudolph’s luminescent nose will be necessary on this Christmas Eve.      -----      Feature Image: DreamWorks Classics ||||| \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" is by the Robert L. May, Dartmouth class of 1926. Credit: Rauner Special Collections Library, Dartmouth. We're all familiar with the story of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer by Robert L. May (a class of 1926 Dartmouth alumnus) but scientifically speaking, what are the optical benefits of a shiny red nose on a foggy Christmas Eve?      In a paper just published by Frontiers for Young Minds, Nathaniel J. Dominy, Professor of Anthropology at Dartmouth, explores this very question. By citing research by other scientists on the unique eyes and vision of Arctic reindeer, Dominy explains why Rudolph is able to lead Santa and his team of eight tiny reindeer through the thick Arctic fog.      Dominy points out that Arctic reindeer (scientific name Rangifer tarandus tarandus) can see ultraviolet light, which is invisible to humans and most mammals—a trait that comes especially handy in mid-winter when the sun is low on the horizon and the high scattered light from the atmosphere is mainly blueish and ultraviolet. In addition, the reflective tissue (tapetum lucidum) in reindeer eyes changes from a rich golden color during the summer months to a deep blue color during the winter months. This tissue (which causes eye shine at night) helps nocturnal animals see in the dark, and a blue one is expected to improve their ability to see blue light. Yet, fog extinguishes blue light more readily than red light, which may make it especially difficult for Santa's reindeer to see blue effectively, never mind fly.      This is where Rudolph's luminescent (glowing) nose comes into play, as it serves as an excellent fog light for navigating his fellow reindeer. Given that the redness of Rudolph's nose is similar to red holly berries, Dominy was able to estimate the color of light emitted from Rudolph's nose by measuring the color of holly berries. He found that Rudolph's nose is probably the maximum level of redness that mammals are able to see, which may explain why Rudolph's nose is effective as a fog light.

Credit: Eli Burakian, class of 2000, Dartmouth College.      According to Dominy, Rudolph's nose also poses a problem. Reindeer noses are extremely vascular, which causes them to lose body heat through their noses. A glowing nose could cause excessive heat loss for Rudolph, putting him at risk of hypothermia. \\"It is therefore imperative for children to provide high-calorie foods to help Rudolph replenish his energetic reserves on Christmas Eve,\\" says Dominy. As a result of the unique properties of Rudolph, it is no wonder that with a nose so bright, he is able to effectively guide Santa's sleigh.

Select the topic that this about: Property and casualty insurers such as State Farm and The Hartford have invested in wireless and other technologies to streamline claims processing for policyholders affected by recent hurricanes.","output":"Property and casualty insurers have faced significant challenges in recent years due to an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters, such as hurricanes. The devastation caused by these calamities has placed immense pressure on insurers to quickly and efficiently process claims for policyholders in need. As a result, major insurance companies like State Farm and The Hartford have turned to innovative technologies, particularly wireless and other communications technologies, to streamline the claims process. These advancements have not only helped insurers meet the overwhelming demand for claims processing, but they have also improved the experiences of policyholders during some of the most difficult times in their lives. Some of the technologies that property and casualty insurers have invested in include: 1. Mobile applications: Many insurers have developed mobile apps that allow policyholders to file claims, upload photos of damage, and track the progress of their claims. These apps can provide real-time updates and make it easier for customers to access the information and support they need without having to call or visit a local office. Moreover, these apps often incorporate features that allow policyholders to access additional resources and assistance, such as finding nearby shelters or navigating evacuation routes. 2. Drones and aerial imagery: The use of drones and aerial imagery has been a game-changer for insurers handling claims following a natural disaster. Drones can capture high-quality images of damage in areas that are difficult to access or too dangerous for adjusters to enter. This technology not only accelerates the claims process but also provides better documentation and a more accurate assessment of damages. 3. Internet of Things (IoT) and smart home devices: Smart home devices, such as connected security systems, water sensors, and weather stations, provide real-time data that can be invaluable for insurers during a disaster. This data can help insurance companies quickly identify the extent of the damage and prioritize which claims need immediate attention. Insurers can also use this information to provide policyholders with alerts and advice on how to mitigate potential damage during a natural disaster, thereby reducing the overall cost of claims. 4. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning: AI and machine learning technologies have been increasingly used by insurers to analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that can help improve the claims process. For example, machine learning algorithms can quickly assess damage in aerial images, or even recognize fraud attempts in claim submissions. This technology enables insurers to allocate resources more efficiently, ensuring that legitimate claims are processed promptly and accurately. 5. Video assessment and communication tools: Remote video assessment and communication tools have become invaluable for claims adjusters in the wake of natural disasters. Adjusters can now conduct virtual inspections of damaged properties via video chat or by reviewing recordings provided by policyholders. This allows for faster, more efficient assessments and eliminates the need for adjusters to physically visit and inspect each property. These technological advancements have significantly improved the claims processing experience for both policyholders and insurers. By leveraging these cutting-edge tools and platforms, property and casualty insurers can process claims more quickly, provide better support and assistance to policyholders, and minimize the negative impacts of natural disasters on their business operations. Additionally, the adoption of these technologies underscores the importance of continuous innovation within the insurance industry to remain agile and responsive in an increasingly unpredictable world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: Peter Boddy, 65, admitted selling 55 horses from his abattoir, in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, and accepting 17 animals without keeping proper records. He told Southwark Crown Court some of the meat went to Italian restaurants. Boddy was also ordered to pay more than £10,442 in costs after admitting breaching EU regulations. Slaughterhouse manager David Moss was given a four-month suspended sentence for forging an invoice relating to the sale of horses in February 2013. Sentencing the pair, Judge Alistair McCreath said: \\"The traceability of food products, here meat, is of critical importance in relation to public health. \\"If meat causes ill health then it is important that those responsible for investigating the cause of it should quickly be able to discover where the meat came from and trace it backwards... to find where the problem lies and prevent the problem escalating.\\" Adam Payter, prosecuting, said it was a requirement for slaughterhouses to keep a record of where they bought their meat and where they sold it. Boddy's failure was uncovered during a Food Standards Agency (FSA) investigation into abattoirs known to slaughter horses. Mr Payter said that in early 2013 the FSA asked Boddy, of East Hey Head Farm, Todmorden for documents in relation to the traceability of horse carcasses at the business during 2012. Initial documents, provided by Moss, of Higher Moss, West Yorkshire, were considered \\"inadequate\\" and did not show where a number of horses had gone or where they had come from. However, on that occasion Moss - who the prosecution say was acting as manager on the day - conceded that some of the horsemeat had been sold \\"cash in hand\\". The FSA then asked for delivery notes or invoices and a few days later Moss provided a forged invoice. Mr Payter said: \\"The prosecution say that in relation to horses that were slaughtered on the site, there were FSA records for those; in relation to other horses that were not in the FSA records - there were not proper records for those horses. \\"It can't be said where they were slaughtered, when they were slaughtered, whether it was on site - but horsemeat passed through Peter Boddy's slaughterhouse without being properly documented.\\" He added that although the prosecution could not say whether the meat had ended up in the human food chain, \\"there would be no cause to cover up the provenance or destination of horsemeat unless there was something underlying wrong with that horsemeat\\". Christopher James, defending Boddy, said his client had been \\"reckless\\", but that his failings were not deliberate and the meat had only ever been offered as horsemeat. He added: \\"There is little or no risk to the public health from the failings that had been established there.\\"","output":"A man named Peter Boddy admitted to selling 55 horses from his abattoir, which is a place where animals are killed for their meat.

During the game it was Jeffrey's call to put Jason into position so the team could win because","output":"of his incredible athletic abilities and unique strategic mindset. This decision would ultimately prove to be a game-changer, as Jason's entry into the field bolstered the team's performance and inspired a newfound sense of confidence within each individual player. Jason, having been part of the team's core group for quite some time, possessed not only a deep understanding of the game's mechanics but also a strong intuition for predicting his opponent's moves. As he took his place on the field, his presence had an instantaneous effect on the team's morale and dynamics - the players felt energized and reassured, knowing they had someone reliable on their side. With each passing minute, Jason's contributions to the game became increasingly evident. His swift moves allowed him to dart between opposing players, leaving them bewildered and disoriented. His excellent ball-handling skills facilitated the team's assault on the opposition's goal, constantly forcing the other team to play defense. Despite their best efforts, the opponents struggled to keep up with Jason's agility and finesse. Similarly, Jason's exceptional communication helped streamline the team's efforts and improve their overall coordination. He knew exactly how to direct his teammates towards specific objectives, as well as when to take charge and when to let others shine. His tactical decision-making, paired with his ability to read the opposition, played a key role in many of the goals scored throughout the game. At one crucial moment, when the scoreboard was tied, and tensions couldn't be higher, it was Jason's intervention that turned the tides for the team. He intercepted a powerful strike from an opposing player with an impressive combination of dexterity and determination. Then, with a quick scan of the field, he set into motion a lightning-fast counter-attack. Noticing a temporary gap in the opposition's defense, he passed the ball to one of his teammates, who then forwarded it to another. As the opponents scrambled desperately to react and cover their positions, Jason positioned himself strategically near the opposing team's goal. Finally, with only seconds to spare, the ball was launched in his direction, and he tapped it into the net with ease and grace. The team erupted into cheers, as Jason's timely goal secured the victory they'd been seeking. Jeffrey's decision to involve Jason in the game was clearly the turning point that decided its outcome. The team had never been more proud and grateful for his intervention and guidance. As they gathered at the end of the game, there was a genuine sense of camaraderie and satisfaction that radiated from each player. Thus, Jeffrey's fateful call to incorporate Jason into the game not only propelled the team to victory but elevated the spirit of sportsmanship, teamwork, and personal growth among each member and even the spectators. It was an unforgettable moment that would go down in the history of the team as a testament to the power of trust, leadership, and, most importantly, the unwavering passion for the game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At the hearing preceding Norman's release, Lila Loomis (Vera Miles) shows up to protest, producing a petition that she's been circulating with signatures of 743 people who do not want to see Norman return to society. Lila is the sister of Marion Crane, one of Norman's victims (from the first film), and the widow of Sam Loomis, who was Marion's boyfriend at the time of her death. When the judge refuses to acknowledge Lila's petition, she vows to see Norman returned to the institution to pay for his crimes.Dr. Raymond takes Norman back to his old home, the gloomy mansion on the hill behind the Bates Motel. A car is parked by the motel, which belongs to Warren Toomey (Dennis Franz)--the current owner of the motel. Dr. Raymond offers to introduce Norman to him, but Norman says it can wait until later.

Norman admits he is just nervous about being back after such a long time away.Inside the house, all the furniture is covered up with sheets.

Dr. Raymond reminds Norman that, with him living back at home, the memories from his past are likely to reoccur, but he is confident that Norman can handle it now. Dr. Raymond regrets that there won't be a trained social worker to check in on Norman occasionally, due to budget cutbacks, however Norman says that at least Dr. Raymond will come by from time to time to see him.

Hint: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries: the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.","output":"Since Mike was more interested specifically in mantle melting and related phenomena, he would be the person who learned about lowering the melting temperature of the mantle.

But Ruth Madoff seems likely to end up with a relative pittance even if she is found not to have any connection to her husband's decades-long Ponzi scheme. On Monday federal prosecutors notified a New York court that they will also seek the assets of Ruth Madoff, including a 7.0 million Manhattan penthouse, homes in Palm Beach, France and New York's Long Island, a 2007 BMW as well as three other vehicles and 62.0 million in funds deposited in her name. Last week, 70-year-old Bernard Madoff pleaded guilty to securities fraud and perjury, among other charges in a scheme that seems to have cost investors a mind-boggling 65.0 billion. He took the unusual course of pleading guilty as charged without trying to strike a deal with prosecutors. Madoff might have sought some degree of leniency in exchange for naming his accomplices. He claimed he ran the whole fraud by himself and, having admitted his guilt, could not benefit from helping prosecutors gain an exact understanding of how his scheme worked. In a court filing in March, Madoff's lawyers had indicated that Ruth Madoff was entitled to keep as much as 69.0 million in assets that were unrelated to the fraud. In the end, the government will get most of the assets, and Ruth Madoff will be left with a small amount to pay for her living expenses, said Michael Goldberg, a shareholder at Akerman Senterfitt who specializes in unraveling Ponzi schemes. She was not independently wealthy or making money on her own, so any assets she has would be directly traceable to the fraud. Theres virtually no chance that she will be able to keep any significant assets. Madoff could face up to 150 years in prison when he is sentenced in June. On Thursday at least 50 victims sat in a packed U.S. District Courtroom in Manhattan as the disgraced money manager was led off to jail in handcuffs after pleading guilty to masterminding the 65.0 billion Ponzi scheme. (See Bernie Madoffs Billionaire Victims.) In court papers on Friday, lawyers for Bernard Madoff argued that he should be released while he awaits sentencing. The papers detailed the assets and put the net worth of Madoff and his wife at 823.0 million to 826.0 million. Last month, a court-appointed trustee said he had recovered about 946.4 million for former Madoff clients. Thomson Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this article.

It was said that there less than 20 jaguars in the world, one of which was living in the national zoo of Peru. In order to help this jaguar, Peruvians set up a zoo for it, where there were sheep and deer for the jaguar to eat. However, strange enough, no one had ever seen the jaguar hunt the deer and sheep. What they could see was its lying in its cave, sleeping and eating the meat provided by the zoo keepers. At first, people thought that the jaguar felt too lonely, so they found a female tiger to accompany it. However, it did not make too much sense. The jaguar just sometimes went out of its cave with its \\"girlfriend\\" for a while before it came back to its house again' It is normal for the jaguar to be lazy here. Tiger is the king of forest but you simply put some small animals around him. That is why the jaguar shows no interest in going out' a visitor said. So people put five wolves into the jaguar's zoo. Since then, the jaguar did not go back to its cave any more . It either stands on top of the hill yelling or runs up and down the hill without sleeping all day long .

The audience is first given a taste of the demon's powers when shortly before meeting K, she seduces and then kills an employee of the local bar she uses as her hunting ground. Later, during sexual intercourse with a patron of the bar (a closeted homosexual), she transforms into a beast and kills him, horribly. During another seduction (and after having met K) she infects a married man with an incurable, flesh-eating disease before sending him home to his wife who promptly shoots him.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who documented the poaching of buffalo, deer, elk, and antelope for hides? , can you please find it?   There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection.   This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park. The report included letters and attachments by other expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist George Bird Grinnell. Grinnell documented the poaching of...

You see, little one, the scouts in Scoutland always looked forward to this event, because it meant they could show off their amazing skills, and win lots of shiny medals. These scouts really loved to play hard and have a good time. Now, the scouts knew that this particular series was going to be really tough, because all the other teams were practicing super hard too. Every team wanted to win, and nobody was going to make it easy for the others. So, all the little scouts and their friends practiced day and night to get better at their games. They climbed trees, ran like the wind, jumped as high as they could, and solved tricky puzzles. They wanted to get ready for the big day. When the day finally arrived, everybody was super excited. They knew it was going to be a tough series, but they were ready for the challenge. The scouts were certain that if they worked together and played their best, they could win. And so began the great and hard-fought series of games. The scouts had lots of fun competing against each other and cheered for their friends on the other teams as they played their hearts out. In the end, they all learned a valuable lesson: that even though something might be challenging and difficult, as long as they tried their best and never gave up, they could achieve great things.

Sanders's victory follows rising tensions between the two candidates after he questioned Clinton's qualifications to run for president, a remark that snowballed into a weeklong dispute.      He said Wednesday that her super-PAC support, Iraq War vote and support of trade agreements made her unqualified. The campaign doubled down a day later, arguing that Clinton and her allies had insinuated that Sanders himself wasn't qualified to run, but she brushed aside those accusations.      The argument appeared to die down Friday when Sanders said that \\"of course\\" Clinton is qualified.

Even so, he made no gains in Clinton's delegate lead, as each earned seven delegates as a result.      The Vermont senator was favored going into the caucuses. Wyoming is similar to other places he's won with big margins: rural, Western and overwhelmingly white. The victory is Sanders' eighth win out of the last nine contests -- including a contest that counted the votes of Democrats living abroad -- and a big morale booster heading into the crucial New York primary on April 19.      Sanders, speaking at a rally in Queens, New York, when the state's results were projected, announced the victory to his supporters after his wife, Jane, joined him on stage to say they had won.      \\"News bulletin: We just won Wyoming,\\" Sanders said as the room exploded into cheers.      Sanders won 55.7% of the vote to Clinton's 44.3%, giving each candidate seven delegates. That helps Clinton maintain her pledged delegate lead over Sanders, 1,304 to 1,075.      A Clinton campaign aide said their \\"secret sauce\\" in Wyoming was the state's onerous vote-by-mail rules that required anyone voting by mail to have voted as a Democrat in the 2014 midterms.      \\"This is exactly the type of contest he needed to shut us out in,\\" the aide said. \\"Not only did he not do that, he only netted two delegates, if that.\\"      With 55% of remaining delegates in New York, Pennsylvania and California, one senior aide said \\"by the time we get to California, we will only need to meet threshold to win. He can win 85% and we're fine.\\"      Sanders is banking on momentum to keep Clinton from officially clinching the nomination until the convention, when superdelegates will vote.      \\"If you look at the math, if you want to talk about math, the truth is is that it is very, very, very unlikely that either candidate, either Secretary Clinton or Sen. Sanders, will go into the convention with a majority needed of pledged delegates in order to win,\\" Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told CNN's Chris Cuomo on \\"New Day\\" Tuesday.      The Republican National Committee in a statement Saturday afternoon quickly noted Clinton's \\"embarrassing string of defeats,\\" a sign, the RNC said, that Clinton will be beatable if she's the Democratic nominee.      Democrats turn out      Leaving nothing to chance, Sanders spent Tuesday night -- the evening he won Wisconsin's primary -- holding one of his signature large rallies in Laramie, a town of 30,000.      It could be all the attention Wyoming gets in the presidential contest. The rural, sparsely-populated state that's home to former Vice President Dick Cheney is solidly Republican , so Democrats don't spend time trying to win it in the general election.      Saturday morning, Wyoming Democrats jammed into Cheyenne Central High School to caucus.      \\"We're expecting a record turnout throughout the state. There's a lot of excitement,\\" said Aimee Van Cleave, executive director of the state Democratic Party. \\"It's wonderful today. Everyone will be allowed to vote. They're not being stopped by an early spring blizzard.\\"      One group of enthusiastic Sanders partisans broke into a Bernie Sanders song to the tune of \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy.\\"      \\"Elections in America are brought by corporations / Bernie is the only one who uses small donations,\\" they sang, to the accompaniment of an acoustic guitar.      Republicans, meanwhile, are in neighboring Colorado for a party convention where every delegate matters on the road to Cleveland's GOP convention and Donald Trump is trying to clinch the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination.

The Democratic race has taken a sharply bitter turn in New York, where Sanders accused Clinton of \\"hustling money from the wealthy and powerful\\" on Thursday, and Clinton instructing Sanders: \\"Don't make promises you can't keep.\\"      Sanders raised the stakes on Wednesday night, launching into a tirade on why Clinton is \\"not qualified\\" for the presidency by citing her positions on trade and her coziness with Wall Street interests.      \\"I'm not going to get beaten up. I'm not going to get lied about. We will fight back, but I do hope that we can raise the level and I do hope that the media will talk about real issues,\\" he said Thursday in Philadelphia.      Clinton responded with a desire for unity -- to a point. She said that eventually, \\"we're going to have to unify Democrats,\\" pointing to her own support for then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008 after a hard-fought Democratic nominating contest.      Still, Clinton said she's going to \\"keep drawing contrasts\\" with Sanders.      \\"Because that's what elections are about,\\" she said. \\"But I think it is important to tell people about what you're going to do for them, and how you can get it done -- how you can produce results that will make a positive difference in people's lives.\\" |||||","output":"Bernie Sanders has won the Wyoming Democratic caucuses, continuing his recent string of victories and providing his campaign with additional momentum before the crucial New York primary on 19 April. Despite his win, Sanders made no gain on the delegate lead held by Hillary Clinton, with both candidates earning seven delegates as a result. Sanders' victory marks his eighth win out of the last nine contests, including a contest that counted votes of Democrats living abroad. The win serves as a significant morale boost for his campaign heading into the New York primary. Sanders' campaign is banking on the continued momentum to block Clinton from officially securing the nomination until the convention, when superdelegates will vote."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No one in the family seems to know when she started collecting them, or exactly how many she had. My grandmother died just over two years ago. At 91, she had spent 30 years without her right leg, which was removed due to cancer the year I was born. She was a poet, an artist, a food lover and a salt cellar collector. The funny thing about the salts, as she called them -- I never once heard her say salt cellar -- was that although everybody knew they were her hobby and everyone was always searching for them at yard sales or in stores, nobody seemed to know what they meant to her and they just wanted to make her happy. Grandma kept her salts in a dark wooden corner display case in the living room. Since her death the case has remained exactly as she left it. Grandpa tries his best to preserve his memories of her just as they are.  Now I am collecting, too. Collecting memories about my grandmother's hobby, a way she spent her time. And as I hold one of them in my hand, I picture her holding it in her hand on the day she got it. She is smiling. My mother and her two sisters all have small collections, but my mother admits that she was more interested in finding salts to send to Grandma.  Grandma once wrote a poem titled \\"When April Comes\\". The poem contains the line, \\"When April comes and I am not around, remember me when daffodils are found.\\" Now, Grandpa is working on a poem with the line, \\"April came and you were not around\\". But she was, somehow. She was there in the memories left behind by her possessions. Answer:","output":"What was a significant aspect of the grandmother's life mentioned in the article? A.

As their movements become slower and slower, the attractive forces between become stronger.  When we are increasing energy used while running what will happen speed up or slow down? Answer:","output":"When the liquid particles lose energy, their movement slows down even more, reflecting a decrease in kinetic energy. The kinetic energy of a particle is directly related to its speed – as the kinetic energy decreases, the overall speed of the particle decreases as well. The attractive forces between particles play a significant role in the changes occurring within a liquid, as stronger attractive forces lead to greater potential energy. In simpler terms, as particles lose energy and slow down, they are held more tightly by the attractive forces between them. Now, considering the situation when we increase energy used while running, this can be explored by examining the laws of motion and energy conservation. An increase in energy usage when running signifies a greater input of work being done on a body or an object. Work is a transfer of energy, and as per the work-energy theorem, the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. So, when we exert more energy while running, it leads to an increase in the kinetic energy of our body. Since kinetic energy is directly related to the speed or velocity of an object, the effect of increasing energy will lead to an increase in the speed. As we utilize more energy when running, it translates into a faster movement or pace. This accelerated speed comes from the enhanced force applied to overcome air resistance, gravitational forces, and any other factors that act against the motion.  In conclusion, if a person uses more energy when running, their speed will increase as a result. This increase comes from the increased kinetic energy of their body, as the energy expenditure causes a faster pace and quicker motion. Similarly, in the case of liquid particles, when they lose energy, their motion slows down, and the attractive forces between them become stronger."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Vincent Price and Gavin Gordon in The BatCornelia Van Gorder (Agnes Moorehead) is a mystery author who lives in a town terrorized by a mysterious murderer known only as \\"The Bat\\". The Bat is said to be a man with no face who murders women at night by ripping out their throats with steel claws. Early in the film, The Bat enters Van Gorder's house and releases a bat, which bites van Gorder's maid Lizzy (Lenita Lane). With Lizzy in a panic, fearing she may now have contracted \\"the rabies\\", an outbreak of which local papers have reported, Van Gorder calls her doctor, Dr Malcolm Wells (Vincent Price), who is conducting research on bats.Meanwhile, the whole town is searching for a million-dollar stash of looted bank securities that were recently stolen. Dr. Wells discovers the location of the treasure when the thief confides in him. Wells then murders the thief in cold blood, presumably so that he can take the treasure for himself, which he believes to be hidden in van Gorder's house.A series of break-ins and murders by The Bat brings the local chief of detectives, Andy Anderson (Gavin Gordon) to the Van Gorder house. The Bat then murders two people in the Van Gorder house, Mark Fleming (John Bryant) and Judy Hollander (Darla Hood). Anderson attempts to determine the identity of The Bat, suspecting both Wells and Van Gorder's new butler, Warner (John Sutton). Wells is removed from suspicion, however, when he is murdered by The Bat in his lab.Van Gorder cleverly manages to capture The Bat inside the secret room in her house.

Please answer the following question: This article: The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\"  Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose illness led to his death?, what is it ?

Question: During what word event did the Holocaust happen? Is \\"The Holocaust (which roughly means \\"burnt whole\\") was the deliberate and systematic murder of millions of Jews and other \\"unwanted\\" during World War II by the Nazi regime in Germany.\\" the correct answer? OPTIONS: [+] yes; [+] no;","output":"Yes, the statement you provided is correct. The Holocaust happened during World War II, taking place from 1941 to 1945. It was orchestrated by the Nazis, led by Adolf Hitler, with the goal of exterminating certain groups of people, mainly Jews, but also including Roma (Gypsies), Poles, Slavs, Soviet prisoners of war, disabled individuals, and LGBTQ+ populations, among others. The Holocaust was among the most devastating and darkest events in human history, resulting in the systematic persecution, and ultimately the deaths, of approximately six million Jews, as well as millions of others from different groups. The event was carried out through various stages and methods. At first, people deemed \\"undesirable\\" by the Nazis were disenfranchised, losing their rights and being subjected to pervasive discrimination. During the war, these individuals were forced to live in ghettos, isolated areas surrounded by walls or fences, where they were deprived of their basic needs. The Holocaust worsened when Nazi Germany decided to intensify its efforts and escalate its genocidal activities known as \\"the Final Solution to the Jewish Question.\\" This plan, led by Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Eichmann, involved the construction and operation of extermination camps where millions were systematically murdered, mostly in gas chambers. These camps, such as Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, Sobibor, Belzec, Chelmno, and Majdanek, were established in Germany-occupied Poland and other regions, resulting in the rapid increase of Jewish and other targeted victims. Apart from the extermination camps, millions were executed through mass shootings, forced labor, starvation, and other forms of mistreatment in concentration camps and ghettos. Throughout the Holocaust, diverse resistance movements emerged, with people fighting back through armed struggle, spiritual resistance, or rescuing targeted populations. The Holocaust came to an end in 1945 with the defeat of Nazi Germany. However, the lasting effects of this genocide continue to be felt by those who survived and the global community as a whole. The Holocaust serves as a critical reminder of the importance of promoting tolerance, understanding, and respect for the inherent dignity and rights of all human beings.

Joe started the no-till gardening method, while Kat applied conventional gardening methods.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which gardener didn't increase predator population?  Hint: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.

Possible A: injury, being laughed at, breaking the glass, contact with, lacerations  Why is \\"lacerations\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Lacerations\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because when a person falls onto a pile of broken glass, their most immediate and rational concern would be about the potential physical harm that the sharp and jagged edges of the glass can cause. Lacerations refer to deep cuts or tears in the skin or flesh, which are highly likely to occur in such a situation.  From the given options, \\"injury\\" and \\"contact with\\" are also reasonable answers, as they too relate to the potential harm or danger that can result when someone falls onto broken glass. However, \\"being laughed at\\" and \\"breaking the glass\\" are less aligned with human common sense as they focus on secondary concerns rather than the immediate risk of injury.

If you're buying packaged weisswurst, read the cooking instructions to determine if you should fully cook the sausages. Since many packaged weisswurst are precooked, you can simply toss them onto a medium-heat grill. Cover the grill and cook the weisswurst until they're completely hot throughout. Turn the weisswurst occasionally and grill them for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve the hot weisswurst. Avoid poking the weisswurst casing with a fork, knife or tongs to prevent the flavorful liquid inside the sausage from leaking. Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for medium-heat. Brush the grill grate with vegetable oil, so the sausages don't stick to the grill. Place the weisswurst on the grill over indirect heat. Cover the grill and let the weisswurst cook until they reach 140 °F (60 °C). Frequently turn the sausages and spray them with a little water or beer, so they brown evenly and don't split. Remove the cooked weisswurst from the grill and transfer them to a serving plate. Lay a sheet of aluminum foil over the sausages and let them rest for 5 minutes. They'll finish cooking and then you can serve the hot weisswurst. You can store leftover grilled weisswurst in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\" have sense organs to smell and taste chemicals\\" is \\"humans\\", given that  frogs have sense organs to smell and taste chemicals? Answer:","output":"The right answer to the question \\"have sense organs to smell and taste chemicals\\" is not limited to just humans or frogs, as a considerable number of living organisms possess sense organs that allow them to detect, smell, and taste chemicals in their environments. In fact, it is a common biological adaptation across numerous species. In the case of humans, the sense of smell (olfaction) is facilitated by the olfactory system, which includes the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb. The sense of taste (gustation) in humans, on the other hand, is facilitated by the taste buds on the tongue, which contain receptor cells that respond to specific chemicals in food and beverages. Frogs also possess similar sense organs that allow them to detect chemicals in their environment. They have nasal cavities and specialized taste organs called \\"taste buds\\" on their tongues and other parts of the mouth. These taste-receptor cells help frogs identify food and avoid harmful or toxic substances. Thus, both humans and frogs, along with numerous other animal species, have sense organs that respond to chemicals. Using the phrase \\"organisms with sense organs to smell and taste chemicals\\" would be a more accurate and inclusive answer, given that the presence of such sense organs is not exclusive to only humans or frogs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fact 2: An electrical current is a flow of electrons.  Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"when a circuit is working properly, what runs through that circuit?\\" with the following options:  - coils  - direct energy  - electromagnetic energy  - conductors  - h2o  - activation energy  - hydrogen and oxygen  - flow of electrons A:","output":"When a circuit is working properly, a \\"flow of electrons\\" runs through that circuit. This statement can be explained with reference to the provided facts. Fact 1 states that \\"when an electrical circuit is working properly, electrical current runs through that circuit\\". According to conventional understanding, an electrical current is constituted by the flow of electric charge, which is essentially disseminated by moving electrons within the circuit.  Fact 2 further corroborates this by explicitly defining an electrical current as a \\"flow of electrons\\". Hence, this understanding aligns with the conventional comprehension of how electrical circuits operate. In an electrical circuit, the element that moves is essentially the electric charge within the objects, and not the other components. This movement is feasible due to the presence of free moving electrons -- particularly in conductive materials -- that shift from one location to another under the influence of an electric field, facilitating the flow of electrical current.  To further detail, an electrical circuit is a closed path or a loop within which an electric current flows. This circuit comprises components such as conductors (which facilitates the 'flow of electrons'), loads (like a light bulb or a motor which utilize the energy carried by the electrons), and a power source (like a battery or a generator which produces the electrical energy). So when we say the circuit is working properly, it implies that the electrical energy is being efficiently transformed into other forms of energy like light, heat, motion etc. according to the needs of the device in use. In comparison to the other options – \\"coils\\", \\"direct energy\\", \\"electromagnetic energy\\", \\"conductors\\", \\"H2O\\", \\"activation energy\\", and \\"hydrogen and oxygen\\" – the accurate statement is the \\"flow of electrons\\". It's because as per the provided facts, coils, conductors, hydrogen and oxygen, or H2O are not 'what runs through the circuit', but rather they are components or factors that could influence how the 'flow of electrons', is achieved or controlled in the circuit. On the other hand, direct energy, activation energy, or electromagnetic energy are forms which the electrical energy (carried by the 'flow of electrons') may be converted to, depending upon the kind of load or device the circuit is catering to."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A former police officer and his lover plotted to conceive a baby so they could abuse it and share it with other paedophiles, a court heard. Alexander McCracken, 35, shared fantasies of raping and murdering newborn babies with his then-girlfriend Sharon Campbell and said he would 'deffo rape a little baby girl'. Police found more than 500 hardcore child porn and bestiality images when they raided his home in Ayr, many of which were passed on to other paedophiles. The pair are now facing jail after admitting three charges of possessing and distributing indecent images of children at Ayr Sheriff Court. Former police officer Alexander McCracken, 35, (pictured) shared fantasies of raping and murdering newborn babies said he would 'deffo rape a little baby girl' McCracken, who has a 10-year-old son, spent nine years with Strathclyde Police before being exposed in 2010 as a swinger and a £400-a-night bisexual prostitute, the Daily Record reported. Police seized his computer and smartphone in last year's raid and found a string of sickening messages including one which suggests they breed a 'baby toy' and abuse it 'as soon as born'. One, from a user linked to McCracken's computer, says: 'Oh would deffo rape a little baby girl.' When asked if his girlfriend would let him, the reply was: 'It's the wife typing lol. I would help him lol.' The usernames 'sleazyperv79' and 'NepicoupleUK' were linked to the computer and mobile used by McCracken. During one exchange, 'sleazyperv79' wrote: 'Three month old getting molesting … I hope he snuffed her eventually.' John Bradford, prosecuting, said: 'The chat indicates that the user has a predilection to violently sexually abuse these infants to death, or allow others do do so. He exchanged sickening messages with his former girlfriend Sharon Campbell and they are both now facing jail. The pair are  facing jail after admitting three charges of possessing and distributing indecent images of children at Ayr Sheriff Court (pictured) 'The communications include content of a paedophilic nature, comments on the rape and killing of newborn babies and what purports to be a couple trying for a baby so that they can sexually abuse her.' He revealed that cybercrime experts found 551 such images in Yahoo Messenger chat files after the raid in January last year. The majority of the images were category five, the most depraved possible and most were passed among paedophiles between July 2012 and October 2013. Mr  Bradford said: 'The images are predominantly of young girls, with the majority being newborn, babies and toddlers with a few up to about the age of eight.' Police were alerted to the couple's actions by the National Online Child Abuse Protection service. Campbell, 39, who was a support worker for elderly people with mental health problems at a care home in Ayr, is no longer with McCracken. Her lawyer, Peter Lockhart, said: 'This is a frankly shocking and appalling offence and she recognises that. She has co-operated fully throughout and there is no getting away from it that a custodial sentence must be uppermost in your mind.' McCracken's lawyer Jill Malloy said he complied fully with strict bail conditions and had no unsupervised contact with females under 16 and no internet use where history could be hidden. She added that he had lost his job as a factory production worker. Sheriff Scott Pattison called for reports before sentencing next month. He said: 'These offences are of the utmost seriousness. You are fortunate you have been prosecuted in the sheriff court.' The usernames 'sleazyperv79' and 'NepicoupleUK' were linked to the computer and mobile used by Alexander McCracken. Computer experts found apps including Internet Relay Chat, Yahoo Messenger and Gigatribe had been used. One message, from a user linked to McCracken's computer, says: 'Oh would deffo rape a little baby girl.' When asked if his girlfriend would let him, the reply was: 'It's the wife typing lol.

PUBLISHED:. 20:01 EST, 26 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 05:52 EST, 27 November 2013. Andrew Mitchell launched an astonishing attack on the Metropolitan Police over the Plebgate affair last night – after a 12-month inquiry concluded there was insufficient evidence that a Number 10 police officer had lied. The former Tory chief whip named PC Toby Rowland – with whom he clashed in Downing Street – branding him a serial liar and demanding that he repeat his claims that he used the word ‘plebs’ on oath. Mr Mitchell flatly denies claims by the officer that he used the word after he was stopped cycling through the street’s gates last September. Andrew Mitchell (pictured with his wife Dr Sharon Bennett) has said he ntends to bring PC Rowland to 'justice' and re-instate his reputation. His denunciation came as prosecutors yesterday decided a single officer should face trial following a mammoth police investigation, which involved taking more than 1,100 statements. PC Keith Wallis, 53, was charged with misconduct in a public office over allegations he falsely claimed he witnessed the row. Five officers from the Met’s Diplomatic Protection Group, including Wallis, will now face gross misconduct hearings for discreditable conduct, meaning they could lose their jobs. Three others will face less serious disciplinary proceedings. related]. But, crucially, the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to show that PC Rowland, 43, lied about what had happened. Nor is he facing a misconduct inquiry. Mr Mitchell claimed the police had failed to even interview PC Rowland as a suspect about what happened. And he accused Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe of prematurely clearing his officers of wrongdoing. Mr Mitchell said: ‘PC Toby Rowland, who was responsible for writing those toxic phrases into his notebook, was not telling the truth. 'I will seek to say this on oath in a court of law and it is our intention to ensure that PC Toby Rowland has similarly to swear his account. ‘I understand that PC Toby Rowland has not been arrested or even interviewed under criminal caution during the police inquiry.’ The former Tory chief whip named PC Toby Rowland - with whom he clashed in Downing Street - branding him a serial liar and demanding that he repeat his claims that he used the word 'plebs' on oath. In a statement, PC Rowland said last night: ‘I stand by my account of events in Downing Street on 19th September 2012. 'This has now been thoroughly investigated and the CPS has confirmed there is insufficient evidence to take any criminal proceedings against me. ‘In addition, neither am I subject to any disciplinary proceedings. 'I confirm that I am prepared to give evidence under oath if required.’ Mr Mitchell is suing The Sun newspaper, which printed the original report, for libel and said he believed the paper would have to call PC Rowland to corroborate the paper’s account, forcing him to give evidence on oath. Scotland Yard said PC Rowland was interviewed under ‘police misconduct regulations’ – not under police caution. But it added his statement could have been used against him had he been charged with criminal or internal disciplinary offences. The announcement by new Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders fell far short of the result that Mr Mitchell had sought if he is to resume his cabinet career. She said: ‘We have considered all of the evidence in this case, including previously unseen, unedited CCTV footage from Downing Street, not referred to by the media. 'Taking it all into account, including the accounts of the officer at the gate of Downing Street and that of Andrew Mitchell MP before, during and after the incident, we have found that there is insufficient evidence to show that the officer at the gate lied in his account. ‘The CPS has also found that there is insufficient evidence to show that Mr Mitchell was the victim of a conspiracy of misinformation.’ Her lawyers also found that a jury would be likely to decide that the leaking of an email in the affair was in the public interest, a finding that could undermine Mr Mitchell’s attempt to sue the Sun. Sir Bernard said: ‘This investigation has been a ruthless search for the truth as at the heart of this are extremely damaging allegations that officers have lied and falsified statements against a Cabinet Minister.’ A Channel 4 documentary into the Plebgate affair has been called into question by the new head of the Crown Prosecution Service. Last December’s programme – hailed by Andrew Mitchell and his supporters – appeared to cast doubt on the officers’ account of what happened. It revealed CCTV footage which showed there was not a large group of tourists outside the main gate of Downing Street at the time of the altercation as had originally been claimed. Mr Mitchell at the gate where he clashed with the officer. He flatly denies claims that he used the word after he was stopped cycling through the street's gates last September. But Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders, who succeeded Keir Starmer QC earlier this month, said the programme ‘showed edited footage that was less than clear in a number of regards’. She said in her 1,800-word statement on Plebgate: ‘Much of the press reporting to date has assumed that the CCTV recordings show that the gate officer lied about the words used during the incident. ‘The CCTV footage that has been aired publicly was edited and did not show the full picture. ‘We have been supplied with previously unseen and unedited footage of the incident from five different cameras. The CCTV footage does not determine the issue completely as it could be consistent with either the accounts of the officer on the gate or Mr Mitchell. ‘It is clear from the footage that there was sufficient time for the words to have been said either as described by the gate officer or as described by Mr Mitchell, and this has been confirmed by an expert.’ A Channel 4 spokesman defended its journalism on Plebgate. He said: ‘The CCTV footage was obtained by Andrew Mitchell from Downing Street and provided to Dispatches and Channel  4 News. The footage as broadcast for the first time on 18th December 2012 was not edited by the production team to change or alter the sequence of events. ‘Furthermore the three camera angles that we were provided with were image-matched frame by frame to confirm their veracity. We stand fully behind this investigation.’ At his televised press conference yesterday, Mr Mitchell made clear his appreciation of the Channel 4 documentary, and selected Michael Crick, Channel 4 News’s political correspondent – with whom he enjoys a strong professional relationship – to ask him the first question from the floor. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"1.

Cells are the most basic structural and functional units in biological systems, and they play a crucial role in various life processes, such as growth, development, reproduction, and adaptation. Understanding cells allow us to decipher the inner workings of living beings and gain insights into various aspects of biology, including evolution, genetics, and physiology. 2. \\"Smallest units\\": This phrase highlights the microscopic nature of cells and emphasizes their position as the most basic components of living organisms. By calling them the \\"smallest units,\\" the sentence conveys that cells are indivisible, and no further substructures exist when considering an organism's basic structure and function. This notion is essential as it sets the foundation for various cellular concepts, such as cell division and differentiation, which are critical for the growth and development of organisms. 3. \\"Organism\\": The term \\"organism\\" refers to an individual living being, including animals, plants, fungi, and microorganisms. Organisms consist of various organ systems, tissues, and cells that work together to maintain their survival, growth, and reproduction. By mentioning \\"organism\\" in this sentence, it establishes the connection between cellular biology and the broader study of life processes in more complex structures.

Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \\"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, \\"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions\\".\\",  answer the following question.

Half the birds were juveniles  of about three months in age that had never migrated before, while the other half were adults that had made the round trip to their wintering site in the south-western United States at least once.

There was just one problem - she needed to lose 5st to fit into the A-line dress. Kirsty  weighed 15st 4lb and was a size 16 when she spotted the dress but discovered it was only made in a size 8. Scroll down for video. Kirsty, pictured before her weight loss, says she has also gained weight easily. Kirsty pictured in her dream size eight wedding dress on her special day in May this year. Determined Kirsty bought the dress anyway - and amazingly managed to lose all the weight ahead of her big day. Kirsty, 25, said: 'When I saw the dress, I just knew that I had to have it. 'The fact that it was only available in a size 8 was just the incentive I needed to really transform my life and get back into shape. 'I wanted a wedding album that I could be proud of and I knew the only way I was going to be able to achieve my goal was to fit into that dress.' Kirsty, from Maesteg, Bridgend, said: 'I had always put on a weight quite easily and needed to be careful what I ate. A chronic snacker, on a bad day Kirsty would eat whole pack of Jaffa Cakes. Kirsty was so overweight she found it difficult at times to keep balance and kept falling. 'I am the type of person who can easily put on 4lb over the course of a weekend if eating lots of fattening things and having ice cream for dessert. 'I noticed my weight creeping up and obviously that affected my general self-esteem. 'I put on a lot of weight after the birth of my eldest son. You are told when you are pregnant that you can eat for two, but that is a complete myth. 'You only need a few more calories in the very late stages of the pregnancy but otherwise you should just eat as you would normally. 'I put on a stone and a half throughout the pregnancy and I didn't lose it after my son was born.' She was so overweight she found it difficult at times to keep balance and kept falling. Her doctor said the falls were because of her weight. Kirsty's final trigger which encouraged to knuckle down and diet was a holiday in the Dominican Republic. Switching to a healthier low-fat diet, cutting out the snacking and beginning to exercise saw the pounds fall off. The final trigger which encouraged her to knuckle down and diet was a holiday in the Dominican Republic. Kirsty said: 'I remember walking down the beach and being approached by a group of women who were all in great shape and looked amazing in their bikinis. 'I felt so self-conscious because I was so badly out of shape and could see they were looking at me. I knew I had to change.' Mother-of-two Kirsty had bought the dress last August and when she finally tied the knot in May this year - just nine months later - she was a shapely size 8 weighing just 9st 12lb. She had lost a staggering 76lb, or 5st 4lb, - more than half a stone a month - and got the body she had always wanted. Kirsty achieved this feat by completely changing her diet and exercising regularly. She had previously snacked throughout the day and was incapable of just having one of her favourite Jaffa Cakes - on a bad day, she could munch her way through a whole packet. Kirsty was able to fit into her dream dress just nine months after buying it four sizes too small. Her other downfall was bread - she would eat five or six slices alongside her evening meal. Kirsty switched to a healthier low-fat diet, cut out the snacking and started eating low-calorie bread. She also started taking Forza Supplements Raspberry K2 capsules which she says helped take the edge off her appetite at weak moments and gave her extra energy to exercise more. And if she ever needed an extra incentive to carry on with the diet, she just looked at the white dress in the cupboard and dreamed of the day she would be able to fit into it. Kirsty said she felt like a new woman as she got back into shape. She said: 'Once I put my mind to it, I found it quite straightforward. Kirsty says her wedding day was the 'happiest' of her life and that she loved looking at the pictures afterwards. 'The Forza Raspberry K2 capsules were a big help. I started walking a lot and they gave me real energy and helped me to get out more.' At the end of her weight loss journey Kirsty was finally at the right weight to fit into her wedding dress. 'It meant so much to me,' she said. 'The dress fitted me perfectly and looked just as wonderful when I had bought it as a size 16 all those months ago. 'My wedding day was the happiest of my life and I loved looking at the pictures afterwards. 'I had the wedding album I had always dreamed of.'

Primal Scream are a Scottish rock band originally formed in 1982 in Glasgow by Bobby Gillespie (vocals) and Jim Beattie. The current lineup consists of Gillespie, Andrew Innes (guitar), Martin Duffy (keyboards), Simone Butler (bass) and Darrin Mooney (drums). Barrie Cadogan has toured and recorded with the band since 2006 as a replacement after the departure of guitarist Robert \\"Throb\\" Young. The band performed throughout 1982-1984, but their career did not take off until Gillespie left his position as drummer of The Jesus and Mary Chain. The band were first introduced to the acid house scene by McGee in 1988. They were at first sceptical; Gillespie said: \\"I always remember being quite fascinated by it but not quite getting it.\\" The band quickly developed a taste for it and began attending raves. The band met up with DJ Andrew Weatherall at a rave, and he was given a copy of \\"I'm Losing More Than I'll Ever Have\\", a track from Primal Scream, to remix for one of his shows. Weatherall added a drum loop from an Italian bootleg mix of Edie Brickell's \\"What I Am\\", a sample of Gillespie singing a line from Robert Johnson's \\"Terraplane Blues\\" and the central introductory sample from the Peter Fonda B-movie The Wild Angels. The resulting track, \\"Loaded\\", became the band's first major hit, reaching number 16 on the UK Singles Chart. This was followed by another single, \\"Come Together\\", which reached number 19.  The band entered the studio with Weatherall, Hugo Nicolson, The Orb and Jimmy Miller producing, and Martin Duffy now full-time on keyboards. They released two more singles, \\"Higher Than The Sun\\" and \\"Don't Fight It, Feel It\\" which featured the lead vocals of Manchester singer Denise Johnson, both of which were successful. The album, Screamadelica, was released in late 1991 to positive reviews. Ink Blot Magazine said that the album was \\"both of its time and timeless.\\" The album was also a commercial success, reaching number eight on the UK chart. The album won the first Mercury Music Prize, beating Gillespie's former band The Jesus and Mary Chain.  The supporting tour kicked off in Amsterdam, and it included a performance at the Glastonbury festival before coming to an end in Sheffield. Throughout the tour the band and their increasingly large entourage gained notoriety for their large narcotic intake. Around this time, the band recorded the Dixie Narco EP.

Article: / Updated By Courtney Kube and Mary Emily O'Hara      Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning walked out of a military prison early Wednesday after seven years behind bars.      Manning's 35-year sentence for leaking an enormous trove of military intelligence records was commuted by President Barack Obama in January.      At the time, the White House said Manning had accepted responsibility, expressed remorse and served time.      A U.S Army official confirmed to NBC News that she was released from Fort Leavenworth military prison at around 3 a.m. ET.      Manning made her first statement as a free woman on Wednesday, according to a statement sent out by the ACLU.      \\"After another anxious four months of waiting, the day has finally arrived,\\" said Manning. \\"I am looking forward to so much! Whatever is ahead of me is far more important than the past. I’m figuring things out right now — which is exciting, awkward, fun, and all new for me.\\"      She also uploaded the first photo taken of her in years, a snapshot of her shoes that she posted to a brand-new Instagram account.      A few hours later, Manning's dreams of finally eating a slice of pizza came true.      Pfc. Manning, 29, will remain an active-duty soldier in the U.S. Army, but she won't be paid a salary and it's highly unlikely that she will be called to serve. However, her \\"excess leave\\" status will legally entitle her to military medical care, along with commissary privileges.      The Crescent, Oklahoma, native tweeted after being granted clemency that she plans to move to Maryland. Neither she nor her attorneys explained why, but she has an aunt who lives there.      Manning, a former intelligence analyst in Iraq, is still appealing her conviction in a case that could take years. The government has yet to respond to the appeal.      \\"She is looking forward to eating pizza, swimming, playing PlayStation and meeting the many friends who have supported her over the years\\"      Then known as Bradley Manning, she leaked nearly 750,000 military files and cables to WikiLeaks aged 22. The materials included battlefield video.      Manning said she wanted to expose what she considered to be the U.S. military's disregard of the effects of war on civilians and that she released information that she didn't believe would harm the U.S. No document was classified higher than secret and her defenders say no one was endangered by the leaks.      Critics said the leaks laid bare some of the nation's most-sensitive secrets and endangered information sources, prompting the State Department to help some of those people move to protect their safety. Several ambassadors were recalled, expelled or reassigned because of embarrassing disclosures.      Manning was court-martialed and sentenced in 2013 to 35 years in prison.      In a statement given to NBC's TODAY the day after sentencing, Manning came out as a transgender woman.      Manning said in a statement released by her attorneys last week that she was looking forward to being released from Fort Leavenworth.      People hold signs calling for Chelsea Manning's release during a gay pride parade in San Francisco on June 28, 2015. Elijah Nouvelage / Reuters, file      “For the first time, I can see a future for myself as Chelsea,\\" she said. \\"I can imagine surviving and living as the person who I am and can finally be in the outside world. Freedom used to be something that I dreamed of but never allowed myself to fully imagine.\\"      Manning's ACLU attorney and transgender advocate, Chase Strangio, told NBC News that the current focus is on \\"building her life\\" once she steps out of prison.      \\"She is looking forward to eating pizza, swimming, playing PlayStation and meeting the many friends who have supported her over the years but who were never allowed to visit in person,\\" Strangio said. \\"Beyond that, she is waiting to experience life outside of prison before declaring any future plans. After so many years of government control over her body and gender, I know she is eager to grow her hair, express her gender and negotiate decisions on her own terms.\\"      Manning attempted suicide twice last year — once in July, another in November — while imprisoned in Kansas. She also began a hunger strike last September over what she says was the lack of treatment she was receiving for her gender dysphoria.      The Department of Defense has repeatedly declined to discuss Manning's treatment in prison.      Two fundraising projects are underway, with supporters raising money to fund Manning’s transition from prison back to civilian life. On GoFundMe.com, over 150,000 had been raised by Wednesday to pay for “rent, utilities, health care, clothing, and other living expenses for the first year.”      Also on Wednesday, a group of musicians released a benefit album called Hugs For Chelsea. The compilation was created by transgender songwriter Evan Greer, and features high-profile artists from rock, indie, hip-hop, and punk genres. Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth), Graham Nash (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young), Talib Kweli, Against Me!, Mirah, Amanda Palmer, and others contributed songs to the 25 release, with REM’s Michael Stipe posting a short video on Twitter to encourage people to purchase it online.      However, not everyone thinks Manning deserved to be freed.      President Donald Trump, days before being inaugurated, wrote on Twitter that Manning is \\"TRAITOR ... who should never have been released from prison.\\"      House Speaker Paul Ryan said at the time that Obama's decision was \\"outrageous.\\"      He added: \\"Chelsea Manning's treachery put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation's most sensitive secrets.\\" ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What next for Chelsea Manning after release?      US soldier Chelsea Manning is celebrating her freedom after being released from military prison.      Manning took to Twitter after her release, photographing her \\"first steps of freedom\\" in civilian clothes.      In a brief statement, she said she was focused on the future, which \\"is far more important than the past\\".      She served seven years of a 35-year sentence for leaking hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables and military files to Wikileaks.      Most of her sentence was commuted by then-US President Barack Obama in January.      In a statement issued through the American Civil Liberties Union, which provided her with legal support, Manning said: \\"After another anxious four months of waiting, the day has finally arrived. I am looking forward to so much!\\"      She added: \\"Whatever is ahead of me is far more important than the past. I'm figuring things out right now - which is exciting, awkward, fun, and all new for me.\\"      A US Army spokesperson confirmed that she left Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in the early morning.

A day after she was sentenced to 35 years in prison in 2013, Manning said she had felt female since childhood and wanted to live as a woman called Chelsea.      \\"For the first time, I can see a future for myself as Chelsea,\\" she said in a statement last week ahead of her release. \\"I can imagine surviving and living as the person who I am and can finally be in the outside world.\\"      Speaking to the BBC, Manning's friend, the journalist Glenn Greenwald - who was involved in the publication of leaks from Edward Snowden - said she faced a difficult life outside prison.      \\"She's going to live in a country where the top officials have expressed extreme denunciations of her, condemnations of her, who regard her as a traitor,\\" he said.      \\"But the reality is that if you look back at what it is that she achieved, she revealed unquestionable war crimes, her disclosures led to reforms around the world.\\"      President Obama's decision to commute her sentence drew criticism from leading Republicans, including Senator John McCain, who called it a \\"a grave mistake\\".      'Back to Maryland'      Manning was convicted of 20 charges in connection with the leaks, including espionage. She was acquitted of the most serious charge, aiding the enemy.      She defended the leaking by saying she had wanted to spark a public debate in the US about the role of the military and US foreign policy, but later apologised for \\"hurting the US\\", saying she had mistakenly believed she could \\"change the world for the better\\".      In January she tweeted that she wanted to move to Maryland after being released, a state where she previously lived.      On Monday she tweeted: \\"Two more days until the freedom of civilian life ^_^ Now hunting for private #healthcare like millions of Americans =P\\".      Manning will remain on active army duty while her military court conviction remains under appeal. She will have healthcare benefits but will be unpaid, the army says.      An online campaign set up by her attorney has raised 150,000 (£115,725) to pay for her living expenses for the first year after her release.      If the appeal is denied, she could be dishonourably discharged from the army, US media say.

Justin wants to learn how to flip a pancake so he asks Robert for an advice, because","output":"Robert is well-known for his expertise in the culinary world, particularly when it comes to making and flipping pancakes. Justin approaches Robert, eager to learn from the best. Robert, ever the humble mentor, is more than happy to teach Justin the art of flipping a pancake. To start, Robert offers Justin an introduction to the essential tools and ingredients needed for the perfect pancake. They review the basics, discussing the required ingredients such as flour, milk, eggs, butter, and salt, as well as the importance of a non-stick pan and the correct mixing techniques to prevent lumps in the batter. Justin is a quick learner, so they soon progress to the practical aspect of making the pancake batter. Under Robert's guidance, Justin quickly masters the perfect pour, creating an even layer of batter in the pan, which is heated gently. Robert teaches him how to shake the pan gently so that the batter spreads out evenly, ensuring an even cook with no overly thick or thin areas. Robert tells Justin that the key to a successful pancake flip is all about timing and confidence. Once the edges of the pancake begin to turn golden brown and small bubbles start forming on the surface, Justin knows it's time to gear up for the flip. Using a spatula, Robert demonstrates how to gently lift the edges of the pancake just enough to loosen it from the pan. Now comes the exciting part – the flip itself. Robert explains that the trick is to give the pan a gentle yet swift flick of the wrist, propelling the pancake upward and allowing it to make a full 180-degree turn before landing back in the pan. Justin watches in awe as Robert makes it seem effortless, the pancake floating gracefully through the air before landing perfectly, golden side up, back in the pan. With excitement and determination, Justin attempts his first flip. He follows Robert's advice to the tee, but his nerves get the better of him, and his pancake lands slightly off-center, folding onto itself. Robert encourages Justin not to be disheartened and reminds him that practice makes perfect. Justin, not one to back down from a challenge, tries again. After a few more attempts, Justin finally manages to flip his pancake with confidence. It's not as graceful as Robert's, but the sense of accomplishment is evident on his face. With each subsequent flip, Justin gains even more confidence, and his technique begins to show the poise and precision of a true pancake flipper. Robert offers further advice on how to ensure the pancake is cooked through, suggesting that it's important to pay attention to the smell and the color of the pancake. Once the second side is golden brown and it gives off a warm, buttery aroma, it's time to remove the pancake from the pan and begin the process all over again. In no time, Justin and Robert have a stack of delicious, perfectly flipped pancakes, ready to be enjoyed with their favorite toppings. As they sit down to savor their homemade feast, Justin can't help but feel a deep sense of gratitude for his newfound skill, knowing that it was Robert's patience and guidance that made it all possible. As they continue to chat and laugh, Robert shares more of his culinary secrets with Justin, discussing the various cuisines he's experienced and the dishes he's created over the years. Inspired by his newfound passion, Justin resolves to continue learning from Robert, embracing the art of cooking as a valuable life skill. In the weeks and months that follow, under Robert's mentorship, Justin ventures beyond pancakes and learns to prepare all sorts of dishes, each one more intricate and impressive than the last. The two develop a strong bond through their shared love for cooking, and Justin soon becomes an accomplished chef in his own right, thanks in no small part to Robert's unwavering support and expertise. At the end of this culinary journey, Justin's initial desire to learn how to flip a pancake has transformed into so much more, fostering a lifelong friendship and a passion for cooking that will forever influence his approach to creating and enjoying food."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process: - Kidneys filter waste out of blood - Composition of blood is regulated - Volume of water in blood is kept constant - PH is kept at a constant level - Kidneys help regulate blood pressure - Kidneys stimulate the making of red blood cells - Calcium levels are maintained.  Question: suppose You take more antibiotics to cure your infection happens, how will it affect \\"Kidneys function more poorly\\".  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"When you take more antibiotics than prescribed or necessary to cure an infection, it can negatively impact your kidneys by causing them to function more poorly. Antibiotics are drugs designed to target and eliminate bacterial infections in the body, but they can also have harmful effects on other systems like the kidneys. Here's a detailed explanation of how this can happen and how it influences the second effect you mentioned, which is the regulation of blood composition: 1. Antibiotics filtering through the kidneys: When you consume antibiotics, they eventually get filtered through the kidneys as they work to remove waste products from the blood. Although antibiotics are metabolized and broken down in the liver, their metabolites and unmetabolized portions still need to pass through the kidneys to be excreted in urine. When you take a higher dosage than required, it means that your kidneys will need to filter out greater amounts of these drugs which can put additional stress on the kidneys, causing them to function more poorly. 2. Nephrotoxic effects: Some antibiotics are known to be nephrotoxic, meaning they can damage the kidneys while performing their intended functions. When you take more antibiotics than necessary, the risk of nephrotoxic effects increases. This can lead to acute kidney injury or more severe chronic kidney damage, ultimately affecting their ability to filter waste out of the blood efficiently. Regarding the second effect (regulation of blood composition) being influenced by the supposed perturbation (kidneys functioning more poorly due to higher antibiotic intake): Less Effectiveness in Blood Composition Regulation: As the kidneys' function declines due to the overuse of antibiotics, their ability to regulate blood composition may be compromised. Kidneys are responsible for maintaining an appropriate balance of water, electrolytes, and minerals in the bloodstream. If the kidneys are damaged or functioning poorly due to excessive antibiotic intake, their ability to maintain this crucial balance may diminish, resulting in less effective regulation of blood composition. In conclusion, taking more antibiotics than necessary to cure an infection can negatively affect your kidneys by causing them to function more poorly. This poor kidney function has a subsequent negative impact on the regulation of blood composition, making it less effective. It is essential to follow proper dosage recommendations and only take antibiotics when prescribed by a healthcare professional to avoid these potential harmful effects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

George O'Hearn","output":"Title: Unraveling O'Hearn Genre: Drama/Mystery Introduction: The film introduces David Kepesh, a respected college professor and accomplished writer, who leads a seemingly perfect life. David and his closest friend, George O'Hearn, meet regularly to catch up over coffee and discuss their latest literary ventures. George, a lovable and witty man, captures the interest and respect of anyone he encounters. David admires George's unique outlook on life, and the two have been inseparable since the day they met. Act I: The story takes a turn when a shocking discovery is made about George O'Hearn. A student obtaining a copy of George's latest novel, \\"The Garden of Betrayal,\\" is accidentally given access to files containing classified government information. The student, who is ironically one of David's brightest proteges, uncovers evidence that George O'Hearn works as a mole for a foreign espionage agency. David struggles to process the revelation, as this puts a strain on their friendship and challenges his principles. An internal battle ensues as David grapples with the choice to confront George with this newfound information or approach the authorities. Act II: David, conflicted by his loyalty to George but determined to know the truth, takes it upon himself to investigate the matter. He covertly begins digging into George's past. This endeavor leads David down a rabbit hole of the underground world of spies, lies, and government corruption. David learns about the enigmatic handler, referred to as \\"The Puppetmaster,\\" who has been guiding George's actions. As David delves deeper, he realizes that George is not the only mole in their circle and that every individual has their reasons for getting entangled in the web of espionage. Act III: Despite his love for George, David finally confronts his friend, accusing him of betraying their country and jeopardizing their friendship. George, now aware that his cover may soon be blown, reveals that he had been working on an operation designed to expose and dismantle an enemy plot. \\"The Garden of Betrayal,\\" George's novel, is a cover for his real mission: unraveling the corruption that has seeped into the highest levels of the national intelligence agency. George realizes David's integrity outweighs his loyalty, and he decides to entrust him with the secrets of \\"The Puppetmaster\\" and the extent of the infiltration. Act IV: As the film progresses, David must make another choice: stay passive and protect his friend or actively join him in fighting the sinister forces at play. Ultimately, David throws caution to the wind and decides to stand by George's side unconditionally. They team up to foil \\"The Puppetmaster\\" and prevent a devastating, large-scale attack orchestrated by the enemy agency. The movie culminates in an adrenaline-fueled sequence of events, with the pair faced with life and death stakes amidst the chaos of a city at risk. Conclusion: In the aftermath, David and George emerge as unsung heroes. The traitors within the intelligence agency are brought to justice, but David and George's actions remain concealed to protect their identities. Their friendship, tested by the harshest realities and hidden betrayals, emerges stronger than ever. The film concludes in a bittersweet manner; both friends are forced to live with the consequences of their choices but remain bonded through their shared experiences. The final scene of the movie portrays an ordinary day, reminiscent of the introduction. David and George sit together at their favorite café, smiling at each other as they share coffee and discuss their latest literary passion, hinting at the enduring power and resilience of true friendship. \\"Unraveling O'Hearn\\" delivers a powerful message about loyalty and friendship, presented in a gripping cinematic narrative that explores the dark and dangerous world of espionage and secrets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In many countries the standard of living enjoyed by their people has increased rapidly in recent years. Sadly, not everyone in these countries is so fortunate and many people in rich countries are homeless. The reasons for homelessness are various, but poverty is undoubtedly one of the main causes. The homeless people may have become jobless and then been unable to pay their rent and so no longer have _ . Often, the fact that unemployed people get help from the government prevents this from happening, but not always. Some homeless people are mentally ill and have no one to look after them. Some are young people who, for one reason or another, have left home and have nowhere to live. Many of them have had a serious disagreement with their parents and have left home, choosing to go to a city and live on the streets. Sometimes they have taken such action because they have been unable to get on with a step-parent. Many homeless people get into the habit of begging to get enough money to stay alive, but many of the general public refuse to give anything to beggars. Often they are moved on by the police, being accused  ,whether rightly or wrongly, of forceful begging . There are many who disrespect homeless people. Some cynics declare that homeless people choose to live the life which they lead. But who would willingly choose to live in a shop doorway, under a bridge or in a cardboard box?

Despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals, this movie is not for everyone. The story is very similar to other movies, in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age, and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family. She does that by choosing some kind of sport, and with the help of a local boy, that for some reason falls in love with her, she confronts her problems and wins. In Girlfight it's boxing, in Bend it like Beckham it's soccer, and now it's Kung Fu. But Fighter is much inferior product than these two, it was simply embarrassing to watch it. Semra Turan, the \\"actress\\" that playing the role of a teenage girl, maybe can do a lot of things, but one thing she can't do is to act. Her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy, the dramatic situations, in which she tries to show some emotions, are dreadful, her body and facial language are of amateur actress, badly instructed by the director. The rest of the cast is a little better, but they just cannot save this cliché movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot. Besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer. Even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this, it's just so boring. The slow motion was really unnecessary, the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration, and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions, not actually fighting. Not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys, and knocks them off their feet.  The only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because it's European. It's very easy to publicize this movie - A first martial arts film from Denmark, but don't be fooled, it's not.

Accept that you will make some mistakes. Embracing the fact that everyone makes small, recoverable mistakes when they speak will help you feel less nervous and keep you from making larger, more critical mistakes. Most minor mistakes won't even be noticed.  If you make a minor mistake like mispronouncing a word or skipping a small part, don't stop your presentation or start backtracking. This can interrupt your flow and make you even more nervous. Correct the mistake if you notice it right away. Otherwise, just move on.

Repeat the process until you feel calmer and you can focus on your points instead of your nerves. This is an especially helpful tool to use right before you have to speak. Actors say and do things onstage that they would never imagine saying or doing in everyday life. That's because actors are playing a character.

This helps some people because when they are playing a character, it is easier to take risks knowing that if you mess up, it's the character that will get the blame, not you.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Coyotes rarin' to go vs. Avalance after 5-day break The Arizona Coyotes return from a five-day layoff Thursday night to host an Avalanche team coming off one of its most impressive performances of the season. After producing 12 goals over a 1-5-1 stretch, Colorado (4-7-1) recorded three in the final seven minutes to earn a 6-3 home win over slumping Calgary on Tuesday. Nathan MacKinnon netted the game-winner with 6:59 remaining and added two assists, while Matt Duchene scored twice after managing just one goal through the first 11 games. The game can be seen on FOX Sports Arizona, starting at 6:30 p.m. Arizona (5-5-1) seeks a return to early-season form in its first outing since Friday's 4-3 loss to visiting Vancouver, its sixth in eight games following a 3-0-0 start. A portion of those struggles came during an East Coast trip in which the Coyotes played five times in eight days. \\"If today's practice is any indication we'll have great energy,\\" Head Coach Dave Tippett said Wednesday. \\"We've tried to balance the workload with preparation, and we've had some good practices, so hopefully that gets us out of the fatigue factor we were into and into a new stretch of the season where we can get back at it and play well.\\" The break enabled Martin Hanzal to get healthy after missing the previous two contests with a lower-body injury. The top-line center has 10 assists in nine games while often working with promising youngsters Max Domi and Anthony Duclair, each tied for the team lead with five goals. \\"It was good to get some time off after that heavy schedule we had, but now everbody's really excited to get back,\\" forward Tobias Rieder said. \\"We're ready to go.\\" Tippett is hoping the time off benefits Mike Smith as well. The struggling goaltender has a 4.55 goals-against average over his past seven starts after yielding two goals in winning his first three. Smith was pulled just 4:26 into the Vancouver game after allowing two goals on three shots, three days after permitting six in a loss at Boston. Smith owns a 1.93 GAA in 10 career starts against Colorado but has lost his last three while surrendering four goals in each. Center Antoine Vermette is questionable for the game due to a lower-body injury. The Avalanche's late-game outburst vs. Calgary reversed a season-long trend of third-period failures. \\"We knew how we felt when we collapsed,\\" MacKinnon said. \\"(Tuesday) it was different, more confidence. We just knew we were going to win this game. We thought we deserved it and we went and took it, so it definitely feels good.\\" Colorado has endured some goaltending issues of its own with Semyon Varlamov having allowed three or more goals in seven of his nine starts. With the Avs hosting the New York Rangers Friday, it's likely he'll split duties with Reto Berra during the back-to-back set. Varlamov posted a 1.80 GAA in winning his two matchups with the Coyotes last season. Colorado swept all three games with Arizona last season -- scoring 14 goals -- and has won six of the last seven meetings.","output":"The Arizona Coyotes have had a five-day break and are now ready to play against the Avalanche team. The Coyotes have had some rest and practice, which the head coach believes will help them be energetic and play well. The Avalanche team is also doing well, having won a recent game against Calgary. Both teams have faced some challenges, but are excited to play against each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

The first question is asking about getting address proof in India, which is a broader query, while the second question is specifically asking about getting address proof in Mumbai, which is more location-specific. However, the process to obtain address proof might be similar in both cases. Here's a step-by-step guide to getting address proof in India (which also applies to Mumbai). Step 1: Determine your available documents First, find out which documents you have that can be used as address proof. In India, several documents are generally accepted as address proof, such as: 1. Aadhaar Card 2. Voter ID Card 3. Passport 4. Driving License 5. Ration Card 6. Bank statements or passbook 7. Post Office account statements or passbook 8. Utility bills (electricity, water, gas) issued within the last 3 months 9. Rent Agreement (registered) 10. Income Tax Assessment Order 11. Employer-issued and attested letter on company letterhead Step 2: Update your current address If you have any of the above documents, but they contain an outdated or incorrect address, take steps to update the address. The process to update your address on these documents may vary based on the issuing authority. For example, to update the address on your Aadhaar card, you can visit the UIDAI online portal or an Aadhaar Kendra (enrollment center). Step 3: Apply for a new document (if required) If you don't have any valid address proof documents, you can apply for one. For example, you can apply for a new Voter ID card or a new Aadhaar card with your current address. You'll need to provide other supporting documents such as identity proof and proof of residence. Step 4: Keep your address proof document safe Once you obtain or update your address proof document, make sure to keep it safe and easily accessible, as it might be required for various services and verifications. By following these steps, you can obtain address proof in India, including Mumbai."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Although Deal performed most of the instruments herself at the 1999 sessions, her sister had some involvement. They recorded \\"The She\\", \\"Forced to Drive\\", and \\"Too Alive\\" in Chicago, with Deal's drum performance on the third track taken from the Texas session.Deal was satisfied with the material recorded up to this point, but realized she would not be able to tour without a band.

After a chance meeting with members of Fear, she invited drummer Andrew Jaimez, bassist Mando Lopez, and guitarist Richard Presley to jam with her at the studio she was renting. Deal wanted to continue playing with these musicians, and so within three months she moved to Fear's hometown Los Angeles. Jaimez, Lopez, and Presley joined the Breeders, and Kelley Deal rejoined the group soon after. About a month after Kim Deal's arrival, Jose Medeles replaced Jaimez, who decided he did not have enough time for the Breeders because of his involvement in other musical projects.

Article: Clothes can make phone calls, play music, dial your pal's number, keep you warm during cold weather and operate your computer? This is not a fantasy. A British company, called Electrotextiles, has created a wide range of clothes -- clothes that have minds of their own! Scientists, working for the company, have invented a kind of fabric that can be blended  with flexible electronic materials to create intelligent clothing. The result are electronic garments. If you think the wearer has to be wired to different devices, think again. These designer clothes are wire-free, soft to touch and washable!! Like any electronic device, these high-tech clothes have to be powered. Currently, a tiny nine-volt battery serves the purpose. But the researchers hope that in the near future the clothes will generate electricity by using body heat. These clothes are 100 percent shock proof, they say. The Electrotextiles team has also created the world's first cloth keyboard. This keyboard can be sewn into your trousers or skirt. To use this device, you will have to sit down and tap on your lap! These 'lap- tap' gadgets  are all set to take over laptop computers! Another useful garment is the shirt-cum-mobile phone. This handy invention enables drivers to chat comfortably with others at the wheel! Other popular electronic wear include the denim  jacket with flexible earphones sewn into the hood  and the electronic ski jacket with a built-in heater. The ski jacket is also programmed to send signals to a satellite. This technology is known as global positioning system and can be used to track lost skiers and wandering kids.

Write an article based on this summary: About 630 children whose school was destroyed by floods during Storm Desmond have returned to lessons in temporary classrooms on the site of a former primary school.","output":"Title: Storm Desmond's Young Victims Start Afresh in Temporary Classrooms Introduction The devastating effects of Storm Desmond in December 2015 left many communities wrecked, with countless lives impacted - including the lives of young children who were forced to leave their flood-damaged school. After a prolonged and difficult period, approximately 630 children can finally resume normalcy and return to lessons. This has been made possible by the provision of temporary classrooms, located on the site of a former primary school. The Impact of Storm Desmond Storm Desmond, a powerful extratropical cyclone, caused torrential rain and heavy flooding across the United Kingdom, especially in Northern England and Scotland. This unprecedented disaster brought life across these regions to a standstill, with schools and livelihoods adversely affected. The flood destroyed a vast number of homes and critical infrastructure, leaving thousands of people in despair. For the 630 children whose school was ruined by Storm Desmond's floods, education came to an abrupt halt. The school's impracticable condition imposed immense challenges on the pupils, their families, and the staff. Temporary Classrooms as a Solution Amid the chaos, local authorities and the community sprung into action to find an alternative solution for the impacted children to smoothly transition back to receiving their education. They identified the site of a former primary school that had been closed down as a potential location for temporary classrooms. With a concentrated effort from the government, NGOs, and the wider community, the site was equipped with the necessary infrastructure, including spacious classrooms, practical amenities, and safety measures. With the temporary classrooms securely set up on the former primary school's property, the stage was set for the children to resume their education journey without further disruption. A sense of hope and recovery filled the air as the 630 children from the storm-ravaged school eagerly made their way back to their new temporary campus. Adjusting to the New Educational Environment For the children, staff, and parents, the transition to the temporary classrooms represents a significant milestone on the road to recovery. The children can now focus on their education once again, while the staff can continue teaching with fewer obstacles hindering their progress. However, adjustments must be made to fit the new educational landscape. Teachers, parents, and students need to adapt to the temporary facilities and find creative ways of making the best use of the spaces and resources available. The children may also require additional emotional support to cope with the disruptions caused by the storm and the subsequent change in educational environments. Counsellors and dedicated staff will play a crucial role in helping the children return to a sense of normalcy in the aftermath of such a life-changing event. Looking Ahead to a Long-Term Solution Although the temporary classrooms symbolize an essential step toward recovery, the community's focus must now shift toward establishing a permanent solution for the affected school. This will entail extensive collaboration between local authorities, residents, and other stakeholders to ensure the construction of a new school, one equipped to withstand potential natural disasters in the future. In the meantime, the resilience of the 630 children, their families, and the staff must be commended. Their determination to overcome the challenges presented by Storm Desmond serves as a source of inspiration for all those affected by natural disasters around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Choose from:  -- no.  -- yes.","output":"To fix brassy orange hair at home, you can follow these steps: Step 1: Analyze the hair's current condition Before attempting any color correction, assess the hair's current state. Identify the dominant brassy orange tones and the overall health of the hair to determine the appropriate treatment method. Step 2: Choose a purple or blue-toned shampoo or toner Purchase a quality purple or blue-toned shampoo or toner. These products work by depositing violet or blue pigments into the hair to neutralize the unwanted brassy tones. The best purple shampoo for brassy hair depends on your preference, hair type, and budget. Some popular options include Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo, Fanola No Orange Shampoo, and Matrix Total Results Brass Off. Step 3: Apply the product Follow the instructions on the product label. Generally, you should apply the product to wet hair, lather, and let it sit for a few minutes to let the color-correcting pigments do their work. The amount of time the product should stay on your hair is specified by the manufacturer. Step 4: Rinse out the product Rinse the shampoo or toner out of the hair thoroughly. Be sure to use lukewarm or cool water to help seal the hair cuticle, locking in the color-correcting pigments. Step 5: Deep condition the hair Treat the hair with a deep conditioning mask to help repair any damage and moisturize the hair. This step will also make the hair more manageable and minimize frizz. Step 6: Evaluate the results After the hair dries, assess the results to determine if the brassy tones have been adequately neutralized. If necessary, repeat the process until the desired tone is achieved. Now, to answer your question about the meaning of the two questions: 1. How do you fix brassy orange hair at home? 2. What is the best purple shampoo with brassy hair? The answer is: no. These two questions are related but not the same. The first question asks for a method to fix brassy orange hair at home, while the second question specifically asks about the best purple shampoo for brassy hair. The answers to these questions can be interconnected, as using a purple shampoo is one way to fix brassy hair, but the questions themselves have different meanings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Groening was born on February 15, 1954 in Portland, Oregon, the middle of five children (older brother Mark and sister Patty were born in 1950 and 1952, while the younger sisters Lisa and Maggie in 1956 and 1958, respectively). His Norwegian American mother, Margaret Ruth (nee Wiggum; March 23, 1919 - April 22, 2013), was once a teacher, and his German Canadian father, Homer Philip Groening (December 30, 1919 - March 15, 1996), was a filmmaker, advertiser, writer and cartoonist. Homer, born in Main Centre, Saskatchewan, Canada, grew up in a Mennonite, Plautdietsch-speaking family. After spending a few years researching science fiction, Groening got together with Simpsons writer/producer David X. Cohen (known as David S. Cohen at the time) in 1997 and developed Futurama, an animated series about life in the year 3000. By the time they pitched the series to Fox in April 1998, Groening and Cohen had composed many characters and storylines; Groening claimed they had gone \\"overboard\\" in their discussions. Groening described trying to get the show on the air as \\"by far the worst experience of [his] grown-up life.\\" The show premiered on March 28, 1999. Groening's writing credits for the show are for the premiere episode, \\"Space Pilot 3000\\" (co-written with Cohen), \\"Rebirth\\" (story) and \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela\\" (story).  After four years on the air, the show was canceled by Fox. In a situation similar to Family Guy, however, strong DVD sales and very stable ratings on Adult Swim brought Futurama back to life. When Comedy Central began negotiating for the rights to air Futurama reruns, Fox suggested that there was a possibility of also creating new episodes. When Comedy Central committed to sixteen new episodes, it was decided that four straight-to-DVD films - Bender's Big Score (2007), The Beast with a Billion Backs (2008), Bender's Game (2008) and Into the Wild Green Yonder (2009) - would be produced.  Since no new Futurama projects were in production, the movie Into the Wild Green Yonder was designed to stand as the Futurama series finale. However, Groening had expressed a desire to continue the Futurama franchise in some form, including as a theatrical film. In an interview with CNN, Groening said that \\"we have a great relationship with Comedy Central and we would love to do more episodes for them, but I don't know... We're having discussions and there is some enthusiasm but I can't tell if it's just me\\". Comedy Central commissioned an additional 26 new episodes, and began airing them in 2010. The show continued in to 2013, before Comedy Central announced in April 2013 that they would not be renewing it beyond its seventh season. The final episode aired on September 4, 2013. Did he do anything besides write?","output":"Yes, Matt Groening has been involved in various aspects of the entertainment industry besides writing.  1. Cartoonist: Groening began his career as a cartoonist, with his comic strip \\"Life in Hell\\" being his first major success. The strip began in 1977 and continued until 2012. It featured anthropomorphic rabbits and a gay couple, Akbar and Jeff, and depicted the daily struggles and humor in life. This comic caught the attention of James L. Brooks, who approached Groening to create short animated features for The Tracey Ullman Show, which led to the creation of The Simpsons. 2. Animator: Groening played a significant role in creating and designing the characters for The Simpsons and Futurama. His distinctive drawing style is evident in the characters and the animation of both shows. 3. Voice Actor: Though not a regular voice actor, Groening has occasionally lent his voice to both The Simpsons and Futurama. He made cameo appearances as himself in a few episodes of The Simpsons and even voiced a character called \\"Old Man Waterfall\\" in the Futurama episode \\"A Taste of Freedom.\\" 4. Producer and Creative Consultant: For both The Simpsons and Futurama, Groening served as an executive producer and creative consultant. This involved overseeing the shows' development, working closely with the writers, animators, and voice actors, and ensuring the shows maintained their intended creative direction. 5. Music: Groening is a big fan of music and has curated several music festivals, including the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in the UK in 2003 and 2010. He has also released a limited edition vinyl album called \\"Drinky Crow's Clubhouse,\\" which features various artists and is a homage to Tony Millionaire's comic strip character \\"Drinky Crow.\\" 6. Comics Publishing: Groening founded his own publishing company, Bongo Comics Group, in 1993. The company specializes in producing comic books and graphic novels based on The Simpsons and Futurama, as well as original content by other writers and artists. In summary, Matt Groening's impact on the entertainment industry extends beyond writing, with significant contributions to animation, voice acting, producing, music, and comics publishing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Though there're many kinds of resources, with the fast increase of population and the increase of many more factories, the more we use, the fewer there will be left for the future. Oil is getting less and less year after year. It's said that oil can last for only 50 years. Natural gas perhaps will last about 38 years. Oil can be used in many ways and it's difficult to imagine what the modern world will be like without oil. But oil isn't easy to find and get out of the earth. Men must study the rocks. When they think the rocks in a certain place may have oil, a metal tower is built. A machine in the tower cuts a hole down into the ground. At the same time, a steel pipe is pushed down to stop the sides from falling in and to keep out water. At last if the men are right, usually the oil rushes up the sides with great force by the pressure of the gas in the top of the rock, and it rushes high into the air. If the oil catches a light, there will be a terrible fire. So a kind of cover is fixed on the top of the pipe, and the oil can run out through taps . If we are near the middle of the oil field, we can also get gas. Such gas is sent through pipes to towns far away and used in houses and factories like coal gas. Today oil is under pressure as never before. The price of oil keeps rising all the time. In many countries, the governments encourage people to save oil as much as possible.

Write a text based on this summary: foreign exchange rates in new zealand Text:","output":"Title: Understanding Foreign Exchange Rates in New Zealand  Introduction Foreign exchange (Forex or FX) rates are an essential parameter determining the relative value of one currency against another. In New Zealand, the forex market is crucial for supporting trade and investments in the global economy, mainly due to its geographical location and its close ties with Australia and Asian markets. This article seeks to provide an in-depth analysis of the foreign exchange rates in New Zealand, the factors influencing them, and their impact on the economy. Overview of the Foreign Exchange Market in New Zealand The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) actively manages the country's monetary policy, which includes the exchange rate as one of the key determinants. As a small, open economy, New Zealand heavily relies on international trade, and its currency, the New Zealand Dollar (NZD), is one of the most traded currencies in the world. New Zealand’s major trading partners include Australia, the United States, China, and the European Union. As a result, trading in these currencies—Australian Dollar (AUD), United States Dollar (USD), Chinese Yuan (CNY), and Euro (EUR)—is vital for New Zealand's forex market. Factors Influencing the Foreign Exchange Rates in New Zealand 1. Monetary Policy: The RBNZ aims to maintain price stability and promote long-term economic growth through controlling interest rates and the money supply in the economy. The set policy rates have a direct influence on the NZD exchange rate, as higher interest rates tend to attract foreign capital, strengthening the local currency. 2. Economic Indicators: Economic factors such as GDP growth rates, inflation, employment levels, and the trade balance can significantly impact the forex rates. A strong economy typically results in higher currency demand and, consequently, an appreciation of the NZD. 3. Market Sentiment: Global market sentiments and risk appetite can significantly impact the NZD's value. As a risk-sensitive currency, the NZD generally strengthens during upbeat market sentiment, fueled by investors' preference for riskier assets. 4. Geopolitical and Global Economic Events: Major global political and economic events—such as pandemics, natural disasters, or political crises—can quickly shift investors' perceptions and affect exchange rates. 5. Commodity Prices: New Zealand is a major exporter of commodities, particularly dairy products and agricultural goods. Fluctuations in global commodity prices can have a profound impact on the NZD's value, as higher prices usually boost its demand and vice versa. Impact of Foreign Exchange Rates on the New Zealand Economy Exchange rates have direct and indirect consequences on the New Zealand economy. Such effects include: 1. Trade and Competitiveness: Exchange rate fluctuations can impact the country's export competitiveness, as a weak NZD makes exports cheaper in foreign markets, boosting trade. Conversely, a strong NZD makes imports cheaper and may lead to increased demand for imported goods and services. 2. Inflation: Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have a direct bearing on inflation. A weak NZD can lead to higher import prices, leading to increased inflation rates, while a stronger NZD may cause lower import prices, reducing inflationary pressures. 3. Investment: Foreign exchange rates can encourage or discourage foreign direct investments (FDIs) into the country. An attractive exchange rate can boost foreign investments, contributing significantly to the country's economic development and growth. Conclusion Foreign exchange rates play a pivotal role in New Zealand's economy, primarily driven by its reliance on international trade and global economic integration. A multitude of factors, including monetary policy, economic indicators, global market sentiment, and commodity prices, influence these rates. In turn, fluctuations in exchange rates affect trade, inflation, and investments in the country, necessitating a clear understanding of their implications for businesses and individuals alike."},{"instruction":"Q: Generate a correct and concise answer for the question based on the words in the context.

Now, in this big city, there's a hospital that is saying something important to some patients. Let me tell you about it! The Cardiff Hospital has announced that this weekend, patients who don't have serious or urgent problems will have to wait longer than usual. What does that mean? Well, you know when you feel sick, and mommy or daddy take you to a place where the doctors and nurses make you feel better? Sometimes, you have to wait a little while before you see the doctor. This weekend, that waiting time might be a bit longer at the Cardiff Hospital. Why is this happening? Probably because there are many people who need to see the doctor or nurse right away because they are very sick or hurt. Sometimes, hospitals get very busy, so they need to make sure the people who need help the most are seen first. This way, they can help people get better faster. So, what can we do if we are one of those patients who have to wait for a longer time? We can be patient, and remember that there's a reason for the wait – it's because the doctors and nurses are very busy taking care of those who need help urgently. And, maybe, we can bring a book or a toy to play with while we wait our turn. In conclusion, kids, remember that hospitals are places where people go to get better when they are sick or hurt. This weekend, the Cardiff Hospital may be a bit more busy than usual, so if you go there, be patient and know that everyone is doing their best to help everyone feel better as soon as possible.

Seedless vascular plants reproduce through spores, which are the plant's reproductive cells that grow without fertilization. Some common examples of seedless vascular plants include ferns, horsetails, and clubmosses. On the other hand, seed plants are vascular plants that produce seeds as a mode of reproduction. Seeds are essentially fertilized and matured ovules that contain a plant embryo, which can grow into a new individual plant upon germination. Seed plants are further subdivided into two categories: gymnosperms and angiosperms. Gymnosperms are plants with \\"naked seeds,\\" such as conifers and cycads, where the seeds are not enclosed within an ovary or fruit.

Though prehistoric remains from the Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Ages have been unearthed in the Manzanares Valley, prior to Madrid's sudden elevation to capital city in 1561 its history was rather undistinguished. Over a period of many centuries crucial in Spanish history, Madrid's significance was negligible. The Romans built their most advanced outpost on the Iberian peninsula, but left nothing of consequence in Madrid. Armies of North African nomads, intent on disseminating Islam, invaded the peninsula in a.d. Within 10 years, they had overrun most of Spain. If Madrid played any role in these pivotal events, no record of it remains. The first solid references to this obscure settlement on the Castilian plateau, guarded by the looming Guadarrama mountain range, appear in the 9th century. The Arabic name for \\"place of many springs,\\" variously recorded as Magerit, Mayrit or Magrit, eventually evolved into Madrid. The hamlet entered historical chronicles for its military significance; it was located near the main line of resistance to the Christian reconquest. Over centuries of struggle, the defending Moorish army built a full-scale fort, or Alcázar, on the heights of Madrid commanding the Manzanares valley. After several unsuccessful skirmishes, the Christian forces of Alfonso VI captured Madrid in 1083. The Alcázar became a fort of the crown of Castile. During a counter-offensive in 1109, the town was overrun by the Moors, but the Christianized fortress held. The Moors were expelled from the town, but they remained in control of southern Spain for almost four centuries. Meanwhile, Madrid enjoyed brief prominence in 1308 when king Ferdinand IV and his Cortes, an early version of parliament, held a formal meeting in the fledgling town. From then on, the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid, where the air was invigorating and the hunting excellent. Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic monarchs that united all the provinces of Spain, first visited Madrid in 1477.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Air was invigorating\\" correctly answer the question \\"What caused the kings of Spain to begin to visit Madrid\\"?","output":"Based on the paragraph, the response \\"Air was invigorating\\" is part of the correct answer to the question \\"What caused the kings of Spain to begin to visit Madrid?\\" Another factor mentioned is that the hunting in the area was excellent. So, the complete answer would be that the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid because the air was invigorating and the hunting was excellent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The other woman my wife wanted me to visit was my mother, who has been a widow  for 19 years, but the demands of my work and my three children had made it impossible to visit her often. That Friday after work, when I arrived at her house, my mother waited in the door with her coat on. She had curled her hair and was wearing the dress that she had worn to celebrate her last wedding anniversary.  We went to a restaurant that, although not elegant, was very nice and comfortable. My mother took my arm as if she were the First Lady. During the dinner, we had an agreeable conversation, nothing extraordinary but catching up on recent events of each other's life. We talked so much that we missed the movie. As we arrived at her house later, she said, \\"I'll go out with you again, but only if you let me invite you.\\" I agreed. A few days later, my mother died of a massive heart attack. It happened so suddenly that I didn't have a chance to do anything for her. Some time later, I received an envelope with a copy of a restaurant receipt from the same place Mother and I had dined. An attached note said \\"I paid this bill in advance.

Article: FOR people who are interested in space, nothing is more exciting than the idea of living on other planets. That might be why the movie The Martian (<<>> ) is so popular. It shows an astronaut struggling to live on Mars. But would it actually be possible to live on the Red Planet? While the idea of living on Mars is great, the reality does not look as good. Mars does not have a friendly atmosphere for humans. There is very little oxygen there. And because of its distance from the sun, it is also very cold. The temperature on Mars can be -62 degrees on average. This is much too cold for humans. However, scientists say it might be possible to live there even without a good atmosphere. Daytime on Mars is almost the same as Earth's. It means there's enough sunlight to grow plants inside safe buildings. However, they would have to grow in soil from Earth. Mars does not have a strong enough atmosphere to stop the radiation coming from space, which makes it dangerous to grow things in the soil. The radiation is also bad for our health. If we want to live there healthily, we need to build our homes under the ground or within the rocks on the planet. This would protect humans from the radiation and also some heat. When could we actually live on Mars? NASA is hoping to make some progress within the next 20 years.

Is The console's 2 kB of onboard RAM may be used for tile maps and attributes on the NES board and 8 kB of tile pattern ROM or RAM may be included on a cartridge. a good answer to this question?","output":"The provided statement focuses on the memory capacity and tile pattern information of the NES console, but does not directly answer the question about the standard display resolution of the NES. The answer should highlight the resolution and provide additional details to better address the question. A more comprehensive answer would be: The standard display resolution of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is 256x240 pixels. The NES is an 8-bit video game console, released in the 1980s, which utilized a custom Picture Processing Unit (PPU) for rendering graphics. The PPU is responsible for generating the video signal output displayed on a TV screen. The resolution of the NES comprises of 256 pixels horizontally and 240 pixels vertically, creating a grid where 8x8 pixel tiles are placed. The PPU has two pattern tables (also known as character tables), each having a 4 kB memory area for tile storage (8 kB in total). These pattern tables define the shapes and patterns used for both the background and the game sprites. While the NES does feature 2 kB of onboard RAM for tile maps and attributes, the 8 kB of tile pattern ROM or RAM mentioned in the provided statement is indeed stored on a cartridge. This storage provides the memory for tile patterns used in rendering game graphics, including both foreground sprites and the background. It is important to note that due to the limitations of the NTSC television standard at the time, the NES didn't utilize all 240 vertical pixels. In fact, only 224 pixels were typically visible, as the remaining lines were often used for off-screen objects and to simplify scrolling. Additionally, the PAL version of the NES utilized a slightly different resolution, with 256x288 pixels, to accommodate the PAL television standard. In summary, the standard display resolution of the NES is 256x240 pixels, with the console's onboard RAM being used for tile maps and attributes, and additional tile pattern ROM or RAM being stored on cartridges. The NES's PPU is responsible for rendering graphics using this memory and outputting the video signal to a TV screen."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Good Crazy is an episode from the comedy series on CBS named what?

The Sitwells looked after their protégé both materially and culturally, giving him not only a home but a stimulating cultural education. He took music lessons with Ernest Ansermet, Ferruccio Busoni and Edward J. Dent. He attended the Russian ballet, met Stravinsky and Gershwin, heard the Savoy Orpheans at the Savoy Hotel and wrote an experimental string quartet heavily influenced by the Second Viennese School that was performed at a festival of new music at Salzburg in 1923. Alban Berg heard the performance and was impressed enough to take Walton to meet Arnold Schoenberg, Berg's teacher and the founder of the Second Viennese School.In 1923, in collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Walton had his first great success, though at first it was a succès de scandale. Façade was first performed in public at the Aeolian Hall, London, on 12 June. The work consisted of Edith's verses, which she recited through a megaphone from behind a screen, while Walton conducted an ensemble of six players in his accompanying music. The press was generally condemnatory. Walton's biographer Michael Kennedy cites as typical a contemporary headline: \\"Drivel That They Paid to Hear\\". The Daily Express loathed the work, but admitted that it was naggingly memorable. The Manchester Guardian wrote of \\"relentless cacophony\\". The Observer condemned the verses and dismissed Walton's music as \\"harmless\\". In The Illustrated London News, Dent was much more appreciative: \\"The audience was at first inclined to treat the whole thing as an absurd joke, but there is always a surprisingly serious element in Miss Sitwell's poetry and Mr Walton's music ... which soon induced the audience to listen with breathless attention.\\" In The Sunday Times, Ernest Newman said of Walton, \\"as a musical joker he is a jewel of the first water\\".Among the audience were Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf and Noël Coward.

He had just finished his evening food distribution, and the news left him feeling \\"thrilled\\" and as though he had been given \\"the biggest gift in this world.\\" He was grateful for the nomination, as it brought him and his fellow heroes into the spotlight for their phenomenal work. For Krishnan, this worldwide exposure has great potential for his organization, Akshaya Trust. The recognition from a reputed media outlet like CNN not only enhances the credibility of the organization but also highlights its work to millions of people across the globe. However, this newfound recognition carries with it greater responsibility and accountability, as the nonprofit must now maintain high standards to prove worthy of the honor. Most importantly, Krishnan wants people to understand that human suffering is universal, and that everyone experiences both happiness and sorrow in life. By acknowledging this truth, individuals can develop empathy for those who are less fortunate and extend a helping hand to those in need. It is this genuine compassion and commitment to alleviating the suffering of others that drives Krishnan's work and the mission of Akshaya Trust, setting an inspiring example for the rest of the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Problem: Solve 10 = 8*f - 6 for f. And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation 10 = 8*f - 6 for f, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the term containing the variable 'f' Start by isolating the term containing the variable 'f,' which is 8*f in this case. To do this, we will first perform the inverse operation of subtraction on both sides of the equation. Since the term on the right side of the equation is '-6', we will add 6 to both sides of the equation. 10 + 6 = 8*f - 6 + 6 Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation We can now simplify both sides of the equation. On the left side, 10 + 6 equals 16. 16 = 8*f On the right side, -6 + 6 equals 0, so the equation simplifies to: 16 = 8*f Step 3: Solve for 'f' Now that we have isolated the term containing 'f,' we can solve for 'f' by performing the inverse operation of multiplication, which is division. Since the term containing 'f' is '8*f', we will divide both sides of the equation by 8 to find the value of 'f.' 16 / 8 = 8*f / 8 Step 4: Simplify and find the value of 'f' On the left side of the equation, 16 divided by 8 equals 2. 2 = f On the right side of the equation, 8*f divided by 8 equals 'f', so the equation simplifies to: 2 = f So the solution to the equation 10 = 8*f - 6 is f = 2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Jets' seventh game was an interconference duel with the Packers. Punter Steve Weatherford made the game's most controversial decision in the first quarter, opting to attempt a fake punt and run for the first down on 4th and 18. Weatherford was stopped a yard short of the first down, giving the Packers ideal field position which eventually led to an early 3-0 Packers lead. \\"He does it on his own,\\" Ryan said. \\"(The Packers) were caving that side down. This was something Steve did on his own. I don't think he realized we'd just been sacked. We told him before that it needed to be a manageable situation, not fourth-and-20 or whatever it was.\\". In a game where defense ruled, the Packers lead 3-0 at halftime.  The Jets challenged a Brad Smith fumble, and lost due to his knee not being down before losing the ball.  However, the Jets second challenge went to a jump ball, called an interception after Packers cornerback Tramon Williams ripped the ball out of Jerricho Cotchery's hands while they were both on the ground.  The play was controversially upheld, despite the fact that the receiver appeared to be down by contact.  With no challenges left, Mark Sanchez threw a ball to Dustin Keller that was ripped out of his hands and ruled an interception in the 4th quarter. The replay showed that Keller made the catch and was also down before losing possession, but with no challenges left the Jets were left with nothing. Green Bay took a 6-0 lead after the turnover. The Jets had two more chances to take the lead but had drives halted on 4th and longs. The Packers added on another field goal late to finalize a 9-0 win in the New Meadowlands Stadium.

Background: Richard Lester Meyers (born October 2, 1949), better known by his stage name Richard Hell, is an American singer, songwriter, bass guitarist and writer. Richard Hell was an innovator of punk music and fashion. He was one of the first to spike his hair and wear torn, cut and drawn-on shirts, often held together with safety pins. Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, credited Hell as a source of inspiration for the Sex Pistols' look and attitude, as well as the safety-pin and graphics accessorized clothing that McLaren sold in his London shop, Sex. Context: Richard Lester Meyers grew up in Lexington, Kentucky in 1949. His father, a secular Jew, was an experimental psychologist, researching animal behavior. He died when Hell was 7 years old. Hell was then raised by his mother, who came from Methodists of Welsh and English ancestry. After her husband's death, she returned to school and became a professor.  Hell attended the Sanford School in Delaware for one year, where he became friends with Tom Miller, who later changed his name to Tom Verlaine. They ran away from school together and a short time later were arrested in Alabama for arson and vandalism.  Hell never finished high school, instead moving to New York City to make his way as a poet. In New York he met fellow young poet David Giannini, and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico for several months, where Giannini and Meyers co-founded Genesis:Grasp. They used an AM VariTyper with changeable fonts to publish the magazine. They began publishing books and magazines, but decided to go their separate ways in 1971, after which Hell created and published Dot Books.  Before he was 21, his own poems were published in numerous periodicals, ranging from Rolling Stone to the New Directions Annuals. In 1971, along with Verlaine, Hell also published under the pseudonym Theresa Stern, a fictional poet whose photo was actually a combination of both his and Verlaine's faces in drag, superimposed over one another to create a new identity. A book of poems credited to \\"Stern\\", Wanna Go Out?, was released by Dot in 1973. Question: Was his mother in his life?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, after Richard Hell's father passed away when he was 7 years old, his mother raised him. She even returned to school and became a professor following her husband's death.

Please briefly summarize this news article: On Virginiaâs Crooked Road, Music Lights the Way Brendan Smialowski for The New York Times Mouth of Wilson, Va., on Route 58 along the Crooked Road in Virginia. IT starts with a well-worn fiddle, held in equally well-worn hands above a tapping black cowboy boot. Then in comes the banjo, plucked with steel finger picks, followed by the autoharp, the mandolin, the percussive beat of an upright bass. Another banjo grabs the melody, and suddenly the room is bursting with knee-slapping, country-porch music. A man in a crisp checked shirt gets up and starts to dance, bouncing out a complicated bumbumBAM bumbumBAM with his feet, moving as smoothly as a Martha Graham dancer, hitting the floor on the downbeat. Wade Petty plays the fiddle at the Fries Theater. It is Thursday night in Fries (pronounced freeze), Va., population 600, on the wide New River. In the century-old Fries Theater, the silk wallpaper, once a glorious aquamarine embossed with gold ferns, is faded. A sign promises movies for 10 cents, 25 cents on weekends, but there hasn’t been a film here in years. The Fries high school closed in 1989 after the cotton mill that gave birth to this hamlet in 1902 shut down. But where the economy has faltered, the local music culture is thriving. Take a drive through the dozens of one-stoplight towns that are planted along highways that twist through this region’s blue hills and green valleys, and you’ll find that music is the manna of the community. Fries was my first stop on the music trail known as the Crooked Road — an official designation of the state of Virginia since 2004. The heritage of the path can be found in this dance, in that tune, learned by ear from house to house and passed down through generations. The Road isn’t one single highway — it’s a roughly 300-mile series of interconnected two-lane byways and long stretches of Route 58, which skims Virginia’s North Carolina and Tennessee borders all the way to Kentucky. The sound here is Appalachian: mountain music. Joe Wilson, who wrote a book on the Crooked Road, calls the area the “pickle barrel” of American music. “You know you can’t make a good pickle by squirting vinegar on a cucumber,” he said. “You have to let it sit.” Over five days in April, I rambled along part of the Crooked Road and towns around it, from Fries up to Ferrum and Floyd, back to Galax and out to Marion, dipping down toward Abington, and back to Galax again. With my partner, Ian, his parents and my 2-year-old daughter, Orli, I drove down roads that curve so dramatically that locals joke that you can see your own taillights as you round the bends. The drive cuts through pastures dotted with cows and horses and weather-beaten barns, some abandoned and left to splinter. Many see the land they sold in recent decades now covered in Christmas trees, a boom industry that has changed the landscape. Churches rise up one after the other: Baptist, Pentecostal, Methodist. “Google Doesn’t Satisfy All Searches,” reads one church sign. “Can’t Sleep? Try Counting Your Blessings,” says another. We traveled 370 miles in all, what with switchbacks and retracing our steps to hear just one more tune. We were following the songs that had blown this way and that like so many dandelion seeds across the Blue Ridge Mountains and through the foothills of Appalachia. Our lodgings included everything from a Hampton Inn to an eco-minded auberge decorated by local artists, to a Ragtime-era hotel, recently restored to its former glory. ALONG the way we stuffed ourselves with buttery biscuits, farm eggs and smokehouse Southern flavors that somehow taste different south of the Mason-Dixon line. Orli loved every minute of it; her affinity for the music was immediate. When she ran onto the dance floor at the Floyd Friday Night Jamboree, the man next to me caught my arm. “Let her be,” he said. “We’re mountain people — we’ll take care of her as our own.” She woke each morning singing the twang of the banjo. If there ever was a place where musical authenticity was born and nurtured, “raised up” as the people around here say, the Crooked Road is it. From the Carter Family Fold in Hiltons (the site of Johnny Cash’s last concert) and Clintwood, deep in coal country, to the farms near Floyd, music is still being made on fiddles and banjos, mandolins and guitars, dulcimers and autoharps. Every night you’ll find pick-up jams on front porches, performances in theaters and quartets that pack storefronts, an old courthouse and even a Dairy Queen. In summer the area is awash in festivals, from Dr. Ralph Stanley’s Memorial Day bluegrass festival in the mountains of Coeburn, Va., to the venerable Old Fiddlers Convention held every August in Galax. This region is where old-time and bluegrass was born. Old-time is dance music, simpler and older than bluegrass. Bluegrass is filled with vocal harmonies, many made famous by (relative) newbies like Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch. It is suited more for seated audiences than the foot-stomping dance I saw in Fries, which is known as flatfoot. Both genres evolved from tunes brought by Scotch-Irish and German settlers who traveled down the wagon trails from Pennsylvania. They brought dulcimers and fiddles and later picked up the banjo from former slaves. “It wasn’t real practical to bring a piano or an organ till there was a train,” said David Arnold, a Fries native whose wild white beard reached mid-sternum. I met him at a jam. It turned out he was the chairman of the Music Heritage Committee at the Grayson County Heritage Foundation in nearby Independence.

They play old instruments like the fiddle and banjo, and they play a kind of music that makes you want to dance and stomp your feet. In one of these small towns, there's an old theater where people get together to play their music. Even though the town and the theater are old, and some things aren't as busy as they once were, the people there love their music and play it with joy. The music they play is like a special secret passed down from generation to generation. This music has been carried around with them as they moved across the mountains and valleys. This is the same music that comes from the old country, carried by the original settlers who came from across the sea. They've been playing it ever since, and it's very important to them. This music has given shape to other kinds of music like bluegrass, that you may find familiar from some songs on the radio. It's special because it's still played in the way it was originally intended, for people to listen, dance, and be happy. The Crooked Road is a treasure trove for this unique and lively music.  And that's the story behind the Crooked Road. A special place in Virginia where music lights the way. The people there are like one big family; they love their music and, as long as the music plays, they keep dancing with smiles on their faces."},{"instruction":"Given the question: She needed a new night table, what does she need to visit to get one legally?

It was beyond reality, and it didn't work out for the Rangers. He was later traded to the Yankees who happily increased the deal. Good for Rodriguez.  But at least he was being paid to work.  Rory McIlroy has now become Nike's poster boy -- certainly there will be a lot of strings attached; but he's not being paid by Nike to swing a club. He'll get millions more to do that.

Look at band logos, images, and lyrics and select something that you can realistically paint on your shirt. Make sure to consider your artistic abilities and time.  For example, if you want something simple, then you might choose a favorite line or verse from a song and simply write this on your shirt. If you want to try something more advanced, then you could try painting a portrait of one of the band members on the shirt. Before you delve into painting, create an outline on the shirt using pencil. This will make it easier for you to check the positioning and fill in your design before you make it permanent.  For example, if you are writing lyrics on the shirt, write them on the shirt with pencil where you want them to go. If you are painting a portrait of a band member, then draw a basic sketch of the person on the shirt first. After you have your outline, get out the color or colors of fabric paint that you want to use. Dip your brush into the first paint and paint along the edges of the outline. Then, fill in the image with the other colors you want to use.  For example, you could outline your text with black or white, and then fill it in with the same or a different color. If you’re creating a portrait, then you might outline it with a flesh tone and then fill in the image with other colors to add detail.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A wave pool is a swimming pool in which there are artificially generated, reasonably large waves, similar to those of the ocean. Wave pools are often a major feature of water parks. Siam Park City Water Park in Thailand is home to the world's largest wave pool certified by Guinness World Records, and Siam Park (Tenerife) in Spain is home to the biggest man made waves (about 3 meters (9.8 ft)) in the world.  - A museum is an institution that cares for (conserves) a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance and some public museums make them available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary. Most large museums are located in major cities throughout the world and more local ones exist in smaller cities, towns and even the countryside. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the general public.  - The American Museum of Natural History (abbreviated as AMNH), located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City, is one of the largest museums in the world. Located in park-like grounds across the street from Central Park, the museum complex comprises 28 interconnected buildings housing 45 permanent exhibition halls, in addition to a planetarium and a library. The museum collections contain over 33 million specimens of plants, animals, fossils, minerals, rocks, meteorites, human remains, and human cultural artifacts, of which only a small fraction can be displayed at any given time, and occupies more than . The museum has a full-time scientific staff of 225, sponsors over 120 special field expeditions each year, and averages about five million visits annually.  - The Upper West Side, sometimes abbreviated UWS, is a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan, New York City, that lies between Central Park and the Hudson River and between West 59th Street and West 110th Street. The Upper West Side is sometimes also considered by the real estate industry to include the neighborhood of Morningside Heights.  - In physics, a standing wave  also known as a stationary wave  is a wave in a medium in which each point on the axis of the wave has an associated constant amplitude. The locations at which the amplitude is minimum are called nodes, and the locations where the amplitude is maximum are called antinodes.  - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.  - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\".

Available options: [a]. negative; [b]. positive;","output":"Based on the preceding review, it appears that the movie was seen positively. The reviewer seems to be highlighting unique aspects of the film in a somewhat enthusiastic and engaging manner.  Allow me to break down the review into individual components to clarify the context behind my answer: 1. High drama: This phrase suggests that the movie has a compelling storyline, filled with dramatic and emotional moments. High drama is often considered a desirable attribute, as it indicates that the film is both engaging and memorable. 2. Disney-style: By referring to \\"Disney-style,\\" the reviewer seems to imply that the film possesses qualities typically associated with Disney movies. Disney is known for producing iconic animated and live-action films that generally evoke feelings of wonder, excitement, and inspiration. As such, this reference has a positive connotation. 3. A wing and a prayer: This idiomatic expression is used to describe situations in which success relies on hope or luck rather than skill or planning. In the context of this review, the reviewer likely refers to the movie's plot or a character facing challenges or pursuing something with limited chances of success. This creates an exciting narrative and invites the audience to root for the character, which can be a positive aspect of the film. 4. A hunky has-been: This phrase could generate positive or negative connotations based on its context. However, in the case of this review, the tone seems playful and lighthearted. The term \\"hunky\\" implies that the protagonist is attractive, while \\"has-been\\" suggests that the character might be attempting a comeback or redemption arc. This combination creates an interesting and sympathetic character for the audience to connect with at a deeper level. 5. Pursuing his castle in the sky: \\"Castle in the sky\\" is a metaphor for a lofty goal or unattainable dream. In the film's context, the character is pursuing an ambitious objective, which adds to the overall excitement and drama of the story. The reviewer's use of this phrase indicates appreciation for the character's ambition, which contributes to the movie's positive reception. Considering all these elements, the movie was seen positively based on the preceding review. Therefore, the correct answer is [b]. positive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.  Now, I have a new situation: Two neighboring planets identical to Earth in size and atmospheric conditions behaved differently towards their environments. Planet A emitted a lot of air pollution, destroying its ozone layer, while Planet B respected the environment and used ecological products.  Answer this question please: Which planet had higher levels of UV reaching it? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the situations on both planets. On Planet A, there is a lot of air pollution, which leads to the destruction of the ozone layer. On Planet B, the environment is respected, and ecological products are used, which indicates less air pollution. Step 2: Determine the impact of air pollution on the ozone layer. Air pollution, particularly chlorine and bromine gases, destroy the ozone layer. The ozone layer is responsible for filtering out harmful UV radiation from the sun. Step 3: Determine the consequences of a diminished ozone layer. With a damaged or depleted ozone layer, higher levels of UV radiation reach the planet's surface, which can lead to harmful effects on living organisms, such as increased skin cancers, eye cataracts, and disruption of ocean food webs. Step 4: Compare the levels of UV radiation on both planets. Since Planet A has a destroyed ozone layer due to air pollution—while Planet B has a healthier ozone layer because of its eco-friendly practices—we can infer that Planet A will have higher levels of UV radiation reaching its surface, as the protective ozone layer is damaged. Answer: Planet A has higher levels of UV radiation reaching its surface."},{"instruction":"Question: Question: The back courtyard led to a walkout basement, where was it attached to?

Only a polar bear,a seal &amp; a whale.","output":"To describe the sentiment of this tweet, one would first need to break it down into its various components and understand the context and the emotions conveyed.  The tweet reads: \\"#DuckRaces in the bath don't quite work. Especially if you have no ducks! Only a polar bear, a seal & a whale.\\" From this tweet, we can glean that it involves a funny or lighthearted situation, where someone is trying to have duck races in a bath. The humor comes from the fact that instead of using ducks, the person has a polar bear, a seal, and a whale, which are not the traditional figures one would associate with duck races. It implies that the races didn't work as intended; hence, the use of the word \\"Especially\\" highlights the absurdity of the situation. The sentiment expressed in this tweet can be described as a mix of amusement, playfulness, and lightheartedness. The amusement comes from the whimsical idea of having duck races in the bath, while the playfulness is evident from the person's attempt to have the races despite not having ducks. The use of a hashtag at the beginning engages the readers and encourages them to relate to the humor. Furthermore, the presence of the polar bear, seal, and whale adds an element of quirkiness to the scenario, bringing a touch of light-heartedness. Overall, the tweet portrays a cheerful, fun atmosphere, with the person perhaps sharing a funny anecdote or personal experience. Although the races didn't work as intended, the sentiment suggests that the person finds humor in the absurdity of the situation, possibly encouraging others to embrace such entertaining moments in their lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At the age of 4, she discovers the local library and walks there every day to read while her father is at work, her mother is playing bingo, and her older brother, Michael (Brian Levinson), is at school. At age six-and-a-half, Matilda begins to lose patience with her parents, expressing a desire to go to school. In retaliation for her father constantly berating her, she adds hydrogen peroxide to his hair tonic, turning his hair an unhealthy blonde. He takes his children to his workshop, where he reveals that the cars he sells are faulty. Matilda accuses him of being dishonest and he belittles her, so she responds by putting super glue on his hat, forcing Zinnia to cut it off of his head. She reads a borrowed library copy of Moby-Dick, which Harry rips up while her family is watching television. When he forces her to watch with them, she becomes increasingly angry and causes the television set to suddenly explode.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: You may have heard the term \\"the American Dream\\". In 1848, James W. Marshall found gold in California and people began having golden dreams. That 19th century \\"American Dream\\" motivated   the Gold Rush and gave California its nickname of the \\"Golden State\\". The American Dream drove not only 1800s gold-rush prospectors but also waves of immigrants throughout that century and the next. People from Europe, and a large number of Chinese, arrived in the US in the 19th century hoping that in America they would find gold in the streets. But most, instead, worked as railroad labourers. They created the oldest Chinatown, in San Francisco, and gave the city a Chinese name \\"the old gold hill\\". In the 20th century, some critics said that it was no longer possible to become prosperous through determination and hard work. Unfair education for students from poor families and racial discrimination almost made the American Dream a nightmare. Then, in the 1990s, California saw a new wave of dreamers in Silicon Valley. People poured their energy into the Internet. This new chapter of the American Dream attracted many business people and young talents from China and India to form start-ups and seek fortunes in America. Better pay, a nice house, and a rising standard of living will always be attractive. However, the new American Dream is no longer just about money. It encourages Americans to consume wisely to protect the environment, improve the quality of life, and promote social justice. The Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has become the model of the new American Dream. After years of hard work, he grew from a poor young man from Austria into a movie superstar and then governor. Many people hope his story can save the American Dream and give California a brighter future. Question: Why did most of the early immigrants work as railroad laborers? - Because they could earn more money as railroad laborers. - Because they had to make a living by working as railroad laborers. - Because they thought railroad was the first step to find gold. - Because railroad laborers were greatly honored at that time. Answer:","output":"Most of the early immigrants worked as railroad laborers because they had to make a living by working as railroad laborers. The arrival of people from Europe and a large number of Chinese immigrants in the 19th century were driven by the \\"American Dream\\" hoping to find gold in the U.S., but instead, many ended up working as railroad laborers. The text does not mention that they chose this job because it paid more, was the first step to finding gold, or because it was a greatly honored position.

The underwater rescue and touching encounter with the turtle afterwards was filmed on a GoPro camera at the start of the year by two friends who were spear fishing off Baja on the Mexican coast. When kite surfer Cameron Dietrich and Colin Sutton spotted the distressed sea turtle they quickly dived in the ocean to try to rescue it. Scroll down for video. Touching: A sea turtle swims nose-to-nose with Cameron Dietrich after he freed it from tangled fishing nets. Rescue: Dietrich uses a dive knife to cut away the tangled mess of nets that had wrapped around the turtle. 'When I saw the turtle tangled up I jumped in the water and began to cut it free,' Dietrich told MailOnline. 'It was totally worn out from fighting for its life for last probably 12 to 20 hours.' Using a dive knife, Dietrich carefully cut away the tangle of rope and netting that had wrapped itself around a front fin, while Sutton helped the turtle to float. Once it had been freed, Dietrich described how he stayed beneath the turtle to make sure it had the strength to swim after its traumatic experience. Reassured that the turtle was going to be fine, Dietrich swam away from it, stopping a short distance away to watch the creature. But in an unexpected move, the turtle slowly circled back and returned to the surfer, stopping inches from his face and letting him gently hold it, as if to say thanks. Dietrich and his friends spotted the turtle in distress while they were spear fishing off the Mexico coast. Colin Sutton films on a GoPro camera as Dietrich dives in to help the turtle. Professional kite surfer Dietrich said sadly it has become common to see turtles and other wildlife injured by debris dumped in the oceans. 'It returned back to me on top of my chest and came right up to my face and. let me touch its under shell,' he said. 'It got right up to my mask then swam off.' 'For me, it was an unusual and wonderful moment,' he added. 'After it came up to my face it swam off into the blue straight.' Dietrich told MaiOnline that as a professional watersports athlete he has seen many animals trapped by the debris dumped in the oceans. 'We are being poor stewards of our ocean. It bothers me to both see the disregard for our planet but also the endangering of animals,' he said. Since the video of the touching rescue was uploaded on YouTube earlier this month it has been viewed more than 1.9 million times. The friends work quickly to free the sea turtle, which calmly allowed Dietrich to get close. The freed sea turtle started to swim away before suddenly turning back towards Dietrich. The turtle swims over to Dietrich and lets him embrace it. Dietrich floated under the turtle for a sort distance, fearing it would be too exhausted to swim after its ordeal with the nets.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Ledyba is a Flying-type bug with three abilities (Early Bird, Rattled, and Swarm), and one hidden ability. You will encounter this bug from red berry trees.  Swarm - When HP is below 1/3rd, the bug's power increases to 1.5 times. Early Bird - Sleep conditions will last for half as long, rounding down. For example, half of three turns is 1.5, which rounds down to one turn. When the number of turns to sleep is one, half of this rounded down is zero, and the Pokémon wakes up instantly. Rattled - Its speed is raised by one stage when the Pokémon is hit by a Bug-type, Ghost-type, or Dark-type move. This bug will target your blueberry trees. It has Illuminate, Swarm, and Prankster ability, and also has one hidden ability, which will be unlocked when it reaches a certain level.  Swarm - The same as Ledyba, this skill increases the bug's power to 1.5 times when HP is below 1/3. Illuminate - Raises the likelihood of meeting wild Pokémon. Prankster - Speed priority of category “Status moves” is increased by 1. This is a  bug-type Pokémon known for its speed. This Pokémon has Oblivious, Tinted Lens, and Prankster ability, with one hidden ability. This Pokémon is classified as Firefly.  Oblivious - The Pokémon cannot be under Attract condition or be taunted while having this ability. Tinted Lens - The power of “Not very effective” moves is doubled. Prankster - Just like Volbeat, Prankster causes the speed priority of category “Status moves” increase by 1. Burmy is classified as a bagworm; this Pokémon can be found in green berry trees and possesses two abilities (Shed Skin and Overcoat) and one hidden ability (available through transfer).  Shed Skin - Every turn, it has 1 in 3 chances of healing from a status condition, such as Burn, Paralyze, Sleep, Poison, and Freeze. Overcoat. - This protects the Pokémon from weather effects and powder moves, such as Sleep Power, Poison Powder, etc. A flying Bug–type Pokémon classified as tiny bee. This Pokémon is known for its speed points and has two abilities (Honey Gather and Hustle) and one hidden (obtained through leveling). This Pokémon can be found in yellow berry trees.  Honey Gather - Pokémon may pick up honey after a battle; the higher the level, the higher the chance. Hustle - Damage from physical attacks is 1.5 times, but average accuracy is only 80%. This bug is found in pink berry trees and is known for its defense points. Classified as scatterdust, Spewpa has two active abilities (Shed Skin and Friend Guard) and one hidden ability (obtain from leveling).  Shed Skin - Every turn, it has 1 in 3 chances of healing from a status condition like burn, paralyze, sleep, poison, and freeze. Friend Guard - In double or triple battles, the ally Pokémon receives reduced damage from any form of attacks.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing... Answer:","output":"Instead of using a machine, Moore carved the relief of The Virgin and Child directly, marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing machine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Rob likes to visit high mountainous locations. Last year he visited the the Alps mountains in Austria. There he saw an unique type of glacier called valley glacier. This year he went further east to visit the Ural mountains in Russia. There he didn't see any valley glacier.  In which year Rob would not observe quarrying effect, this year or last year?  Hint: Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier.","output":"From the given information, it seems that Rob would not observe the quarrying effect, also known as plucking, this year when he visited the Ural Mountains in Russia. This is because the description indicates that this specific type of glacial erosion is particularly associated with valley glaciers, which Rob saw last year in the Alps but did not encounter during his visit to the Ural Mountains. Quarrying, or plucking, happens when a glacier, specifically a valley glacier, moves along a valley. The basal ice at the lower part of the glacier melts as a result of friction, soaking into cracks and crevices in the bedrock. Upon refreezing, the ice can cause these cracks to expand through a process known as hydraulic wedging - a phenomenon that takes place due to volume changes related to the transition between ice and water. This process eventually dislodges large pieces of rock called joint blocks, which then become embedded within the moving glacier. Over time, these joint blocks contribute to the sculpting and reshaping of the valley through which the glacier is moving, leading to the erosion seen in many glaciated landscapes. Since the Ural Mountains did not have any valley glaciers during Rob's visit this year as per the provided information, it means that there were no suitable conditions for the quarrying process to occur. Hence, Rob would not have observed the effects of quarrying during this particular trip.  On the other hand, during his trip to the Alps last year, Rob encountered a valley glacier, so it is likely that he would have observed signs of the quarrying effect. To witness this phenomenon, he may have spotted the joint blocks that had been dislodged from the bedrock and embedded in the ice or recognized patterns of erosion in the mountainous landscape.  It's important to note though, that while valley glaciers are known for their quarrying effect, it doesn't necessarily mean that every valley glacier Rob comes across will showcase signs of quarrying. A lot depends on the specific environmental conditions, the glacier’s rate of movement, the characteristics of the bedrock, and the temperature - factors that can mean the difference between observable erosion activity and a seemingly static block of mountain ice. However, in general terms and based on the information provided, Rob would likely not have noticed the quarrying effect during his trip to the Urals this year."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
