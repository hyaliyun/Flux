Women are luckier, only about one in two hundred is affected in this matter. Perhaps, after all ,it is safer to be driven by a woman. There are different kinds of color blindness. For example, a man cannot see deep red. He may think that red, orange and yellow are all shades   of  green. Sometimes a person can't tell the difference between blue and green. Only a few unlucky men may see everything in shades of green-- a strange world indeed. Color blindness in human beings is a different thing to explain. In only one eye there are millions of very small things called \\"cones \\" . These help us to see in the bright light and to tell differences between colors. These are also millions of \\"rods\\" ,but these are used for seeing when it is nearly dark. They show us shapes but not colors. Some insects have favorite colors. Mosquitoes  like blue but do not like yellow. A red light will not attract insects, but a blue light will. Human beings also have favorite colors. Yet we are lucky. With the help of the cones in our eyes, we can see many beautiful colors by day, and with the help of the rods we can see shapes at night.

To further assist Mexico, the White House on April 15 named a former U.S. Justice Department official to lead efforts to crack down on drug-related violence along the U.S. side of its southwest border with Mexico.  Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced the appointment of Alan Bersin, a former federal prosecutor, during a visit to El Paso, Texas.  Bersin held the same post - dubbed \\"border czar\\" - during the Clinton administration. And three Mexican drug gangs — the Sinaloa cartel, Los Zetas and La Familia Michoacana - have been placed on a list of significant foreign narcotics traffickers targeted for special sanctions, the White House said April 15.

Possible A: supermarket, home, closet, mart, hardware store  Why is \\"supermarket\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","output":"\\"Supermarket\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is typically the primary place where groceries are purchased and where shopping bags are readily available.  Supermarkets often have multiple options for shopping bags, including plastic, paper, and reusable bags, that customers can use for packing their groceries. It is very common for customers to collect their groceries in a shopping cart before proceeding to check out, where the cashier or even the customers themselves will pack the groceries into the shopping bags. In addition to this, supermarkets frequently sell reusable bags at the entrance or near the checkout counters, which encourages customers to adopt a more environmentally friendly approach to packing their groceries. The other possible answers, such as \\"home\\" and \\"closet,\\" are also somewhat valid, as people may store extra bags at home for personal use. Similarly, some people might take bags from home to shopping destinations like marts and hardware stores. However, the ubiquity of shopping bags specifically for groceries makes \\"supermarket\\" the most logical and common response in terms of human common sense."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Crew's house by the cemetery was less than half a mile from where they'd last seen Winston. Walking, it might've taken ten minutes to get there, but on Chloe's Vespa it was a hair-raising three-minute ride away. When they got there, Paul saw no sign of either Winston or Lily, so he assumed they were still inside the rundown shack that passed for a gallery. They parked a block away and approached at a brisk walk, Paul almost jogging to keep up with Chloe's excited strides. Winston was Chloe's mentor in what they referred to as \\"The Life,\\" this being a euphemism for a whole range of different activities, groups and lifestyles that fell under the general category of living underground and off the information grid. Paul, after defrauding his former partners and then running afoul of the law in a very public way, had been living The Life for almost a year and a half now. Chloe, as near as he could tell, had been doing it for almost a decade. Winston had started in the late '60s as a 16-year-old member of the notorious Weather Underground. He not only led his own Crew, he was also in contact with dozens, maybe scores of other such groups all over the world, including Chloe and Paul's little Crew of four. On top of all that, he'd once taken a couple bullets while helping Paul out, so, like Chloe, Paul had a soft spot in his heart for the old man. They hadn't seen him since that bloody night, but Chloe had been in communication with him off and on over the last sixteen months. Winston and his Crew were old school and didn't trust much in the way of electronic communications. Mostly it had been encoded, hand-delivered letters and arcane classified ads in various newspapers. Chloe found this particular breed of paranoia on Winston's part annoying, but Paul admired it. What is probably true about Paul?  A. not enough information  B. He's a child  C. He's a criminal  D.

Surprisingly, his innovative playing initially received greater attention and appreciation among European critics than those in the country of his birth. The British music trade magazine \\"Melody Maker\\" published a number of reviews of his recordings and assessments of his cornet playing. In the April 1927 issue, bandleader Fred Elizalde stated: \\"Bix Bidlebeck (sic) is considered by Red Nichols himself and every other trumpet player in the States, for that matter, as the greatest trumpet player of all time\\". The magazine's editor, Edgar Jackson, was equally fulsome in his praise: \\"Bix has a heart as big as your head, which shines through his playing with the warmth of the sun's rays\\" (September 1927 issue); \\"The next sixteen bars are a trumpet solo by Bix, and if this doesn't get you right in the heart, you'd better see a vet….\\" In Blackboard Jungle, a 1955 film starring Glenn Ford and Sidney Poitier, Beiderbecke's music is briefly featured, but as a symbol of cultural conservatism in a nation on the cusp of the rock and roll revolution. Brendan Wolfe, the author of Finding Bix, spoke of Beiderbecke's lasting influence on Davenport, Iowa: \\"His name and face are still a huge part of the city's identity. There's an annual Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival, and a Bix 7 road race with tens of thousands of runners, Bix T-shirts, bumper stickers, bobble-head dolls, the whole works.\\" In 1971, on the 40th anniversary of Beiderbecke's death, the Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival was founded in Davenport, Iowa, to honor the musician.  In 1974, Sudhalter and Evans published their biography, Bix: Man and Legend, which was nominated for a National Book Award. In 1977, the Beiderbecke childhood home at 1934 Grand Avenue in Davenport was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\\"Bix: 'Ain't None of Them Play Like Him Yet\\", a 1981 film documentary on Beiderbecke's life directed and produced by Brigitte Berman, featured interviews with Hoagy Carmichael, Bill Challis and others, who knew and worked with Bix.

Step-by-step rationale: 1. Ice forms inside a cloud: This is the initial stage where water vapor turns into ice particles within the cloud. 2. Ice inside the cloud bumps around and causes electrostatic charges: As the ice particles collide with one another, they transfer charges, leading to a separation of charges within the cloud. 3. The cloud becomes a thundercloud: The charge separation creates a charged environment, which makes the cloud a thundercloud. 4. Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge: The bottom part of the cloud accumulates a strong negative charge. 5. Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud: Due to the strong negative charge in the cloud, a positive charge is induced on the ground beneath it, as opposite charges attract each other. 6. This positive energy gathers on the ground: The positive charge at the surface of the Earth concentrates below the negatively charged cloud. 7. A lightning discharge occurs between the cloud and the ground: Eventually, the attraction between the positive and negative charges becomes too strong, and a lightning bolt discharges to neutralize the difference in charge, connecting the cloud to the ground.

I know that the answer to the question \\"How did Jefferson avoid Virginia's possible provision of theology at UVA?\\" is in \\"Jefferson's opponents said his position was the destruction and the governmental rejection of Christianity, but this was a caricature. In setting up the University of Virginia, Jefferson encouraged all the separate sects to have preachers of their own, though there was a constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity, arising from his own Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Some have argued that this arrangement was \\"fully compatible with Jefferson's views on the separation of church and state;\\" however, others point to Jefferson's support for a scheme in which students at the University would attend religious worship each morning as evidence that his views were not consistent with strict separation. Still other scholars, such as Mark David Hall, attempt to sidestep the whole issue by arguing that American jurisprudence focuses too narrowly on this one Jeffersonian letter while failing to account for other relevant history\\". Can you tell me what it is?","output":"Jefferson avoided Virginia's possible provision of theology at the University of Virginia (UVA) by establishing a system that respected the separation of church and state while still allowing religious expression on campus. He achieved this by encouraging various religious sects to have their own preachers at the university, without providing any government support for a specific Professorship of Divinity. This approach was in line with his Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, which established a constitutional ban on state-supported religion. While some argue that this arrangement shows that Jefferson supported a strict separation between church and state, others point to his support for a scheme where students at UVA would attend religious worship each morning as evidence of a more nuanced stance. In conclusion, Jefferson managed to avoid the provision of theology at UVA by creating an environment that welcomed religious expression without directly involving the government in funding or endorsing a particular religious doctrine. By doing so, he demonstrated a commitment to upholding religious freedom, even while navigating the complexities of establishing a new public university."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.  - Lake Michigan is one of the five Great Lakes of North America and the only one located entirely within the United States. The other four Great Lakes are shared by the U.S. and Canada. It is the second-largest of the Great Lakes by volume and the third-largest by surface area, after Lake Superior and Lake Huron (and is slightly smaller than the U.S. state of West Virginia). To the east, its basin is conjoined with that of Lake Huron through the wide Straits of Mackinac, giving it the same surface elevation as its easterly counterpart; the two are technically a single lake. Lake Michigan is shared, from west to east, by the U.S. states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. Ports along its shores include, Chicago, Milwaukee, Green Bay, Wisconsin, Gary, Indiana, and Benton Harbor, Michigan. The word \\"Michigan\\" originally referred to the lake itself, and is believed to come from the Ojibwa word \\"mishigami\\" meaning \\"great water\\". In the earliest European maps of the region, the name of Lake Illinois has been found in addition to that of \\"Michigan\\".  - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo.  - A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from \\"musical form\\" and \\"musical style\\", although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Recently, academics have argued that categorizing music by genre is inaccurate and outdated.  - Lake Forest is a city located in Lake County, Illinois, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 19,375. The city is along the shore of Lake Michigan, and is a part of the Chicago metropolitan area and the North Shore. Lake Forest was founded around Lake Forest College and was laid out as a town in 1857 as a stop for travelers making their way south to Chicago. The Lake Forest City Hall, designed by Charles Sumner Frost, was completed in 1898 and originally housed the fire department, the Lake Forest Library, and city offices.  - The Jazz Age was a period in the 1920s, ending with the Great Depression, in which jazz music and dance styles became popular, mainly in the United States, but also in Britain, France and elsewhere. Jazz originated in New Orleans as a fusion of African and European music and played a significant part in wider cultural changes in this period, and its influence on pop culture continued long afterwards. The Jazz Age is often referred to in conjunction with the Roaring Twenties.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - African-American music is an umbrella term covering a diverse range of musics and musical genres largely developed by African Americans. Their origins are in musical forms that arose out of the historical condition of slavery that characterized the lives of African Americans prior to the American Civil War.  - Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770.  - Improvisation is broad term referring to the process of devising an atypical method of solving a problem due to lack of time or resources. In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation, within the context of performing arts, is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines.  - Ragtime  also spelled rag-time or rag time  is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - Lake County is a county in the northeastern corner of the U.S. state of Illinois. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 703,462, making it the third-most populous county in Illinois. Its county seat is Waukegan. Originally part of McHenry County, the townships composing Lake County were carved out into a separate county in 1839.

To do this, we will subtract 22 from both sides of the equation: 2*k + 22 - 22 = 0 - 22 This simplifies to: 2*k = -22 Step 3: Solve for 'k' Now that we have isolated the variable 'k', we will solve for it. Since 2*k equals -22, we just need to divide -22 by 2. k = (-22) / 2 Dividing -22 by 2 gives us: k = -11 So, the solution to the equation 2*k + 171 - 149 = 0 is k = -11."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: Faster computers allowed the creation of models that incorporated differences in behavior. The Nobel committee cited Professor Deaton’s work around 1980 in modeling demand for individual goods, which was both some of the earliest work in that vein and a model that remains in wide use.      In continuing his research, he found that rising incomes tend to improve calorie intake for the poorest families, but the effect diminishes at higher income levels. Aggregate statistics, as a result, obscured the benefits of income gains for very poor families.      “What he’s shown is that you do learn a great deal more by looking at the behavior that underlies the aggregates,” said Duncan Thomas, an economist at Duke University and another former student.      Professor Thomas said he also admired Professor Deaton’s clarity. “He will bring evidence to the table in a way that makes you say, ‘Well, of course that has to be right,’ ” Professor Thomas said.      Professor Deaton said he hoped “carefulness in measurement” would be his legacy. He said his mentor, Richard Stone, a Cambridge professor who won the Nobel in economics in 1984, had ingrained in him the importance of good data. “I’ve always wanted to be like him,” Professor Deaton said. “I think putting numbers together into a coherent framework always seemed to me to be what really matters.”      His work also is marked by an insistence that theories must explain these more complicated sets of facts. “A good theoretical account must explain all of the evidence that we see,” Professor Deaton wrote in a 2011 essay on his life in economics. “If it doesn’t work everywhere, we have no idea what we are talking about, and all is chaos.” ||||| A Scottish economist and son of a Yorkshire miner has been awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in economics for his pioneering work measuring poverty around the world.      Angus Deaton, 69, became the 47th recipient of the Nobel, which was announced by Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm today.      BREAKING NEWS The 2015 Prize in Economic Sciences is awarded to 69 years old Angus Deaton @Princeton #NobelPrize pic.twitter.com/8iHMo0CcPX      He received the accolade for three decades of research analysing welfare in the developing world and the relationship between income and spending.      \\"Mr Deaton's work has helped transform the fields of microeconomics, macroeconomics & development economics\\" said the Royal Swedish Academy.      The decision to award the prize to an economist whose work has influenced public policy on aid and poverty, was widely praised.      US economist Tyler Cowen said Mr Deaton was \\"a brilliant, excellent selection\\". He described him as an \\"economist who looks more closely at what poor households consume to get a better sense of their living standards and possible paths for economic development.      \\"He truly, deeply understands the implications of economic growth, the benefits of modernity, and political economy\\" said Mr Cowen.      Mr Deaton, who holds both US and British citizenship, taught at the Universities of Cambridge and Bristol, before moving to the US.      He said he was \\"surprised and delighted\\" albeit a little \\"sleepy\\" when he received the call from Stockholm at his US home on Monday morning.      Aid is guided less by the needs of the recipients than by the donor country’s domestic and international interests. Angus Deaton      Born in Edinburgh in 1945, Angus Deaton is the son of a Yorkshire miner who later became a civil engineer. Mr Deaton fulfilled his father's dream by gaining a scholarship to study at the prestigious Fettes College in Edinburgh aged 13.      \\"My father believed in education, and he liked to measure things\\" wrote Mr Deaton in 2011.      \\"He was determined that I should be educated properly, and set his heart on sending me to Fettes College... whose annual fees were well in excess of his salary\\".      While at Cambridge, Mr Deaton said he \\"found economics much more to my taste than mathematics\\". He left Cambridge to briefly work for the Bank of England, but soon returned for his post-graduate study, later receiving his PhD in economics.      \\"He was in a bit of shock...but I think he was very very happy\\" said prize giver and friend, professor Jakob Svensson.      Mr Deaton's most recent book, \\"The Great Escape\\" was published in 2013. In it he argues that foreign aid from western governments has done more harm than good to developing nations, saying that it has helped prop up corrupt governments and rarely reaches the poor.      \\"The idea that global poverty could be eliminated if only rich people or rich countries were to give more money to poor people or to poor countries, however appealing, is wrong\\", he wrote in 2013.      \\"These simplistic beliefs are based on a misdiagnosis of what it is that is keeping people poor\\".      The Deaton choice will not make the aid industry happy. He is a vocal critic of foreign aid. — Dani Rodrik (@rodrikdani) October 12, 2015      Economist Justin Wolfers described him as \\"one of the great microeconomists and microeconometricians of our time.\\"      \\"Deaton has worked tirelessly to understand the lot of the poor\\".      Angus Deaton has been one of the pioneering researchers on the economics of happiness & well-being. — Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) October 12, 2015      Last year, the award - which is officially known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in memory of Alfred Nobel - went to French economist Jean Tirole for his pioneering work on the regulation of large companies.      This prize has been awarded every year since 1969.      Mr Deaton had been touted as one of the leading candidates for this year's Nobel. Other candidates had included British economist and professor at University College London, Sir Robert Blundell.      What did Angus Deaton win the Nobel prize for?      Angus Deaton is one of the world's foremost economists specialising in the nature of poverty and living standards in the developing world.      His contribution to economic science hinges on pioneering ways to measure poverty at the individual rather than societal level. Mr Deaton's research, mainly in India, has focussed on using household survey data to show relationships between income and consumption, concentrating on aspects such as calorie intake and food demand when incomes rise and fall.      His findings have also given birth to the \\"Deaton Paradox\\" - the observation that short sudden shocks to people's income do not have large effects on consumption.      In 1980, Mr Deaton developed a model called the \\"Almost Ideal Demand System\\", an intuitive way of estimating how the demand for each good depends on the prices of all goods and on individual incomes ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. |||||","output":"Scottish economist Angus Deaton has been awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in economics for his innovative work on measuring poverty around the world.

The difference between sociology and psychology? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Pick your answer from: i. no ii. yes","output":"To calculate the least living expense for an international student in Toronto, we need to consider several factors, such as housing, transportation, food, utilities, and other miscellaneous expenses. Here's a breakdown of the costs: 1. Housing: Rental prices depend on the area and type of accommodation. On average, university residence or dormitory can cost around CAD 1,000 - CAD 1,500 per month. If you choose to live off-campus, a shared apartment could range from CAD 800 to CAD 1,200 per month. 2. Utilities: Utility costs depend on your housing choice. If you are living in a university dormitory, utilities are often included in the rent. For off-campus accommodations, utilities can vary from CAD 100 to CAD 200 per month. 3. Transportation: A monthly public transportation pass for students in Toronto costs around CAD 122. If you're traveling pre-dominantly within walking distance, you can minimize your transportation expenses. 4. Food: Cooking meals at home is the most cost-effective choice. On average, grocery expenses can range from CAD 200 to CAD 400 per month. Eating out occasionally or in the university cafeteria can bring your food costs to around CAD 400 to CAD 600 per month, depending on your food choices and frequency of eating out. 5. Miscellaneous Expenses: These include expenses such as entertainment, personal care items, clothing, and more. Depending on your needs, these can range from CAD 100 to CAD 300 per month. To be on the lower end of the expenses, an international student might need a minimum budget of CAD 1,300 to CAD 1,700 per month to cover all living expenses in Toronto. Now let's address the second part of the question about the difference between sociology and psychology: Sociology and psychology are two distinct fields of study that explore human behavior and society, but with different perspectives and methodologies. Sociology is the scientific study of society and human interaction within social groups. It focuses on analyzing the structures, cultures, and institutions of societies to understand how they influence individual and collective behavior. Sociologists observe patterns, norms, social inequalities, and interactions to identify how various social factors contribute to human behavior, including race, class, gender, age, and religion. Some primary research areas in sociology include families, organizations, crime, urbanization, social inequality, social change, and social movements. On the other hand, psychology is the scientific study of the human mind and its functions, particularly those affecting behavior in a given context. Psychologists are interested in understanding mental processes, emotions, motivations, and personality traits that drive individual actions. The focus of psychology lies predominantly at the individual level, but it also touches upon interpersonal and group dynamics. Major fields in psychology include cognitive, developmental, clinical, neuropsychology, social, industrial-organizational, and forensic psychology, among others. In summary, sociology primarily examines social structures and group dynamics, while psychology focuses on individual mental processes and behaviors. Regarding the multi-choice problem, it seems that the question is asking whether two distinct questions are the same. Since these questions - the living expense calculation for Toronto and the difference between sociology and psychology - are not the same, the answer to the multi-choice problem would be: i. no"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He lives on a London council estate ruled by violent gangs and spends most of his time playing chess with his friend, Len Attwell, at a local pub owned by Sid Rourke. When the hospital phones to tell him that his wife, Kath, is dying, Harry is too late because he is scared to take a shortcut through a narrow underpass, where a gang holds court. His wife is laid to rest next to the grave of their thirteen-year-old daughter, Rachel, who died in 1973. Len confides to Harry that he is being terrorized by youths and shows him an old bayonet he now carries to defend himself; with the police unable to help, he plans to confront his harassers himself. The next day, Harry is visited by Detective Inspector Alice Frampton and Detective Sergeant Terry Hicock, who tell him that Len has been murdered. The police arrest Noel Winters, the leader of a drug-dealing gang, along with members Carl, Dean and Marky, but are released due to lack of evidence. Harry gets drunk after Len's funeral, and is then held at knife-point by Dean, who intends to rob him; Harry kills Dean with his own knife during a brief struggle. Frampton visits Harry in the morning to inform him that because Len was killed with his own bayonet, any charges could be reduced to manslaughter on the basis of self-defense, leaving Harry feeling angry and betrayed. Harry follows a drug dealer, Kenny, to a den where he negotiates to buy a pistol. Inside, Harry finds Kenny and his associate, Stretch, growing cannabis and sexually abusing an overdosing girl to make pornographic films. Harry kills the dealers before burning down their den, fleeing with the girl and a bag of firearms in a stolen Land Rover. He leaves the girl outside a hospital, and later follows Marky to find him being sexually abused by Troy Martindale, a heroin smuggler that supplies drugs to the gang.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many field goals did Akers kick?","output":"Title: The Field Goal Legacy of David Akers: A Comprehensive Look into His NFL Career Introduction: Assessing the Triumphs of David Akers Throughout the history of the National Football League (NFL), placekickers have played a vital role on any team's path to success. Though they may not directly engage in the game's physicality, their sharp precision and timely scoring ability can be the thin line between victory and defeat. One name that stands out in the world of placekickers is David Akers, a former NFL standout who spent more than a decade assisting his teams in climbing to the highest peaks of American football. In this article, we will explore Akers' accomplishments, specifically by answering the question: How many field goals did Akers kick during his professional career? David Akers: The Journey from Rookie to Pro-Bowler Born on December 9, 1974, in Lexington, Kentucky, David Roy Akers would grow up to become one of the most accurate and consistent placekickers in NFL history. Although his initial entry to the NFL was unassuming - as an undrafted free agent in 1997 - Akers' perseverance and unwavering dedication to his craft would soon set him on a path to greatness. He began his career with the Atlanta Falcons before joining the Washington Redskins for a season. However, it was with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1999 when things began to look up for Akers. From 1999 to 2010, Akers was a staple on the Eagles' roster, participating in five Pro Bowls and achieving two All-Pro honors. After a successful run in Philadelphia, he played for the San Francisco 49ers for two seasons, and he concluded his career with the Detroit Lions in 2013. A Field Goal Tally to Remember Throughout Akers' illustrious 16-year NFL career, he was no stranger to making high-pressure kicks with formidable accuracy. So, how many field goals did he make in his tenure? Examining the available statistics on David Akers' professional career, we find that he accumulated a total of 386 successful field goals, out of 477 attempted kicks. This impressive track record places Akers 12th on the all-time list of successful field goals made in NFL history. His field goal percentage of 80.9% demonstrates his remarkable consistency and reliability throughout his career. Akers' regular-season field goals were not the only highlight of his career. David also had a penchant for shining bright in playoff matches. During his postseason appearances, Akers successfully completed 39 field goals out of 45 attempts. This record made him the all-time leader for postseason field goals before he was surpassed by Adam Vinatieri and Stephen Gostkowski. Legacy and Conclusion Over his 16-year career, David Akers had undoubtedly made a significant impact on the numerous teams he played for and their successes throughout the years. With a total of 386 field goals during the regular season and an additional 39 in the playoffs, Akers etched his name in the annals of NFL history, proving that hard work, dedication, and the ability to perform under pressure can take an undrafted free agent to the pinnacle of his profession. As we look back on the storied career of David Akers, it's hard not to be in awe of the sheer number of clutch moments he provided for his teams, helping snatch victory from the jaws of defeat on countless occasions. Through his on-field successes, Akers has left an indelible mark on the NFL, ensuring his place in the pantheon of the greatest placekickers to ever grace the league."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's clear how U.S. officials feel (they're outraged) about Russia's military activities in Ukraine's Crimea region and along the border between the two neighbors. Here's what others are saying or doing: China A neighbor and often an ally of Russia, China is distancing itself from Russia's troop movements. \\"It is China's long-standing position not to interfere in others' internal affairs,\\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Qin Gang said. \\"We respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.\\" At the same time, Qin suggested that Ukraine isn't completely faultless. \\"There has been a distinct change in the tone of the markets today as the OPTIONS: - Angela Merkel-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - CNN-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - China-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - Chinese Foreign Ministry-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - Crimea-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - European Union-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - German-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - Putin-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - Qin-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - Qin Gang-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - Russia-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - U.S.-Ukraine crisis stabilizes. - Ukraine-Ukraine crisis stabilizes.","output":"Correct Answer(s):  - \\"China-Ukraine crisis stabilizes.\\" Explanation:  The paragraph quotes a major player in the ongoing situation - China - and cites a statement from its Foreign Ministry. The talk about the \\"distinct change in the tone\\" likely refers to the feedback and response from these stakeholders.  Why other answers are wrong: - \\"Angela Merkel-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" and \\"German-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" are incorrect because Angela Merkel and Germany weren't mentioned in the paragraph.  - \\"CNN-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" is also incorrect. Even though the source is CNN, the network itself doesn't play a role within the events of the story.  - \\"Chinese Foreign Ministry-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" is not a complete fit as the paragraph refers directly to China and its stance, not the Ministry alone.  - \\"Crimea-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" would be incorrect because Crimea is the subject of dispute, not an active player in the geopolitics. - It's similar with the \\"European Union-Ukraine crisis stabilizes,\\" as the EU wasn't mentioned.  - \\"Putin-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" and \\"Russia-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" are incorrect because these entities are causing the situation, not responding to it.  - \\"Qin-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" and \\"Qin Gang-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" aren't fitting as they are individual personalities and the sentence requires a collective response. - \\"U.S.-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" is irrelevant here, as the paragraph does not discuss the U.S.'s response to a stabilization of the crisis. - \\"Ukraine-Ukraine crisis stabilizes\\" is incorrect because it would be redundant and odd for Ukraine to react to its own crisis in this context.

What is a very short summary of the above text?","output":"A former official from Anhui Province, East China, convicted of corruption, has sued a reporter for writing that she used sexual favors for career progression.  Could you please elaborate further on the situation? Reporters play a critical role in bringing to light essential news relating to various issues, including corruption cases. However, they also bear the responsibility to ensure the accuracy of their reporting and respect individuals' reputations. In this specific case happening in East China's Anhui Province, there involves an ex-official convicted of graft who has become the center of attention. Graft is a form of corruption where an official uses their station or status to gain personal benefit, violating their duties and the rights of others. It's a widespread issue in many regions around the world, and China, unfortunately, is no stranger to it, having encountered several high-profile graft cases throughout its recent history. The disgraced official in question here decided to take legal action against a reporter. This reporter's alleged claim is that this official traded sexual favors in return for career advancement, a serious charge that adds a different, potentially more pernicious layer to the graft conviction. These allegations imply that she had exploited her sexuality to achieve her professional objectives, which, if true, gives a darker undertone to the initial graft case. On the other hand, if these accusations are unfounded, they can represent a case of defamation, which is the act of damaging someone's good reputation by making false statements. Defamation can be extremely harmful, leading to serious emotional distress and damage to a person's reputation that can be hard to repair. Therefore, it's understandable why the ex-official would want to defend herself against such serious allegations, even amidst a graft conviction. This case represents a complex blend of corruption and potential defamation, all of which will need to be carefully investigated to ensure that justice is done. Regardless of the lawsuit's outcome, it underscores the need for greater transparency, accountability, and respect for individual rights in both the realm of politics and journalism. This incident will no doubt spark debate on the dynamics of power, gender, and media ethics, particularly in regions like East China's Anhui Province where graft has been an issue.  Ultimately, the ramifications of this case will extend beyond just the individuals involved, potentially leading to increased scrutiny of corruption and media practices in the region and perhaps in other parts of China as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Diaper Chump Review: We have 2 children in diapers, so our diaper pail is an essential piece of equipment. We retired our Diaper Genie and moved on the Diaper Champ because it doesn't require special bags. We were very disappointed in the performance. It did absolutely nothing for odor control. You could smell diapers down the hall. My son also found it very amusing to put his toys into the Diaper Champ, as it was a little too easy to operate. We switched back to the Diaper Genie. Answer:","output":"Based on the review provided by the customer, we can infer that they were dissatisfied with the Diaper Champ product. There are several reasons that lead to this conclusion. Firstly, the customer mentions that they had high expectations for the Diaper Champ since it doesn't require special bags. However, they were disappointed with its performance when it came to odor control. The fact that they could smell diapers down the hall indicates that the product didn't meet their expectations in this area, which is a significant factor for any diaper pail's effectiveness. Secondly, the customer's son found it amusing to put his toys into the Diaper Champ, which suggests that the product was not designed optimally in terms of child safety and user friendliness. The ease with which their child could operate it points to a design flaw that could potentially lead to more dissatisfaction from the user's perspective. Lastly, the customer ultimately decided to switch back to the Diaper Genie, which shows their clear dissatisfaction with the Diaper Champ. By reverting to their previous diaper pail choice, they demonstrated that the Diaper Champ didn't offer a satisfactory solution to their diaper disposal needs.  In conclusion, the customer was definitely dissatisfied with their experience using the Diaper Champ, as evidenced by their disappointment in the product's performance, concerns about its ease-of-use, and decision to switch back to their previous diaper pail choice."},{"instruction":"Long bus rides are like television shows.

Here is a goal: To make a ham sandwich, Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of making a ham sandwich, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Gather Ingredients and Equipment Justify: You'll need all the essential ingredients and appropriate equipment to make a ham sandwich. Ingredients: - Bread (2 slices) - Ham (2-4 slices) - Cheese (optional) - Lettuce (optional) - Tomato (optional) - Mayonnaise, mustard, or other desired condiments (optional) Equipment: - Toaster (optional, for toasting bread) - Knife (for spreading condiments and cutting the sandwich) - Plate Step 2: Prepare the Bread Justify: Preparing the bread ensures the base of your sandwich is ready for building. - If you prefer toasted bread, place the two slices of bread in the toaster and toast it to your desired level of crispiness. - If you do not want to toast your bread, skip to the next step. Step 3: Spread Condiments Justify: Spreading condiments on the bread adds flavor and prevents the bread from becoming soggy from other ingredients. - Decide which condiments you'd like to use (such as mayonnaise, mustard, or both). - Use a knife to spread the desired condiments evenly on one or both slices of bread. Step 4: Add Ham Justify: Adding ham is the key component of the sandwich, providing protein and flavor. - Place 2-4 slices of ham onto one slice of bread (the one with condiments if you have only applied it to one side), ensuring even coverage. Step 5: Add Additional Ingredients (Optional) Justify: Additional ingredients such as cheese, lettuce, and tomato can enhance the sandwich by providing extra flavors, textures, and nutrients. - If desired, add a slice of cheese on top of the ham. - If desired, wash and pat-dry lettuce leaves and stack them on top of the cheese or ham. - If desired, wash and slice a tomato and place the slices on top of the cheeses or lettuce. Step 6: Assemble the Sandwich Justify: This step brings everything together to form the completed ham sandwich. - Place the other slice of bread on top of the sandwich, condiment-side down (if you applied condiments to both slices). - Press down lightly to help the sandwich hold together. Step 7: Cut and Serve Justify: Cutting the sandwich makes it easier to eat and serve. - Use a knife to cut the sandwich diagonally or straight down the middle. - Transfer the sandwich halves onto a plate and serve. Following these steps accomplishes the goal efficiently and ensures a consistent, satisfying ham sandwich every time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common.  Paragraph: two buildings had different tenants.

Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere.  Question: \\"What did the book The Rebel bring about?\\" Response: \\"The final split with Sartre\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? Choices: -- no -- yes","output":"yes The response is factually correct because in the paragraph, it is mentioned that after publishing the book \\"The Rebel,\\" it brought about the final split between Camus and Sartre.

Q:Two climate experts studied different continent to observe climate changes. Jordan studied Australia, while Jeb studied Antarctica.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person observed autumn cooling?  Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

It is composed of Gary LeVox, his second cousin Jay DeMarcus and Joe Don Rooney. DeMarcus is also a brother-in-law of country music singer James Otto, and formerly one-half of the Christian music duo East to West. They are best known for performing a cover of Tom Cochrane's \\"Life Is a Highway\\". In early 2000, the group made its debut with the single \\"Prayin' for Daylight\\", a song that had been on the three-song demo that had gotten the band signed. The song, which reached No. 3 on the Billboard country charts, was the first single from their self-titled debut, which was issued in early 2000 on Lyric Street. Following \\"Prayin' for Daylight\\", the album's other three singles all made top ten on that chart: \\"This Everyday Love\\", \\"While You Loved Me\\", and \\"I'm Movin' On\\", which respectively peaked at No. 9, 7, and 4. \\"I'm Movin' On\\" was awarded Song of the Year by the Academy of Country Music in 2002. Stephen Thomas Erlewine reviewed the album with favor, calling it \\"a sunny, pleasing modern country-pop album\\".  Melt was the title of their second album, released in 2002. Unlike their previous album, Rascal Flatts co-produced Melt. Its first single, \\"These Days\\", also became their first No. 1 single on the country chart. The album included two more top ten hits, \\"Love You Out Loud\\" and \\"I Melt\\", and the band's second number-one single, \\"Mayberry\\". The music video for \\"I Melt\\" featured partial nudity and was banned from the Great American Country network.  Rascal Flatts's third album was entitled Feels Like Today, released in late 2004. The album's title track was its first single, followed by \\"Bless the Broken Road\\". The latter song was originally recorded by its co-writer, Marcus Hummon, and had also been recorded by Melodie Crittenden (whose version made the country chart in 1998), Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and Sons of the Desert. In early 2005, Rascal Flatts's version of the song spent five weeks at No. 1, followed by \\"Fast Cars and Freedom\\", which also hit No. 1. While the latter was climbing the charts, some radio stations began playing a hidden track on the album, titled \\"Skin\\". This airplay caused \\"Skin\\" to enter the top 40, and after \\"Fast Cars and Freedom\\", it was released as a single under the title \\"Skin (Sarabeth)\\" and officially added to the album's track list.

What is the answer to this question? where did the first trade center of danish company was established?","output":"The first trading center of a Danish company was established in Tranquebar, India. This trading center was set up by the Danish East India Company, also known as \\"Østindisk Kompagni\\" in Danish. The Danish East India Company was a Denmark-born trading company operating in India and similar Southeast Asian regions from 1616 to 1669. It was modeled after the successful Dutch East India Company, a chartered company of Dutch merchants. The primary objective was to carry out trade operations for the economic benefit of Denmark. The first trading center was established in 1620, in the coastal town of Tranquebar, also known as Tharangambadi, which is situated in the southern state of Tamil Nadu in India. This was made possible after a treaty was signed between the kingdom of Denmark and the Thanjavur Nayak kingdom, giving them the right to establish a fort and trading post in Tharangambadi. The trading center was known as Fort Dansborg, which became the seat of the Danish trade in South India. The Danish East India Company, under the leadership of Admiral Ove Gjedde, took a fleet to India. Despite having an initial trading relationship that seemed promising, the company failed to make the meaningful impact on trade they had hoped for. By the mid-17th century, the Danish East India Company, which was inadequately funded and lacked the necessary naval power as well, was unable to effectively compete in the area. The company was eventually liquidated. However, the Danish presence in Tranquebar continued long after the dissolution of the Danish East India Company. It lasted for about 225 years, from 1620 to 1845, before its territories were sold to the British East India Company in 1845. Fort Dansborg, which served as the trading center, has been preserved and is now utilized as a museum showcasing the Danish influence on the region and its history. Its establishment marks an important chapter in the cultural and trade history of Denmark and its involvement in the colonial era of South Asia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On the third play of the game, Brady attempted a deep pass to Moss; it was intercepted by rookie cornerback Vontae Davis at the Dolphins' 7-yard line and returned 15 yards. Six plays later, the Dolphins moved into Patriots territory on a 21-yard catch by tight end Joey Haynos from Chad Henne; after the catch, McGowan forced Haynos to fumble, but the ball went out of bounds at the spot of the catch, the Patriots' 39-yard line. On the next play, Henne appeared to have been strip-sacked by Banta-Cain, with linebacker Adalius Thomas returning it 59 yards for a touchdown. However, the Dolphins challenged that Henne's arm was moving forward and it was an incomplete pass and the play was reversed. Three plays later, a Dan Carpenter 52-yard field goal gave the Dolphins a 3-0 lead. The Patriots began their next drive at their own 37-yard line after offensive lineman Dan Connolly returned a short kickoff 16 yards. A few plays later, Brady connected with Moss on a 36-yard pass to the Dolphins' 1-yard line; Maroney then ran for a 1-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 7-3 lead. On the ensuing possession, Henne found his other tight end, Anthony Fasano on a 20-yard strike to move into Patriots territory, but a \\"Wildcat\\" formation run by Ricky Williams for a loss and a sack by Chung moved the Dolphins out of field goal territory and forced a punt. The Patriots advanced to the Dolphins' 42-yard line on their next drive before punting on the final play of the first quarter. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots began an 11-play, 49-yard drive that reached the Dolphins' 11-yard line on first down before a short pass, and incompletion, and sack led to a Gostkowski field goal; the 30-yarder put the Patriots ahead 10-3. The Dolphins introduced rookie quarterback Pat White on their next drive, employing him as part of an option offense that first had White run for a 33-yard gain and later in the drive had White option to Williams for a 15-yard touchdown run, tying the game. Following a 34-yard punt return by Tate, the Patriots quickly moved back into Dolphins territory on completions of 14 yards to Faulk and 23 yards to Watson. However, a Watson pass interference penalty on a 17-yard Faulk reception pushed the Patriots back to the Dolphins' 35-yard line. Gostkowski would later kick a 38-yard field goal to re-establish a Patriots lead at 13-10. On their next drive, the Dolphins would punt shortly after the two-minute warning, setting up a 10-play, 70-yard Patriots drive that ended the half with a 34-yard Gostkowski field goal after Brady was again sacked in the red zone. With possession and down 16-10 at the start of the third quarter, the Dolphins moved downfield on a 16-play drive that lasted more than ten minutes, eventually scoring on a 1-yard touchdown catch by Haynos from running back Ronnie Brown out of the \\"Wildcat,\\" giving the Dolphins a 17-16 lead. Three plays later, Brady and Moss connected on a 71-yard touchdown pass and then again on the two-point conversion to re-take the lead at 24-17. The Dolphins would continue to employ both White and the \\"Wildcat\\" on their next drive, but it resulted in a Brandon Fields punt early in the fourth quarter. An exchange of punts consumed the next six minutes of the game, with the Dolphins choosing to use all three of their timeouts to gain back possession with 3:38 left. However, three straight incompletions and a penalty set up fourth down, when Henne again was unable to complete a pass from his own 27-yard line. The Patriots re-gained possession and ran the ball three times before Gostkowski kicked a 40-yard field goal to extend the Patriots' lead to 27-17. The game would end four plays later on a 23-yard Greg Camarillo reception to the Patriots' 23-yard line. The win bettered the Patriots record to 6-2 entering their matchup with the 8-0 Colts. How many total points were scored in the game?","output":"The total points scored in the game were 44. The Patriots scored 27 points and the Dolphins scored 17 points. 27 (for the Patriots) plus 17 (for the Dolphins) equals 44 points in total."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Tactical breathing is used in the military to calm combatants. It's highly effective at calming your body when it's in an anxious state. Practice tactical breathing a little every day, even when you are calm, so that you will already know how to do it when you are nervous.  Breathe in through your nose for a slow 4-count. Hold your breath for a slow 4-count. Breathe out through your mouth for a slow 4-count. Hold your breath for a slow 4-count. Repeat this process four times. Many people find that their hands do not shake if they clench a different muscle. Try clenching your buttocks or your thigh muscles. Your audience won't be able to tell, and it just might stop your shaky hands or any other shaky body part. You may have noticed yourself pressing on your temples or rubbing your hands when you're stressed. You do this because it stimulates nearby bundles of nerves and releases cortisol, which can help calm your nervous system. To subtly release some relaxation onstage, press some fingers into the fleshy part of your hand between your fingers and thumb. You can do this behind your back, or behind a podium while you speak. If you shake from anxiety, a therapist may be able to help you find ways to lessen your symptoms. If your shaking is changing and becoming worse, let your doctor know. Your doctor may also refer you to a therapist who can help you come up with a long-term plan for dealing with your anxiety. While anxiety can cause tremors, it's also possible that another condition is contributing to your shaking. Your doctor can help you investigate the possibility of an underlying condition. Summary:","output":"Tactical breathing is a technique used in the military to help combatants calm down during anxious situations. It involves inhaling through the nose for a 4-count, holding the breath for a 4-count, exhaling through the mouth for a 4-count, and holding the breath again for a 4-count, then repeating the process four times. Practicing this daily can prepare you to use it effectively when feeling nervous. To reduce shaking, try clenching a muscle, such as the buttocks or thigh muscles.

She played golf and used her connections to find clients that included Somerset Maugham and Samuel Beckett. She was involved with the noted production of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot in 1956 and holidayed with Maugham in France. She notably told John Osborne to \\"think again\\" about his play Look Back in Anger that transformed British theatre. Black was fluent in French and so in love with France that she was sometimes called \\"Noir\\". She created translations of plays that were enabled not only be her fluency in French but with her knowledge of theatre after reading so many plays as a literary agent. Her translations included Crime Passionel by Jean Paul Sartre. She also translated his play \\"Morts sans Sépulture\\" and was thrilled when the director said that it was perfect. In partnership with Michael Flanders, she translated Stravinsky's Histoire du soldat for the Edinburgh Festival. The work played to capacity audiences in Edinburgh, and again in London at the Royal Festival Hall in 1956 with Flanders as the narrator, Sir Ralph Richardson as the Soldier and Peter Ustinov as the Devil.

Containers for caterpillars can be found in hobby and pet shops, on the Internet, or you can fashion one from items around the home. Preferably this should be one made from wire mesh, to give the caterpillar something to cling to. An aquarium or a one-gallon jar can work, too, provided it's lined with a screen or cheesecloth tightened with a rubber band at the top.  Don't use jar lids with holes in them, however, as these don't provide adequate ventilation and can also cut the delicate caterpillars with sharp edges around the holes. Put a two inch layer of dirt and grass on the bottom of every container if you think your caterpillar may pupate below ground. If not, a layer of paper towels or newspaper will do fine. Instead of spraying or squishing the caterpillar, identify it (see Warnings) and capture it to grow into a butterfly. Butterfly season is from late spring to summer, depending on your region.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Don't get overwhelmed by a class presentation or a long paper. Remember that you don't have to finish a project in one sitting.  List all the different steps you must complete to finish the project. Make a schedule that forces you to finish one small piece of the project per day. For a paper, you might read and summarize one source on day one; another source on day two, a third source on day three; synthesize their arguments on day four; outline your argument on day five; integrate quotations from your sources into your outline on day six; write your paper on days seven and eight; rest on day nine; and revise on day ten. If you want to stay motivated in school, you need something to look forward to. Bargain with yourself: if you study for two hours, you can watch your favorite TV show at 8:00. If you get an A on your paper, you'll take the whole weekend off and just relax.  Remember that nobody can work all the time. Give yourself a little time off when you deserve it. If you don't meet your goals, keep yourself to your promise. If you goof off on social media for half of the two hours you were supposed to be studying, don't let yourself watch your favorite TV show! If you don't achieve the work goals you set for yourself, give yourself a punishment. You'll work harder during the week if slacking off means you can't go to the movies with your friends over the weekend. Spread the news: you're setting a high bar for yourself. Tell your friends, your parents, tell everyone you know that you plan on bringing your English grade up to a B by the end of the semester, or that you're going to ace the chemistry test. By telling others about your goals, you will work harder to avoid the embarrassment of failing to meet those goals. If you work your best and still fail to meet those goals, don't be discouraged. Redouble your efforts. With hard work and time, you'll meet your goals. Summary:","output":"To effectively manage and complete your class presentation or paper, break the project into smaller, manageable tasks and create a schedule to tackle them one by one. Reward yourself with breaks and enjoyable activities as motivation for meeting your goals. Communicate your objectives to others for added accountability, and even if you face failure, don't be discouraged; instead, work harder to achieve your goals in time with persistent effort."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We were told to find ourselves a table, so we sat in an attractive area sort of like a small stage. No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up… Oh, here’s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food. We got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected. The very special people had not arrived—so (had we been served) we could have enjoyed our meal right there. We did find food elsewhere. The first place closed in less than a month. Good riddance! Question: where was the new table? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"The new table was located in the hall leading to the toilet. After the manager asked you and your daughter to move from the stage-like area to make room for a \\"very special group,\\" you were led to a lonely little table in the hallway that led to the restroom. Unfortunately, the overall experience at the restaurant was unsatisfactory due to the delays in service, poor organization, and ultimately not being served any food. This series of events led you and your daughter to leave the restaurant and find another place to eat. The first restaurant closed down in less than a month, indicating that your experience was likely not an isolated incident but rather a reflection of the overall management and customer service provided by the establishment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? The film Old St. Paul's is set in what year? Answer:","output":"To answer the question regarding the year in which the film Old St. Paul's is set, we need to explore some background information on the movie itself. Old St. Paul's is a British silent historical film released in 1914, directed by Frederick A. Young and produced by Edwin J. Collins. The film is based on the novel \\"Old St. Paul's: A Tale of the Plague and the Fire\\" written by William Harrison Ainsworth and published in 1841. The novel is set during the Great Plague of London (1665) and the Great Fire of London (1666). These two historical events profoundly impacted London and its citizens during the 17th century. The Great Plague was a devastating epidemic that killed tens of thousands of people, and it was followed by the catastrophic Great Fire, which destroyed much of the city. Given that the film Old St. Paul's is an adaptation of this novel, it is reasonable to assume that the movie is also set during the same time period, specifically between 1665 and 1666, during the occurrences of the Great Plague and the Great Fire of London."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate \\"Jame, I'm coming.\\" to Czech?","output":"In Czech, \\"Jame, I'm coming\\" can be translated as \\"Jame, jdu.\\" or \\"Jame, přicházím.\\" Here's a detailed breakdown of the translation: - \\"Jame\\" remains the same, as it is a proper noun, which is a person's name. In Czech, proper nouns generally do not change. - \\"I'm coming\\" can be translated in two different ways. First, as \\"jdu\\", which is the present tense form of the verb \\"jít\\" (to go or to come) and implies that the person is coming or going somewhere. This form is shorter and more colloquial. An alternative translation for \\"I'm coming\\" can be \\"přicházím,\\" which is the present tense form of the verb \\"přicházet\\" (to come or to arrive) and implies that someone is arriving or coming to a certain place. This form is slightly more formal than \\"jdu.\\" Both translations convey the same meaning, and you can choose one based on the context and level of formality required. So, you can say either \\"Jame, jdu.\\" or \\"Jame, přicházím.\\" to convey \\"Jame, I'm coming.\\" in Czech."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Aaron Charles Carter was born on December 7, 1987, at the Tampa General Hospital in Tampa, Florida, where his parents, Jane Elizabeth (nee Spaulding) and Robert Gene Carter (1952-2017), ran the Garden Villa Retirement Home. The family was originally from New York City, where his older brother Nick, of the boy band Backstreet Boys, was born. In addition to his brother Nick, he also has three sisters: twin sister Angel (a model), B.J. and Leslie (1986-2012). Carter is named after his paternal grandfather, Aaron Charles Carter, and his maternal grandfather, Douglas \\"Charles\\" Spaulding. Carter's next album, Another Earthquake!, was released on September 3, 2002, during the \\"Rock, Rap, and Retro\\" tour. The album featured the patriotic-themed \\"America A.O.\\" and the ballad \\"Do You Remember\\". He guest starred on three episodes of the Nickelodeon TV show, All That and sang the theme song to the PBS animated series Liberty's Kids, titled \\"Through my own Eyes.\\"  During that time, Carter's parents filed a lawsuit against his former manager, Lou Pearlman (now deceased), in 2002 alleging failure to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties on Carter's 1998 album, which was released through Pearlman's label and production company, Trans Continental. On March 13, 2003, Pearlman was declared in contempt of court for ignoring a court order to produce documents relating to royalty payments.  Carter had also dated Lindsay Lohan along with his girlfriend Hilary Duff at the same time (leading to a feud between the two), but he broke up with Lohan in April 2003, and resumed dating Duff. Later, that same year, he reportedly cheated on her and Duff ended their on-and-off relationship after two years. Carter's Most Requested Hits, a collection including tracks from his last three albums as well as a new single, \\"One Better\\", was released on November 3, 2003.  \\"Saturday Night\\", which was released on March 22, 2005 and was promoted by Carter during his summer 2005 Remix Tour. The song was released by Trans Continental label, with Lou Pearlman as executive producer. The single was also featured in the soundtrack of the film Popstar, in which Carter starred. The direct-to-video film was based heavily on his own life as a performer. A real-life motocross racer, Carter also appeared in 2005's Supercross. On March 21, 2006, Trans Continental filed a lawsuit against Carter within the Los Angeles Superior Court, citing that Carter allegedly reneged on a recording deal. Carter had signed the contract on December 7, 2004, when he was 17 and underage. His attorney however stated that Carter had the right to \\"cancel or void various agreements\\" that were signed when he was a minor.  Carter and his siblings starred in a reality show, House of Carters, which ran in October-November 2006 on E!. The series features all five Carter siblings reuniting to live in the same house. On September 18, 2006, it was reported that Carter was engaged to former beauty queen and Playboy model Kari Ann Peniche. US Weekly later reported that Carter had broken off his engagement to Peniche, saying he was impulsive in proposing to her.

Context: Well we're not married (yet), but one time my boyfriend playfully spanked me. Hard. I know he didn't mean to hurt me, but I was mad about it all. Day. Long. I just couldn't get over the fact that he technically hit me! I started to consider things like, “Is he really sorry?” “Will he do it again?” “Should I leave him?” And gave myself reasons like “He didn't mean to!” “He's been apologizing all day!” “He was just playing!” “He meant to have fun, He's sorry!” Yet countered it with one simple statement, “Yeah that's what all abused women say.” In the end, I felt the question that should determine whether or not I should leave is: “If I stop talking to him tomorrow and can never see him or speak to him again, will I be okay with that?” and the answer was “No”, so obviously I shouldn't leave him. He is very well aware that I was considering leaving him, (I have a very strict 0 tolerance policy of abuse in my relationships, as I was abused terribly growing up,) and he still apologizes to this day, but he has certainly made it a point to never do that again.

Although many people assume that learning to paint is just about picking up a brush and slapping on some color, the process is, in fact, much more intricate. To achieve a vibrant, lasting, and professional finish, you must pay close attention to every detail, starting with the application of a base coat. In this article, we'll explore the whys and hows of applying a base coat in one of your main colors, as well as the fundamental techniques and considerations required to ensure a successful outcome. Why Apply a Base Coat? A base coat is a foundation layer of paint that sets the stage for additional colors and effects. Applying a base coat has multiple benefits: 1. It unifies the painting surface, providing a consistent base for the desired color tone. 2. It enhances the adhesion of subsequent layers, improving the overall stability of the artwork. 3. It prevents uneven texture, reducing the risk of visible brush strokes or other surface imperfections. 4. It increases the longevity of the painting by protecting it from external elements such as light, humidity, and dust. Choosing Your Base Coat Color: Selecting the appropriate color for your base coat is crucial to achieving the desired effect. Typically, artists choose a base coat color that reflects their primary color scheme. This helps create a sense of coherence and harmony in the finished piece. When choosing your base coat color, consider the following factors: 1. Tonal value: Aim for a mid-tone color that can be easily adjusted with darker or lighter shades. 2. Color harmony: Consider how your chosen base coat color will interact with other colors in your composition. Make sure they complement each other rather than creating unwanted contrasts. 3. Emotional impact: Remember that colors evoke emotions. Choose a color that sets the desired emotional response for your artwork. Preparing the Painting Surface: Before applying the base coat, it's crucial to prepare the painting surface correctly. This involves: 1. Cleaning: Ensure the surface is free of dust, dirt, and oils. For best results, use a mild detergent and water to clean the area thoroughly, then allow it to dry completely. 2. Priming: Priming creates a receptive barrier between the surface and the paint, preventing the paint from soaking into the material, enhancing adhesion, and sealing any imperfections. Most artists recommend using a quality gesso to prime your surface. Base Coat Application – The Process: Having chosen your color, prepared your surface, and gathered your tools, it's time to apply the base coat. Follow these steps for a successful application: 1. Mix your paint: Combine your chosen base coat color with an appropriate paint medium. This will ensure smooth application and increase the longevity of your artwork. 2. Protect your workspace: Cover your work area with drop cloths or protective sheets to avoid potential paint spills or accidents. 3. Apply the base coat: Using a suitable brush or painting tool, evenly apply the base coat to your entire painting surface. Work in long, steady strokes, maintaining a consistent thickness throughout. 4. Fix any imperfections: While your base coat is still wet, use a clean brush or tool to correct any visible brush strokes, marks, or inconsistencies. 5. Allow the base coat to dry: Patience is key when waiting for your base coat to dry. Depending on the paint type and environmental factors, drying time can range from a few hours to several days. Refrain from adding additional layers or making adjustments until the base coat is entirely dry. Conclusion: The foundation of any successful painting lies in the proper application of a base coat. Through careful color selection, surface preparation, and attentive technique, artists can create a lasting, vibrant work of art that resonates both visually and emotionally. By understanding the importance of a base coat and honing the skills required for its application, you can open the door to new levels of artistic proficiency and creative expression."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: \\"What word was not used to describe Mary: unstained, grace, or innocent?\\"  Context: \\"It is admitted that the doctrine as defined by Pius IX was not explicitly mooted before the 12th century. It is also agreed that \\"no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture\\". But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers. Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are, it is pointed out, so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual. Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as \\"in every respect holy\\", \\"in all things unstained\\", \\"super-innocent\\", and \\"singularly holy\\" are applied to her; she is compared to Eve before the fall, as ancestress of a redeemed people; she is \\"the earth before it was accursed\\". The well-known words of St. Augustine (d. 430) may be cited: \\"As regards the mother of God,\\" he says, \\"I will not allow any question whatever of sin.\\" It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin. But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin \\"of every sort\\" (omni ex parte).\\"  Answer: A:","output":"In the given context, the word \\"innocent\\" was not used to describe Mary. Instead, the following epithets were applied to her: \\"in every respect holy,\\" \\"in all things unstained,\\" \\"super-innocent,\\" and \\"singularly holy.\\" These expressions emphasize Mary's sinlessness, which has been considered to include both original sin and actual sin.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Every year, World Blood Day is celebrated by blood services worldwide on 14 June, the birthday of Nobel Prize winner Karl Landsteiner, the man who discovered the ABO blood group system. If you have every thought of becoming a blood donor, just register to do it. And you should never worry about the donation. Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body. It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients. First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday. Although most people are able to give blood, some people who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease are no tasked to be donors. Pregnant women or those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood. Blood has a very short shelf life. Some blood components can be kept longer than others, for instance red blood cells will keep for 35 days but platelets for only five. Remember, you should wait at least 16 weeks before donating blood again. Question: Who can donate their blood? Options: A: A teenager who is studying in a primary school B: A mother who is about to give birth to a new baby C: An adult who smokes and drinks from time to time D: A man just coming back for a place suffering from malaria The answer is:","output":"C: An adult who smokes and drinks from time to time To elaborate on the answer, it's important to first understand the eligibility criteria mentioned in the article for blood donors. According to the given information, first-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg, and be in good health. Additionally, donors can continue giving blood up to their 70th birthday if they have donated before. Certain people, such as those who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease, pregnant women, and those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood. Now, let's examine each option and compare it to the eligibility criteria: A: A teenager who is studying in a primary school - This option is incorrect because primary school students are typically younger than 17, which is the minimum age requirement for first-time donors. B: A mother who is about to give birth to a new baby - This option is incorrect because pregnant women are specifically mentioned in the article as being ineligible to donate blood. C: An adult who smokes and drinks from time to time - This option is the correct answer. Although smoking and drinking are not ideal habits and may affect the person's overall health, the article does not mention these as disqualifying factors for blood donation. As long as the adult meets the age, weight, and general health requirements, they are eligible to donate blood. D: A man just coming back from a place suffering from malaria - This option is incorrect because the article states that people who pose a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease should not be blood donors. Malaria is an infectious disease, and exposure to it would disqualify someone from being a blood donor. In conclusion, an adult who smokes and drinks from time to time is eligible to donate blood as long as they meet the necessary age, weight, and general health requirements. However, it is still a good idea for individuals to consult with healthcare professionals before donating blood to ensure that they are fit and eligible to do so."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The Potomac River, a significant river on the East Coast of the United States, flows into the Chesapeake Bay. Spanning a length of approximately 405 miles (652 kilometers), the river originates from the junction of its North and South Branches in the Appalachian Mountains situated in West Virginia. Throughout its course, the Potomac River serves as a natural boundary between several states, including West Virginia, Maryland, and Virginia. Additionally, it plays an essential role in the Washington, D.C. area, where it forms part of the city's borders and supplies drinking water to millions of residents. As the river continues its journey, it flows through some of the most historically significant regions in the United States, such as Harpers Ferry and Great Falls. These areas are notable for their breathtaking natural beauty, as well as the many recreational activities they offer, such as hiking, fishing, and kayaking. Before reaching its terminus, the Potomac River widens and forms a vast estuary, where the tidal influence of the Chesapeake Bay becomes increasingly apparent. This estuary, spanning approximately 50 miles in length, is known as the Potomac River Tidal Basin. It is home to numerous flora and fauna, from migratory birds and fish to diverse aquatic vegetation. Ultimately, the Potomac River makes its way into the Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the United States. Boasting an extensive watershed covering over 64,000 square miles across six states, the Chesapeake Bay is a critical ecological and economic resource. It supports a vast array of marine life, including the iconic blue crab, oysters, and striped bass, as well as an assortment of birds such as ospreys and bald eagles. As the Potomac River flows into this extensive estuarine system, it significantly contributes to the bay's overall health, providing essential nutrients and supporting a wide variety of habitats. Moreover, the Potomac River's confluence with the Chesapeake Bay plays a vital role in local economies and cultures, shaping the lives of those who live, work, and thrive in the surrounding communities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I have a new situation: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries.  But I can use this background: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue.  What is an answer for this question: Which country would attract businesses requiring higher labor supply, Germany or France? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Germany would be more likely to attract businesses requiring higher labor supply. Here is the step-by-step reasoning: 1. The Laffer curve shows that there is a critical point at which government revenue starts to decrease as the tax rate rises, due to a decline in labor supply. 2. After World War II, Germany implemented a tax rate below the critical rate while France implemented a tax rate above the critical rate. 3. According to the Laffer curve, decreasing tax rates should increase labor supply when tax rates are above the critical point. 4. Since Germany's tax rate is below the critical point, businesses operating there can expect a more favorable labor supply situation compared to France, where the tax rate is above the critical point. 5. Therefore, businesses requiring a higher labor supply would be more attracted to Germany due to its lower tax rates and more favorable labor supply conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Hyderabad produces around 4,500 tonnes of solid waste daily, which is transported from collection units in Imlibun, Yousufguda and Lower Tank Bund to the dumpsite in Jawaharnagar. Disposal is managed by the Integrated Solid Waste Management project which was started by the GHMC in 2010. Rapid urbanisation and increased economic activity has also led to increased industrial waste, air, noise and water pollution, which is regulated by the Telangana Pollution Control Board (TPCB). The contribution of different sources to air pollution in 2006 was: 20–50% from vehicles, 40–70% from a combination of vehicle discharge and road dust, 10–30% from industrial discharges and 3–10% from the burning of household rubbish. Deaths resulting from atmospheric particulate matter are estimated at 1,700–3,000 each year. Ground water around Hyderabad, which has a hardness of up to 1000 ppm, around three times higher than is desirable, is the main source of drinking water but the increasing population and consequent increase in demand has led to a decline in not only ground water but also river and lake levels. This shortage is further exacerbated by inadequately treated effluent discharged from industrial treatment plants polluting the water sources of the city.

Context: Some of Elvis Presley's early singles on Sun Records might have sold more copies on 78 than on 45. This is because the majority of those sales in 1954–55 were to the \\"hillbilly\\" market in the South and Southwestern United States, where replacing the family 78 rpm player with a new 45 rpm player was a luxury few could afford at the time. By the end of 1957, RCA Victor announced that 78s accounted for less than 10% of Presley's singles sales, essentially announcing the death throes of the 78 rpm format. The last Presley single released on 78 in the United States was RCA Victor 20-7410, I Got Stung/One Night (1958), while the last 78 in the UK was RCA 1194, A Mess Of Blues/Girl Of My Best Friend (1960).

Step 1: Simplify. The equation can be simplified by combining like terms. Here, the like terms are the constant terms 1872 and -6724. \`-206*f + (1872 - 6724) = 2770\` That simplifies to: \`-206*f - 4852 = 2770\` Your equation becomes: \`-206*f = 2770 + 4852\` Step 2: Add 4852 to both sides to isolate the term with 'f'. When you add 4852 to both sides, you'll get: \`-206*f = 7622\` Step 3: Isolate 'f'. Next, you need to isolate 'f'. To do this, you can divide every term of the equation by -206:  \`f = 7622 / -206\` Step 4: Final solution. When you divide, you'll get approximately -37 as a solution: \`f = -37\` So, the solution to the equation \`-206*f + 1872 - 6724 = 2770\` is \`f = -37\`."},{"instruction":"The Nagoya Municipal Subway 5050 series (名古屋市交通局5050形) is a rapid transit electric multiple unit operated by the Transportation Bureau City of Nagoya on the Nagoya Subway Higashiyama Line in Japan since 1992.

Here is a goal: make an easy fruit smoothie How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"Step 1: Gather the ingredients  The first thing to consider when making an easy fruit smoothie is the selection of ingredients. I would need fresh or frozen fruit, a liquid base, and perhaps some sort of sweetener or additional extras if desired. Some of the simplest fruit choices are bananas, strawberries and blueberries, but the choice can be varied according to preference. As a basic smoothie, I'd recommend bananas and strawberries, some almond milk as a dairy-free liquid base, and a bit of honey for sweetness. Justify: The selection of the right ingredients is key in making a delicious smoothie. Using a mix of fresh or frozen fruits, liquid base, and a sweetener can help create a tasty, refreshing beverage. Step 2: Prepare the fruits After gathering all the ingredients, I would start by preparing the fruit. This step involves washing the strawberries, removing the tops and cutting them into halves. I'd then peel the bananas and cut them into slices.  Justify: It's important to wash and prepare the fruits to ensure they are clean. Cutting them into smaller pieces will ensure they blend smoothly and evenly.  Step 3: Place the ingredients in a blender Next, I'd place the prepared fruit into the blender, then add the almond milk and honey. Justify: The blender is the tool that helps combine all ingredients into a smooth consistency. The order is not crucial but usually, placing the fruits first helps ensure a smoother blend. Step 4: Blend the ingredients Now it's time to start blending. I would blend the ingredients at a medium speed first, increasing to high as needed until the smoothie has a smooth, even texture.  Justify: Blending at a lower speed initially, then increasing helps ensure all the ingredients are properly broken down and mixed. Step 5: Check the consistency and taste After blending, I'd check the consistency. If it's too thick, I would add a bit more almond milk and blend again. If it's too thin, I would add a bit more fruit. I'd also taste the smoothie and if it needs to be sweeter, I would add more honey. Justify: A good smoothie should be neither too thick nor too thin. Checking for taste is also important because everyone's taste preference is different. Step 6: Serve the smoothie Once the smoothie has reached the desired consistency and taste, I would pour it into a glass and serve. Justify: Serving the smoothie completes the process. It's best enjoyed fresh, right after it's made."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Soon afterward, in April 1993, Albini remarked to the Chicago Tribune that he doubted Geffen would release the completed album.  Albini commented years later that in a sense he felt he spoke about the situation \\"from a position of ignorance, because I wasn't there when the band was having their discussions with the record label.

While Albini's remarks in the article drew no immediate reply from the group or its label, Newsweek ran a similar article soon afterwards that did.  Nirvana denied there was any pressure from its label to change the album's sound, sending a letter to Newsweek that said that the article's author \\"ridiculed our relationship with our label based on totally erronous  [sic] information\\"; the band also reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in Billboard.  Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder David Geffen made the unusual move of personally calling Newsweek to complain about the article.Nirvana wanted to do further work on the recorded tracks, and considered working with producer Scott Litt and remixing some tracks with Andy Wallace (who had mixed Nevermind).  Albini vehemently disagreed, and claimed he had an agreement with the band that it would not modify the tracks without his involvement.  Albini initially refused to give the album master tapes to Gold Mountain, but relented after a phone call from Novoselic.  The band decided against working with Wallace and chose to remix and augment the songs \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" and \\"All Apologies\\" with Litt at Seattle's Bad Animals Studio in May 1993.  Furthermore, a remix of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" by Scott Litt (at Bad Animals on November 22, 1993) appears on the censored Wal-Mart and Kmart versions of In Utero; this remix is also available on the band's 2002 best-of compilation, Nirvana, and is the same mix that appeared on the single.... Answer:","output":"The name of the album whose sound Nirvana denied there being any pressure from its label to change is \\"In Utero.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This game would be marked as Dolphins QB Joey Harrington's return to Detroit, as he was constantly booed throughout the contest.  In the first quarter, Miami trailed as Lions QB Jon Kitna got Detroit off to a fast start.  Kitna would complete a 2-yard TD pass to TE Dan Campbell, while kicker Jason Hanson nailed a 52-yard field goal.  Afterwards, Harrington started to get the Dolphins back into business as he completed his first-ever Thanksgiving touchdown pass on an 8-yard strike to WR Marty Booker.  In the second quarter, Harrington acquired the only score of the period on a 5-yard TD pass to TE Randy McMichael.  In the third quarter, kicker Olindo Mare nailed a 42-yard field goal, while Harrington and Booker connected with each other again on a 19-yard TD pass.  In the fourth quarter, Mare managed to put the game away with a 28-yard field goal. RB Ronnie Brown only had 68 yards rushing (with 5 yards receiving), as he left the game early with a broken left hand. He is currently week-to-week and will likely miss the team's next game against Jacksonville. With the Dolphins victory, not only did the Dolphins improve to 5-6, but Harrington also got his second-ever Thanksgiving Day victory and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd touchdown pass ever on Thanksgiving Day. Answer this question: How many total yards did Mare have?","output":"The text doesn't give any specific information on how many total yards Olindo Mare, the kicker for the Dolphins, had in that game.

But remember, this doesn't include any unsuccessful attempts or extra points he may have kicked, which also count towards a kicker's total yards in a game.

Common Law Cabin (original title \\"How Much Lovin' Does a Normal Couple Need?\\") is a 1967 exploitation film directed by Russ Meyer. The movie features Alaina Capri and Meyer regulars Babette Bardot and Jack Moran. It was co-written by Russ Meyer and Jack Moran, and filmed on location on the Colorado River in Arizona. Other portions of the film were shot in the Coachella Valley, California. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Moran served multiple roles in the making of Common Law Cabin.","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can indeed conclude that Jack Moran served multiple roles in the making of the film, \\"Common Law Cabin.\\" The text specifically mentions Moran as one of the movie's actors, and it also states that he co-wrote the film with director Russ Meyer. Therefore, Moran was both an actor and a screenwriter for this movie. In terms of specific roles, acting and writing are major jobs in a film production. As an actor, Moran would have helped to bring characters to life on the screen, representing the creative vision of himself and the other writers, as well as the director, Russ Meyer. This often involves interpreting the script, developing a character, and working on set to execute the film scenes. As a co-writer, Moran would have been instrumental in the creation of the film's narrative, the development of its characters, and the formulation of its dialogue. Screenwriters have an important role in shaping the direction of the film, as they create the storyline that the director and actors then bring to life visually. So yes, based on the paragraph, it is clear that Jack Moran undertook multiple vital roles and significantly contributed to the creation of \\"Common Law Cabin.\\" However, we must always remember that in the film industry, people may at times perform more roles that are not overtly stated. For instance, actors can often contribute with indirect directing notions and writers can provide important feedback on performances. This possibility is not directly supported by the paragraph in question, but is a common practice in the film industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is a news article: Americans have a favorable early impression of the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran and feel strong skepticism toward the prospect of military action against the Islamic state, according to private Democratic polling shared with POLITICO.      In a survey taken for the liberal group Americans United for Change and conducted by the firm Hart Research, a 34-percent plurality of respondents who had heard at least “a little” about the deal said they favor the White House arrangement with Iran. A total of 22 percent said they oppose the deal and 41 percent said they had no opinion or didn’t know enough to answer.      Text Size -      +      reset      After hearing a clinically worded description of the deal — stating that it requires Iran to “freeze its nuclear development program” and admit international inspectors, while reducing some U.S. economic sanctions and continuing negotiations for a six-month period – a full 63 percent of respondents favored the deal.      The survey, which tested 800 voters from Nov. 26 to Dec. 1 — but did not include calls on Thanksgiving and the day after — may bolster the case President Barack Obama and his allies will make to Congress, as they ask the legislature to hold off on placing new sanctions on Iran as the administration seeks to make the Iran deal work.      There are also indications that the argument over Iran is far from over: While many voters are “somewhat” inclined to back the deal or find Obama’s arguments “fairly convincing,” there is not yet a majority solidly set behind the administration’s position.      Democratic pollster Geoff Garin, who conducted the survey, said the straightforward takeaway is that voters “clearly want to give negotiations a chance to work if there is a possibility negotiations can prevent Iran from acquiring a weapon without a military strike.”      “Americans do not want to get involved in another war in the Middle East,” Garin said. “The public is reassured by the fact that most sanctions remain in place and Iran has agreed to intrusive inspections, and Americans understand tougher sanctions can be imposed if and when negotiations for a permanent resolution do not succeed.”      Offered a choice between two congressional approaches to the Iran deal, 68 percent of voters said they would prefer to see Congress “closely monitor” the implementation without taking “any action that would block the agreement.” Twenty-one percent of voters said Congress should pass new Iran sanctions “even if doing so would break the agreement … or might jeopardize the negotiations.”      In a sign of the country’s continuing war weariness, only 27 percent of respondents said they would take a favorable view of a lawmaker who backed “military action against Iran to destroy its nuclear development program.” Fifty-two percent said they would take a somewhat unfavorable or strongly unfavorable view of such a position.      And two thirds of respondents said they would prefer a member of Congress who “wants to give the new agreement and further negotiations a chance,” as opposed to 25 percent who’d rather support a lawmaker who wants to hand down new sanctions at the risk of undermining negotiations.      That divide isn’t merely a partisan one: Obama’s Iran deal has drawn flak from Democrats such as New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, as well as an array of leading Republicans, who have voiced concern that Iran is merely playing for time with the deal and has no real intention of abandoning its quest of atomic weapons.      Garin maintained: “The clear majority of voters do not want Congress to impose more sanctions at this point if doing so might jeopardize the agreement and ongoing negotiations.”      AUC president Brad Woodhouse said the group would be briefing congressional Democrats and “other interested parties” on the Iran poll in the coming days.      Update: This story has been updated to clarify that the poll did not test voters on Thursday and Friday of the Thanksgiving holiday. ||||| Iran's Minister of Petroleum Bijan Namdar Zangeneh, center, speaks to journalists prior to the start of a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, at their headquarters... (Associated Press)      Iran indirectly challenged OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, announcing that it plans to pump as much oil as it can once sanctions on its crude exports are lifted, even if its extra output drives prices into the basement.      The comments by Iranian oil minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh reflected Tehran's determination to regain its global role as an oil power as soon as it is freed of the sanctions under any nuclear deal with six world powers meant to ensure that it cannot make atomic weapons.      The Saudis produce about a third of OPEC's output now, and Zanganeh, in comments ahead of a meeting of OPEC's 12 oil ministers, said his country was determined to regain its share \`'under all circumstances.\\"      \`'We will produce 4 million even if the price drops to 20,\\" he told reporters. Benchmark Brent crude on international markets now sells for nearly six times as much, and a drop to anywhere near 20 would spark a crisis among oil exporters by leaving production costs far outstripping sales revenue.      Iran's agreement to limit its nuclear program is still only a preliminary one. Sanctions on its oil exports are likely to stay in place until a final deal is reached, which is unlikely before mid-2014. But the Iranian challenge reflected potential problems ahead for OPEC, unless the Saudis and others are prepared to cut back on their production and make room for a resurgent Iran.      Bitter regional rivals with Iran, the Saudis may not be ready to cede much ground.      Saudi oil minister Ali Naimi sought to ease concerns, telling reporters he did not see a price war on the horizon.      \\"I hope Iran comes back (and) produces all it can,\\" he said. But he gave no sign that his country was ready to reduce output, saying it remains \`'prepared to supply our customers with what they need.\\"      Naimi and other oil ministers came to Wednesday's meeting saying the market is well balanced and expressing happiness with present prices. That means that ministers on Wednesday will probably opt to keep the present OPEC output target at around 30 million barrels daily.      But a major uptick in Iranian exports _ and attempts by Iraq and Libya to increase their own output _ could result in an oil glut. OPEC has had little success in the past at asking member countries to respect individual targets.      Zanganeh on Tuesday suggested oil sanctions may be incrementally relaxed even earlier than mid-2014. In a nod to the Saudis, he said he hoped OPEC members understand that \`'when a member country comes back ... they should open the doors for him and not fight with him.\\"      Strong U.S. shale oil production could add to internal OPEC pressures beyond political tensions caused by Sunni Saudi Arabia vying with Shiite-led Iran and Iraq.      All three countries have put forward candidates for the post of OPEC secretary general, who acts as the voice of the organization between meetings. But with their rivalries strong and potentially harmful to OPEC unity, the meeting is expected to skirt the issue and extend Libya's Abdullah Al-Badry's term for another year.      ___      Margaret Childs contributed to this report. ||||| VIENNA: OPEC was expected to stick by its oil output limit at a meeting here even as Iraq and Iran eye higher crude exports amid slashed Libyan production.      The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries does not see a need to alter the cartel’s crude production ceiling of 30 million barrels per day, member nations led by the world’s biggest oil producer Saudi Arabia said in Vienna ahead of the meeting.      Pumping about one third of the world’s crude, OPEC will decide also on whether to replace Abdullah El-Badri as secretary general.      “We know demand is good, economic growth is good, supply is good,” Saudi Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi told reporters at OPEC headquarters in the Austrian capital.      OPEC members Nigeria and Venezuela each said they believed the cartel would agree to maintain its crude oil production ceiling.      Oil market analysts were meanwhile not expecting any surprises from OPEC, whose dozen member nations from the Middle East, Africa and Latin America are together producing slightly below its output target.      “It is unlikely that OPEC will adjust its official notional production ceiling as it is unlikely that either Iran and Iraq can contribute incrementally in any significant manner to the group’s supply next year,” Harry Tchilinguirian, BNP Paribas’ global head of commodity markets strategy, told AFP.      OPEC is facing also demand strains as consumers turn to cheaper oil and gas extracted from shale rock, particularly in North America.      At the same time, Iraq and Iran are seeking to increase their production after sizable falls to output in recent years.      Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members argue that benchmark crude oil prices, currently averaging 100 per barrel, provide acceptable income for producers without weighing too heavily on consumers.      “The price of oil is acceptable and there will be some additional oil coming to the market from OPEC and outside OPEC,” Qatar’s Energy Minister Mohammed Al-Sada said.      “What is more important is that this additional oil will be needed for the signs of economic recovery.”      Al-Sada added: “The current (output) situation seems to be comfortable... 30 million barrels seems to do justice to the current economic situation.”      Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh this week said that the country would be able to “immediately” export 4.0 million barrels per day (bpd) once sanctions are lifted in the wake of the international deal to roll back its nuclear program.      Iranian crude oil exports have been slashed to about 1.2 million bpd from 2.5 million bpd in 2011, according to Zanganeh.      At the same time, Iraq’s Oil Minister Abdelkarim Al-Luaybi said his country hoped to export 3.4 million bpd of crude oil next year, including 400,000 bpd from Iraqi Kurdistan, as it looks to recover from years of bloodshed.      This compares with exports of 2.38 million bpd in November.      The market though doubts how quickly new production can come on board.      “OPEC will find it very hard to come to an agreement to cut production given a significant number of its members — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria — are suffering from constrained production,” said Thomas Pugh, commodities analyst at Capital Economics consultants.      Libya’s output has plunged to about 250,000 bpd amid deadly fighting between radical fighters and the army, but oil minister Abdelbari Al-Arusi said he hoped production would be back to its normal level of 1.5 million bpd within two weeks.      Nigeria is meanwhile facing regular acts of sabotage to its oil pipelines.      Saudi Arabia is battling against Iraq and Iran for the position of succeeding El-Badri, who has steered the cartel through the financial crisis in the role of administrative head since 2007.      OPEC voted in December last year to re-appoint the Libyan for another year after members failed to agree on a new secretary general. ||||| This player has full sharing enabled: social, email, embed, etc. It has the ability to go fullscreen.

House Republicans are considering various legislative options that would either tacitly or explicitly rip the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran.      A handful of House GOP lawmakers told The Hill that the party is debating how best to express disapproval of the multilateral agreement, which was struck shortly after Congress left for Thanksgiving recess.      ADVERTISEMENT      House Majority Leader(R-Va.) on Tuesday was adamant during a closed-door meeting with Republicans that the White House explain the details of the agreement, a source in the room told The Hill.      Noting that Cantor is “very concerned with where the president is leading us,” the source said the No. 2 GOP House leader intended to work closely with Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) to produce a legislative response.      Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), said, “The overwhelming sentiment [among House Republicans is] this was an agreement that was foolish, dangerous, and that we need to do something and push forward.”      Many Republicans and some Democrats have criticized the nuclear pact because it does not insist that Iran suspend all uranium enrichment.      Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) has asserted Iran got more than it gave up, saying it “does not seem proportional.”      Cantor spokesman Rory Cooper said, “The leader does not believe the interim agreement the White House negotiated with Iran was in our nation’s best interests, so he will work with members on both sides of the aisle to determine that any final deal definitively addresses serious congressional concerns.”      According to several participants at the Tuesday morning meeting, House Republicans focused on several possible responses to the six-month agreement endorsed by the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, China, Russia and Iran. Under the deal, Iran agreed to enrich less uranium and allow nuclear weapons inspections in exchange for the elimination of nearly 7 billion in sanctions.      One option would be pressuring the Senate to consider new sanctions on Iran. The House this summer passed a bill with bipartisan support to do just that, 400-20.      Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has repeatedly noted that the House passed an Iran sanctions bill and that it is sitting in the Senate.      Contrary to the wishes of the White House, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Schumer have indicated the upper chamber will tackle a companion bill next week.      The other option for House Republicans would be a resolution to formally disapprove of the interim deal.      “I think that we should have a sense of the House that we oppose the deal,” said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), a senior Foreign Affairs Committee member.      Some Democrats would likely vote for such a measure, though Rohrabacher suspects “there are a lot of people on the Democratic side of the aisle who seem to feel compelled to support the administration on anything they possibly can, and this might fall within that range because you’ve got a Democratic president under attack.”      More than a few Republicans, including Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn (Texas), have suggested the Iran agreement was timed to distract from the disastrous rollout of ObamaCare.      It is unclear when the House will act on an Iran resolution; the lower chamber is scheduled to adjourn for the year at the end of next week.      Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday will appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee to discuss the deal. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"This news article talks about how a survey showed that Americans had a favorable early impression of the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran.

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Eggleston once again called on... According to the above context, answer the following question. What did Obama probably do after the story?

Q: When we got married we thought it was going to be all bliss and happiness for life. By about week two we both had an awakening. Something about being exact opposites and together 24/7. We clashed about something so important I can’t even remember what it was. We hadn’t really ever had that happen while engaged. Suddenly we realized that the bliss and excitement was growing into, well, everyday life. And all that passionate romance that had driven our relationship was growing, well, less passionate. We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs. Through all the frustration and bliss. Through all the sameness and romance. We still everyday enjoy our love and each other. And can’t imagine life without the other. Well actually, there have been probably a couple of those days for my wife. She’s just too nice to say it. A great marriage isn’t built because it’s perfect. Only because you keep trying to make it perfect. According to the above context, answer the following question. How does the author's wife feel the same about the marriage? pick from the following.

On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan.

Pierre Benjamin Monteux (pronounced [pjɛʁ mɔ̃.tø]; 4 April 1875 – 1 July 1964) was a French (later American) conductor. After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907.  He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century. From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919–24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924–34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929–38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936–52).  In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later.  Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records. Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Lorin Maazel, Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, Seiji Ozawa, André Previn  and David Zinman. The school in Hancock has continued since Monteux's death. The answer to this question is:","output":"Monteux"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We can do that by subtracting 3387 * n from both sides of the equation: 3396 * n - 3387 * n = -18 Now, we can see that both terms on the left side of the equation have 'n', so we can write it as: (3396 - 3387) * n = -18 Doing the math inside the parentheses, we get: 9 * n = -18 Now, to find the value of 'n', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 9: n = -18 / 9 When we do this division, we get: n = -2 So the solution to this math problem is: n = -2"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the aphotic zone, the light level is extremely low, making it difficult for plants and other photosynthetic organisms to survive. Nevertheless, various non-photosynthetic organisms, such as certain marine animals and bacteria, can live in this dark and cold environment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

White, and it is the first part of his tetralogy about the legend of King Arthur, collectively titled \\"The Once and Future King.\\" The book was initially written and published in 1938.  The story is set in England during the Dark Ages and focuses on the early life and education of Arthur, the future king, through his mentor and guardian, the wizard Merlin. The sword in the stone serves as a device to identify Arthur as the future king, as it can only be removed from the stone by the rightful heir to the throne. Drawing upon various sources, including Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" and Alfred, Lord Tennyson's \\"Idylls of the King,\\" White's novel is a distinct interpretation that combines elements of medieval legend, adventure, comedy, and fantasy. The entire tetralogy, \\"The Once and Future King,\\" was published over the years in the following sequence: \\"The Sword in the Stone\\" (1938), followed by \\"The Witch in the Wood\\" (later renamed \\"The Queen of Air and Darkness\\") in 1939, \\"The Ill-Made Knight\\" in 1940, and finally \\"The Candle in the Wind\\" in 1958. The complete compilation of the four novels was published as \\"The Once and Future King\\" in 1958, gaining widespread attention and critical acclaim. It has since become a classic of the fantasy genre and serves as an inspiration for numerous retellings of the Arthurian legend in literature, theater, and film."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic.  Paragraph: Two friends had different diseases. Nigel was more prone to viral infections, so one day he got infected with the HIV virus. Manny had contracted some sort of bacterial infection.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend received more antiretroviral drugs? The answer to this question is:","output":"Nigel received more antiretroviral drugs. This conclusion is drawn based on the information given in the paragraph. Nigel was more prone to viral infections and contracted HIV, a viral infection. Antiretroviral drugs, as mentioned in the background information, are specifically used for treating viral diseases such as HIV. The rapid increase in the development of antiretroviral drugs over the past twenty years has been driven by the AIDS epidemic, which is caused by the HIV virus. As a result, it can be assumed that Nigel, being infected with the HIV virus, received more antiretroviral drugs as part of his treatment to manage the infection. On the other hand, Manny contracted a bacterial infection. Bacterial infections are typically treated with antibiotics, a class of medications that target bacteria, rather than antiviral drugs that are specifically designed to treat viral infections. Although it is not explicitly mentioned which particular antibiotics Manny received, it can still be concluded that he did not receive antiretroviral drugs for his bacterial infection, as they are not effective in treating this type of infection. In summary, based on the information provided and the nature of the infections the two friends contracted, it can be concluded that Nigel, who was infected with the HIV virus, received more antiretroviral drugs than Manny, who had a bacterial infection and would have required different treatment, likely involving antibiotics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The main characters, Carmine and Sasha live in a carefree and comfortable world and the arrival of a child shakes up their conventional life: behind their illusion of a fancy condominium and their successful careers hides a couple that is living in pain, secrets and lies. Simultaneously, the other couple within the film, Justine and Seb are freedom seekers that live day by day on the streets of Montreal. These two young squeegee kids live in hopes of a better future, but in the meantime seem to be content with part-time jobs; such as washing windshields and doing small-time deals. Justine's pregnancy catches Seb off guard as he is not ready to be a father. The history of violence in their relationship makes getting an abortion the obvious choice, however things worsen and turn out differently.

Combine like terms: Since both -1337*n and -513*n have the variable n, we can combine these terms. -1337*n - 513*n = (-1337 - 513) * n = -1850 * n Now, the equation becomes: -1850 * n + 22200 = 0 2. Isolate the variable n: In order to isolate n, we need to move the constant term, 22200, to the other side of the equation. -1850 * n = -22200 3. Divide by the coefficient of n: The coefficient of n is -1850. To solve for n, divide both sides of the equation by -1850. n = -22200 / -1850 4. Simplify the solution: Now, we need to simplify the fraction -22200 / -1850. Both numerator and denominator have a common factor of 370. Divide both numerator and denominator by 370. n = (22200 ÷ 370) / (-1850 ÷ 370) = 60 / 5 n = 12 So, the solution to the equation -1337*n - 513*n + 22200 = 0 is n = 12."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Super Junior (Korean: syupeojunieo; Syupeo Junieo), also known as simply SJ or SUJU, is a South Korean boy band. Formed in 2005 by producer Lee Soo-man of S.M. Entertainment, the group comprised a total of thirteen members at its peak. Super Junior originally debuted with twelve members, consisting of leader Leeteuk, Heechul, Hangeng, Yesung, Kangin, Shindong, Sungmin, Eunhyuk, Siwon, Donghae, Ryeowook and Kibum. Kyuhyun joined the group in 2006. In February 2006, Super Junior 05 began performances for \\"Miracle\\", the second promotional single from their debut album. \\"Miracle\\" topped the music charts of Thailand, drawing interest from international markets. As promotions for \\"Miracle\\" ended, SM Entertainment began selecting new members for Super Junior's second generation, Super Junior 06. The company even prepared a list of chosen members that were to graduate from the group. However, the company abandoned the rotational concept after adding a thirteenth member, Kyuhyun, in 2006. The group then became known as just Super Junior, without the suffix \\"05\\". Member Eunhyuk indirectly explains in a variety show that junior group SHINee could have been part of the group, but that was contemplated before Kyuhyun broke the rotational concept.  After the addition of Kyuhyun, Super Junior released their single \\"U\\" for free download on May 25, 2006 on their official website. \\"U\\" exceeded 400,000 downloads within five hours of release and ultimately surpassed 1.7 million downloads, crashing the server. The physical single of \\"U\\" with a total of three tracks was released on June 6, eventually selling over 81,000 units in South Korea. The single became one of Korea's most popular songs of the year, taking up number one spots for five consecutive weeks on two of Korea's top music programs. By the end of the year, Super Junior collected over seven awards in five of South Korea's top music award ceremonies, and was one of the three Best Newcomer winners at the 21st Golden Disk Awards.  In late 2006, Kyuhyun, Ryeowook, and Yesung formed the subgroup Super Junior-K.R.Y., Super Junior's first sub-unit. They performed their first single \\"The One I Love\\", theme song to the Korean television drama Hyena, on the KBS music program Music Bank on November 5, 2006. In February 2007, Leeteuk, Heechul, Kangin, Sungmin, Shindong and Eunhyuk formed Super Junior-T, a trot-singing group. They released their first single \\"Rokuko\\" on February 23, 2007, and made a debut performance on Popular Songs two days later.  Super Junior's second official album was intended for a late 2006 release, but due to several accidental setbacks, Don't Don was not released until September 20, 2007. Don't Don sold over 60,000 units the first day of release and debuted at number one on the monthly chart of September 2007. Although Don't Don received mixed reviews from critics, the album went to sell more than 160,000 copies by the end of the year, becoming the second best-selling record of 2007. Super Junior received seven nominations at the 2007 Mnet/KM Music Festival, winning three of them which included Artist of the Year, termed by many as the highest recognition of the ceremony.

The design named \\"The Strawberry Thief\\" is a popular design seen on textiles and wallpaper. It's one of the most famous designs produced during the 19 century, a distinct piece that reveals the intricacies of 19th-century design trends. The Strawberry Thief was designed by William Morris, a designer, poet, and polymath connected with the British Arts and Crafts Movement. This pattern was designed in 1883 and it continues to be popular in the modern era too. This design was ‘inspired by the thrushes that Morris found stealing from his kitchen garden of his countryside home, Kelmscott Manor, in Oxfordshire.' Why it's important to know this?

Comme elle le dit elle-même, Renée, 54 ans, est en tout point l'archétype de la concierge : elle est vieille, laide, petite, grassouillette et cultive à souhaits des abords revêches. Elle exerce ses fonctions, depuis près de vingt-sept ans, dans cet immeuble bourgeois de la rue de Grenelle à Paris où elle entretient à loisir l'image disgracieuse que se fait généralement l'opinion.  En réalité, à force de duplicité, Renée dissimule à merveille une insoupçonnable érudition. Férue de philosophie et de littérature, elle se passionne aussi pour le cinéma japonais dans un univers tout intérieur qu'elle camoufle derrière une rusticité d'apparat. Ainsi a t-elle vécu jusque-là « cinquante-quatre ans de clandestinité et de triomphes muets dans l'intérieur capitonné d'un esprit esseulé » feignant d'être niaise et rustre pour mieux se préserver.  Parallèlement, dans cet immeuble aisé, les locataires (député, ancien ministre) sont quant à eux assez proches de leur propre caricature. Enfermés pour certains dans les rouages du snobisme, ils peuvent être indifférents, voire parfois méprisants envers le « petit personnel ». Pourtant, il y a parmi eux la petite Paloma (12 ans) qui déverse à l'encontre de l'univers qui l'entoure de bien acerbes diatribes. Elle est en pleine rébellion contre son milieu qu'elle juge désespérément superficiel, désolant et en a même quelques idées suicidaires.   Le livre se construit alors au gré de ces deux voix, alternant les réflexions perspicaces de Renée et celles de Paloma, beaucoup plus cyniques encore, qu'elle consigne dans son journal.  Ainsi va la vie au 7 rue de Grenelle avec ses petites anecdotes du quotidien et les monologues de ces deux solitudes vont bon train. Les jours se succèdent avec leur lot de banalités exaspérantes jusqu'à l'arrivée d'un nouveau locataire japonais qui va bouleverser bien des habitudes. À lui seul, en toute simplicité, il incarne « un bienfaiteur céleste, un baume miraculeux contre les certitudes du destin. »  De toute évidence, l'auteure aime la belle écriture et ce dernier livre le prouve joliment. Le style est dense, consistant et pourtant la lecture coule allégrement. Le lecteur ne peut que se régaler.

Process:  - Cells obtain glucose and oxygen - The glucose and oxygen create carbon dioxide - The cells release energy - The cells don't have enough oxygen to repeat this - The cells obtain more oxygen from the air - The cells repeat this process.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is a big fire happens, how will it affect more oxygen will reach the body.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a big fire happening can have both direct and indirect effects on the process, specifically on the availability of oxygen to reach the body and cellular respiration. Here is a detailed explanation: 1. Direct Effects: When a big fire occurs, it consumes a significant amount of oxygen in the surrounding area. As the fire burns, it uses up oxygen and produces carbon dioxide, smoke, and other harmful gases. This can lead to a lower concentration of oxygen in the air, especially in closed or poorly ventilated areas. Since our cells rely on the continuous supply of oxygen to perform cellular respiration and produce energy, a reduced availability of oxygen due to the fire can stall the energy production process. Furthermore, the presence of smoke and harmful gases can cause respiratory issues that hinder the proper functioning of the respiratory system. This makes it difficult for the lungs to effectively extract oxygen from the air and deliver it to the cells. As a result, the cells might not receive enough oxygen, causing a strain on the energy production process and leading to inefficient cellular respiration. 2. Indirect Effects: The indirect effects of a big fire can also negatively impact the process of oxygen reaching the body and cellular respiration. For instance, stress and anxiety caused by the fire can stimulate the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones elevate the heart rate and cause rapid breathing, increasing the body's demand for oxygen. However, the fire has already reduced the availability of oxygen in the air, making it difficult for the body to meet its increased oxygen needs. Additionally, prolonged exposure to high temperatures due to the fire can cause dehydration, heat exhaustion, or heatstroke. These conditions can lead to impaired respiratory and circulatory functions, interfering with the ability of the cardiovascular system to effectively transport oxygen to the body's cells. Consequently, the reduced supply of oxygen affects cellular respiration and energy production. In conclusion, the perturbation created by a big fire can have significant direct and indirect effects on the process of oxygen reaching the body and cellular respiration. It leads to reduced oxygen availability in the air, respiratory difficulties, stress response, and impaired body functions, all of which hinder the efficient process of energy production in cells. This highlights the importance of ensuring proper safety measures and adequate ventilation in areas prone to fires or other emergencies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, being under the sun for prolonged periods can sometimes lead to painful sunburns. Sunburn is our skin's reaction to excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, causing redness, inflammation, and irritation. Although prevention is key by using sunscreen and avoiding long hours under direct sunlight, sunburn can still occur. Before reaching for medicated creams and pain relievers, consider trying these natural remedies to soothe and relieve sunburn. 1. Take a Cold Shower or Bath One of the simplest methods to provide relief from a mild sunburn is taking a cold shower or a bath. Cold water eases the pain by constricting blood vessels and cooling the skin. Gently pat your skin dry with a towel instead of rubbing it, as sensitive sunburned skin can get further irritated. 2. Make a Cold Compress Another effortless way to ease the pain of sunburn is using a cold compress. Soak a washcloth in cold water, wring out any excess water, and apply the compress to the affected area. Repeat the process as needed for instant relief. An alternative is using a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a thin cloth to avoid direct contact with icy surfaces. 3. Soak the Affected Area in a Bicarbonate Solution Baking soda can help alleviate the sting of a sunburn. Fill a tub with cool water and add ½ to 1 cup of baking soda. Stir it well to mix, then submerge the sunburned area in the solution. You can also mix baking soda with water to form a paste and apply it directly to the affected area. Allow it to sit for a few minutes and rinse it off with cold water. 4. Take an Oatmeal Bath and Make an Oatmeal Paste Oatmeal is known for its skin-soothing properties, making it an ideal solution for sunburn relief. Fill a bathtub with cool water, sprinkle in 1 to 2 cups of ground oats, and soak for about 20 minutes. Alternatively, create an oatmeal paste by mixing ground oats with just enough water to form a spreadable consistency. Apply the paste to the sunburned area and leave it on until it dries before rinsing off with cold water. 5. Use Aloe Vera on the Affected Area Aloe vera is a go-to remedy for minor burns, as it provides cooling and soothing effects with its natural anti-inflammatory properties. Apply pure aloe vera gel, either directly from the plant or store-bought, to the sunburned area. The aloe vera gel quickly absorbs into the skin, reducing redness and irritation. Reapply as often as necessary. 6. Use Fresh Mint Leaves Mint is another natural option to soothe sunburn due to its cooling properties. Crush a handful of fresh mint leaves to release their oils and apply them to the sunburned area. Leave it on for several minutes before rinsing with cool water. Alternatively, prepare a mint tea by steeping the leaves in boiling water, then cool the tea and soak a cloth in it. Use the soaked cloth as a compress for additional relief. Conclusion: Natural remedies for sunburn can provide significant relief and help your skin heal faster. When applying these treatments, remember to be gentle and avoid exposing the affected area to further sun exposure. Also, stay hydrated to help your body recover quickly. While sunburns are common during the summer months, protecting your skin from dangerous UV rays should be a priority. Wear protective clothing, apply sunscreen of at least SPF 30, and avoid prolonged exposure to the sun, especially during peak hours. By embracing preventative measures and using natural remedies when needed, you'll be better equipped to enjoy a sunburn-free summer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Millions of children in the United States go to summer camps. Some go to play outdoors at traditional camps in the woods, in the mountains or on lakes. But families now have many choices of special camps. These can be in the middle of nature or a big city. Special camps offer young people the chance to learn about different subjects: anything from space exploration to business to medicine. In technology camps, one subject that children can learn about is video game design. They learn how to use computer programs to create games of their own. One program that teaches video game design is called Cybercamps. Children can learn how to design their own virtual  worlds to set their video game in. Then, they program their own rules and objects into the game. Cybercamps also offers courses in robot building and Web design.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Roy Buchanan (September 23, 1939  August 14, 1988) was an American guitarist and blues musician. A pioneer of the Telecaster sound, Buchanan worked as both a sideman and solo artist, with two gold albums early in his career, and two later solo albums that made it on to the Billboard chart. Despite never having achieved stardom, he is still considered a highly influential guitar player. \\"Guitar Player\\" praised him as having one of the \\"50 Greatest Tones of all Time.\\" He appeared on the PBS music program \\"Austin City Limits\\" in 1977 during Season 2.  - Gordon \`\` Gordy '' Johnson , ( born 1952 in Minneapolis , Minnesota ) is an American double bassist and bass guitarist who has toured and / or recorded with numerous artists , a few of which include Roy Buchanan , Bill Carrothers , Lorie Line , Chuck Mangione , Dewey Redman , Greg Brown , Peter Ostroushko , Paul Winter Consort , Cliff Eberhardt , Maynard Ferguson , Becky Schlegel , Benny Weinbeck , Bradley Joseph , and Stacey Kent . He is the older brother of Allan Holdsworth and James Taylor bassist Jimmy Johnson .  - Paul Winter (born August 31, 1939) is an American saxophonist (alto and soprano saxophone), and is a seven-time Grammy Award winner.  - A pianist is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\".   - Glen Velez (born 1949) is an American percussionist, vocalist, and composer, specializing in frame drums from around the world. He is largely responsible for the increasing popularity of frame drums in the United States and around the world.  - Keith Jarrett (born May 8, 1945) is an American jazz and classical music pianist.  - The violin is a wooden string instrument in the violin family. It is the smallest and highest-pitched instrument in the family in regular use. Smaller violin-type instruments are known, including the violino piccolo and the kit violin, but these are virtually unused in the 2010s. The violin typically has four strings tuned in perfect fifths, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings, though it can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato). Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition and in many varieties of folk music. They are also frequently used in genres of folk including country music and bluegrass music and in jazz. Electric violins are used in some forms of rock music; further, the violin has come to be played in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. The violin is sometimes informally called a fiddle, particularly in Irish traditional music and bluegrass, but this nickname is also used regardless of the type of music played on it.  - Peter Ostroushko (born August 12, 1953) is an American violinist and mandolinist.  - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores).  - Russ Landau is an American composer of film and television scores and themes including \\"seaQuest 2032\\", \\"Survivor\\", \\"Fear Factor\\", and \\"Pirate Master\\" for which he won an Emmy in 2008. He is an alumnus of the University of Bridgeport class of 1977 (South End, Bridgeport, Connecticut).  - The Paul Winter Consort is an American musical group, led by soprano saxophonist Paul Winter. Founded in 1967, the group mixes elements of jazz, classical music, world music, and the sounds of animals and nature. They are often classified as \\"new age\\" or \\"ecological jazz\\", and their musical style is often called \\"Earth Music\\". The group has had many lineup changes since it was founded. Long-standing members currently in the group include Paul Winter, cellist Eugene Friesen, bassist Eliot Wadiopan, jazz oboist Paul McCandless, and percussionist and frame drum specialist Glen Velez. Past members who were part of the group for a considerable length of time include Paul Halley, Susan Osborn, Oscar Castro-Neves, Russ Landau, David Darling, Jim Scott and Rhonda Larson.  - Oscar Castro-Neves (May 15, 1940 - September 27, 2013), was a Brazilian guitarist, arranger, and composer who is considered a founding figure in bossa nova.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.  - Eugene Friesen (born 1952) is an American cellist and composer.  - Tenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is one of the highest of the male voice types. The tenor's vocal range (in choral music) lies between C, the C one octave below middle C, and A, the A above middle C. In solo work, this range extends up to C, or \\"tenor high C\\". The low extreme for tenors is roughly A (two As below middle C). At the highest extreme, some tenors can sing up to two Fs above middle C (F). The tenor voice type is generally divided into the \\"leggero\\" tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor.  - Stanley Newcomb \\"Stan\\" Kenton (December 15, 1911  August 25, 1979) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and arranger who led an innovative, influential, and often controversial progressive jazz orchestra.

The show helped Austin to become widely known as the \\"Live Music Capital of the World\\", and is the only television show to receive the National Medal of Arts, which it was awarded in 2003. It also won a rare institutional Peabody Award in 2011 \\"for its more than three decades of presenting and preserving eclectic American musical genres.\\" For the first 12 seasons (1976-1987), \\"Austin City Limits\\" was produced by the Southwest Texas Public Broadcasting Council. Beginning in Season 13 (1988), \\"Austin City Limits\\" moved to its current production home at Austin's PBS affiliate KLRU, the Capital of Texas Public Telecommunications Council.  - Randolph Denard Ornette Coleman (March 9, 1930  June 11, 2015) was an American jazz saxophonist, violinist, trumpeter, and composer. He was one of the major innovators of the free jazz movement of the 1960s, a term he invented with the name of . He was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 1994. His album \\"Sound Grammar\\" received the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for music.  - A sideman is a professional musician who is hired to perform or record with a group of which he or she is not a regular member. They often tour with solo acts as well as bands and jazz ensembles. Sidemen are generally required to be adaptable to many different styles of music, and so able to fit smoothly into the group in which they are currently playing. Often aspiring musicians start out as sidemen, and then move on to develop their own sound, a name, and fans of their own, or go on to form their own groups. Some examples of this are: Some sidemen become famous for their musical specialties, and become highly sought-after by pop, rock, blues, jazz and country music bands. Examples of some of these include multi-instrumentalists. David Lindley is a multi-instrumentalist who has worked with such diverse musicians as Curtis Mayfield, Dolly Parton, Jackson Browne, and Hani Naser. Lindley used his time as a sideman to discover and master new instruments while on tour around the world, becoming proficient on ethnic instruments rarely seen in Western music genres. He has mastered so many that he admits to losing count, and instead placed a photo gallery of them on his website.  - Bradley Joseph (born 1965) is an American composer, arranger, and producer of contemporary instrumental music. His compositions include works for orchestra, quartet, and solo piano, while his musical style ranges from \\"quietly pensive mood music to a rich orchestration of classical depth and breadth\\".  - Stacey Kent (born March 27, 1968) is a Grammy-nominated American jazz singer. She is married to British tenor saxophonist Jim Tomlinson  - Reno is a city in the U.S. state of Nevada. It is located in Northern Nevada, approximately from Lake Tahoe. Known as \\"The Biggest Little City in the World\\", Reno is famous for its casinos and as the birthplace of Caesars Entertainment Corporation. It is the county seat of Washoe County, located in the northwestern part of the state. The city sits in a high desert at the foot of the Sierra Nevada and its downtown area (along with Sparks) occupies a valley informally known as the Truckee Meadows.  - Free jazz is an approach to jazz music that was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s as musicians attempted to alter, extend, or break down jazz convention, often by discarding fixed chord changes or tempos. Though the music of free jazz composers varied widely, a common feature was dissatisfaction with the limitations of bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz that had developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Often described as avant-garde, free jazz has also been described as an attempt to return jazz to its primitive, often religious, roots and emphasis on collective improvisation.  - A mandolin (; literally \\"small mandola\\") is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or \\"pick\\". It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths. It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass.  - Lorie Line (born 1958) is a classically trained pianist, composer, and performer from Minneapolis, Minnesota. Born in 1958, Line grew up in Reno, Nevada playing the piano. She obtained a B.A. in Piano Performance from the University of Nevada.  - Walter Maynard Ferguson (May 4, 1928  August 23, 2006) was a Canadian jazz musician and bandleader. He came to prominence playing in Stan Kenton's orchestra before forming his own band in 1957. He was noted for his bands, which often served as stepping stones for up-and-coming talent, and his ability to play expressively and accurately in a remarkably high register.  - The flugelhorn (also spelled fluegelhorn, flugel horn, or Flügelhornfrom German, \\"wing horn,\\" ) is a brass instrument pitched in B, and resembles a trumpet, but has a wider, conical bore. The instrument known today as the flugelhorn was developed from the valved bugle and is a member of the saxhorn family, which was developed by Adolphe Sax, who also created the saxophone family. The modern flugelhorn and Sax's B soprano (contralto) saxhorn are practically the same instrument.  - A bandleader is the leader of a music group such as a rock or pop group or jazz quartet. The term is most commonly, though not exclusively, used with a group that plays popular music as a small combo or a big band, such as one which plays jazz, blues, rhythm and blues or rock and roll music. Most bandleaders are also performers with their own band, either as singers or as instrumentalists, playing an instrument such as electric guitar, piano, or other instruments.  - Charles Frank \\"Chuck\\" Mangione (born November 29, 1940) is an American flugelhorn player, trumpeter and composer.   - Walter Dewey Redman (May 17, 1931  September 2, 2006) was an American jazz saxophonist, known for performing free jazz as a bandleader, and with Ornette Coleman and Keith Jarrett.

Here is a question about this article: In 2007, two FAA whistleblowers, inspectors Charalambe \\"Bobby\\" Boutris and Douglas E. Peters, alleged that Boutris said he attempted to ground Southwest after finding cracks in the fuselage, but was prevented by supervisors he said were friendly with the airline. This was validated by a report by the Department of Transportation which found FAA managers had allowed Southwest Airlines to fly 46 airplanes in 2006 and 2007 that were overdue for safety inspections, ignoring concerns raised by inspectors. Audits of other airlines resulted in two airlines grounding hundreds of planes, causing thousands of flight cancellations. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held hearings in April 2008. Jim Oberstar, former chairman of the committee said its investigation uncovered a pattern of regulatory abuse and widespread regulatory lapses, allowing 117 aircraft to be operated commercially although not in compliance with FAA safety rules. Oberstar said there was a \\"culture of coziness\\" between senior FAA officials and the airlines and \\"a systematic breakdown\\" in the FAA's culture that resulted in \\"malfeasance, bordering on corruption.\\" In 2008 the FAA proposed to fine Southwest 10.2 million for failing to inspect older planes for cracks, and in 2009 Southwest and the FAA agreed that Southwest would pay a 7.5 million penalty and would adopt new safety procedures, with the fine doubling if Southwest failed to follow through.

Article:Mr Farage challenged David Cameron and Ed Miliband to commit to opt out of any common asylum policy. EU leaders met to discuss the crisis last week. The UK said it would provide naval support, but it would not accept more asylum seekers. Main pledges In a break from domestic campaigning for the UK general election, the UKIP leader travelled to Strasbourg for a debate in the European Parliament, following the meeting of the European Council on 23 April. European leaders agreed to triple funding for rescue operations aimed at migrant boats in the Mediterranean, and to look at ways to capture and destroy smugglers' boats and deploy immigration officers to non-EU countries, officials said. But many MEPs demanded bolder action, passing a resolution calling on the Commission to set a \\"binding quota\\" for the distribution of asylum seekers among EU states, amid concerns that southern European countries are bearing the brunt of the crisis. The resolution, which was backed by four of the European Parliament's major political groups, also called for expanded search and rescue operations, bigger contributions to resettlement programmes, better cooperation with non-EU states and tougher measures against people smugglers. The resolution is not binding on the Commission but Mr Farage alleged that a common asylum policy had been \\"agreed already\\" - and further claimed that extremist group Islamic State - also known as Isis - had threatened to send extremists to Europe through the Mediterranean route. Mr Farage, who is an MEP for the South East region, told the European Parliament: \\"When Isis say they want to flood our continent with half a million extremists they mean it.\\" He added: \\"If the message is that anybody that comes will be accepted we are headed for disaster.\\" It's shock and awe part two from Nigel Farage. As the final week of the election campaign approaches the UKIP leader has deployed the tactic that he is convinced worked so well for him and his party in the TV debates. A few weeks back it was foreigners with HIV getting free treatment on the NHS. Tonight it's the threat of IS inspired extremists coming to the UK on boats across the Med. He claims half a million could arrive in Europe. Nigel Farage is breaking off from the campaign on Wednesday to fly to Strasbourg to speak against plans for what he says is an EU common migration policy. Something he believes could pose \\"a direct threat to our civilisation\\". European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told the same debate that there was a need for member states to \\"share refugees geographically\\". Arguing that allowing a certain measure of legal migration could reduce the number trying to enter Europe illegally, he called for the door to Europe to be left \\"partly ajar\\". Speaking to journalists ahead of the debate, Mr Farage claimed: \\"The principle [of common asylum] has been accepted. All we're now talking about is the detail. \\"If people in Britain see what I'm doing today and understand the significance of what is going on, I think they will be very, very angry indeed and they would want to know from the two potential prime ministers: do they intend to opt us out of this or will they stick with the legal agreements that we agreed back in 2013? \\"We've got to a point here with this where, unless we stand up and say something, we will be opening up our doors not just to many more people but to the Islamic extremist threat.\\" Also speaking in the Strasbourg debate was Dutch MEP Sophia in 't Veld from the Liberal ALDE group, who called the UKIP leader's words \\"populist and despicable\\". She claimed the idea of a \\"flood of jihadists\\" had been \\"invented by Mr Farage to get himself elected on 7 May\\". An EU directive in 2013 reaffirmed the aim of a common asylum policy. However, EU leaders have not agreed a common asylum and immigration policy within the EU. An emergency meeting of EU leaders was convened last week after more than 750 people died on a boat crossing from Libya on 19 April. Whereas the total number of deaths in 2014 was 3,279, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) says it fears the figure for this year could top 30,000, based on the current death rate. The UK - in the past a leading advocate of reducing naval patrols - said it would contribute helicopter carrier HMS Bulwark, two patrol boats and three helicopters. Germany, France and Belgium also offered ships. Prime Minister David Cameron did not commit the UK to accepting more refugees. Mr Farage also told the European Parliament that \\"we are guilty for this crisis\\", echoing earlier comments that the bombing of Libya has \\"directly caused\\" migrant disasters in the Mediterranean Sea. The UKIP leader has also said he has \\"not got a problem with us offering refugee status to some Christians\\" from the Middle East and North Africa. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"UKIP leader, Nigel Farage, has alleged that a common EU asylum policy has already been agreed upon and claims that extremist group Islamic State has threatened to send extremists to Europe through the Mediterranean route.

Question: \\"Scientists study the neural mechanisms of what by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality?\\"  Context: \\"Many different disciplines have produced work on the emotions. Human sciences study the role of emotions in mental processes, disorders, and neural mechanisms. In psychiatry, emotions are examined as part of the discipline's study and treatment of mental disorders in humans. Nursing studies emotions as part of its approach to the provision of holistic health care to humans. Psychology examines emotions from a scientific perspective by treating them as mental processes and behavior and they explore the underlying physiological and neurological processes. In neuroscience sub-fields such as social neuroscience and affective neuroscience, scientists study the neural mechanisms of emotion by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality, emotion, and mood. In linguistics, the expression of emotion may change to the meaning of sounds. In education, the role of emotions in relation to learning is examined.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Scientists study the neural mechanisms of emotions by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality. This interdisciplinary approach is commonly practiced in sub-fields such as social neuroscience and affective neuroscience, which aim to understand the complex relationship between the brain, behavior, and emotion. Emotions play a crucial role in human experiences, decision-making, and behaviors. They are deeply interconnected with various mental processes and have a significant impact on our overall well-being. The study of neural mechanisms of emotions focuses on how different emotions are generated, processed, and regulated in the brain, as well as how they influence our thoughts, actions, and interactions with others. One of the primary reasons for integrating neuroscience with personality psychology is the recognition that individual differences in emotional experience and regulation can be largely attributed to variations in personality traits. Personality refers to the unique and relatively enduring set of characteristics, tendencies, and patterns of behavior that define an individual. By examining the relationship between personality and emotions, researchers can gain insights into the neural processes underlying distinct emotional experiences. Some common methods used in the study of neural mechanisms of emotions include: 1. Brain imaging: Techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) allow researchers to monitor brain activity in real-time while participants experience or process different emotions. This helps in identifying the specific regions of the brain involved in emotional processing and regulation. 2. Lesion studies: These involve examining individuals with brain injuries or abnormalities that impact their emotional processing. By comparing their emotional experiences to those of healthy individuals, researchers can better understand the role of specific brain areas in generating and regulating emotions. 3. Genetic studies: Researchers can investigate the role of genetic factors in emotional processing and regulation by examining the relationship between specific genetic variants and individual differences in emotional experiences and personality traits. 4. Behavioral and self-report measures: Through questionnaires, interviews, and laboratory experiments, researchers can gather information on emotional experiences, personality traits, and behavior in response to emotional stimuli. This data can help in understanding how emotions and personality factors interact and influence decision-making, problem-solving, and social interactions. Some of the significant findings in this field include the identification of key brain regions responsible for processing specific emotions, such as the amygdala's involvement in fear and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex's role in reward processing. Moreover, studies have revealed that individual differences in personality traits, such as extraversion and neuroticism, are linked to variations in the neural processing and regulation of emotions. In conclusion, by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality, scientists can delve deeper into understanding the neural mechanisms behind diverse emotions and how they influence human behavior. This interdisciplinary approach not only sheds light on the intricacies of the human mind but also opens opportunities for developing novel treatments and interventions for various emotional disorders and promoting overall mental health."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie: The Disappointing Disaster Rating: 1/5 The Disappointing Disaster, directed by John Doe, was one of the most anticipated releases this year, but it turned out to be exactly what the title suggests, a disaster. Upon entering the theater, I was filled with excitement and high expectations, only to be let down by the lack of creativity and coherence of the plot. The storyline seemed to be an amalgamation of various clichéd plots that left audiences feeling underwhelmed. With a weak script, one would hope that film's star-studded cast, including popular actors John Smith and Jane Doe, could save the movie. Unfortunately, their talents were wasted in poorly written characters, and it was painful to watch them struggle with their scenes.  Moreover, the pacing of the film was poorly executed. Confusing edits and abrupt scene changes made it seem as if the filmmakers were trying too hard to create an epic saga, but they ended up with a chaotic mess. The film could have benefited from a more straightforward presentation and a focus on the narrative.  As for the visual effects, they were severely lacking. The CGI was glaringly obvious, and any sense of immersion was lost due to low-quality special effects. In today's age of advanced technology, the creators of The Disappointing Disaster failed to make use of available resources to enhance the movie's visuals.  The film's predictable plot, combined with the weak performances, made it challenging to feel any emotional connection with the characters. What could have been an engaging and enthralling cinematic experience turned into a tedious, lackluster event for viewers. To summarize, The Disappointing Disaster lives up to its unfortunate name. With a forgettable plot, sub-par visual effects, and a terrible waste of the talents of its star cast, it failed to deliver on any front.

Input: Paragraph: America’s opioid epidemic, especially damaging in rural areas where Trump is popular, has been a focus for the Republican president. On Tuesday, the government charged drug distributor Rochester Drug Co-operative Inc and company executives for their role in fueling the epidemic. The company agreed to pay 20 million and enter a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve charges it turned a blind eye to thousands of suspicious orders for opioid pain killers. “We are holding big Pharma accountable,” Trump said at the Rx Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit in Atlanta. Deaths from opioid overdose in the United States jumped 17 percent in 2017 from a year earlier to more than 49,000 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Deaths from potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl surged 45 percent in that time, according to the CDC. Hundreds of lawsuits by state and local governments accuse drugmakers such as Purdue Pharma of deceptively marketing opioids, and distributors such as AmerisourceBergen Corp, Cardinal Health Inc and McKesson Corp of ignoring that they were being diverted for improper uses. Trump said he convinced Chinese President Xi Jinping in a December meeting in Argentina to designate fentanyl as a controlled substance. China last month listed all fentanyl-related substances as controlled narcotics after criticism from Trump, though its government blamed U.S. culture for abuse of the drug and said the amount of fentanyl going from China into the United States was “extremely limited.”  “Almost all fentanyl comes from China,” Trump said on Wednesday. “They are going to make it a major crime.”   Little has come of Trump’s earlier calls for executing drug dealers. But the administration has taken some action to address the crisis on other fronts. Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency in October 2017. Last week, U.S. health officials said they will spend 350 million in four states to study ways to best deal with the opioid crisis on the local level, with a goal of reducing opioid-related overdose deaths by 40 percent over three years in selected communities in those states. The Democratic National Committee said in a statement before Trump’s remarks that his proposed Medicaid cuts and efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, could make the opioid problem worse. Trump has used the crisis to support his call for building a wall on the border with Mexico, saying it would help keep out heroin and other illegal drugs and curb the crisis. Claim: Trump says he is holding big Pharma accountable in opioid fight. Output:","output":"The claim that Trump is holding big Pharma accountable in the opioid fight is supported by the paragraph which mentions that the government charged drug distributor Rochester Drug Co-operative Inc and company executives for their role in fueling the epidemic. The company agreed to pay 20 million and enter a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve charges of ignoring thousands of suspicious orders for opioid pain killers. Additionally, hundreds of lawsuits have been filed against drugmakers like Purdue Pharma and distributors such as AmerisourceBergen Corp, Cardinal Health Inc, and McKesson Corp for deceptive marketing and allowing opioids to be diverted for improper uses. The Trump administration has also taken some actions to address the crisis like declaring it a public health emergency and allocating 350 million to study ways to best deal with the opioid crisis on the local level."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paying tribute to Pink’s 17-year long career as a performer and trailblazing impact on music, pop culture, fashion and philanthropy, the honor came with a powerhouse performance from high-flying singer — who took the stage to sing a medley of her hits including “Get This Party Started,” “So What,” “Try,” “Don’t Let Me Get Me,” “F–in’ Perfect,” “Blow Me (One Last Kiss),” and her new single, “What About Us,” from her forthcoming sixth album, Beautiful Trauma.      The trip down memory lane include a high five from her 6-year-old daughter Willow Sage — who adorably walked the red carpet with her mom and dad husband Carey Hart in matching suits and sang along with her mom to the show (the couple also share 8-month-old son Jameson Moon).      Carey Hart, Willow, and Pink Rob Latour/REX/Shutterstock      After her song, Pink gave an inspiring speech about body image inspired by a time Willow told her mom, “I’m the ugliest girl I know” and “look like a boy with long hair.”      “‘You’re beautiful,’ ” Pink recalled telling her daughter. “When people make fun of me they say I look like a boy or I’m too masculine or I’m too outspoken. Do you see me growing my hair? Do you see me changing my body? Do you see me selling out arenas all over the world?”      Frederick M. Brown/Getty      “Baby girl, we don’t change,” Pink continued, calling out artists like Michael Jackson, David Bowie, Freddie Mercury, Janis Joplin, George Michael, and Elton John. “We take the gravel in the shell and make a pearl. We help other people to change, so they can see all kinds of beauty.”      She ended her speech by thanking her contemporaries — and sending love to Willow again. “To all the artists here, I’m so inspired by you guys,” Pink said. “There’s so much rad s— happening right now in music. Keep doing it and keep shining. And you my darling girl are beautiful and I love you.”            Check out PEOPLE’s full 2017 MTV Video Awards coverage.

News article: In What Universe Does This Guy Turn Into Bruce Willis? ‘Looper,’ With Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt      “Looper,” an obstreperously entertaining, bullet- and attitude-ridden science-fiction pastiche, opens in a futuristic world that looks and sounds paradoxically out of the past. Set in 2044, in a dystopia with Turner Classic Movies flavor, it puts a spin on the familiar figure of the existentially troubled gun for hire while leaving a layer of dust on many of the other genre fundamentals it plays with. Some of it you’ve seen and heard before, intentionally so, though it adds a weird wrinkle: an attempt to transform Joseph Gordon-Levitt , his nose prosthetically bobbed and a smirk surfing his thinned upper lip, into the wisecracking Bruce Willis of the “Moonlighting” years.      The ostensible reason for Mr. Gordon-Levitt’s extreme makeover is that he and Mr. Willis are playing the same contract killer, Joe, at different ages. A looper, the young Joe works for an outfit that exists 30 years beyond 2044, where time travel exists but is illegal. Whenever the outfit wants to dispose of a “problem,” it sends the problem with a hood over his head into the past where a looper is waiting with a gun to blow him to smithereens. The hook — you can almost hear the original movie pitch it’s so tidy — is that every so often the outfit sends back an older looper, who’s unknowingly killed by his younger self, which is how the 2044 Joe stares down his middle-aged counterpart.      It isn’t a happy meeting, but the writer and director Rian Johnson makes it a largely diverting one, filled with wit, smashing edits and showy, at times distracting allusions that reflect his cleverness like little mirrors. Slamming genre cheap thrills together with high-art aspirations, Mr. Johnson spins a fast-moving entertainment out of a setup that could have been cooked up by the science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick and was undoubtedly influenced by Chris Marker’s cinematic touchstone from 1962, “La Jetée,” in which scientists in a postapocalyptic world send, as the film puts it, “emissaries into time to call past and future to the rescue of the present.” The middle-aged Joe sets off on a similar mission, trying to persuade his younger self to go along.      It’s a juicy premise, ripe for the squeezing, though it takes a while to get over Joe’s looking less like a young Mr. Willis and more like Keanu Reeves with a dash of Marlon Brando doing Japanese minstrel for “The Teahouse of the August Moon.” Mr. Johnson throws a lot at the screen, blasted corpses included, yet little here is as initially transfixing as Mr. Gordon-Levitt’s mug. The makeover is a distracting miscalculation and a curious one given that, for his last movie, “The Brothers Bloom,” Mr. Johnson cast the non look-alikes Adrien Brody and Mark Ruffalo in the title roles. Even so, after the bodies and plot twists pile up, and after you’ve scoped out the Bruce-ified downward curve of Mr. Gordon-Levitt’s nose and laughed when he worriedly touches his receding hairline, the movie starts getting its groove on.      There’s a lot to get past, including an antediluvian divide between hard-charging men and decorative dames, including a stripper, Suzie (Piper Perabo), who works at a club called La Belle Aurore, the name of the Paris joint where Humphrey Bogart once met Ingrid Bergman. As time goes by, indeed, or as Mr. Johnson prefers, loops the loop. (Using some metaphysical shorthand he also alludes to the cosmic cup of coffee brewed by Jean-Luc Godard in “Two or Three Things I Know About Her.”) Things, or rather the gender politics, improve once Joe, fleeing the outfit — with his older self nearby — takes refuge at a farmhouse belonging to Sara (an appealing Emily Blunt), a single mom with a strange little boy, Cid (an excellent Pierce Gagnon). There, Mr. Johnson settles into something deeper, swaps the banter for real feelings and wins you over.      “Looper” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Lots of gun deaths.      Looper      Opens on Friday nationwide.      Written and directed by Rian Johnson; director of photography, Steve Yedlin; edited by Bob Ducsay; music by Nathan Johnson; production design by Ed Verreaux; costumes by Sharen Davis; produced by Ram Bergman and James D. Stern; released by TriStar Pictures. Running time: 1 hour 58 minutes.      WITH: Bruce Willis (Old Joe), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Joe), Emily Blunt (Sara), Paul Dano (Seth), Noah Segan (Kid Blue), Piper Perabo (Suzie), Summer Qing (Old Joe’s Wife), Jeff Daniels (Abe) and Pierce Gagnon (Cid). ||||| Photo by Alan Markfield/DMG Entertainment/Looper, LLC.      After you've seen Looper, come back and listen to our Spoiler Special podcast with Dana Stevens and Dan Kois. You can also download the podcast.            Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slate’s movie critic.      Looper is the third film from Rian Johnson, whose debut feature Brick (2005) somehow pulled off the brazen gimmick of setting a noir murder mystery in a suburban American high school. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (then known to most audiences as the alien kid on the family sitcom Third Rock from the Sun) played the lead role—a teenage Sam Spade investigating his girlfriend’s murder—with an alchemically perfect combination of hip detachment and wary melancholy. Gordon-Levitt was already a rising actor, having been singled out by critics in less-mainstream roles, like the gay drifter he played in Gregg Araki’s moody, unforgettable Mysterious Skin. But it was only after Brick that he began his steady rise toward household-name status, playing a lovelorn greeting-card designer in (500) Days of Summer, a brain-cancer patient in 50/50, and a credible action sidekick in both Inception and The Dark Knight Rises.      I’m an avowed JGL fan, so the prospect of Gordon-Levitt and Johnson working together again was enticing. So was Looper’s high-concept sci-fi premise: Gordon-Levitt plays a hired assassin whose targets are sent back in time from the future. It’s 2044, and time travel hasn’t yet been invented, but—to employ the future-perfect tense useful mainly for time-travel movies—it will have been invented in 30 years. By that point, a fearful, vaguely post-apocalyptic government will have forbidden any use of the technology ... so, to paraphrase the NRA bumper sticker, when time machines are outlawed, only outlaws will have time machines. Soon the contraptions (which look, pleasingly, like Jules Verne-era bathyspheres) are used solely on the black market, transporting the human garbage of the future back in time for the past to clean up. At least, that's how Joe (Gordon-Levitt) justifies to himself the fact that he makes his living waiting in deserted fields for hooded, cuffed men to appear out of nowhere so he can shoot them with a blunderbuss.      Advertisement            Underground assassins like Joe—members of an organized force led by menacing boss-from-the-future Abe (Jeff Daniels)—are known as “loopers,” for the chilling reason that, after being paid handsomely and given an early retirement that lasts exactly 30 years, they themselves will be captured, sent back in time and killed, thus closing the “loop” of their lives. As the film begins, a new crime lord, a fearsome gangster known as the Rainmaker, has taken over in the future and is issuing new orders about the existing loopers: He wants all their future selves sent back in time and killed immediately, preferably by the younger versions of themselves. (Why exactly this setup would be desirable was one plot point among many that eluded me. Given that the victims from the future are being sent back with their heads covered, why would it matter which looper killed whom?)      Get Slate in your inbox.      Joe’s featherbrained fellow looper Seth (Paul Dano), encountering his own later-self, isn’t able to bring himself to pull the trigger, and the man gets away, resulting in a very bad outcome for both present and future Seths (and the first of several extended bursts of stomach-churning violence). Joe resolves that, when and if his own future self appears in cuffs before him, he won’t hesitate to blow him away—but when that day comes and Joe’s future self turns out to be Bruce Willis, all bets are off.      Future Joe manages to knock Past Joe out cold, take his gun, and head out into the world to find and kill the child destined one day to grow into the Rainmaker. Based on a tip about the super-criminal’s date and place of birth, old Joe has narrowed the candidates down to three small children, one of whom (Pierce Gagnon) is the son of a lonely sugarcane farmer (Emily Blunt) in whose barn young Joe has taken shelter while on the run from Abe’s men, who are now hunting down both Joes with extreme prejudice.      You see where this is going: At some point, Young Joe and Old Joe are going to have to meet up and debrief about the 30 years that separate them, then decide whether they’re going to continue as allies or enemies. The moment this finally happens, in an Edward Hopper-esque diner in the middle of nowhere, was for me the movie’s high point. As they stare at each other in profile over two identical plates of steak and eggs, Willis and Gordon-Levitt, such different types both physically and temperamentally, make a strange sense as each others’ time-traveling avatars, especially since we’re meant to imagine that Joe’s years of hard living to come will make him a coarser, tougher man in middle age. (Levitt was also fitted with facial prosthetics to make his fine-boned face more closely resemble Willis’ craggier features. The nose works; the eyebrows are pushing it.) The diner scene also snaps with smart dialogue that playfully bats around sci-fi clichés; asked by his 2044 self to explicate one of the paradoxes of time travel, 2074 Joe impatiently dismisses the question, insisting they have no time to “start making diagrams with straws.”      Too bad, because a well-thought-out straw diagram might have been able to get me through the movie’s last half-hour, in which timeless philosophical questions of free will vs. destiny, nature vs. nurture, and utilitarian ethics (would you consider killing a child if you knew it meant saving countless future lives from the monster he might grow up to be?) get raised, then chucked aside as the story hurtles to a rushed, gory conclusion that leaves nearly as many plot holes as bullet holes. Saddest of all, after their juicy mid-movie encounter at the diner, Old and Young Joe hardly ever share the screen again, and when they do, it’s mostly to exchange terse remarks and gunfire. ||||| \\"Looper\\" is way inventive but it wears its creativity lightly, like it's no big deal. This is a highflying, super-stylish science-fiction thriller that brings a fresh approach to mind-bending genre material. We're not always sure where this time-travel film is going, but we wouldn't dream of abandoning the ride.      Written and directed by Rian Johnson and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt, \\"Looper\\" demonstrates what a sharp and focused imagination can do when no one fences it in. Johnson gave us a taste of his ability in \\"Brick,\\" the 2005 Sundance film also starring Gordon-Levitt, but this is that promise fulfilled.      Because its futuristic framework is so specific and so carefully worked out, \\"Looper's\\" world takes a while to outline in words. And it can be a challenge to follow the film's head-spinning narrative twists, such as having Gordon-Levitt and Willis sitting opposite each other in a riveting scene as the same man separated by 30 years of time.      PHOTOS: Hollywood backlot moments      Keeping us involved are convincing work by actors who make us buy the unbelievable and Johnson's gift for smart, exhilarating filmmaking. He's a director with a natural flair for visual style (Steve Yedlin is the excellent cinematographer) and an ear for the kind of wised-up dialogue that almost allows Jeff Daniels, irresistible as an exasperated bad guy, to walk away with the picture.      Perhaps the best thing about \\"Looper\\" is the feeling of uncertainty it conveys, the delicious sense that we are in only partially charted territory, that things can and will happen that are deeply unexpected. Despite the plot's unmistakable genre underpinnings, there's a surprising ruthlessness to what takes place here, the sense of a story that has the nerve to play by its own rules.      \\"Looper\\" opens, typically as it turns out, with an arresting, unnerving scene. Gordon-Levitt's Joe is alone in an empty Kansas field, a large tarp carefully laid out in front of him, an imposing weapon known as a blunderbuss in his hands.      Joe checks his watch and, right on schedule, a bound and hooded man materializes on the tarp. Joe kills him at once, removes the handful of silver ingots taped to the body that is his pay, disposes of the corpse and goes out to party, another day's work safely behind him.      The year is 2044 and Joe is employed as a looper, a profession that takes some explaining. As Joe's voice-over reveals, time travel will be invented in 2074, then promptly banned. The only people who continue to use it, albeit clandestinely, are big-time organized criminals who, finding body disposal difficult in the future, hit on the idea of sending targets back in time 30 years and having specialized assassins kill them: \\"Taking out the future's garbage\\" is how the stoic Joe thinks about it, when he thinks about it at all.      One of the quirks of the looping profession (likely named to reference time-travel theories involving causal loops) is that it is mandated that, at some point, you will end up unknowingly shooting the future version of yourself, an act called \\"closing your loop.\\" You will get a big payoff in gold ingots and go off to enjoy the last 30 years of your life.      Joe's carefully segmented world — which involves hanging with best friend and fellow looper Seth (an effective Paul Dano) and a dalliance with party girl Suzie (Piper Perabo), as well as constant use of a potent narcotic administered via eye drops — is not fated to last.      One afternoon Joe has the tarp ready for his next intended victim but everything goes wrong. Not only is the man not tied up, he's not hooded, and Joe immediately recognizes him as the older version of himself. Though Joe knows the dangers involved in not pulling the trigger, in doing what's called \\"letting your loop run,\\" circumstances conspire to enable old Joe (Willis) to escape.      It's at this point that \\"Looper's\\" plot goes into overdrive. Though they are technically the same man, the difference in age means that Joe (Gordon-Levitt underwent extensive makeup changes to bolster the resemblance to Willis) and his older self have different dreams, different goals for their lives. What it says in the film's ad line — \\"Hunted by your future, haunted by your past\\" — turns out to be the truth.      \\"Looper's\\" plot is way more complicated than you can imagine, and it couldn't hope to succeed without strong acting by all concerned, starting with Gordon-Levitt and a very committed Willis. Also doing potent work are Blunt as the inevitable woman of mystery and compelling child actor Pierce Gagnon as her self-possessed 10-year-old son, Cid. Best of all is Daniels, who gives an electric, eclectic performance as a man from the future fed up with living in the past.      Because \\"Looper's\\" plot is hard to get your head around, the film also counts on its involving future world to keep us in the story. Working with production designer Ed Verreaux and cinematographer Yedlin, Johnson has created an interesting riff on the usual dystopian future by emphasizing elements, such as pervasive homeless encampments, that convincingly play like today's problems run amok.      One of the memorable lines in Johnson's script has Daniels' gangster-from-the-future Abe casting a disparaging eye on Joe's style of dress and telling him, \\"The movies you are dressing like are just copying other movies.\\" The best thing about \\"Looper\\" is that it doesn't feel like it's copying anything at all.      kenneth.turan@latimes.com      'Looper'      MPAA rating: R, for strong violence, language, some sexuality/nudity and drug content      Running time: 1 hour, 58 minutes      Playing: In general release ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"\\"Looper\\" is a science-fiction film set in 2044 that puts a spin on the familiar figure of a troubled gun-for-hire while adding a fresh approach to genre material.

Try doing daily exercises like looking in the mirror and naming 5 things you love about yourself — not 5 things you hate.  If you can't name 5, name as many as you can. Each day try to increase the number until you can list 10 or 20 things about yourself that you like. Almost no one will love everything about themselves; just try to like as much as you can. You are beautiful in your own unique way. The popular saying, “to give is better than to receive,” is true for many people. Studies have shown that the same parts in our brain light up when giving gifts as when receiving them. Examples of good deeds:  Try volunteering for a cause you believe in, even if it's only for a few hours a month. Help a friend, relative, colleague, or neighbor with something you know they could use help with — for example, mowing the lawn, organizing their files, driving to the grocery store, packing up to move. Sometimes you need to get out of your head. Clean your house, doodle until you've filled a page, dance around to your favourite song, or sing at the top of your lungs to it. Allow yourself a few moments of distracted enjoyment as often as you can — no matter how bad you feel or how much you feel you may not deserve it.","output":"This article highlights the importance of emotional well-being and provides several strategies for enhancing mood and overall happiness. It is suggested that facial expressions, such as smiling and frowning, can impact one's emotions. To boost mood, try smiling for 30 seconds or making funny faces in the mirror to induce laughter.  Redecorating or rearranging one's living space can give a sense of fresh start and improve mood. Displaying inspiring images, such as pictures of dream destinations or people who bring happiness, can further elevate emotions. Framing a cherished photograph of loved ones and placing it in a prominent location serves as a reminder of positive relationships.  Practicing self-care by scheduling alone time to indulging in activities like reading a desired book, sipping favorite tea, or taking a relaxing bath can also benefit emotional health. Engaging in daily self-love exercises, such as listing personal qualities one appreciates and gradually increasing the number of positive attributes identified, helps build self-esteem and counteract negative thoughts. Generosity has been shown to activate the same brain regions as gift-receiving. Performing good deeds, such as volunteering or assisting others, can improve mood and overall well-being. Examples include helping a friend or neighbor with household tasks or volunteering for a meaningful cause. Finally, allowing oneself to participate in enjoyable, distracting activities – like dancing, singing, or cleaning – can provide temporary relief from negative emotions. Incorporating these strategies into daily life can contribute to a more positive outlook and enhanced emotional well-being, recognizing that everyone is beautiful and unique in their own way."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On his way back to the castle from grocery shopping, Sam complains that the king never thanks him for his hard work in having to both pick up groceries and prepare meals three times every day, but that the king instead whines that Sam takes too long with preparing the meals, much to Sam's annoyance (\\"Cook!

This approach is more effective because it results in clearer, more legible letters and allows for greater precision in the overall process. Here are the steps for using this method: 1. Choose your duct tape: Begin by selecting a duct tape that is easy to work with and comes in a color that you find appealing. Keep in mind that some duct tapes have stronger adhesives or are thicker, which might make cutting and handling more difficult. 2. Create or find a stencil: To ensure accuracy and proper sizing, you may want to create your own stencil of the letters you desire using a stencil-making material like cardstock or plastic. Alternatively, you can find pre-made letter stencils in various fonts and sizes at your local craft store or online. 3. Trace the letters: Carefully apply your duct tape onto the desired surface, smoothing out any air bubbles or wrinkles. If you are using a stencil, position it properly, and then carefully trace your letters onto the tape using a pencil or a fine-tip permanent marker. If you are drawing the letters freehand, try to make sure your lines have an even thickness and consistent shape for a polished look. 4. Cut around the edges of the block letters: Using a sharp craft knife, carefully cut along the traced lines to create the shape of your letter. Be sure to maintain a steady hand to ensure even, clean cuts. For better control, consider using a cutting mat or a piece of thick cardboard as a surface that can protect your table while you work. 5. Peel away excess tape: After cutting out your letters, gently peel away the excess tape outside the shape of the letter. Be cautious not to rip the tape or damage the surrounding area, as this may impact the final appearance of your project. 6. Smooth out the cut letters: Run your finger or a flat, blunt object along the edges of the cut letters to ensure that they are fully adhered to your chosen surface. This will help prevent the edges from lifting and give your project a professional appearance. 7. Keep refining as needed: Depending on your project, you might need to trim any rough edges or cut additional shapes to achieve the desired effect. Practice patience and remain focused on your goal to create a polished piece of duct tape art or messaging. By following these steps and cutting slowly and carefully around the edges of the block letters you drew on the tape, or by using a stencil and cutting along the borders of the letters you want, you will achieve a more legible, precise result that is visually appealing and accomplishes your goal of writing using duct tape."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The answer is:","output":"Given the context provided, it is not possible to predict the exact details of what will happen to Quinn. However, we can discuss some potential scenarios that could play out based on the information given. These scenarios might range from positive to neutral or even negative experiences for Quinn, as we do not know the specifics of Sasha's intentions or the nature of the barn as a meeting location. 1. Friendly Gathering: One possibility is that Sasha has organized a friendly get-together at the barn after school for a small group of friends, including Quinn. This could be a surprise party, a study group, or just a casual hangout for everyone to unwind after a long day at school. In this situation, Quinn would likely enjoy their time with friends and appreciate Sasha's initiative. 2. One-on-One Meeting: Sasha might want to discuss a personal or private matter with Quinn and has chosen the barn as a discrete location. This scenario could involve anything from sharing a secret or expressing personal feelings to seeking support or advice on a specific issue. Quinn's experience here would depend on the nature of the conversation and their relationship with Sasha. 3. Conflict Resolution: If Sasha and Quinn have recently been involved in a disagreement, the barn meeting might serve as an opportunity to clear the air and resolve their conflict. This encounter could be challenging and emotional for the both of them, but ultimately may lead to a better understanding and resolution of the disagreement. 4. Unexpected Adventure: Perhaps the barn holds secrets, or Sasha has found something interesting there that she wants to share with Quinn. This could lead to an unexpected adventure that Quinn wasn't anticipating. The outcome might range from fun to frightening, depending on the nature of the surprise and how Quinn reacts to it. 5. A Prank or Dare: It's also possible that Sasha has planned a prank or a dare for Quinn at the barn after school. This could involve an uncomfortable or embarrassing situation for Quinn, and the experience will depend on Quinn's personality and how they handle such situations. 6. Misunderstanding: It could also be a miscommunication or misunderstanding that leads Quinn to the barn after school. Maybe Quinn misheard Sasha or someone else passed on the message incorrectly. In this case, Quinn might end up at the barn but not find Sasha, leading to confusion and uncertainty. No matter what the scenario, it is essential to remember that we cannot predict the exact details of Quinn's experience based solely on the given context. However, identifying these possible scenarios helps to explore the differing outcomes and emphasize the importance of understanding the broader context in any situation."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information:  - The Acropolis Rally of Greece is a rally competition, part of the European Rally Championship schedule.

It encompasses Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as Murmansk Oblast, much of the Republic of Karelia and parts of northern Leningrad Oblast in Russia. Its name comes from the Latin words \\"Fennia\\" (Finland) and \\"Scandia\\" (Scandinavian). The term was first used by the Finnish geologist Wilhelm Ramsay in 1898. Geologically, the area is distinct because its bedrock is Archaean granite and gneiss with very little limestone, in contrast to neighboring areas in Europe.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia.

Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - A co-driver is the navigator of a rally car in the sport of rallying, who sits in the front passenger seat. The co-driver's job is to navigate, by reading off a set of pacenotes to the driver, often over a radio headset, due to the high level of noise in the car. The co-driver tells the driver what lies ahead, where to turn, the severity of the turn, and what obstacles to look out for.

He won his first world rally at the 2006 Rally Australia . Lehtinen and Hirvonen competed for Citroën in 2012 . Lehtinen lives in Lahti with his wife Tanja .  - In rallying, pacenotes are a commonly used method of accurately describing a rallying route to be driven in extreme detail. As well as dictating the general route to be taken, in terms of turnings, junctions, etc., all notable features of the route which might affect the way it is driven at speed are included. These details include the distance between each feature, the degree and severity of bends, adverse camber, crests and hill jumpings, surface type and conditions, potholes, special instructions to the driver, etc.  - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe.

It extends between Finland (to the north) and Estonia (to the south) all the way to Saint Petersburg in Russia, where the river Neva drains into it. Other major cities around the gulf include Helsinki and Tallinn. The eastern parts of the Gulf of Finland belong to Russia, and some of Russia's most important oil harbours are located farthest in, near Saint Petersburg (including Primorsk). As the seaway to Saint Petersburg, the Gulf of Finland has been and continues to be of considerable strategic importance to Russia. Some of the environmental problems affecting the Baltic Sea are at their most pronounced in the shallow gulf.  - The Ford World Rally Team, also known as the \\"Ford Motor Co.

Bernard Mathew Leadon III (pronounced led-un; born July 19, 1947) is an American musician and songwriter, best known as a founding member of the Eagles. Prior to the Eagles, he was a member of three pioneering and highly influential country rock bands: Hearts & Flowers, Dillard & Clark, and the Flying Burrito Brothers. He is a multi-instrumentalist (guitar, banjo, mandolin, steel guitar, dobro) coming from a bluegrass background. He introduced elements of this music to a mainstream audience during his tenure with the Eagles. Leadon was born in Minneapolis, one of ten siblings, to Dr. Bernard Leadon Jr. and Ann Teresa (nee Sweetser) Leadon, devout Roman Catholics. His father was an aerospace engineer and nuclear physicist whose career moved the family around the U.S. The family enjoyed music and, at an early age, Bernie developed an interest in folk and bluegrass music. He eventually mastered the 5-string banjo, mandolin and acoustic guitar.  As a young teen he moved with his family to San Diego, where he met fellow musicians Ed Douglas and Larry Murray of the local bluegrass outfit, the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers. The Barkers proved a breeding ground for future California country rock talent, including shy, 18-year-old mandolin player Chris Hillman, with whom Leadon maintained a lifelong friendship. Augmented by banjo player (and future Flying Burrito Brother) Kenny Wertz, the Squirrel Barkers eventually asked Leadon to join the group, upon Wertz's joining the Air Force in 1963.  His stint in the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers did not last long. In late 1963, his family once again relocated to Gainesville, Florida, when his father accepted a position as Professor of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Florida. Leadon attended Gainesville High School, where he met classmate and future Eagles lead guitarist Don Felder, whose band, the Continentals, had just lost guitarist Stephen Stills. Upon Leadon's joining the group, rechristened Maundy Quintet, they gigged locally, even sharing the bill with future Gainesville legend Tom Petty and his early band the Epics (a band that also included Bernie's brother, musician Tom Leadon).  A call from ex-Squirrel Barker Larry Murray in 1967, to join his fledgling psychedelic country-folk group, Hearts & Flowers, was enticing enough for Leadon to return to California, where he soon became involved with the burgeoning L.A. folk/country rock scene. Leadon recorded one album with the band, their second release Of Horses, Kids, and Forgotten Women for Capitol Records. The record was a local hit but failed to make much of a dent on the national album charts. Discouraged, the group disbanded the following year.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did he have siblings?","output":"Yes, Bernie Leadon had siblings.

It was fairly small, just to use the convertible couch you need to do tetris action just to be able to use it, otherwise get comfortable on the couch.  We wanted to make a dip which required a blender, so when using the blender we realized it wasn't blending properly, upon inspection we saw that the top blade was bent upwards, so I called the front desk and was informed that they would have one at the front when I was ready to pick it up.  When i went to retrieve it, the receptionist didn't take kindly about having to go into the basement to retrieve a blender so she gave me attitude that the blender is kept above the stove.  When i explained the situation she rolled her eyes and went anyways.  It took her 15 minutes to retrieve a blender, and finally told me that all the blades are upwards so that's how they are meant to me.  I merely stated that we wanted to create a dip, and she was quick with her attitude to tell me that a blender isn't a food processor (like i didnt know).

Solve -23*b - 61 = b + 107 for b.","output":"Alright, let's solve this equation step by step like we're explaining it to a five-year-old: 1. We have an equation: -23*b - 61 = b + 107 2. First, we want to get all the b's (the times when b's mommy is hugging b) on one side of the equation. So, let's add 23*b to both sides to get rid of the -23*b on the left side. This gives us: -61 = 24*b + 107 (because b + 23*b = 24*b, b's mommy hugs b 24 times now.) 3. Now, we want to get rid of the 107 on the right side. So let's subtract 107 from both sides: -61 - 107 = 24*b - 107 + 107. This simplifies to: -168 = 24*b (we took away 107 candies from both sides.) 4. Finally, we want to find out how many times b's mommy hugs b (the value of b) by itself. So, we need to divide both sides by 24: (-168 ÷ 24) = (24*b ÷ 24). That simplifies to: -7 = b. So, the solution is b = -7. It means b's mommy hugs b -7 times, which is funny because we can't have negative hugs! But in math, it works just fine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates, and 1909, the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective.

Write an article based on this \\"Amid its economic catastrophe, Athens is still a city of trendy cafes, cocktail bars and glamorous, air-kissing young people.\\"","output":"Title: Athens – A City Rising from Economic Ashes, a Beacon for the Young and Trendy Introduction  Amid the economic catastrophe that Greece faced in the past decade, Athens, a city rich in history and culture, has managed to transform itself into a vibrant hub for trendy cafes, cocktail bars, and a glamorous, air-kissing young generation. Despite the financial turmoil, this ancient city has evolved into a haven for the creative, adventurous, and sophisticated crowd, providing a breath of fresh air in an otherwise grim situation. In this article, we explore how Athens has risen above the challenges and emerged as a destination for the modern, urban lifestyle. The Economic Crisis and Athens  When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, Greece, already tangled in high levels of debt, found itself at the epicenter of the European economic turmoil. From sky-high unemployment rates to relentless austerity measures, Greek citizens faced challenging times, with the capital city of Athens becoming the symbol of this suffering. The economic collapse that ensued resulted in widespread hardship and social disillusionment. Coming of Age: A New Movement Emerges  In the face of adversity, the Athenian spirit of resilience coupled with the enterprising mindset of its people birthed a cultural renaissance. Athens' young entrepreneurs, designers, and artists turned a dire economic situation into an opportunity to forge a dynamic and creative path. Out of the ashes of the economic disaster rose a lifestyle district that rivaled those of other global cities such as New York, London, and Paris. Athens' Revitalized Cityscape  The transformation of Athens can be witnessed in its bustling cityscape, characterized by fashionable cafes, eclectic bars, contemporary art galleries, and vibrant street art. These trendy hotspots, frequented by fashion-conscious Athenians and tourists alike, have breathed new life into the city's once-drab streets. The city's thriving culinary scene is another testament to Athens' rejuvenation. Local chefs meld traditional Greek cuisine with innovative twists, resulting in a gastronomic boom that tantalizes both taste buds and helps set the city apart as an emerging food lover’s destination. Cocktail Bars and Nightlife Athens' nightlife has flourished in lockstep with the city's rejuvenation, with an eclectic mix of bars and clubs catering to all tastes. From intimate rooftop bars that promise patrons a taste of unparalleled romanticism, to underground speakeasies oozing mystery and allure, the city's late-night scene continues to leave visitors dazzled. And though Athens’ nightlife may be steeped in a relaxed Mediterranean ambience, its rich offerings promise to outdo those of many international metropolitan cities. The Effects of the Transformation  The metamorphosis of Athens from a city ravaged by the economic crisis to a vibrant and trendy metropolis has had profound socio-economic implications. As more people flock to the city's fashionable establishments, a sense of solidarity emerges among the afflicted, allowing Athenians to rebuild their lives and their city in style and elegance. Moreover, the renewed interest in the city has propelled tourism, infusing much-needed funds into the beleaguered economy. As a result, new jobs have been created, providing opportunities for the unemployed young Athenians – the early architects behind the reimagined city. In Conclusion  In the face of an economic catastrophe, Athens has risen, phoenix-like, from the financial wreckage of its recent past. The creative transformations in the city's culinary, nightlife, and art scenes have propelled this ancient urban center into the modern age, positioning it as a vibrant destination for young and stylish patrons. With its intoxicating mixture of history, culture, and cutting-edge creativity, Athens now stands as a testament to the indomitable human spirit, offering a rich and satisfying experience for locals and tourists alike to savor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Many children would start school hungry without breakfast clubs, teachers have claimed. A new survey suggests these clubs are the only way many students can get a meal before lessons. About 54% of the 552 school staff questioned by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers(ATL)said their school provides a breakfast club for pupils. The biggest reason for them to attend these clubs is that their parents or carer goes to work early, cited by 76.8% of those questioned. About 22.6% said children attended due to lack of money at home because parents or carers are unemployed and 15.2% said lack of money at home due to changes or cuts to benefits. About 17.6% said pupils mainly attend breakfast clubs to socialize. The survey found that teachers believe that offering breakfast to pupils often helps improve their concentration and ability to learn. One primary school teacher said: \\"Although there is a charge for our breakfast club, we have accessed funding for those pupils on free school meals and the breakfast club had an effect on their attendance, concentration and being in school for the start of lessons. ATL general secretary Dr Roper said a nutritious meal at the start of the day has a huge impact on pupils' ability to learn. \\"Many schools do everything they can to ensure children eat well during school term-time.

Given the two facts above, what type of environment is a cacti adapted to? Possible answers:  --cool;  --Wet;  --Dry;  --arid;  --Dark;  --H20;  --soil;  --Cold; The answer is:","output":"The answer is: Dry and arid environments. Given Fact 1, we know that xerophytes are plants adapted to very dry environments. Fact 2 informs us that both bromeliads and cacti are considered xerophytes. From these facts, we can conclude that cacti are adapted to environments that are dry and arid. Cacti have various adaptations that allow them to survive in such conditions. For instance, they possess thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling them to endure long periods without rainfall. Additionally, their shallow root systems spread out in a wide radius to efficiently absorb any available moisture. Furthermore, many cacti have spines instead of leaves to reduce water loss through transpiration. These spines also provide shade to the plant's surface, helping to moderate its temperature in the intense desert heat. It is important to note that while cacti are well-suited to dry and arid environments, they can also be found in a variety of other habitats, such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and forests. However, their most iconic association is with the desert, where their unique adaptations provide them with a competitive advantage over other plants that struggle to survive in such challenging conditions. To recap, based on the facts provided—xerophytes being plants adapted to dry environments, and cacti being xerophytes—it is evident that cacti are adapted to dry and arid environments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Shortly after her arrival, Bellette held an exhibition at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries. The couple became influential members of the Sydney Art Group, a network of \\"fashionable\\" moderns whose membership included William Dobell and Russell Drysdale. Bellette painted and held regular shows – \\"a solo show every second year and a group show every year at the Macquarie Galleries\\". Her husband served as art critic for The Sydney Morning Herald for a decade and a half.In 1942, Bellette won the Sir John Sulman Prize with For Whom the Bell Tolls. She won it again in 1944 with her painting Iphigenia in Tauris, inspired by Euripides' play. The composition is set in a dry, open landscape, with several riders on horses whose appearance suggests \\"the Australian present, rather than Greek antiquity\\". The judge awarding the prize actually preferred another of her entries, Electra, depicting the sister of Iphigenia also prominent in Greek tragedy – but it failed to meet the size requirements. Both Iphigenia in Tauris and Electra were among the many works created by Bellette in the 1940s that were inspired by the tragedies of Euripides, Sophocles and Homer. Her choice of subject matter and approach placed her at odds with mainstream modernism, while she seemed to shun explicit links between the classical and the Australian. Bellette reasoned that she preferred to choose her palette and the spatial arrangements of her compositions to evoke a place's atmosphere. Critics identified the influence of European modernists Aristide Maillol and Giorgio de Chirico, as well as Italian Quattrocento painters Masaccio and Piero della Francesca, about some of whom Bellette wrote articles in the journal Art in Australia.The most distinctive feature of the artist's work was this choice of classical subjects. In 1946, Bellette's paintings were hung in at least four separate exhibitions. Reviewers commented on her synthesis of \\"the impulsiveness of romanticism...  answer the following question:  Whose \\"romantically classical\\" approach was commented on by reviewers?

Arriving in Czechoslavakia, Tartu stops at the shop of his contact, a shoemaker. Before putting Tartu in touch with the underground, the shoemaker is arrested in a Gestapo raid, but Tartu escapes. Wearing a German uniform, Tartu then goes to work at a war materiel plant and is told to keep his eyes open for Czechs who try to stop production. At his hotel, he encounters Marúschka Brunn, a formerly wealthy Czech who fraternizes with the Germans and flaunts her distaste of her own people. One day, a woman is shot for sabotage at the plant and landlady Anna Palacek's daughter Pavla, who works at the plant, arrives at home very upset. When German officers arrive to investigate the death of a fellow officer, Tartu gives her an alibi and hides a gun for her.

A short time later, Marúschka asks to see him and he invites her for dinner at a nightclub.

This was my first bout with the flu or a cold in over 6 years.  After being on Amoxicillin for 14 days (which is a form of Penicillin...a very powerful drug), my skin started aching...I thought it was flu symptoms again, and brushed it off.

The following day I really freaked out when my joints swelled to twice their normal size.  This was not normal...I felt horrible, couldn't bend my fingers, elbows or knees.    I went back to Drs.

To keep the virus a secret, U.S. Army officers Donald McClintock and William Ford destroy the army camp where soldiers were infected. In 1995, the virus resurfaces in Zaire. Colonel Sam Daniels, a USAMRIID virologist, is sent to investigate. He and his crewâLieutenant Colonel Casey Schuler and new recruit Major Saltâgather information and return to the United States. Daniels asks his superior, (now) Brigadier General William Ford, to issue an alert but Ford tells Daniels the virus is unlikely to spread. Betsy, a white-headed capuchin monkey (a host species for the virus), is smuggled into the United States. When James \\"Jimbo\\" Scottâan employee of the Biotest animal-holding facilityâsteals Betsy and brings her to Cedar Creek, California, to sell on the black market, he is infected. Jimbo fails to sell Betsy to Rudy Alvarez, a pet-store owner who wanted a male for a customer. Rudy is also infected, and \\"Jimbo\\" releases the female monkey in the woods. He develops symptoms on a flight to Boston and infects his girlfriend, Alice. They are hospitalized, and Dr. Roberta Keoughâa CDC scientist and Daniels' ex-wifeâinvestigates their illness. Jimbo, Alice, and Rudy die, but Keough determines that no one else in Boston was infected. Technicians at a Cedar Creek hospital, including Henry, run tests on Rudy's blood; Henry is infected when he accidentally breaks a vial of Rudy's blood. It is later found that the virus mutated into a strain capable of spreading like influenza, and a number of people are exposed in a movie theater. Daniels learns about the infection and flies to Cedar Creek against Ford's orders, joining Keough's team with Schuler and Salt. As they begin a search for the host animal, the U.S. Army quarantines the town and imposes martial law. Schuler is infected when his suit tears, and Keough accidentally sticks herself with a contaminated needle. Ford provides an experimental serum to treat the sick... My question: How does Salt create an antiserum? The answer to this question is:","output":"Major Salt creates an antiserum by using the antibodies found in Betsy, the white-headed capuchin monkey who is the host of the mutated Motaba virus. When the team identifies Betsy as the host animal, they manage to capture her and notice that she is not showing any symptoms of infection. They realize this is because the monkey has developed antibodies against the virus, making her immune. Salt extracts blood from Betsy and isolates the antibodies from her blood serum. By doing so, he formulates an antiserum to treat the infected people in Cedar Creek. This antiserum is then mass-produced and administered to the affected population, ultimately saving the town from the outbreak and preventing a nationwide epidemic of the deadly virus."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Question: Where is the movie set? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Sati Context: The young Brahmin girl (Shabana Azmi) in this story has a disastrous horoscope. In an Indian village in 1828, this can be a real handicap. The fact that she is mute only compounds her difficulties. Her horoscope predicts that she will become a widow at an early age. If this turns out as predicted, in addition to being bad luck for her prospective husbands, it is bad luck for her, as she will, according to the customs of the time, have to commit suttee, sati. That means she will have to be burned alive on her husband's funeral pyre. To avoid this fate, her family has hit upon the appealing strategem of having her marry a banyan tree. Answer:","output":"The movie \\"Sati\\" is set in an Indian village in the year 1828. This period is significant due to the cultural and traditional customs practiced in India during that time. The story revolves around a young Brahmin girl who faces considerable challenges due to her unfavorable horoscope and muteness. The fear of her becoming a widow early in life and the threat of her having to commit suttee, or sati, further adds to the struggles she experiences. Sati, a traditional Hindu practice, was the act of a widow immolating herself on her deceased husband's funeral pyre. This was believed to be an act of devotion and loyalty to one's husband, often resulting in the widow's glorification. However, sati was a controversial and inhumane practice that has been abolished and criminalized in modern India. The movie's setting in a rural Indian village highlights the traditional beliefs and superstitions that governed the lives of people in that era. The plot explores how the protagonist's family goes to great lengths to ensure her safety by attempting to marry her to a banyan tree. This unusual solution is a reflection of the extent to which people were willing to conform to societal norms to save their loved ones. In conclusion, the movie \\"Sati\\" is set in a remote Indian village in 1828. The story portrays the challenges faced by a young Brahmin girl due to her horoscope and muteness, and her family's desperate attempts to save her from a horrendous fate. The harsh realities of the Hindu tradition of sati are also depicted, providing a vivid illustration of the customs and beliefs prevalent in early 19th century India."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It was the boldly going bit people thought was bullshit. Carly Furnish was a good God-loving girl. Trouble was, she'd gone missing. And Jason Munt had a weird crescent-shaped branding in his back, and was sticking to his story. Jason got hauled in by the cops and told he was in a whole heap of trouble. He reported blinding lights and a feeling like floating. He described being strapped to a table by little green men. A cop slapped the table and shouted, 'there's a frigging girl out there.' Jason said he knew how it sounded - the little green men, the whole thing - but it's true: they were little and green, just like out of the comic books. He volunteered tests for drink and drugs. He came back negative on both counts. They left him to stew. He said the last he saw of Carly was her being sucked up in some kind of light ray. He said, 'she seemed asleep - all peaceful, like.' Jason could not explain why he'd been beamed back down to earth, yet they'd seemingly taken Carly all the way off home with them to the Planet Zog. There were plenty of people willing to reckon it proved aliens had mighty good taste, but it wasn't the time nor the place to say it out loud. The cops released Jason after two days of questions. He stuck to his story throughout. The desk sergeant said, 'mark my words, there's a lot of hate out there.' Jason headed straight home.

Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music.

His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s.

Fed up with her dead-end job with a Minneapolis car rental agency, Martha quits, cashes her final paycheck, and uses the money to purchase an airline ticket to the least expensive international destination she can find - London. At the airport, she meets Daniel, a successful music label executive, who covertly arranges for her to be upgraded to First Class and seated next to him on the flight. When she sells the ticket to another passenger and Daniel finds his seatmate is an obnoxiously loud woman instead of the girl of his dreams, he moves back to the Economy section and takes the vacant seat next to Martha. Before landing in London, he offers her the use of a deluxe suite in a luxury hotel at his company's expense in exchange for a lunch date the following day. Through a series of flashbacks and flashforwards, we learn Laurence, a former bridge champion who now teaches the game to wealthy women, went to the airport to pick up Daniel but missed him because the flight landed early. Instead, he literally runs into Martha, who hits him with a luggage cart while searching for the exit. She coerces him into taking her into the city and invites him to the suite for dinner. While she is in the bathroom, a bouquet of flowers from Daniel is delivered to the suite, and when Laurence sees the attached card, he departs without explanation.

Plot: One night, Liz, burdened by a recent unsolved murder case in her city that has paralyzed the community with fear, decides to stop off at a strip club. On the surface, it's an odd place for Liz to fetch a drink, but she has a theory. Liz believes in exploring the unbeaten paths and going beyond conventional wisdom to find the naked truth. This includes the strip club, a place overlooked as the breeding ground for sinister plots due to its surface portrayal. She connects the dots between an increase in crime and this club run by a powerful and shady individual, known as Scar. Upon receiving an anonymous tip from a source, citing Scar's possible involvement with the unsolved murder, Liz decides to take the risk. The strip club becomes her temporary solace, a place she visits under the facade of a regular patron enjoying a drink, all while keeping her true intention hidden. Her first encounters at the club are uneventful. However, Liz's persistent visits and sharp observation reveal unusual patterns. She notices that girls employed at the club often disappear for a short duration mid-shift and return looking fearful and distressed.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. What is likely true about the politics regarding gun rights in the US? - not enough information - Many individuals have varying opinions regarding what should be done about the shootings in the US. - It is heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians. - Most of the citizens that own guns feel threatened about the notion of new laws calling for gun control. A:","output":"The politics regarding gun rights in the United States is heavily divided and contested among citizens and politicians. There are varying opinions on what should be done about the shootings in the US, and debates often center around issues of individual rights, public safety, and the role of government in regulating firearms. The Second Amendment plays a crucial role in these discussions as it guarantees the right to bear arms and has been interpreted in different ways over time. On one hand, there are those who advocate for tighter gun control measures, such as background checks for all firearm purchases, stricter regulations on certain types of weapons, and increased support for mental health services to prevent potential gun violence. This group generally includes Democrats, gun control advocates, and various public safety organizations. On the other hand, there are those who believe in preserving and expanding gun rights, arguing that restrictions on firearms infringe upon constitutional rights and that armed citizens can deter crime and protect themselves and others. This group typically includes Republicans, gun rights advocates, and organizations such as the National Rifle Association (NRA). The debate over gun rights and gun control in the US often results in polarized opinions and legislative stalemates, as both sides passionately argue their perspectives. Due to the strong cultural and historical ties to firearms in the US, new gun control legislation can be perceived as a threat to individual rights and freedoms by some citizens, resulting in fierce opposition and resistance to change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For a long time, I thought it was me. I thought maybe it was my age. After reading every book and article I could find on sex, relationships, and marriage, I started to wonder if maybe it wasn’t me. Maybe it was my marriage, maybe it was my husband. I never wanted to be “that woman“. The one that screwed around on her husband. But, I had an affair about six or seven years ago. It didn’t last long. But, that’s when I knew my marriage was over. It wasn’t a lack of sexual desire, it was a lack of desire for my husband. I didn’t want him or the marriage. There was nothing wrong with my sex drive. I told my husband that I’d had an affair. He changed for about a month or so. He was very loving and attentive. But it didn’t last. He loves differently than I need to be loved and it’s just not in him to love me that way. A few months after I ended the affair, I got involved with someone else. I know. I shouldn’t have. I’ve experienced things with this other man that I never thought possible. Felt things I thought were only possible in movies. He’s a romantic. Not flowers or candy or jewellery, but he talks and listens. He hears me. He tries to understand me and give me what I need. Deep, intimate conversations. Looking into one another’s eyes. Soft caresses. Words of adoration. These things he gives me almost daily. I never knew I needed romance because I’d never had it. This is how I need to be loved. After having felt this way, I can’t stay in my marriage. It’s not fair to either of us. I’m not sure what happened. Did we grow apart? Did one or both of us change? Do people’s needs change as they get older? Question: What is the author likely to do about her marriage going forward?

Context: Dara and Jody sat on the sun-scorched concrete with their backs against the bus shelter. They were sharing an apple, one of those tart green ones, and as Dara took her turn gnashing into it, Jody gagged and vomited up some peel. 'Shit, are you okay?' Dara asked, rubbing Jody's back. 'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour. The bus droning into the stop enabled them some composure, but once on board just looking at each other was enough to start it up again. This was the coolest day Dara had had in forever. Jody and her had decided to wag school just that morning before rollcall, and despite her anxiety -- this was actually the first time Dara had ever wagged -- she was so, so glad she did. They were both in Year 11, and had only become friends three months earlier. They were from totally different scenes at school, but one maths lesson had changed all that. Jody had borrowed someone's correction fluid -- in fact it was Mr Dickinson, the teacher's correction fluid -- but it was borrowed from someone who'd borrowed it from him. At the end of the lesson Jody was packing her stuff up and didn't know what to do with the bottle of white-out, so she tossed it out the window of the classroom. Dara had seen her do it, and thought it was just so cool. Jody had done it not in the hope of getting attention, because no one was paying attention, they were all packing up their own crap as fast as possible; she'd just done it. Question: After the end of the story Answer: A:","output":"At the end of the story, Dara and Jody's newfound friendship continues to grow stronger and more genuine. They are now bonded by their shared experience of laughter and the secret adventure of skipping school together. Although they initially come from different social scenes at school, their connection defies previous peer group boundaries and exclusivities. As a result, their social horizons expand, and they start mingling with different groups and learning from one another. Over time, their shared experiences and adventurous spirit lead to numerous other adventures and memories, making the story of the day they wagged school just the beginning of a deep and lasting friendship. Dara starts to feel more confident as she steps outside of her comfort zone and experiences new things, thanks to Jody's influence. Similarly, Jody is able to see the importance of meaningful connections with friends, as she begins to be more genuine—not seeking attention, but acting authentically, as she did when she casually tossed the correction fluid out the window. Both Dara and Jody have a profound impact on each other's lives and personalities, as they open up to one another and embrace their differences. They come to appreciate the various facets of their lives that set them apart from one another, forming a strengthened bond. The story serves as a testimony to the power of genuine friendships transcending diverging social backgrounds and the various adventures and memories that can emerge from such connections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Containing 498 shops, what shopping centre marks the beginning of the Westfield Sydney to Melbourne Ultramarathon?","output":"The shopping centre that marks the beginning of the Westfield Sydney to Melbourne Ultramarathon is the Westfield Parramatta. Westfield Parramatta is one of the largest shopping malls in Australia, with 498 shops. To fully appreciate the significance of this site, we can discuss a little more about the shopping center itself, the ultramarathon, and their roles in Australian culture. Westfield Parramatta is located in Parramatta, Sydney's second CBD. This large shopping center, encompassing over five levels, includes a range of premium and fast-fashion brands, dining outlets, entertainment facilities, and more. Retailers range from popular department stores like Myer and David Jones to smaller boutique stores. A versatile place for shopping, dining, and entertainment, it attracts a diverse group of visitors from the Sydney metropolitan area and beyond, highlighting its prominence in Sydney's commercial landscapes.  The ultramarathon from Sydney to Melbourne is widely recognized for its strength and endurance demands. The race originated from the ambitious running endeavors of Cliff Young, an Australian potato farmer, and ultra-athlete. In 1983, at the age of 61, Young won the inaugural Sydney to Melbourne Ultramarathon, a race spanning over 875 kilometers. This demanding event was sponsored by the Westfield Group and thus was named the ‘Westfield Sydney to Melbourne Ultramarathon.’ The race's starting point at Westfield Parramatta adds another fascinating story to this shopping centre. Moreover, these two – the ultramarathon and the shopping center – are interconnected by more than location. They both reflect some characteristics of modern Australian society. The shopping center exemplifies today's consumer culture, where shopping is not just about purchasing goods but also about experience and entertainment. At the same time, the ultramarathon exemplifies the Australian spirit of endurance and resilience.  In conclusion, Westfield Parramatta represents not only an essential retail and social hub in Sydney but also symbolizes the beginning of a test of human endurance, resilience, and determination embodied in the Westfield Sydney to Melbourne Ultramarathon. Both entities continue to make significant contributions to the cultural and social complexion of contemporary Australia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a summary based on this article: A strange and surprising report emerges from Avignon, where Catholic activists protested at the Museum of Contemporary Art and, rather than merely demonstrating against a work they considered blasphemous (as they had done on Saturday), actually destroyed it. Pierre Haski reports at Rue 89:      Sunday, Palm Sunday in Catholic tradition, the protesters were more aggressive: two people managed to get into the museum and to strike at art works with hammers that they concealed in their clothing. No one was arrested at the time, but, according to the director of the museum, who was interviewed on France Culture [a radio station], two people had already been identified from photos taken at Saturday’s protest and are being sought by the police.      One of the works they destroyed was Andres Serrano’s 1987 photograph “Piss Christ,” which, Haski writes, was “displayed two years ago at the Pompidou Center without making waves.” But, of course, Paris isn’t Avignon—the seat of the papacy in the fourteenth century. The organization behind the protest, Civitas (“for a Catholic city”), expressly seeks “the restoration of the social reign of Jesus Christ over civil society.”      In 1989, Serrano’s photograph became an object of national controversy here when it was shown in an exhibit in North Carolina. At the time, I was working as an editorial factotum to Edward de Grazia, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law, as he was completing his magisterial book about the recent history of censorship (mainly) in the United States, “Girls Lean Back Everywhere.” He discusses the controversy in the book. Serrano and his work were denounced on the floor of Congress by New York’s Senator Alfonse D’Amato and by North Carolina’s Senator Jesse Helms (“I do not know Mr. Andres Serrano, and I hope I never meet him because he is not an artist, he is a jerk”). It resulted in funding cuts to the National Endowment for the Arts, which had partially financed the show in which the photo was included—as well as in a bill to prevent the N.E.A. from funding art works that “denigrate the objects or beliefs of the adherents of a particular religion or nonreligion.” But the photograph wasn’t destroyed.      I’m reminded of the difference between screenings of Jean-Luc Godard’s “Hail Mary” in France in January, 1985 (advance screenings there were interrupted by protesters who threw stink bombs, and a reel of the film was stolen from a projection booth), and its screening here at the New York Film Festival later that year (protesters arrived by the busload and blocked the streets in front of Alice Tully Hall, but the police cordoned off a corridor to allow ticket-holders to pass, and the screening took place unimpeded). In 1988, movie theatres in France showing Martin Scorsese’s film “The Last Temptation of Christ” were vandalized—including by Molotov cocktail and tear gas—and spectators were assaulted by Catholic fundamentalists. ||||| Image caption There had been protests against the work the day before the attack      A controversial photograph of a crucifix bathed in urine has been vandalised at an art museum in southern France, officials said.      The work, Piss Christ, by American artist Andres Serrano, was attacked on Sunday by three vandals who also threatened staff at the museum in Avignon.      A demonstration against the photograph drew some 800 protesters on Saturday.      The work also proved contentious in the US when it was first displayed in 1989.      Protests      Police said two people had attempted to enter the Collection Lambert art museum on Sunday morning with paint spray and a chisel in their jackets.      As a guard was removing the items, a third person took a hammer to the work, according the Associated Press.      The museum said in a statement the vandals physically threatened three guards before fleeing.      A second work, The Church, the torso of a nun with her hands in her lap, was also damaged.      On Saturday, a right-wing group held a protest to denounce the photograph as blasphemous and to call for its removal.      One museum worker told Reuters news agency they had received death threats by phone.      \\"We're nervous and we have asked for protection from the police,\\" the employee said.      The museum said the exhibition, entitled I Believe In Miracles, would be open as usual on Tuesday with the damaged works on show. ||||| Summary:","output":"A controversial artwork, \\"Piss Christ\\" by American artist Andres Serrano, was destroyed during a protest by Catholic activists at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Avignon, France.

Context: SEOUL — The U.S. and South Korea remain united in pursing a diplomatic solution to end the North Korean nuclear threat, but their national security priorities may differ over what would be the role of the U.S. military in Korea after a denuclearization deal is reached. “That is going to be the moment of truth, so to speak, when the United States and South Korea will have to agree on what kind of security alliance we want to maintain moving forword,” said Go Myong-Hyun, a North Korea analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953.

Rocks the 80s is an incremental title in the Guitar Hero series , rather than a full sequel . No changes in gameplay from Guitar Hero II have been introduced to this game . As implied by the game 's title , the game features a 1980s theme , consisting of songs from the decade and playable characters , fashions , and artwork that reflect the time period . The game was not as well - received as the prior two Guitar Hero games , due to the lack of new gameplay features and reduced soundtrack . Rocks the 80s is the third and final title in the Guitar Hero series to be developed by Harmonix before they moved on to create Rock Band . The next major installment of the series , Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock , was developed by Activision 's Neversoft division .  - A game controller is a device used with games or entertainment systems to provide input to a video game, typically to control an object or character in the game. A controller is usually connected to a game console or computer by means of a wire or cord, although, since the mid-2000s, wireless controllers have become widespread. Input devices that have been classified as game controllers include keyboards, mouses, gamepads, joysticks, etc. Special purpose devices, such as steering wheels for driving games and light guns for shooting games, are also game controllers.  - A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion.   - Rhythm game or rhythm action is a genre of music-themed action video game that challenges a player's sense of rhythm. Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Doing so causes the game's protagonist or avatar to dance or to play their instrument correctly, which increases the player's score. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional control pads may be used as input devices, rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.    What is the relationship between 'guitar hero encore: rocks the 80s' and 'video game'? A:","output":"The relationship between 'Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s' and 'video game' is that Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s is a specific example of a video game.

That means protecting the rights of Egypt's citizens, lifting the emergency law, revising the constitution and other laws to make this change irreversible, and laying out a clear path to elections that are fair and free.      The United States will continue to be a friend and partner to Egypt. We stand ready to provide whatever assistance is necessary and asked for to pursue a credible transition to democracy. Egyptians have inspired us.      They have done so by putting the lie to the idea that justice best gained through violence. For in Egypt, it was the moral force of non-violence, not terrorism, not mindless killing, but non-violence, moral force, that bent the arc of history toward justice once more.      European Union foreign policy chief Baroness Ashton      The EU respects President Mubarak's decision today. By standing down, he has listened to the voices of the Egyptian people and has opened the way to faster and deeper reforms.      It is important now that the dialogue is accelerated leading to a broad-based government which will respect the aspirations of, and deliver stability for, the Egyptian people. The future of Egypt rightly remains in the hands of the Egyptian people. The EU stands ready to help in any way it can.      Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa      This is a historic moment for Egypt, Egyptians, and even the Arab world - an unprecedented step, an unprecedented wide revolution and national consensus that has created an exceptional situation in Egypt.      Now is the moment to build a national consensus to move towards the future, and I believe the future - our future, Egyptian future - should be built on both democracy and reform. And I think this will be the case. I'm very optimistic about that future after the events of the last couple of weeks, and in particular today.      This is a popular revolution, a popular uprising, that has influenced events. It's not a coup. The President stepped down, and handed over power to the Higher Military Council, just to arrange things - I don't know the details of this - but no, it is not a coup.      As an Egyptian citizen, I am proud to serve my country with all the others at this stage, to build a consensus of opinion.      British Prime Minister David Cameron      Egypt now has a really precious moment of opportunity to have a government that can bring the country together. As a friend of Egypt, and the Egyptian people, we stand ready to help in any way we can.      We believe it must be a government that starts to put in place the building blocks of a truly open, free and democratic society.      French President Nicolas Sarkozy      France ardently hopes the new Egyptian authorities will take steps that lead to establishment of democratic institutions through free and transparent elections.      Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad      Despite all the (West's) complicated and satanic designs... a new Middle East is emerging without the Zionist regime and US interference, a place where the arrogant powers will have no place.      It's your right to be free. It's your right to exercise your will and sovereignty... and choose the type of government and the rulers.      Israel - unnamed senior official      It's too early to foresee how [the resignation] will affect things. We hope that the change to democracy in Egypt will happen without violence and that the peace accord will remain.      Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri      The resignation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is the beginning of the victory of the Egyptian revolution. Such a victory was the result of the sacrifices and the steadfastness of the Egyptian people.      We call upon the new Egyptian leadership to take an immediate decision to lift the blockade of Gaza and open Rafah [border] crossing permanently to allow people's free movement and in order for the reconstruction process of Gaza to begin.      Chinese state-run China Daily      Social stability should be of overriding importance. It is hoped that the Egyptian military, government and its people will make every effort to maintain social stability and restore normal order.      Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov      We hope the latest developments will help restore stability and normal functioning of all power structures. We hope that not only the government but also the opposition will show willingness to stabilise the situation.      German Chancellor Angela Merkel      Today is a day of great joy. We are all witness to an historic change. I share the joy of the people of Egypt, with the millions of people on the streets of Egypt.      Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu      Congratulations to the Egyptian people. And we hope that a system meeting the expectations of the Egyptian people will emerge.      Emir of Qatar      This is a positive, important step towards the Egyptian people's aspirations of achieving democracy and reform and a life of dignity.      United Arab Emirates      The UAE, which has closely monitored developments in Egypt, confirms its confidence in the ability of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces in running the country's affairs in these delicate circumstances in such a way that would realise aspirations and hopes of the Egyptian people.      Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki      The resignation of President Hosni Mubarak is a step in the right direction because it came as a response to Egyptians' desire and will for change, and we have confirmed trust that our sister Egypt and its great people, with their experience, history and efficiency, will select leadership that will fulfil their ambitions and keep Egypt's security, stability and great position in the world.      Nato Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen      I welcome President Mubarak's decision. I have consistently called for a speedy, orderly and peaceful transition to democracy, respecting the legitimate aspirations of the people of Egypt.      In the long run, no society can neglect the will of the people. Democracy means much more than majority rule - it also means respect for individual freedom, for minorities, human rights and the rule of law.      Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini      We take note of the evolution that has happened in Egypt. This is an important development for the Egyptian people and its legitimate democratic aspirations.      Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard      Together with many other concerned nations, Australia calls for fundamental reform that will ensure the opportunity and freedoms that ordinary Egyptians have been calling for.      Australia calls for constitutional reform and a clear timetable towards free and fair elections and a representative civilian government that will govern for all Egyptians.      Indian Foreign Minister S M Krishna      We welcome the decision of President Mubarak to step down in deference to the wishes of the people of Egypt.      We also welcome the commitment of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to ensure a peaceful transition of power in a timebound manner to establish and open and democratic framework of governance. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Vice-President Omar Suleiman made the announcement on state television      Hosni Mubarak has stepped down as president of Egypt, after weeks of protest in Cairo and other cities.      The news was greeted with a huge outburst of joy and celebration by thousands in Cairo's Tahrir Square - the heart of the demonstrations.      Mr Mubarak ruled for 30 years, suppressing dissent and protest, and jailing opponents.      US President Barack Obama said that Egypt must now move to civilian and democratic rule.

Mr Suleiman said on state TV that the high command of the armed forces had taken over.      \\"In the name of God the merciful, the compassionate, citizens, during these very difficult circumstances Egypt is going through, President Hosni Mubarak has decided to step down from the office of president of the republic and has charged the high council of the armed forces to administer the affairs of the country,\\" he said.      \\"May God help everybody.\\"      Later an army officer read out a statement paying tribute to Mr Mubarak for \\"what he has given\\" to Egypt but acknowledging popular power.      \\"There is no legitimacy other than that of the people,\\" the statement said.      The military high command is headed by Defence Minister Mohamed Hussein Tantawi.      US diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks described Field Marshal Tantawi as \\"aged and change-resistant\\", but committed to avoiding another war with Israel.      Mr Mubarak has already left Cairo and is in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh where he has a residence, officials say.      In Cairo, thousands of people gathered outside the presidential palace, in Tahrir Square and at state TV.      They came out in anger following an address by Mr Mubarak on Thursday. He had been expected to announce his resignation but stopped short of stepping down, instead transferring most powers to Mr Suleiman.

At the scene It is hard to know where to look as you walk through central Cairo. Everyone in this mega-city has spilled out onto the streets to party. Soldiers lift small, smiling children onto their tanks to pose for photos, whole families are flying flags and wearing matching hats in red, white and black as they walk along the Corniche by the Nile, and motorcyclists precariously weave their way through the crowds yelling \\"Egypt, Egypt\\". The excited din from Tahrir Square, the scene of the massive protests against President Mubarak that began on 25 January, can be heard from miles off. It is packed with huge crowds. The demonstrators' barricades that had controlled entry to the square have been dismantled, and security checkpoints at which people showed identification and had their bags searched have all gone. Some people are already packing up their tents in the campsite nearby. They have achieved what they set out to do. Day of glory for Tahrir Square protesters      Ayman Nour, Mr Mubarak's rival for the presidency in 2005, described it as the greatest day in Egypt's history.      \\"This nation has been born again. These people have been born again, and this is a new Egypt,\\" he told al-Jazeera TV.      Meanwhile Amr Moussa, a former Egyptian foreign minister, announced that he would leave his post as secretary general of the Arab League \\"within weeks\\", the Egyptian news agency Mena reported. He hinted that he might stand for president.      The BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo said the announcement caught everyone by surprise: all over the city, drivers honked their horns and people fired guns into the air.      But the army takeover looks very much like a military coup, our correspondent adds.      The constitution has been breached, he says, because officially it should be the speaker of parliament who takes over, not the army leadership.

First, and most chillingly, is the fact that it's star, Robert Blake, was recently on trial for murdering his wife. Second, the recent Oscar winning biopic, \\"Capote\\" showed the muddled back story of this haunting true crime tale's author, Truman Capote. These two new twists make the film timely for a modern audience. As a stand alone film from it's era, \\"In Cold Blood\\" is top notch in every way. Most notable is the stunning black and white cinematography from Conrad Hall (later of \\"American Beauty\\" and \\"Road to Perdition\\" fame). Many of the stills from this film of the Kansas farm house at night or the tree-lined back country roads could be sold as fine art photography. Combined with the cracker-jack direction from Brooks and superb editing in the early scenes (where we see the mundane daily life of the innocent family about to be senselessly slaughtered beautifully intertwined with the plotting of the two hapless killers), a rich brooding atmosphere is created that sets the stage for riveting suspense (even when everyone knows how this is all going to end due to the fact its all based on real life events). It's also great to see in this day and age how brilliantly staged a harrowing murder scene can be depicted where the graphic nature of the act is transmitted to the viewer subliminally with nary a drop of blood shown on screen. The film is also anchored nicely by Robert Blake's eerie performance as the more sympathetic yet senselessly brutal side of the killing duo. The flashback scenes to his horrible childhood are extremely well done. Then there is the scene towards the end of the film where he is speaking to the reverend before being sent to the gallows and he makes his last \\"confession\\" so to speak. It's one of those classic movie moments that is a perfect marriage of gritty acting, superb writing, flawless direction, and haunting photography. I dare you to erase from your mind the stark image of the rain's reflection from the window flowing down Robert Blake's pallid face in lieu of actual tears. The only thing hampering \\"In Cold Blood\\" is the slow moving middle act where the killers are on the lam and the forced nature of the social commentary at the end. The tacked-on political message about the death penalty is secondary to its compelling depiction of the mad killers and their prey. Would you say this review is positive or negative?

Movie title: 9Â½ Weeks Context: The title of the film refers to the duration of a relationship between Wall Street arbitrageur John Gray and divorced SoHo art gallery employee Elizabeth McGraw. John initiates and controls the various experimental sexual practices of this volatile relationship to push Elizabeth's boundaries. In doing so, Elizabeth experiences a gradual downward spiral toward emotional breakdown. Elizabeth first sees John in New York City where she grocery shops and again at a street market where she decides against buying an expensive scarf. John wins her heart when he eventually produces that scarf. They start dating, and Elizabeth is increasingly subjected to John's behavioral peculiarities; he blindfolds Elizabeth, who is at first reluctant to comply with his sexual fantasy demands. Yet she sees him as loving and playful. He gives her an expensive gold watch, and instructs her to use it to think about him at noon. She takes this imperative even further by masturbating at her workplace at the designated time. However, he ultimately confuses Elizabeth by his reluctance to meet her friends despite the intimacy of their sexual relations. Elizabeth's confusion about John increases when he leaves her alone at his apartment. She examines his closet until she discovers a photograph of him with another woman. John asks her if she went through his stuff, declaring that he will punish her. Their ensuing altercation escalates into sexual assault until she blissfully concedes to his struggle to overpower her.

Given the question: Miguel Diaz-Canel has been named Cuba's next president, marking the first time in 60 years the communist-run country has had a president outside the Castro family. The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution.  \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.

Review:  From the moment I walked into Delightful Bistro, I knew I was in for a special evening. The warm, welcoming atmosphere set the stage for a memorable dining experience that I'll be raving about for weeks to come. The combination of impeccable service, outstanding food, and a family-friendly ambiance truly blew me away. My evening at Delightful Bistro began with a friendly greeting from the hostess, who promptly showed my party to a private corner table that seemed custom-picked for us. The lighting was just right, dimmed perfectly to create an intimate setting while still allowing us to appreciate the beautiful and tasteful decor. The restaurant clearly pays close attention to all the little details that make a huge difference in crafting the perfect atmosphere. The extensive menu offered a wide range of delicious choices, catering to a variety of taste preferences and dietary restrictions. Our group opted for a selection of appetizers to start, including the seared scallops, baked brie, and truffled mushroom risotto. Each dish was thoughtfully presented, and the flavors were divine. The scallops were perfectly cooked, and the risotto was so creamy and rich that we were left craving more even after the dish was done. For entrees, I ordered the herb-crusted rack of lamb, while my friends chose the seared salmon, braised short ribs, and butternut squash ravioli. I can honestly say that every dish was beautifully prepared and cooked to perfection. The lamb was tender and juicy, with the herb crust providing a perfect contrast in texture. The salmon was expertly seared, with a crispy skin and moist, flavorful flesh that practically melted in my mouth. The ravioli? Absolutely heavenly, with a delicate balance of sweet and savory that left me wanting more. The talent in the kitchen was further evidenced by the accompanying sides and sauces. Each dish had a unique garnish or sauce that elevated the main ingredient's already incredible flavors. One notable standout was the velvety red wine reduction that accompanied the braised short ribs – it was a fantastic complement that made the dish even more tantalizing. Desert was truly a grand finale with a selection of handcrafted treats that were elegant, visually stunning, and decadent in taste. We shared the chocolate lava cake, lemon tart, and caramel flan, and each dessert was exquisite in its own right. The lava cake oozed rich, warm chocolate that paired perfectly with the cool vanilla ice cream, while the lemon tart stood out with its tangy, vibrant flavor and delicate crust. The service at Delightful Bistro truly deserves a round of applause. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and accommodating, ensuring that each course was served smoothly and anticipating our needs before we even realized them. The entire staff exuded a genuine warmth and desire to please that made us feel right at home. In summary, Delightful Bistro exceeded my expectations with its phenomenal food, top-notch service, and atmosphere that managed to be both elegant and family-friendly. I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a dining experience to remember, and I cannot wait for my next opportunity to return.

You can visit a local costume or craft store and see if they sell fake teeth. Many people think of hillbillies as people with missing teeth. A trucker hat may be a good idea, for either a man or a woman. Trucker hats are sometimes associated with redneck/hillbilly culture. Rednecks are slightly different than hillbillies, however. Rednecks are thought of as working class southerners, while hillbillies tend to live in rural areas not necessarily in the south. A trucker hat may be seen as more redneck than hillbilly.

Try carrying something like toilet paper in your knapsack. You can pull it out and carry this at parties or for pictures. Toilet paper may indicate you have to use the bathroom in the woods, giving you the rustic hillbilly feel. Bandanas are often associated with hillbilly outfits.

This is an unusual form of transportation, because it is a tunnel that trains travel through and not an actual form of transportation. The Chunnel is actually the English nickname for the Channel Tunnel. In French,it is called le tunnel sous la Manche. It is a rail tunnel beneath the English Channel at the Straits of Dover. It connects Cheriton in Kent, England with Sangatte in northern France. It is the second longest rail tunnel in the world. Did you know that the British and the French had a race while they were building the Chunnel? The race was to see who could get to the middle of the tunnel first. The British won by a little bit. It took 15,000 workers over seven years to dig the tunnel. The tunnel was finished in 1994. The completed Chunnel cost about 21 billion. But it all paid off, because it became very popular, very quick. Millions of people use it. Now it is getting even more popular. There are three complete tunnels in the Chunnel. The two outside ones are the passenger trains. The small inner one is a guidance train. The guidance train is not used for transportation. Each track is exactly parallel to each other. There are four different train systems in the Chunnel. The Eurostar is a high speed passenger service that connects London, Paris, Brussels and Lille. The Eurotunnel shuttle is a rail ferry service.

The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one.  Jacob recently contracted the HIV virus and is going to his first support meeting. While there, he meets Dan and strikes up a conversation with him. Dan says that he has had HIV for over a decade at this point and has learned ways to live with it. He is able to give Jacob some good advice on how to handle things and Jacob is very grateful to have someone to talk with.  Which person's body will struggle more to defend from the HIV infection? A:","output":"Jacob B: Dan Given the information provided, we can infer that: 1. As time passes, the number of HIV copies increases, and the number of helper T cells decreases. 2. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. 3. Dan has had HIV for over a decade. Based on this information, Dan's body has been dealing with HIV infection for a longer period of time as compared to Jacob who has recently contracted the virus.  So, the answer is: B: Dan's body will struggle more to defend from the HIV infection because he has had HIV for a longer period of time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: For a stay-at-home mom, a computer with an Internet connection can truly be a lifeline . When diapers and baby talk become just too much, adult talk is just a click away. But for some moms, the attraction of the online world becomes too strong to resist  and instead of being an occasional thing, it becomes an addiction . Coleen Moore of the Illinois Institute for Addiction Recovery says she is seeing a growing number of young stay-at -home moms for whom blogs and social networking have become a passion, which will harm their real-world lives. Now, Internet addiction is not officially recognized as a mental disorder. But a recent survey showed 14 percent of Internet users find it hard to stay away from their computers for several days at a time, and that 8 percent use the Web to escape problems. Considering this, it is probably just a matter of time before it is. What drives a mom to the Internet is not different from what drives an alcoholic  to drink: an empty place that needs filling. \\"In addiction treatment, we talk about the fact that there's a void ,\\"says Moore. \\"Whatever that void may be -- whether it's emotional, spiritual, physical--we're trying to fill it.\\" So, how can you find the void? A journal tracking when and why you go online and what you may be avoiding when you do so can be helpful in finding it out. But what makes Internet dependence special is the fact that usually it is not just a way to escape the tiring parenting or make a connection with others, but also a way to make a statement and be heard. Question: If a mom wants to get rid of Internet addiction, she should   _  . Options: A: talk to online friends B: try to fill the empty space in life C: create a new online name D: ask an alcoholic for some advice A:","output":"If a mom wants to get rid of Internet addiction, she should B: try to fill the empty space in life. The article discusses how moms can become addicted to the internet, specifically blogs and social networking, as a means to escape their real-world lives and responsibilities. Coleen Moore of the Illinois Institute for Addiction Recovery explains that the reason a mom becomes addicted to the internet is similar to what drives an alcoholic to drink: an empty place in their life that needs filling. This void may be emotional, spiritual, or physical. In order to combat internet addiction, it is important for the mom to address and fill this void in her life. Rather than talking to online friends (Option A) or creating a new online name (Option C), which would likely only serve to further perpetuate the addiction, focusing on filling the empty space in one's life would be more beneficial. Finding alternative ways to address their needs, such as joining social groups, engaging in hobbies or exercising, can help break the cycle of addiction and provide a more meaningful and fulfilling life. Asking an alcoholic for advice (Option D) may not be the best choice, as each person's situation and experiences with addiction will be different, and the specific void or issue driving the mom's internet addiction may not be the same as what drives an alcoholic to drink. Professionals like therapists and psychologists that specialize in addiction recovery can provide the most suitable guidance and support in addressing and overcoming internet addiction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Information:  - A given name (also known as a personal name, Christian name, first name, or forename) is a part of a person's full nomenclature. It identifies a specific person, and differentiates that person from other members of a group, such as a family or clan, with whom that person shares a common surname. The term \\"given name\\" refers to the fact that the name usually is \\"bestowed\\" upon a person, normally \\"given\\" to a child by its parents at or near the time of birth. This contrasts with a surname (also known as a family name, last name, or gentile name), which is normally inherited, and shared with other members of the child's immediate family.  - Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. Developed in conjunction with the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) standard and published as \\"The Unicode Standard\\", the latest version of Unicode contains a repertoire of more than 128,000 characters covering 135 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets. The standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation, rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, and left-to-right scripts). , the most recent version is \\"Unicode 9.0\\". The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium.  - A synonym is a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language. Words that are synonyms are said to be synonymous, and the state of being a synonym is called synonymy. The word comes from Ancient Greek \\"sýn\\" (\\"with\\") and \\"ónoma\\" (\\"name\\"). An example of synonyms are the words \\"begin\\", \\"start\\", \\"commence\\", \\"initiate\\", \\"fun\\", \\"pleasing\\" . Words can be synonymous when meant in certain senses, even if they are not synonymous in all of their senses. For example, if one talks about a \\"long time\\" or an \\"extended time\\", \\"long\\" and \\"extended\\" are synonymous within that context. Synonyms with exact meaning share a seme or denotational sememe, whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or connotational sememe and thus overlap within a semantic field. Some academics call the former type cognitive synonyms to distinguish them from the latter type, which they call near-synonyms.  - A surname or family name is a name added to a given name. In many cases, a surname is a family name and many dictionaries define \\"surname\\" as a synonym of \\"family name\\". In the Western Hemisphere, it is commonly synonymous with last name because it is usually placed at the end of a person's given name there.  - In the German alphabet, the (traditionally lowercase-only) letter ß, called Eszett or scharfes S, in English \\"sharp S\\", is a consonant that evolved as a ligature of \\"long s and z\\" (z) and \\"long s over round s\\" (s). It is pronounced (see IPA). Since the German orthography reform of 1996, it is used only after long vowels and diphthongs while \\"ss\\" is written after short vowels. The name \\"Eszett\\" comes from the two letters S and Z as they are pronounced in German. Its Unicode encoding is U+00DF.  - The long, medial, or descending s () is a form of the minuscule (lower-case) letter \\"s\\", which was formerly used where \\"s\\" occurred in the middle or at the beginning of a word (e.g. \\"infulnes\\" for \\"sinfulness\\" and \\"uccesful\\" for \\"successful\\"). The modern letterform was called the \\"terminal\\", \\"round\\", or \\"short\\" s.  - The German orthography reform of 1996 (\\"\\") was a change to German spelling and punctuation that was intended to simplify German orthography and thus to make it easier to learn, without substantially changing the rules familiar to users of the language.   - Strauss , Strauß or Straus is a common Germanic surname . Outside Germany and Austria Strauß is always spelled Strauss ( the letter \`\` ß '' is not used in the German - speaking part of Switzerland ) . The families using the Strauss name represent a genetically varied group of people of both Jewish and Germanic origin . The name has been used by families in the Germanic area for at least a thousand years . The overlord of Gröna for example , went by the name of Struz and used the image of an ostrich as his symbol . Examples of it could still be seen on the thousand - year - old church bell of that town . \`\` Struz '' or \`\` Strutz '' is the North - German form of the word \`\` Strauss '' , which is the modern German word for an \`\` Ostrich '' . Some of the earliest Jewish bearers of the name hailed from the Judengasse in medieval Frankfurt , where families have been known by the name of the houses they inhabited . All the houses had names and these included Haus Strauss , complete with an image of an ostrich on the façade . When , for tax purposes , Napoleon made surnames obligatory in 1808 , some more Jewish families decided to adopt the Straus ( s ) name .  - An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that is used to write one or more languages based upon the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit).  - The Western Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the earth that lies west of the Prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, UK) and east of the antimeridian, the other half being called the Eastern Hemisphere.   - A diphthong (or ; from Greek: , \\"diphthongos\\", literally \\"two sounds\\" or \\"two tones\\"), also known as a gliding vowel, is a combination of two adjacent vowel sounds within the same syllable. Technically, a diphthong is a vowel with two different targets: that is, the tongue (and/or other parts of the speech apparatus) moves during the pronunciation of the vowel. In many dialects of English, the phrase \\"no highway cowboys\\" has five distinct diphthongs, one in every syllable.  - In articulatory phonetics, a consonant is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. Examples are , pronounced with the lips pronounced with the front of the tongue pronounced with the back of the tongue pronounced in the throat; and , pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel (fricatives); and and , which have air flowing through the nose (nasals). Contrasting with consonants are vowels.  - An orthography is a set of conventions for writing a language. It includes norms of spelling, hyphenation, capitalization, word breaks, emphasis, and punctuation.    'strauss' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'is a list of'?

Choices:  - near shore - a romulian space craft - sail on sea - heading east - run aground  The rationale to choose \\"run aground\\" as the answer is that:","output":"\\"Run aground\\" is the most plausible factor among the given choices that would cause a ship to stop moving. Running aground refers to a situation when a vessel inadvertently hits the bottom of a water body, typically the shore or shallow waters, leading to its immobilization. This scenario can occur due to various reasons like navigational errors, strong currents, tide changes, weather challenges, or mechanical failure. When a ship runs aground, it can cause significant damage to the hull, propeller, rudder, and potentially the cargo, making it unable to continue its journey. Now let's consider the other options and why they don't justify as appropriate answers: - Near shore: Being near the shore doesn't necessarily imply that a ship would stop moving. A ship can be anchored close to shore while still maintaining its ability to navigate. Although the proximity to shorelines might necessitate extra precautions and vigilance, it is not a guarantee that a ship must come to a complete halt. - A Romulian spacecraft: Romulians are fictional extraterrestrial species from the science fiction television series Star Trek. As a work of fiction, it has no bearing on real-world scenarios. Consequently, the presence of a Romulian spacecraft would not be a valid reason for a ship to stop moving in reality. - Sail on sea: Sailing on the sea in a sailboat is entirely different from a ship coming to a halt. When a sailboat is at sea, it relies on wind power to move forward. Although the direction and strength of the wind might affect the speed and course of the vessel, it would not necessarily cause the ship to stop moving entirely. - Heading east: Regardless of the direction a ship is taking, whether it is heading east or any other compass point, the vessel can continue moving with adequate power or natural propulsion methods (like wind or current). The direction itself does not influence the ship's ability to move. In conclusion, \\"run aground\\" is the most suitable answer, considering the rationale mentioned above. It is the only choice that accurately describes a situation where a ship would be forced to stop moving. The other options may present certain circumstances or challenges for the vessel but do not guarantee a complete cessation of movement."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Rinaldo drew his sword to attack?  The Crusader army under Goffredo is laying siege to Jerusalem, where the Saracen king Argante is confined with his troops. With Goffredo are his brother Eustazio, his daughter Almirena, and the knight Rinaldo. As Goffredo sings of the coming victory, Rinaldo declares his love for Almirena, and Goffredo confirms that she will be Rinaldo's bride when Jerusalem falls. Almirena urges Rinaldo to fight boldly and assure victory. As she departs, a herald announces the approach of Argante from the city. Eustazio surmises that the king fears defeat; this seems to be confirmed when Argante, after a grandiose entrance, requests a three-day truce to which Goffredo graciously assents. After Goffredo leaves, Argante ponders his love for Armida, the Queen of Damascus who is also a powerful sorceress, and considers the help her powers might bring him. As he muses, Armida arrives from the sky in a fiery chariot. She has divined that the Saracens' only chance of victory lies in vanquishing Rinaldo, and has the power, she claims, to achieve this. The scene changes to a garden, with fountains and birds, where Rinaldo and Almirena are celebrating their love. They are interrupted as Armida appears, and wrests Almirena from Rinaldo's embrace. Rinaldo draws his sword to defend his lover, but a black cloud descends to envelop Armida and Almirena, and they are borne away. Rinaldo mourns the loss of his loved one. When Goffredo and Eustazio arrive they comfort Rinaldo, and propose they visit a Christian magician who may have the power to save Almirena. Rinaldo, left alone, prays for strength.","output":"The name of the person that Rinaldo drew his sword to attack is Armida.

Question: \\"What can some birds feel that others cannot?\\"  Context: \\"The ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has been known for some time; in an experiment conducted in the 1950s a Manx shearwater released in Boston returned to its colony in Skomer, Wales, within 13 days, a distance of 5,150 km (3,200 mi). Birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods. For diurnal migrants, the sun is used to navigate by day, and a stellar compass is used at night. Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an internal clock. Orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the constellations surrounding Polaris. These are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the Earth's geomagnetism through specialised photoreceptors.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Some birds can feel Earth's geomagnetism, which others cannot. Step 1: Understand the question and context. The question asks about a special ability that some birds possess that others do not, while the context discusses various methods birds use for navigation, including the sun, stars, and geomagnetism. Step 2: Identify the key information. From the context, we learn that some species of birds have the ability to sense the Earth's geomagnetism through specialized photoreceptors. Step 3: Formulate the answer. Since the question asks for an ability that some birds possess while others don't, and the context mentions that some species can sense geomagnetism, the answer is that some birds can feel Earth's geomagnetism, which others cannot."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The astrolabe was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and is often attributed to Hipparchus. A combination of the planisphere and dioptra, the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy. An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in 1235. Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe, an early fixed-wired knowledge processing machine with a gear train and gear-wheels, circa 1000 AD.

The planisphere, invented by Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī in the early 11th century, was a star chart that allowed users to observe celestial bodies and their positions over time. The dioptra, on the other hand, was a device utilized for measuring angular distances between objects, typically utilized in astronomy and surveying.  When combined, these two devices formed the astrolabe—an intricate instrument that was effectively an analog computer capable of solving various problems in spherical astronomy. Astrolabes have been widely used throughout history, particularly by astronomers, navigators, and astrologers.  One of the most notable astrolabes was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in 1235.

In fact, phospholipids are similar in structure to triglycerides. However, instead of having three fatty acids, a phospholipid is generated from a diglyceride, a glycerol with just two fatty acid chains (Figure 2.23). The third binding site on the glycerol is taken up by the phosphate group, which in turn is attached to a polar “head” region of the molecule. Recall that triglycerides are nonpolar and hydrophobic. This still holds for the fatty acid portion of a phospholipid compound. However, the head of a phospholipid contains charges on the phosphate groups, as well as on the nitrogen atom. These charges make the phospholipid head hydrophilic. Therefore, phospholipids are said to have hydrophobic tails, containing the neutral fatty acids, and hydrophilic heads, containing the charged phosphate groups and nitrogen atom.

In this statement, the importance of showing unity and support for the people of Iraq and Palestine in the fight against the harmful impacts of neo-liberal globalization is being highlighted. Neo-liberal globalization is the economic and political project that promotes the liberalization of trade, deregulation, privatization, and the reduction of government's role in the economy. It has greatly influenced global politics and economics over the past few decades. First, let's focus on the significance of solidarity with Iraq and Palestine. Both countries have faced considerable challenges in the recent past, and these challenges have been exacerbated by the effects of neo-liberal globalization. In Iraq, the country has struggled with political instability, violence, and conflict following the US-led invasion in 2003. The dismantling of the Iraqi state institutions and the implementation of \\"shock therapy\\" economic policies have led to widespread poverty and unemployment in the country, fueling conflict and instability. Similarly, in Palestine, the ongoing Israeli occupation has severely impacted the social, economic, and political conditions faced by the Palestinian people. The Israeli occupation has not only denied Palestinians their basic rights but also undermined their economic development and access to resources. Neo-liberal globalization has reinforced these conditions, as Israeli settlements continue to expand and global powers offer little support for the Palestinian struggle for self-determination and national sovereignty. The internationalist struggle in this context is an ideological and political movement that seeks to promote international cooperation and solidarity among people and nations across the globe. This struggle opposes the detrimental effects of neo-liberal globalization by advocating for economic and political alternatives that prioritize the welfare of people over profits, promote social justice and democracy, and challenge the hegemony of global powers. Solidarity with Iraq and Palestine, in this regard, is an essential part of the internationalist effort to challenge the negative consequences of neo-liberal globalization. By standing with these people in their pursuit of justice, self-determination, and resistance against imperialism and occupation, internationalists aim to strengthen the global movement against neo-liberalism and its associated policies. This solidarity is demonstrated through various means, including political, financial, and diplomatic support, grassroots activism, and the promotion of alternative narratives that highlight the struggles and resilience of the people of Iraq and Palestine. In conclusion, showing solidarity with Iraq and Palestine is a crucial component of the internationalist struggle against neo-liberal globalization. By standing in alliance with those who are marginalized, oppressed, and exploited by powerful global forces, we collectively work toward a more just and equitable world order that respects the rights and aspirations of all people across the globe."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This will show the student the process for working though the problem without any complicating factors.  For example, 63/3=21. The 3 will go into the 6 evenly, then the 3 will go into the 3 evenly. There are no remainders on either step. Most students will begin learning long division in 3rd grade, or around the age of 8 or 9. The divisor is the number that you are dividing by, while the dividend is the number you’re dividing into. Tell your student that they will need to divide each unit in the dividend by the divisor, starting with the largest unit.  For example, you’d divide the 100s unit, then the 10s unit, and finally the 1s unit. Let’s say your problem is 54/3. Your divisor is 3, which goes into 5 just 1 time. However, you are left with a remainder of 2, which your student will need to save for the next step. Similarly, let’s say your problem is 155/4. You can’t divide 4 into 1, so you’d divide it into 15. This would give you 3, with a remainder of 3. Explain that they will need to multiply the number of times that the divisor goes into the first number by the divisor. They will subtract this product from the units in the dividend to find the remainder, which they’ll carry over to the next unit.  As you work though 54/3, you know that 3 goes into 5  just 1 time with a remainder of 2. You’d multiply 3 x 1 = 3. Subtract 3 from 5 to get 2. Leave the 2 in the 10s spot. Similarly, for 155/4, you know that 4 goes into 15 just 3 times. You’d multiply 4 x 3 = 12. Subtract 15-12= 3. Carry the 3 down in the 10s spot. Carry the next unit down, adding it to the remainder. Then, divide the divisor into this number. Write the result into your answer, and then subtract to find your remainder, if you have 1.  Working through 54/3, you will carry the 4 down, writing it next to the 2, which gives you 24. You’ll next divide 3 into 24. This gives you 8. Putting it all together, your answer is 54/3=18. Similarly, as you work through 155/4, you’d now have a 3 left in your 10s spot. Carry down the 5, to give you 35. Divide the 4 into 35, which will give you a result of 8, with 3 remaining. Explain that the number of steps you’ll take depends on how many numbers are in the dividend. For example, 155/3 will have fewer steps than 1555/3. However, the process for each unit remains the same. Once the student has divided the divisor into the 1s place, they’ve reached the end of the problem. If the divisor does not go in evenly, there will be a remainder. They’ll need to include this remainder in their answer.  Since 3 goes into 54 evenly, you don’t have a remainder. However, 55/3 would give you a remainder of 1. You would find this remainder like this: If you divide 3 into 5, you get 1, with 2 remaining. You’d then divide 3 into 25, which would give you 8, with 1 remaining. This is your remainder. Your remainder should be written as part of your answer. You can indicate that it’s a remainder by writing “R” in front of it. Alternatively, you may write out the word “Remainder\\" followed by the number. For example, you’d write 55/3=18 R 1 or 55/3=18 Remainder 1. Lots of practice is essential for mastering math concepts. You can create your own worksheets or download them for free online. You could provide your student with real world scenarios to help them practice long division. For example, they could practice dividing large quantities of food among party guests. Similarly, you could have them divide their birthday money into 3 categories: spend now, save for later, save for college.

Summarize: But that is exactly what the young PR and advertising student has done. Against all expectations, including his own, he was elected to represent Shettleston at Glasgow City Council in the local elections. One of the most deprived areas of Scotland, the community has long-favoured Labour and the SNP. Yet on Thursday Mr Kerr managed to nudge SNP candidates Laura Doherty and Michelle Ferns into third and fourth place respectively. In fact he was only beaten into second place by one of Scottish Labour's most prominent politicians, former council leader Frank McAveety. Mr Kerr's shock win may be partly explained by his own background. He grew up in nearby Cranhill, a \\"really run-down, working class\\" neighbourhood, with his grandparents and mother. It was, he admits, a \\"really tough upbringing\\" but he credits his former secondary school - Eastbank Academy -  with giving him the ambition and drive to get into politics. \\"The school motto was 'aim for stars',\\" he said. \\"That was always the expectation I had when I was there.\\" His political curiosity was piqued when he was taken to a protest against the Iraq war by his aunt when he was just 10. \\"She is an SNP supporter and is best friends with (SNP MSP) Christine McKelvie, so I was standing with them,\\" he said. But he initially campaigned for the Scottish Labour party before joining the Conservatives as a young teenager. \\"I decided I wanted to join the Conservative party in 2011, after Ed Miliband was elected to lead the Labour party,\\" he said. \\"I had been campaigning with (former Labour MP) Margaret Curran as she has a fantastic personality. \\"But then some people were telling me that some of my views were a bit more right wing. So I looked into Conservative policies and that's when I started to get involved. I was 14. \\"I had to get my granny and granddad to sign the forms allowing me to join. \\"They have always encouraged me in my politics, though I have no idea what they vote, even now. But they said if that's what I want to do, I'll sign you up. \\" So how did the rest of his family and friends react to his decision to join a party that is still considered \\"toxic\\" in parts of Scotland? \\"They were shocked,\\" he admitted. \\"I had a lot of family asking 'How can you be a Conservative?' \\"I told them Conservatives believe that it's not who you are or where you come from, if you work hard and play by the rules, you should be rewarded. \\"The SNP and Labour seem to think that if you grow up in a box, you should stay in a box. \\"I think half of my family vote Conservative now.\\" As he grew older, he campaigned for Better Together ahead of the Scottish independence referendum and last year he stood for Shettleston in the Holyrood elections. He said he stood for the council election because he cares about the community. He never expected to win but started to get a feeling that things were going his way on polling day. \\"Growing up where I grew up was a really tough upbringing but it gave me something and now I want to give something back,\\" he said. \\"I will only stand in the east end of Glasgow because it's the only area I'm passionate about. I just want to serve the people I'm elected to serve.\\" And he already knows exactly what he will do on his first day in the office. \\"The first thing I will do when I get my desk on Monday will be to write a letter to get a pedestrian crossing put in at Mount Vernon train station,\\" he said. But what about the bigger issues? What would he ask of Theresa May that would improve the lives of the people of Shettleston? \\"To be honest, I'd rather have a conversation with Nicola Sturgeon, to say, look, it's time to get back to the job that you were elected to do,\\" he said. \\"We don't want a second independence referendum, the people of Shettleston are fed up.\\" In the meantime, his family are \\"chuffed and proud\\" of his success at the polls. His grandparents were in tears when the results were announced. And his SNP-supporting aunt? \\"She came down to the count to give me a big hug.\\"","output":"A young PR and advertising student has defied expectations by being elected to represent Shettleston, one of Scotland's most deprived areas, at the Glasgow City Council in the local elections.

Every Saturday we would go to the park and play Toodles' favorite game. Toodles loved playing fetch. One Saturday, Toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there. He ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks. The ducks ignored him, and kept swimming. Toodles wasn't having it! He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates. One of the ducks, braver than the others, poked Toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears! Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear. Soaking wet, he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better. After that, whenever he would see a duck, Toodles would run the other way.  Question: \\"How did Toodles play with the ducks?\\" Answer: \\"Running after them\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, sweetheart, the answer isn't entirely correct. Toodles didn't just run after the ducks. He tried to play with them by barking and even jumped into the pond and swam toward them.

Combine the constant terms on the right side of the equation: -11 + 369 = 358 So, the equation becomes: 22*z - 456 = 358 2. Add 456 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable z on the left side: 22*z - 456 + 456 = 358 + 456 This simplifies to: 22*z = 814 3. Now, we need to solve for z. To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by 22: (22*z) / 22 = 814 / 22 This simplifies to: z = 37 Therefore, the solution for z in the equation 22*z - 456 = -11 + 369 is z = 37."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The entrance opened on the only addition to the original farmhouse, a smallish room where the receptionist sat at one of two desks. The area was called the secretarial pod. The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk. To the left was another door, kept closed, which led down the hallway to the client sleeping rooms, the dining room and the kitchen. There was a phone right inside the front door (or the back door, depending upon who you asked). When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling. After enough of those, any problem he had been having with people smoking in the building usually went away. Given the right incentives, even this population could be relatively self-regulating. The telephone rang before Ray was even half-finished with his cigarette. \\"Admit it now, Ray.\\" She sounded petulant. \\"Fine, I admit it.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? being stupid","output":"Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine whether the review portrays a positive or negative opinion of the movie. The phrase \\"being stupid\\" can be interpreted in multiple ways. It may be referring to the movie's content, the reviewer's personal opinion, or even the humor or tone of the film. In order to give a detailed answer, more information and context would be needed. For instance, if the reviewer views \\"being stupid\\" as a positive aspect of the movie, it may mean that they enjoyed the movie's simple, light-hearted humor or found it to be an entertaining escape from reality. In this scenario, the review could be considered positive. On the other hand, if the reviewer finds \\"being stupid\\" to be a negative aspect, then it could imply that they thought the movie lacked intelligence or depth, or that the humor was too crude or juvenile. In this case, the review would be considered negative. Other factors, such as the tone of the review and reviewer's known preferences, can also affect the interpretation of this short statement. If the reviewer is known to appreciate quirky humor and generally uses slang casually, then it is more likely that this may have been a positive opinion. However, if the reviewer has a reputation for critical analysis and is known for identifying meaningful content in movies, then the likelihood increases that it may be a negative opinion. Overall, without more information or context, it is impossible to definitively determine whether the review has a positive or negative opinion of the movie.

Although AFCI (Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter) breakers are required in specific scenarios and locations, such as circuits feeding electrical outlets in residential bedrooms in Canada and the United States, there are areas where their adoption is slower, optional, or required only in high-risk cases. For instance, in Western Europe and the UK, which use a 230 V electrical system, the adoption of AFCI breakers is slower and not necessarily mandatory for all breakers. The higher voltage in these regions implies lower currents, which may contribute to the more selective use of AFCI breakers in those areas.

Information:  - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions.  - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk).  - Andinichthyidae is a prehistoric family of catfishes from the Cretaceous of South America .  - Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example).  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.  - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period.   - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the church whose electricity bill by 2011 was able to be covered by the fifty-four solar panels installed in 2008?, using the article: A diocesan return of 1563 recorded 145 households in the parish of New Sleaford, while the Compton Census (1676) reveals that New Sleaford had a Conformist population of 576 people, no \\"Papists\\", and 6 Non-conformists. There is a widely held local tradition that St Denys' was used during the English Civil War (1642–51) as a barracks for parliamentary troops  who destroyed the interior furnishings. The local historian Trollope stated that the soldiers looted the brass eagle lectern (last recorded in 1622), broke the stained glass windows and the organ, and stole valuables. Whether this damage occurred or not, repairs to the windows and roof were carried out in 1657, paid for by public subscription. Galleries were also added to the church in the 18th century: the south in 1758, west in 1772, and north in 1783–84. In 1772, Edward Evans, a ship's surgeon on HMS Egmont, donated £300 to replace the organ with one built by Samuel Green of London.For most of the 19th century, the Anglican community dominated Sleaford's civic bodies, including the Board of Guardians, who oversaw the workhouse, and the Local Board of Health. Dr Richard Yerburgh and his son, Richard, were vicars in 1809–51 and 1851–82 respectively and had family connections with the local builders Kirk and Parry; Yerburgh and Thomas Parry (one half of the firm) were on the Board of Guardians and were labelled members of a \\"family party\\" by opponents during the Board's 1870 elections (they were nonetheless re-elected). They and other local clergymen were key players in the establishment of National schools in Sleaford and Quarrington, which Kirk and Parry built. The Anglican congregation, at an estimated 700 to 800 people in 1851 (St Denys' had enough space for 743 people), was less than half of the size of the nonconformist community, which was probably larger than 2,000 and tended to flourish in poorer parts of the town.The 19th century also witnessed two major restorations to St Denys'.

The reviewer draws a comparison between their own experiences at AIT in 1974 and the events portrayed in the movie \\"Tigerland,\\" which was set in 1971. They appreciate the authenticity of the film, highlighting how the characters and events are similar to the ones they experienced in the military. They also note that their training period was more relaxed than portrayed during the earlier years because, by 1974, it was evident that the war in Vietnam was coming to an end. This caused problems in the military during the 70s and 80s, which the reviewer is well-aware of from their long service until 2004. Even though they have not heard anyone mention \\"Tigerland\\" specifically, they acknowledge the existence of realistic training villages that the Army had set up across the United States. The reviewer also shares the insight provided by Vietnam Vets, who stated that training during earlier years could have been rougher and more challenging. They share the opinion of their former instructors who believed that no amount of training could prepare soldiers for the reality of war – they simply had to find out and figure it out for themselves. The movie \\"Tigerland\\" resonated with the reviewer because of its authentic portrayal of these experiences, earning high praise and a positive sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the meaning of the term \\"deceleration\\" Deceleration refers to a decrease in speed or the rate at which something slows down. Deceleration could be used in various contexts like physics, engineering or everyday life. Step 2: Determine the opposite action In order to find the opposite of deceleration, we need to consider what action would result in an increase of speed or the rate at which something speeds up. Step 3: Identify the term that represents the opposite action The term that represents the opposite of deceleration is acceleration. Acceleration refers to an increase in speed or the rate at which something speeds up. Justification: Acceleration is the correct answer because it is the antonym of deceleration, meaning it signifies the opposite action, which is increasing speed or the rate at which something speeds up."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, this statement does not directly and explicitly respond to the question with either choice A (yes) or B (no). Instead, it presents a fact about the changes in Comcast's book value over a decade and can be used to determine the share value in 1999. Based on the information provided in the statement, we can deduce that Comcast's share value in 1999 was 8.19 a share. It states that the book value of the company nearly doubled from 8.19 a share in 1999 to 15 a share in 2009. By extracting the relevant information from the statement (i.e., 8.19 a share in 1999), we can conclude that the requested share value in 1999 is 8.19. In conclusion, although the statement does not directly answer the question with a simple 'yes' or 'no', it still provides the necessary information to determine Comcast's share value in 1999, which was 8.19 a share.

The Royal was warmly received on the podium by Paralympic GB's gold medal winner Aled Davies and Chinese bronze medallist Lezheng Wang. But when it was Mehrdad Karam Zadeh's turn to step up, the 40-year-old failed to offer a hand to the Duchess, clutching them close to his chest. Scroll down for video. Hot on her heels: Kate Middleton presented the medals to the Men's Discus Throwing winners on Sunday. Briefed: St. James's Palace insists the Duchess was warned not to expect a handshake. His decision not to shake hands with the Duchess was likely to have been a result of Iranian cultural. convention which bans such contact between unrelated men and women. The. Duchess appeared to have been briefed on the situation, because she did. not offer her hand either. The incident threatened to overshadow a glittering night for Paralympics GB, which enjoyed its most successful day of the Games so far with seven gold medals. The Iranian delegation in London have not been available to comment on the incident, but according to the Daily Telegraph, they have told Games organisers Zadeh was not making a political statement. It's believed the athlete was merely conforming to Iranian cultural convention, forbidding men from shaking hands with unrelated women. A spokesman for St. James's Palace has revealed the Duchess was briefed beforehand and warned not to offer her hand to Zadeh. Presentation: The Duchess hands over the medal, left, and Zadeh claps his hands to his chest, right. End of the presentation: The Duchess of Cambridge moves away from the athlete. The Islamic rules about touching apply to Muslims and non-Muslims. A man or a woman is only allowed to shake hands, or have similar contact, with someone of the same sex. However, there are several exceptions for close relatives such as brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, and so on. 'Many male athletes from Islamic countries do not shake hands in public with women they are not related to for cultural and religious reasons,' the palace representative said. The palace added Middleton was 'honoured' to get the chance to present the medals, particularly to a British champion in Davies. It put Paralympic GB in second place in the medal table, with 54 in all. The Iranians have said that had the. medal been presented by a man Zadeh would have shaken his hand. Likewise, had the Duchess presented the medal to a female Iranian they would not have hesitated to shake hands. However, it's not the first time the Iranian custom has caused controversy. Last year the Iranian volleyball team had to apologise after several team members shook hands with a female referee after a game against Afghanistan. The gesture provoked outrage and Iran’s state-owned media described the players' behaviour as 'stunning and inappropriate'. Beaming: The Duchess of Cambridge smiles as she hands the gold medal to Aled Davies of Paralympic GB. Shaking hands: The pair have no such issues as Aled Davies enjoys his moment of glory.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how does egg substitute effect the cake if u put in Suggested answer: Determining whether a given food should be classified as bread, cake, or pastry can be difficult. Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","output":"No, the suggested answer is not valid for the question provided as it does not address the actual inquiry regarding the effect of egg substitutes on a cake. Let me provide a detailed answer to the proper question: The question asked is about the impact of using egg substitutes on a cake and whether one should validate or consider this potential change in ingredients. When using egg substitutes in a cake recipe, several factors should be taken into consideration: 1. Binding and Structure: Eggs play a significant role in binding the ingredients together and providing structure to the cake. Egg substitutes may vary in the strength of their binding ability, which could result in a difference in the overall texture and structure of the cake. 2. Moisture: Eggs provide moisture to the cake, which is crucial for a soft and tender texture. Depending on the specific egg substitute used, the moisture content might be affected. Some substitutes may retain more moisture, leading to a denser cake, while others may not provide enough moisture, resulting in a drier cake. 3. Leavening: Eggs contribute to the leavening process in cakes, which helps to achieve the desired rise and light, airy texture. Egg substitutes may have different leavening abilities due to their chemical composition, so using a substitute could affect the cake's rise and overall fluffiness. 4. Flavor and Color: Eggs not only affect the cake's texture but also contribute to its flavor and color. Using an egg substitute might slightly alter the taste and appearance of the cake, depending on the specific type of substitute used. 5. Potential Allergies and Dietary Restrictions: Some individuals may have egg allergies or follow a dietary lifestyle that excludes eggs, such as veganism. In these cases, using egg substitutes is necessary to accommodate these needs, and it is essential to find an adequate substitute that will achieve the desired outcome for your specific cake recipe. It is essential to validate and choose the appropriate egg substitute based on the specific cake recipe you are working on. There are several egg substitutes available on the market, as well as homemade alternatives such as applesauce, yogurt, mashed bananas, or silken tofu, among others. Each of these substitutes has its unique characteristics, and some may be more suitable for specific types of cakes. For example, silken tofu may work well for dense, moist cakes, while baking powder and vinegar mixture could be a more appropriate choice for lighter cakes. In conclusion, using egg substitutes in a cake could affect its structure, texture, flavor, and appearance. It is crucial to consider the desired outcome and specific recipe requirements to choose an appropriate egg substitute that will yield the best results."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a 1-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.shahul3d.indiasatelliteweather.

Options: - thrift store - clothing store - costume shop - shopping mall - laundromat  The answer is \\"laundromat\\" because Answer:","output":"The answer is \\"laundromat\\" because a laundromat is a facility specifically designed to provide washing, drying, and sometimes folding services for clothes, which is precisely what you needed when your electricity was cut off. Laundromats are equipped with multiple washing machines and dryers that operate using either coins or cards, depending on the specific establishment. They offer a convenient and efficient way to clean your clothes without having to rely on the availability of electricity in your home.  Exploring the other options briefly: 1. Thrift store - A thrift store is a type of second-hand shop that sells used or pre-owned items at discounted prices. While you may be able to find affordable clothing here, thrift stores do not typically have facilities for customers to wash or dry their clothes. 2. Clothing store - A clothing store is a retail establishment that sells new clothes and various other fashion items. While they may have a wide variety of stylish options for purchase, they do not provide laundry services, as their primary focus is on sales and not assisting with the process of washing existing clothes. 3. Costume shop - A costume shop is a specialized retail store that offers costumes, accessories, and other items related to dressing up for various occasions, such as costume parties or Halloween. They do not have washing facilities and therefore would not be a suitable option for laundering your jeans. 4. Shopping mall - A shopping mall is a large enclosed building containing a variety of retail shops, eateries, and other services. Although it is possible to find clothing stores and, in some cases, even a laundromat within a shopping mall, the mall as a whole is not a place specifically designed for washing clothes. Therefore, while the laundromat may be present in the mall, the correct answer is still \\"laundromat\\" as it is the facility that provides the service you needed. In conclusion, when faced with the need to wash your jeans after having your electricity cut off, the most suitable and practical option among the given choices would be a laundromat.

Answer based on context: Starting lineups: HOUSTON - OFFENSE: QB Matt Schaub, LT Duane Brown, LG Wade Smith, C Chris Myers, RT Antoine Caldwell, RG Eric Winston, WR Andre Johnson, RB Arian Foster, FB Vonta Leach, TE Owen Daniels, WR Kevin Walter. The Texans began their season with a home game against the Indianapolis Colts, a division rival in which they had only beaten once ever. However, Houston got off to an early 13-0 lead after 30 and 49-yard field goals from Neil Rackers (who had recently replaced Kris Brown as the team's kicker) and a 22-yard touchdown pass from Matt Schaub, leading passer in the league a year ago, to Kevin Walter. As expected, the Colts wouldn't go down without a fight as Indy scored ten unanswered points to close out the half on a 14-yard touchdown pass from Peyton Manning to Reggie Wayne and a 20-yard field goal by Adam Vinatieri. With the momentum seemingly shifting to Indianapolis, Houston took nearly eight minutes off the third-quarter clock with a 15-play drive (13 rushes) out of the locker room, as Arian Foster scored from a yard out, his first of three touchdowns on the day. Going into the fourth with Houston leading 20-10, the Texans continued to run, and the Colts continued to pass, as Peyton Manning attempted 57 passes that day, completing 40, a career-high. However, it wouldn't be enough; even though the Colts scored two touchdowns on a 10-yard pass to Dallas Clark and a 73-yard pass to Austin Collie, the Texans would score two of their own: 25 and 8-yard runs from Arian Foster en route to a 34-24 Houston win at Reliant Stadium. Arian Foster finished with 231 rushing yards on 33 carries. Both were Houston records for a game, and the 231 yards was the second most rushing yards on opening week, only behind O.J. Simpson. Peyton Manning eventually went 40/57 for 433 yards and three touchdowns. Houston began the season 1-0 and won for only the second time against Indianapolis, against fifteen losses. The Colts, after going 0-4 in the 2010 preseason, lost their fifth game overall to start the 2010 year.

Arthur's sister Stacey A:","output":"Step 1: Establish the setting and background. In a small coastal town, there's a tight-knit group of friends who have grown up together. Danny, the protagonist, is an aspiring artist with a kind heart and a head full of dreams. Stacey, the sister of Danny's best friend Arthur, is a talented musician with a beautiful voice. They all spend a lot of time together and share many memories. However, as they grow older, feelings start to emerge. Step 2: Develop the characters. Danny, 23 years old, has always been infatuated with Stacey, who is two years younger. However, he struggles to express his feelings as he fears losing his friendship with Arthur, who has been his best friend since childhood. Arthur is a caring brother and a loyal friend, always looking out for those he loves. Stacey, though confident on-stage, lacks confidence in her personal relationships but remains kind and open-hearted. Step 3: Establish conflict. Stacey's music career starts to take off, receiving offers to perform in different cities. As life starts to pull the friends apart, Danny realizes he can't hold his feelings back any longer. He is torn between confessing his feelings for Stacey and maintaining his friendship with Arthur. This internal conflict intensifies when Stacey receives an invitation to tour with a famous band, which will have her move away for an extended period. Step 4: Create a turning point. During a going-away party for Stacey, Arthur accidentally stumbles upon a sketchbook filled with drawings of Stacey by Danny. Recognizing the significance of these drawings, Arthur confronts Danny, leading to an emotional conversation where Danny finally confesses his feelings for Stacey. Arthur, though initially stunned, ultimately supports Danny's confession. Step 5: Climax. On the night before Stacey leaves for her tour, Danny musters the courage to confess his love to her. Stacey, surprised and touched by his words, shares that she has also harbored feelings for him since they were kids, even mentioning that she wrote a song about their friendship. The two share a heartfelt moment and promise to stay in touch while she's on tour. Step 6: Resolution. The movie ends with Danny pursuing his art career more seriously, while Stacey finds success with her music. The two remain in love, even with the distance between them, and their bond only grows stronger. Arthur, still a close friend to both, finds happiness in his own journey. The friends reunite during Stacey's tour, and Danny surprises her during one of her concerts with a beautiful portrait of her on stage. In the end, their love and friendship prove stronger than the challenges they face. In summary, the movie plot revolves around Danny's infatuation with Stacey, the sister of his best friend Arthur. Their intertwined lives, hesitations, and eventual confessions of love create an emotional journey of friendship, sacrifice, and the power of pursuing dreams."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Here's a question: A reaching advantage will lead to what in a race?  Here are possible answers to this question: - victory - being ahead - winning prize - new option - fall  I believe the correct choice is \\"being ahead\\", here's why: The answer is:","output":"Being ahead. Here's a step-by-step justification of my choice: 1. Analyze the question: The question asks about the effect of having a reaching advantage in a race. 2. Define \\"reaching advantage\\": A reaching advantage typically refers to having longer limbs or a greater ability to stretch out and reach. In the context of a race, this could mean having longer strides or being able to cover a greater distance per step. 3. Evaluate the possible answers:    a. Victory: While having a reaching advantage might give a racer an edge, it does not guarantee victory. Many other factors, such as speed, endurance, and strategy, can also determine who wins a race.        b. Being ahead: A reaching advantage allows a racer to cover more ground per stride, which could help them stay ahead of others.        c. Winning prize: Prizes are often associated with victory, but like victory itself, a reaching advantage does not guarantee winning a prize.        d. New option: This choice is vague and does not provide a clear answer to the question.        e. Fall: A reaching advantage should not directly cause a fall in a race. Other factors, such as poor balance or tripping, are more likely to result in a fall. 4.

At night, she works in the FBI's cybercrime division with Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks), fighting identity theft and similar crimes. One night, an anonymous tip leads them to a website called KillWithMe.com. The site features a streaming video of a cat being tortured and killed. The website cannot be shut down, as the creator knew that someone would try and built into it a fail-safe; every time the server is closed, a mirror server immediately replaces it. After the cat's death, KillWithMe.com's webmaster graduates to human victims and makes their deaths correlate directly with the number of hits the site receives. At a press conference, the public is urged to avoid the website, but as Jennifer feared this only increases the site's popularity. The videos are recorded in the killer's basement and his victims include a helicopter pilot (bled to death by injections of anticoagulant), a newscaster (burnt to death by heat lamps while cemented into the floor), and Griffin Dowd (killed by slowly increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid solution in which he is submerged up to his neck). At first it seems the victims were randomly chosen, but this is revealed to be untrue: the first two victims were chosen because they were part of filming or presenting the suicide of a junior college teacher. The teacher's unstable techno prodigy son, Owen Reilly (Joseph Cross), broke down and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. When released, he decided to take revenge and prove a point; that the public's interest in the suffering of others is insatiable, as well as to wreak vengeance on those he felt had exploited his father's death.

Help as much as you can. Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   In which organism ATP molecules would be produced, sample A or sample B?  Hint: There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. Answer:","output":"Sample A would produce ATP molecules. In sample A, the respiration rate is increased, leading to an increase in cellular respiration, which is the process of converting glucose and oxygen into usable energy in the form of ATP molecules. Sample B, with no respiration rate, would not produce ATP molecules through cellular respiration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The first statement says that there are men in red hats and black and yellow vests who are cooking fish. The second statement says that men with white vests are grilling burgers. Unfortunately, the relationship between the two statements is not evident. We do not know whether the men with red hats and black and yellow vests are separate from the men with white vests, nor can we definitively say what type of food they are cooking. To be able to conclude that the men in red hats and black and yellow vests are cooking fish, it would be helpful to have additional information, such as: 1. A direct link between the activities and clothing description given in the two statements. 2. Confirmation that the men in question are part of the same group or event, or are participating in the same activity. For example, if an additional piece of information were provided like, \\"The men wearing red hats and black and yellow vests are also present at the same event, and they are handling the task of cooking fish,\\" then it would be more feasible to conclude that men in red hats and black and yellow vests are cooking fish. Without further information, the given statements can only inform us that the men with white vests are grilling burgers, and men in red hats and black and yellow vests are cooking fish.

Team A studied alcoholic fermentation, while team B learned more about lactic fermentation. They later organised a trivia contest between teams.  But I can use this background: Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy.

St. Moritz is a luxury alpine resort town situated in the Engadin valley in the Swiss canton of Graubünden. Being one of the most prominent winter resorts in Europe, it attracts countless tourists and sports enthusiasts every year to take part in various winter activities, including skiing, snowboarding, ice skating, and, of course, the Cresta Run. The Cresta Run was built in 1884 by British military officers and has since then become an iconic venue for the thrilling and high-speed sport of skeleton riding. The course is constructed yearly by skilled craftsmen, using snow and ice from the nearby frozen lake of St. Moritz. The run is approximately 1,212 meters (3,976 feet) long and features 10 challenging curves, dropping 157 meters (514 feet) from the start at Junction to the finish line at the village of Celerina. Participants can reach breakneck speeds of up to 130 km/h (80 mph) on the sled, lying headfirst and riding down the ice-track. Since its inception, the Cresta Run has been managed by the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club (SMTC), founded by the original builders and still made up mostly of British members. The run is primarily male-dominated, as women were prohibited from riding the Cresta Run after an accident in 1929; however, there have been exceptions, and there is an ongoing discussion about allowing women to participate in this sport again. Over the years, the Cresta Run has been hosting several high-profile competitions, such as the Grand National, which takes place annually during the Cresta Run season running from late December to late February. The course also hosts various clubs and international teams, welcoming riders of various ages and skill levels, as long as they have the required membership or invitation. In summary, the Cresta Run is located in the picturesque winter sports resort of St. Moritz, Switzerland, attracting thrill-seekers, winter sports enthusiasts, and luxury-seeking tourists from all over the world, who enjoy a wide range of winter activities, including the unique experience of skeleton riding down the historic ice toboggan course."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Title: Handy resource Review: I purchased this book for some new ideas for art activities in the college class I teach for elementary education majors. It is nicely arranged by formal art elements with clear, concise directions. While it has worthwhile classroom activities, those concise directions can be a bit thin for most teachers that don't have any art background, unless they are the more motivated type that will do some deeper study into the art elements and principles covered in the National Visual Arts Standards. The one other problem is in the examples pictured in the book, which are obviously done by an adult, and not very imaginative uses of the lessons. Real-live kids would give far better effort than is pictured throughout the text.Overall, this is a nice resource for the classroom teacher. Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","output":"The review is mostly positive, with some minor concerns mentioned. The reviewer commends the book for its organization, clear and concise instructions, and for providing worthwhile art activities for their college class. They appreciate the focus on formal art elements and acknowledge that the book aligns with the National Visual Arts Standards. This positive feedback suggests that the reviewer found the book to be a useful and valuable resource for their teaching purposes. However, they also raise a couple of issues. One concern is that the concise directions might be difficult for teachers without an art background to fully grasp unless they are willing to invest additional effort in understanding the art elements and principles covered. The second issue relates to the examples provided in the book, which the reviewer feels are not very imaginative and not representative of the efforts a child would put into the activities. Despite these concerns, the reviewer still considers the book a handy resource for classroom teachers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Input: Review: King's Solomon's Mines brings us Patrick Swayze (playing Allan Quatermain)who has spent a lot of time in Africa, but decides it is time to return to England and be a father to his son. He finds that his wife's parents have taken custody of his son and that he has very little chance of getting custody of him with lots of money for a law suit. In comes Alison Deedy (playing Elizabeth) whose father is in Africa and being held by an African tribe for ransom of the map Elizabeth's father had sent her. Elizabeth seeks out Quatermain to take her back to Africa to find her father.There is a good cast of supporting characters that go along with Quatermain and Elizabeth and of course there are some enemies (Russians) who want the map also.The movie holds your attention until the end. Patrick once again plays a ruggedly handsome honorable man who comes to the rescue of the damsel in distress. Patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion, loss and despair, the rugged silent good man, anger and strength; In King Solomon's Minds his character actually smiles a few times. I would really like to see Patrick Swayze in a relaxed live-loving story again, one in which he doesn't have to clench his jaws and be quite so strong. Maybe a little dancing would help.

A common substring is a sequence of characters that appears in both strings. To find the longest common substring: 1.

If a common character is found, we continue comparing the following characters in both strings to create a sublist of matching characters. 3. We keep track of the longest sublist of matching characters found so far. 4. We repeat this process for all characters in both strings. Now, let's apply this process to strings A and B: A: IwdUnQvvvktK B: LwnjUnQvvvPaZxv Starting with the first character in A (I), we find no match in B. Moving to the next character in A (w), we find a match in B (w). - UnQvvv is a common substring (A: I(wd)UnQvvvktK, B: L(w)njUnQvvvPaZxv).   However, it has length 6 which is shorter than the previous match.

Write a title for this article: Scores of polling stations across Bangladesh have been hit by arson attacks and at least two people have been killed in scattered clashes before Sunday's controversial election. More than 60 schools due to house polling stations have been hit by arson attacks in the last 36 hours. The violence came as the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP) – which is boycotting the vote – began a two-day strike in protest at what it called a \\"scandalous farce\\". Its ally, the country's biggest Islamist organisation, has been effectively banned from participating in the election. There will be no voting in nearly half the 300 seats of the national parliament which have already been won by the ruling Awami League party. The Awami League is expected to win almost all those being contested, though a handful of rebels from the party could cause some upsets. Tariq Zia, the son of the BNP's leader, Khaleda Zia, called on Saturday for the opposition's four-month-old protest campaign to be intensified in the final runup to the poll in the poor and unstable country of 150 million people. \\"A political faction has distorted the idea of Bangladesh we have had until now for its own interests. I call on all of you to utilise all your strength and come out on the street,\\" Tariq Zia said in a videoed message. Many of the senior officials of the BNP have been imprisoned on charges of fomenting violence and hundreds of lower level workers have been temporarily detained. Khaled Zia herself has been held under effective house arrest in her Dhaka residence. The BNP decided to boycott the election when the government refused to hand over power to a neutral administration. However, senior Awami League officials accuse the BNP of refusing a series of compromise offers, including ministerial posts, and say the restrictions and detentions are necessary to \\"prevent arson killing, burning and destruction of private property\\". Gowher Rizvi, a key adviser to the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, said that postponing the election was not an option. \\"Even if the BNP boycott has taken some of the lustre off the election the government had no choice but to go forward. Not to have had an election would have created a legal and constitutional vacuum. There would have been a state without a government,\\" he said. There has been only one peaceful transfer of power between the parties since the restoration of democracy in Bangladesh in 1991. Each recent poll has been marked by unrest but recent months have been especially violent. Overall, more than 500 people have been killed and at least 20,000 injured in protests, clashes, arson and other attacks in the last year. Awami League officials admit that the new parliament to be elected on Sunday can at best be considered \\"transitional\\" and that new polls will have to be held to seek a convincing mandate. The European Union, a major market for Bangladesh's massive garment industry, has refused to send election observers, as have the US and the Commonwealth, a grouping of 53 mainly former British colonies. Some fear that the EU may now suspend trade privileges which aid the garment producers in Bangladesh. Government officials said such a move would be \\"counterproductive\\" and lead to massive job losses. Many voters are angry with both parties as well as worried about violence. The opposition will hail low levels of participation in the poll as a partial victory. However, patchy enforcement of the strike and blockade indicate that there is little support for the BNP-led protest movement either. Analysts have variously described the violence as \\"a tussle between liberal and pro-democratic elements and non-democratic, anti-secular ones\\"\\"a tussle between liberal and pro-democratic elements and non-democratic, anti-secular ones\\", an intensification of the contest between factions within the country's elite that has been going since Bangladesh won its independence from Pakistan in a brutal civil war in 1971, or the result of a personal feud between Zia, 68, and Hasina, 66.","output":"Title: \\"Bangladesh Polling Stations Sabotaged in Arson Attacks Amid Election Unrest and Violence\\""},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Due to the financial hardship with his mother without resources, Thompson and his older brother were placed in the Grey Coat Hospital, a school for the disadvantaged of Westminster. Thompson graduated to the Grey Coat mathematical school, where he was introduced to basic navigation skills. In 1820, the English geologist, John Jeremiah Bigsby, attended a dinner party given by The Hon. William McGillivray at his home, Chateau St. Antoine, one of the early estates in Montreal's Golden Square Mile. He describes the party and some of the guests in his entertaining book The Shoe and Canoe, giving an excellent description of David Thompson:  I was well placed at table between one of the Miss McGillivray's and a singular-looking person of about fifty. He was plainly dressed, quiet, and observant. His figure was short and compact, and his black hair was worn long all round, and cut square, as if by one stroke of the shears, just above the eyebrows. His complexion was of the gardener's ruddy brown, while the expression of his deeply-furrowed features was friendly and intelligent, but his cut-short nose gave him an odd look. His speech betrayed the Welshman, although he left his native hills when very young. I might have been spared this description of Mr David Thompson by saying he greatly resembled Curran the Irish Orator...  I afterwards travelled much with him, and have now only to speak of him with great respect, or, I ought to say, with admiration... No living person possesses a tithe of his information respecting the Hudson's Bay countries... Never mind his Bunyan-like face and cropped hair; he has a very powerful mind, and a singular faculty of picture-making. He can create a wilderness and people it with warring savages, or climb the Rocky Mountains with you in a snow-storm, so clearly and palpably, that only shut your eyes and you hear the crack of the rifle, or feel the snow-flakes melt on your cheeks as he talks.

What is the funniest joke you have ever read heard or listened? Select from the following. (I). no. (II). yes. The answer is:","output":"(II). yes. Both questions essentially inquire about the same subject: the funniest jokes that one has come across. The slight variations in wording do not change the meaning or the context of the questions. Here's a detailed comparison to explain further: 1. What are some of the funniest jokes you've ever heard? In this question, the person is asked to recall and share multiple jokes that have been found to be amusing. The emphasis is on \\"heard\\" jokes, suggesting verbal or audiobased communication. However, it is reasonable to extend this to jokes a person has read or encountered in any other form, as the main focus is on the humor. 2. What is the funniest joke you have ever read, heard, or listened to? This question is similar to the first, but it asks for a single joke that tops the list in terms of funniness. Additionally, it explicitly covers various forms of communication (reading, hearing, and listening). Nonetheless, the reply may still include more than one joke, as it is often difficult to choose just one example among many humorous experiences. In conclusion, although the questions have subtle differences in their scope (one asking for multiple jokes and the other for a single one), they ultimately address the same topic: the funniest jokes the person has encountered.

Viherpeippo Translate this to English?","output":"\\"Viherpeippo\\" is a Finnish term which translates to \\"European Greenfinch\\" in English. The European Greenfinch, or just Greenfinch (Chloris chloris) is a small songbird of the finch family, Fringillidae.  This bird species is widespread across Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. In appearance, the male Greenfinch primarily features a green-yellow plumage with prominent yellow markings on its wings and tail. The female, on the other hand, is more subdued in coloration, bearing greyish-brown plumage with faint yellow on the wings and tail.  They primarily inhabit gardens, farmlands, woodlands, and hedgerows. The European Greenfinches are seed eaters, with a particular liking for sunflower seeds and peanuts. During the breeding season, they also feed their chicks with insects. Their song is a pleasant, twittering melody, and during flight, they emit a sharp 'dju-dju' sound. These birds have a peculiar way of drinking, by dipping their bill into the water and then lifting their heads to let the water trickle down their throat. As a population, the European Greenfinch has faced threats due to diseases, particularly the Trichomonosis outbreak which negatively impacted their numbers. However, they remain widely distributed, and numerous conservation efforts are in place to ensure their survival.  The term \\"Viherpeippo\\" is therefore a representation of a notable part of Finland's native wildlife, deeply embedded in the local ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  and the situation: Two groups of people were part of a nutrition study that lasted 2 years. Group A had a normal diet, while group B consumed an extra 1000 calories a day for 2 years. Group B gained lots of weight.  Answer the following question: Which group had fewer people that may become obese? A:","output":"Group A had fewer people that may become obese. The background information explains that unused energy from food is stored as fat and consistently consuming more food energy than required may lead to obesity (BMI of 30.0 kg/m² or greater). An extra 3,500 calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. Obesity leads to an increased risk of health issues such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. In the given situation, the nutrition study lasted for 2 years and involved two groups of people. Group A maintained a normal diet, while Group B consumed an additional 1000 calories per day throughout the study period. Consequently, Group B gained a significant amount of weight. Given this information, it is evident that the people in Group A, who adhered to a normal diet, had a lower risk of consuming excess calories, and therefore had a decreased likelihood of storing extra calories as body fat. This reduced the chances of them becoming obese as compared to the individuals in Group B, who consistently consumed an additional 1000 calories per day, predisposing them to gain more weight and potentially become obese. Thus, it can be concluded that Group A had fewer people who may become obese compared to Group B, due to their normal diet that did not involve a consistent intake of extra calories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The painting was referred to in the earliest inventories as La Familia (\\"The Family\\"). A detailed description of Las Meninas, which provides the identification of several of the figures, was published by Antonio Palomino (\\"the Giorgio Vasari of the Spanish Golden Age\\") in 1724. Examination under infrared light reveals minor pentimenti, that is, there are traces of earlier working that the artist himself later altered. For example, at first Velázquez's own head inclined to his right rather than his left.The painting has been cut down on both the left and right sides. It was damaged in the fire that destroyed the Alcázar in 1734, and was restored by court painter Juan García de Miranda (1677–1749). The left cheek of the Infanta was almost completely repainted to compensate for a substantial loss of pigment. After its rescue from the fire, the painting was inventoried as part of the royal collection in 1747–48, and the Infanta was misidentified as Maria Theresa, Margaret Theresa's older half-sister, an error that was repeated when the painting was inventoried at the new Madrid Royal Palace in 1772. A 1794 inventory reverted to a version of the earlier title, The Family of Philip IV, which was repeated in the  records of 1814. The painting entered the collection of the Museo del Prado on its foundation in 1819. In 1843, the Prado catalogue listed the work for the first time as Las Meninas.In recent years, the picture has suffered a loss of texture and hue. Due to exposure to pollution and crowds of visitors, the once-vivid contrasts between blue and white pigments in the costumes of the meninas have faded. It was last cleaned in 1984 under the supervision of the American conservator John Brealey, to remove a \\"yellow veil\\" of dust that had gathered since the previous restoration in the 19th century.

Please answer the following question: -  Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen - The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue -   What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process to transport air to the lungs begins with the inhalation of air through the nostrils and mouth. When we breathe in, our diaphragm, a dome-shaped muscle located at the base of the lungs, contracts and moves downward, expanding the chest cavity. This expansion creates a vacuum, which allows air to be drawn into the respiratory system. As we inhale, air enters through the nostrils, where it is filtered, moistened, and warmed by the nasal passages lined with small hairs called cilia and mucus-producing cells. The air then passes through the pharynx, a common passageway for both air and food, located at the back of the throat. The epiglottis, a small flap of tissue, covers the entrance to the larynx during swallowing to prevent food and liquid from entering the airways. After passing through the pharynx, the air moves into the larynx, also known as the voice box, which contains the vocal cords. The vocal cords vibrate to produce sound when air passes over them. From the larynx, the air travels down the trachea, a tube made up of cartilage rings that prevent the airway from collapsing. Next, the trachea branches into two smaller tubes called bronchi, one for each lung. The bronchi further subdivide into smaller and smaller bronchioles, ultimately leading to the alveoli, the tiny air sacs where the oxygen from the inhaled air is diffused into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide is removed to be exhaled. Throughout this process, the respiratory system efficiently transports air to the lungs, allowing for the crucial exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which supports life and cellular function."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Realize energy savings of about 20 percent by using a convection oven, which circulates air around the food you are cooking. pick from the following. (i) Consider purchasing microwaves, which power energy at a rate of 100 percent. Protect the amount of energy you use in the household by using the energy star designation when you're doing something else.. (ii) This is a moderately low-heat oven that allows more power to be used. This is going to consist significantly more energy than it would if the oven itself were about 1 kilowatt.. (iii) A convection oven functions to heat up the air all around the food. This means that the food will heat up faster quickly, which in turn results in fewer calories hitting your food.. (iv) Convection ovens work better the more surface area the food has. That is, they will work better on cookies or muffins than banana bread..","output":"(iv) Convection ovens work better the more surface area the food has. That is, they will work better on cookies or muffins than banana bread. This means you should adapt your cooking methods based on the appliance and type of food to conserve energy. Denser foods such as banana bread or meat loaves might take more time and energy to cook, as the heat needs to penetrate deeper. Conversely, food items with more surface area heat up and cook more quickly in a convection oven due to the movement of hot air, saving energy. Further, you can adopt some more efficient cooking practices with a convection oven. For example, you can cook multiple dishes at once. Since food cooks faster in a convection oven, you can efficiently utilize the space and energy. This would result in a significant reduction of energy use in comparison to cooking single dishes one after another. Additionally, try to avoid opening the oven door frequently when cooking, as every time the door is opened, heat escapes, making the appliance work harder and use more energy. Moreover, it's not just the oven you can optimize for energy usage. There are many other ways you can reduce energy use in the kitchen. For instance, using smaller appliances such as toaster ovens or microwave ovens for small meals rather than the large conventional oven; using pressure cookers, which take less time and thus save energy; or making sure your appliances are in good working order, as damaged appliances can lead to increased energy usage. Moreover, good planning and strategic appliance use can also lead to greater energy savings. For example, if you run your dishwasher at night, you'll be using electricity at a time when there's less demand and hence, the cost is lower. Or, in winter, you can exploit the heat from the oven spill-over to help heat the house. Last but not least, be mindful of your refrigerator usage. Try to decide what you need before you open the fridge door to reduce the amount of time that it remains open, and thus the amount of energy wasted. Also, allow hot foods to cool down before you put them in the refrigerator to avoid making it work harder to keep things cold. Through these steps, you can significantly reduce energy use in your kitchen, leading to lower energy bills and a more sustainable household."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Having conquered the Greek world, they made Arabic versions of its philosophical and scientific works. During the Middle Ages, translations of some of these Arabic versions were made into Latin, chiefly at Córdoba in Spain. King Alfonso X el Sabio (Alphonse the Wise) of Castille in the 13th century promoted this effort by founding a Schola Traductorum (School of Translation) in Toledo. There Arabic texts, Hebrew texts, and Latin texts were translated into the other tongues by Muslim, Jewish and Christian scholars, who also argued the merits of their respective religions. Latin translations of Greek and original Arab works of scholarship and science helped advance European Scholasticism, and thus European science and culture. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): When were some of the Arabic translations of earlier sentences translated into Latin?","output":"The translation of Arabic texts into Latin, particularly philosophical and scientific works, began as early as the 8th century, during the Islamic Golden Age, and continued until well into the 13th century. This period of translation played a crucial role in the development of European Scholasticism and the transformation of European culture. Some notable moments in the history of Arabic-to-Latin translations include: 1. 8th to 10th centuries: During this period, Latin-speaking Christians in the Umayyad caliphate, especially in Spain and Sicily, began to translate Arabic texts into Latin. Among the earliest translated works were the writings of the Eastern Christian theologians known as the Church Fathers, which had previously been translated into Arabic from Greek and Syriac. 2. 10th to 12th centuries: This era saw a significant increase in the translation of Arabic works, sparked by the growing interest in science and philosophy among Latin-speaking scholars, as well as the establishment of important translation centers. Notably, the School of Translation in Toledo was established in the 11th century, gathering scholars who translated various works from Arabic, Hebrew, and Greek into Latin. Similarly, in Sicily, Christian and Jewish scholars often worked together to translate Arabic texts, including the works of prominent scholars like Al-Farabi and Al-Ghazali. 3. 12th and 13th centuries: These centuries marked the peak of Arabic-to-Latin translation activity in Europe. Scholars, including Gerard of Cremona (1114–1187) and Michael Scot (1175–1232), translated countless Arabic texts, including many authored by famous thinkers like Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Ibn Rushd (Averroes). In addition, King Alfonso X of Castile also sponsored translation efforts, leading to an influx of Arabic scientific and philosophical texts into Latin Europe. Many of these translations became the foundation for the European intellectual revival in the late Middle Ages, known as the Renaissance of the 12th century. In summary, the translation of Arabic texts into Latin took place from the 8th century, reaching its peak between the 12th and 13th centuries. These translations were instrumental in shaping European science, philosophy, and culture during the Middle Ages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery (misspelled \\"sematary\\") in the forest behind the Creed's new home. On his first day at work, Louis encounters Victor Pascow, a jogger who has been mortally injured after being hit by a truck. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before he dies, calling Louis by name despite the fact they have not previously met. That night, Pascow comes to Louis as a ghost and leads him to the Pet Sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is \\"sour\\". Louis awakens, assuming it was a dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt. During Thanksgiving while the family is gone, Ellie's cat, Church, is run down on the highway. Realizing that Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the cemetery and deep into the woods, where they reach an ancient Micmac burial ground. Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone else about what they have done. The next day a reanimated Church returns to the house, a shell of what he was before; he stinks, moves sluggishly, and is vicious towards Louis. Jud explains that as a boy he himself revived his beloved pet dog in the Micmac ground, and that although the cat might be different, it will save Ellie the grief of losing her favorite pet. Sometime later, the young Gage is killed by a truck along the same highway.

What is the title of this article: Statistically speaking, cable-borne elevators are extremely safe. Their safety record is unsurpassed by any other vehicle system. In 1998, it was estimated that approximately eight millionths of one percent (1 in 12 million) of elevator rides result in an anomaly, and the vast majority of these were minor things such as the doors failing to open. Of the 20 to 30 elevator-related deaths each year, most of them are maintenance-related — for example, technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts, and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents, such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors. In fact, prior to the September 11th terrorist attacks, the only known free-fall incident in a modern cable-borne elevator happened in 1945 when a B-25 bomber struck the Empire State Building in fog, severing the cables of an elevator cab, which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building, seriously injuring (though not killing) the sole occupant — the elevator operator. However, there was an incident in 2007 at a Seattle children's hospital, where a ThyssenKrupp ISIS machine-room-less elevator free-fell until the safety brakes were engaged. This was due to a flaw in the design where the cables were connected at one common point, and the kevlar ropes had a tendency to overheat and cause slipping (or, in this case, a free-fall). While it is possible (though extraordinarily unlikely) for an elevator's cable to snap, all elevators in the modern era have been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free-falling and crashing. An elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 (up to 12 or more in high rise installations) hoist cables or belts, each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty-five percent more weight. In addition, there is a device which detects whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed; if this happens, the device causes copper (or silicon nitride in high rise installations) brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the shaft, stopping the elevator quickly, but not so abruptly as to cause injury. This device is called the governor, and was invented by Elisha Graves Otis. In addition, a oil/hydraulic or spring or polyurethane or telescopic oil/hydraulic buffer or a combination (depending on the travel height and travel speed) is installed at the bottom of the shaft (or in the bottom of the cab and sometimes also in the top of the cab or shaft) to somewhat cushion any impact. However, In Thailand, in November 2012, a woman was killed in free falling elevator, in what was reported as the \\"first legally recognised death caused by a falling lift\\".","output":"Title: \\"The Unparalleled Safety Record of Cable-Borne Elevators: A Look at Their Safety Mechanisms and Rare Accidents\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: The City of London has postponed its plan to issue the St Paul's anti-capitalist protesters with legal notices requiring them to leave their tent city. The City of London Corporation confirmed it had suspended legal action against demonstrators until the morning, when the situation will be reviewed. A spokesman said: 'We have not handed them (the protesters) a letter this afternoon.' Earlier a spokesman for St Paul's said the cathedral was not taking joint action with the City of London Corporation. Men (and women) at work: Protesters on the steps of St Paul's unfurled a banner on the steps of St Paul's Cathedral painting their action as essential improvements. Reprieve: Protesters were due to be served with legal notices today by the City of London Corporation, but it is now scheduled to happen in the morning. 'Members of Chapter met yesterday following the resignation of the Dean and are due to meet with the Bishop of London today,' the spokesman said. 'The Chapter have not yet sought an injunction, nor are they serving notices on the protesters today. 'They are committed to a peaceful resolution at all costs.' There were fears today that a split among senior Church of England figures on how to deal with the protest could lead to the camp remaining on the steps of St Paul's during next year's Olympic Games and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Concerns that legal action could lead to violent evictions has led to the Church's liberal wing - led by Archbishop Rowan Williams - to oppose moves to support the City of London Corporation's plans. The split could mean that some protesters would be moved from the City's land but could be allowed to remain in the shadow of St Paul's indefinitely. Authorities were given a possible foretaste of any eviction they may be forced to carry out in the early hours of this morning when police arrested 12 protesters outside Parliament Square. They were among a group of up to 200 demonstrators who are opposed plans to criminalise the act of squatting homes and other building. A protester lies before three policemen in Parliament Square during the demonstration against plans to criminalise squatting. Last night the Archbishop of Canterbury broke his silence on the protesters camped outside St Paul's Cathedral, saying he sympathised with the 'urgent larger issues' they raised. In a sign of the panic within the Church of England high command since the arrival of the activists, Dr Rowan Williams intervened yesterday after the dean of the cathedral became the third member of staff to resign. Indicating his support for the anti-capitalists' aims, the Archbishop said: 'The urgent larger issues raised by the protesters at St Paul's remain very much on the table. Archbishop: Dr Rowan Williams has kept his counsel since the protest began but, after the resignation of Dean of St Paul's Cathedral, Graeme Knowles, he has spoken and backed the demonstrators. 'We need – as a Church and as society as a whole – to work to make sure that they are properly addressed.' The Archbishop's intervention was sparked by the resignation yesterday of the Dean of St Paul's, the Right Reverend Graeme Knowles. The dean caused controversy when he closed the historic building's doors last month for the first time since the Second World War, citing 'health and safety concerns' over the tents. The cathedral reopened last week but the dean said yesterday his position had become 'untenable' amid the ongoing row. The Archbishop's endorsement of the right of the protesters to campaign showed just how confused the Church of England remains in its response to the encampment on its doorstep. His remarks came as the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres, confirmed yesterday that legal efforts to persuade the activists to leave have begun. Stepping down: The Dean of St Paul's, the Rt Rev Graeme Knowles, pictured yesterday speaking to demonstrators camped outside the Cathedral, has resigned. 'Untenable': Rt Rev Knowles became the second of the cathedral's senior clergy to resign in less than a week. Trouble brewing: The Bishop of London (centre) and a protestor in the tea tent yesterday. The bishop stressed that cathedral officials did not want a violent eviction. The. dean's departure followed Canon Chancellor of St Paul's, Giles Fraser –. who had told police to leave the activists alone after their arrival on. October 15 – and part-time chaplain Fraser Dyer. The Occupy London protesters were showing no signs of leaving despite the cathedral's requests. Dr Williams said the dean's departure was 'very sad news'. He. added: 'The events of the last couple of weeks have shown very clearly. how decisions made in good faith by good people under unusual pressure. can have utterly unforeseen and unwelcome consequences, and the clergy. of St Paul's deserve our understanding. Graeme Knowles will be much. missed.' 'Move beyond slogans': The Bishop of London has criticised demonstrators' methods. An unlikely crowd: A demonstrator directs questions to Rt Rev Knowles (second from right), and the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres (right) at the weekend. Crowd: The bishop and dean addressed a crowd of hundreds by the steps of St Paul's. Yesterday a. significant protester splinter group refused even to support the. cathedral's requests for drink, drugs and loud music to be banned from. the protest camp. They. appeared largely bemused by the resignation of the dean – which he had. to yesterday submit to the Queen, since his job is a crown appointment. Their. reluctance to leave was indicated by placards saying 'Hell no we won't. go' and 'Jesus did not quit – he drove the money lenders from the. temple'. The Government is considering whether the law needs to be tightened to deal with protests such as that being held outside St Paul's Cathedral. Justice minister Nick Herbert said everyone had a right to 'make their views known'. But he insisted it was not right to 'disrupt the life of the community' by setting up encampments. 'Everybody agrees there should be a right of peaceful protest in our country,' Mr Herbert told the BBC's Politics Show. 'People have an entitlement to make their view known. It's fundamental to our democracy and the coalition is committed to protect that. 'But we saw - for instance in Parliament Square, where there was a permanent encampment which had gone on for years there and was very disruptive to the enjoyment of Parliament Square by others. 'You cannot protest peacefully at Parliament Square because it is closed off to others. We are taking action to deal with that. 'And if necessary we will take action to deal with other invasions of private property that involved permanent encampments.' He went on: 'We want to protect peaceful protest. We do not think that it's right to disrupt the life of the community, and trespass, and permanently to set up and live somewhere - just as travellers do - which invades private property.' In a statement Mr. Knowles, the dean for four years, said: 'Since the arrival of the. protesters' camp outside the cathedral, we have all been put under a. great deal of strain and have faced what would appear to be some. insurmountable issues. 'It. has become increasingly clear to me that, as criticism of the cathedral. has mounted in the press, media and in public opinion, my position as. dean of St Paul's was becoming untenable. 'In. order to give the opportunity for a fresh approach to the complex and. vital questions facing St Paul's, I have thought it best to stand down. as dean, to allow new leadership to be exercised.' St. Paul's spokesman the Right Reverend Michael Colclough said: 'We are. committed to doing all we can to find a way ahead that ensures the main. message of the protest is not only heard but properly attended to, and. in such a way that people in the local community, as well as our own. team, can do their work peacefully for the good of everyone.' The. Bishop of London explained that due to the 'great mystery' of the. Church of England's organisation, the cathedral made its own decisions. without control from him. But he said St Paul's officials had asked him. to help out in the protesters' row. He. went on: 'There are many diverse voices in the camp outside St Paul's,. but among them, serious issues are being articulated which the cathedral. has always sought to address.' The. bishop stressed that all in the church wanted a peaceful resolution,. but added said that any responsible organisation had to investigate its. legal powers. Outside, the. camp still numbers about 200 tents – but barely 50 protesters attended a. meeting yesterday afternoon to decide tactics. About. a quarter of those present indicated that they were reluctant to accept. basic requests from the cathedral for drink and drugs to be barred from. the site and the camp to be kept tidy. In. a statement, the group, whose official name is Occupy London Stock. Exchange, said: 'The management of St Paul's Cathedral is obviously. deeply divided over the position they have taken in response to our. cause – but our cause has never been directed at the staff of the. cathedral.' The real issue was 'challenging the unsustainable financial system that punishes the many and privileges the few', it added. Highlights:","output":"1.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Feraud  for the following movie plot:  In Strasbourg in 1800, fervent Bonapartist and obsessive duellist Lieutenant Gabriel Feraud (Harvey Keitel) of the French 7th Hussars, nearly kills the nephew of the city's mayor in a sword duel. Under pressure from the mayor, Brigadier-General Treillard (Robert Stephens) sends a member of his staff, Lieutenant Armand d'Hubert (Keith Carradine) of the 3rd Hussars, to put Feraud under house arrest. As the arrest takes place in the house of Madame de Lionne (Jenny Runacre), a prominent local lady, Feraud takes it as a personal insult from d'Hubert. Matters are made worse when Feraud asks d'Hubert if he would \\"let them spit on Napoleon\\" and d'Hubert doesn't immediately reply. Upon reaching his quarters, Feraud challenges d'Hubert to a duel. The duel is inconclusive; d'Hubert slashes Feraud's forearm but is unable to finish him off, because he is attacked by Feraud's mistress. As a result of his part in the duel, d'Hubert is dismissed from the General's staff and returned to active duty with his unit. The war interrupts the men's quarrel and they do not meet again until six months later in Augsburg in 1801. Feraud immediately challenges d'Hubert to another duel and seriously wounds him. Recovering, d'Hubert takes lessons from a fencing master and in the next duel (held in a cellar with heavy sabres), the two men fight each other to a bloody standstill. Soon afterwards, d'Hubert is relieved to learn he has been promoted to captain. Military discipline forbids officers of different ranks from duelling. The action moves to 1806 when d'Hubert is serving in LÃ¼beck. He is shocked to hear that the 7th Hussars have arrived in the city and that Feraud is now also a captain. Aware that in two weeks time he is to be promoted to major, d'Hubert attempts to slip away but is spotted by Feraud's perpetual second. Feraud challenges him to another duel, which is to be fought on horseback with sabres. D'Hubert slashes his opponent across the forehead; Feraud, blinded because the cut bleeds heavily into his eyes, cannot continue...

Alan works in IT and listed the bus for an older friend who isn't quite so tech savvy. That friend does lots of business in and around Texas and its neighboring states, and so when he was tipped off to something rumored to be Willie Nelson's old tour bus being sold in Alabama, he checked it out. He bought it \\"three or four\\" years ago, and has used it frequently ever since. He's \\"giving up the hobby\\" and is ready to unload it. He owns \\"several other vehicles\\" according to Alan.      Alan says the frequent calls he's fielding from curious buyers are 75-percent serious cash-in-hand offers. Some, like us, just have questions.      The bus is one of two identical custom-made for Willie, and it had three owners before the fella Alan is selling it for got hold of it. The interior is in excellent condition (as you can see below) and the only problem with the exterior is a couple spots of peeling clear coat. The generator was serviced three years ago and electrical in the bus has been well maintained over the years.      Alan says, based on the volume of calls, they probably priced Willie's bus too low. They have no plans to raise the price now, though, because sometimes people aren't terrible. It'll stay at 29,999, a figure they arrived at by comparing it to other buses of the same make and year already on the market. \\"The owner doesn't really need the money,\\" says Alan.

Step 2: Question 1: If President Putin said he'd nuke the US if we didn't provide 1T in 48 hours, what would happen? Given the severity of the threat, there would likely be a series of urgent diplomatic negotiations and discussions between the US, Russia, and other global powers. Since the threat of a nuclear attack is extreme, the US might be forced to consider both economic and military options (sanctions, alliances, or even a potential preemptive strike). Question 2: If President Obama said he'd nuke Russia if they didn't provide 1T in 48 hours, what would happen? Similar to Question 1, this scenario would result in a series of urgent diplomatic negotiations and discussions involving multiple countries. The US might face potential global backlash for making such an aggressive threat, particularly from the allied countries of Russia. Russia would consider its own set of military and economic options to respond to the situation. Step 3: Although both questions involve the threat of a nuclear attack and a monetary demand, they are not asking the same thing.

Our behavior when waiting is only partly decided by the length of the wait. \\"Often the psychology of queuing is more important than the statistics of the wait itself,\\" notes the MIT researcher Richard Larson. One apparent aspect of queuing psychology is that we get bored when we wait in line. This issue is solved in many ways, from magazines in hospital waiting rooms to mirrors in elevators so that we can check our appearance. We really hate it when we expect a short wait and then get a long one. But studies show that we are much more patient when we are given an idea of how long we'll be waiting. Walt Disney Co knows this better than anyone else. It posts estimated waiting times for attractions in its theme parks. But according to Larson, these times are overestimated so that visitors get to the front of the queue more quickly than they expect. It keeps them happy. But perhaps the biggest influence on our feelings about waiting in a line has to do with our sense of fairness. When it comes to queues, the universally acknowledged standard is first come, first served. Any departure from this principle is regarded as unfair and can lead to violent queue anger. You've probably experienced mild queue anger yourself in fast food restaurants, watching people in the other line zoom ahead of you, cursing yourself for having chosen the \\"wrong\\" line. In order to solve this problem, the serpentine  line was invented. The serpentine line guides all customers into one big snaking queue, separated by ropes or barriers. When you reach the head of the queue, you are directed to the next available server, or teller, or customs official. The... Question: Walt Disney Co makes people queuing happily by  _  .

'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Fish have ears. Really. They're quite small and have no opening to the outside world carrying sound through the body. For the past seven years, Simon Thorrold, a university professor, has been examining fish ears, small round ear bones called otoliths. As fish grow, so do their otoliths. Each day, their otoliths gain a ring of calcium carbonate  . By looking through a microscope and counting these rings, Thorrold can determine the exact age of a young fish. As a fish gets older, its otoliths no longer get daily rings. Instead, they get yearly rings, which can also be counted, giving information about the fish's age, just like the growth rings of a tree. Ring counting is nothing new to fish scientists. But Thorrold has turned to a new direction. They're examining the chemical elements   of each otolith ring. The daily ring gives us the time, but chemistry tells us about the environment in which the fish swam on any given day. These elements tell us about the chemistry of the water that the fish was in. It also says something about water temperature, which determines how much of these elements will gather within each otolith ring. Thorrold can tell, for example, if a fish spent time in the open ocean before entering the less salty water of coastal areas. He can basically tell where fish are spending their time at any given stage of history. In the case of the Atlantic croaker, a popular saltwater food fish, Thorrold and his assistant have successfully followed the travelling of young fish from mid-ocean to the coast, a journey of many hundreds of miles. This is important to managers in the fish industry, who know nearly nothing about the track of the young fish for most food fish in the ocean. Eager to learn about his technology, fish scientists are now lending Thorrold their ears. Question: Why does the writer compare the fish to trees? Answer: Choose your answer from: A). Trees gain a growth ring each day.. B). Trees also have otoliths.. C). Their growth rings are very small.. D). They both have growth rings..","output":"Answer: D).

The Swedish cheese that can’t be moved As I reached the small village of Burträsk in northern Sweden, I saw snow piled by the roadsides like icing and a group of reindeer sitting down for a rest. When I got out of the car to take a photograph, they stood up, crossed the road and disappeared into the woods. I had come to Burträsk to learn about a secret that felt as elusive as these animals. In this Swedish village, they make a hard yellow cheese dotted with tiny holes called Västerbottensost. If you attend one of Sweden’s traditional summer crayfish parties, you’ll most likely find it served alongside succulent crustaceans and copious schnapps. It’s been on the menu at royal weddings, Nobel Prize dinners and Copenhagen super-restaurant Noma. Famed Swedish playwright August Strindberg mentioned it in his poetry, and Prince Hassan of Jordan said it’s “what I love most about Sweden”. With a reputation like this, it’s understandable that demand for the cheese is high. But when the dairy tried to expand production by starting an operation in the nearby city of Umeå, it didn’t taste the same. It turns out that for the cheese can only be made in Burträsk – and no one knows why. Not even after using forensic DNA analysis techniques or making 12 documentaries about Västerbottensost. Its been suggested that the cheese’s unique flavour could be due to the local spruce shelves that it’s left to mature on, the particular microflora in the dairy building, or even long summer days affecting the mood of the cows. According to the most intriguing theory, the beloved taste is all down to a meteorite that struck the area long ago, creating the lake next to Burträsk and making the soil rich in calcium, which in turn created knock-on effects on the milk and the cheese-making process. If that ancientrock really did land here, however, then the shock waves have long since dispersed. When I arrived, things were pretty peaceful. The dairy roof was covered in a layer of snow, and the sun glinted off the metallic lettering on the red-brick exterior. Burträsk is less than 300km from the Arctic Circle, and the locals are used to dark winters. But today spring was emerging, with wispy clouds stretched across the bright blue sky. Inside the dairy’s spacious visitor centre, light flooded in through a large window. All around the room were displays about the cheese, its history and its place in Swedish culture. I was shown around by Inga Lill-Eklund, who now works in the cafe but spent 35 years in the dairy’s laboratory, taking samples of the bacteria in the milk. Inga’s son, Thomas, is the current master cheese maker, as the head of the dairy is known. According to legend, Inga said, the cheese was created in 1872 by mistake. The story goes that a Burträsk dairymaid called Ulrika Eleonora Lindstrom was distracted from her cheese-making duties by a lover; the process was prolonged and she had to keep reheating the curds. The resulting cheese was left to age anyway, and when someone tasted it they realised the happy accident. The precise recipe is still a secret – but the logistics of making the cheese haven’t changed much over the years. The milk is delivered from 20 to 30 different local farms, pasteurised and curdled. Inga explained that the consistency of the cheese in the curdling vat is still hand tested, to judge its feel in the fingers. The granular curds that emerge after the liquid whey is drained are packed inside linen cloths into a round mould, turned several times by hand, and soaked in brine according to a strict schedule. The resulting cheeses (which weigh 18kg each) are then left to age for at least 14 months at a nearby warehouse. The small dairy, with only 25 people working on a typical shift, makes 4,000 tonnes of Västerbottensost a year. After hearing all these stories, I finally got to taste Västerbottensost – sliced and served on bread most traditionally. However, the cafe offers a range of other dishes that highlight its versatility. You might find it with smoked salmon in a lasagne, with chicken in a pasta sauce or sprinkled on soup. If you’re lucky, you might even be able to try Västerbottensost ice cream, made by adding grated cheese to the cream and eggs before freezing – and best served with warm cloudberries or arctic brambles. I chose to accompany my cheese with some biscuits and fruit syrup.It was tangy, like Parmesan, but subtler and creamier with nutty and fruity notes. The otherwise smooth texture was pleasantly interrupted by the crunch of small crystals. It’s been said that the cheese encompasses all the major flavour categories: sweet, sour, salty and bitter, plus the all-important umami. Like a good wine, it was hard to pin down. Which of course made it my duty to take another chunk. And another one. So what is it about the process of making Västerbottensost that gives it this memorable flavour? Perhaps it would help to borrow another idea from wine: terroir, the unquantifiable combination of local conditions and culture that contribute to the final product. There may be no single factor that unlocks the secret to the cheese – but its enigmatic flavour could only be created here. If the theories were given marks for effort, though, the meteorite would have to win hands down. Given the closeness of this region to the edge of the world, it would certainly be appropriate if the answer came from outer space. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the location of the village of Burträsk. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"In the Swedish village of Burträsk, a hard yellow cheese called Västerbottensost is made, which has a unique flavor that cannot be replicated outside the village, despite attempts using forensic DNA analysis techniques.

Here are possible answers to this question: - pain - dead - distress - die - kill  I believe the correct choice is \\"die\\", here's why: A:","output":"When a person becomes a victim of a murder, various consequences can ensue, depending on the context and extent of the crime. Hence, all the listed answers could be correct depending on the precise details of the situation. However, the central aspect of a murder involves taking the life of a victim, which directly corresponds to the given answer, \\"die.\\" Let's analyze each possible answer: 1. Pain: A victim of murder might experience physical pain during the incident, depending on the method employed by the murderer. However, not all murders necessarily involve pain (e.g., poisoning or sudden fatal injuries), so this answer is not entirely accurate. 2. Dead: This answer is correct from a general perspective, as the victim's eventual state after being murdered would be death. However, it does not provide sufficient context by itself. 3. Distress: Distress could potentially accompany the mental or emotional experience of the victim during a murder or even their loved ones who might suffer psychological trauma after the incident. Still, like pain, not all murder victims would necessarily experience distress. 4. Die: As stated earlier, this answer is the most accurate description of what happens to a murder victim as dying is the core consequence that defines murder. 5. Kill: This answer describes the action carried out by the murderer rather than what happens to the victim. While it is related to the overall act of murder, it does not specifically address the question of what happens to the victim. In summary, the answer \\"die\\" is the most appropriate choice when describing what happens to a murder victim, as it encapsulates the central aspect of various murder situations, the taking of a life. Other answers might be relevant in specific contexts, but \\"die\\" effectively captures the core element of murder."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a question about the following article: The Livonian War  was fought for control of Old Livonia , when the Tsardom of Russia faced a varying coalition of Denmark-Norway, the Kingdom of Sweden, and the Union  of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland. During the period 1558-1578, Russia dominated the region with early military successes at Dorpat  and Narva. Russian dissolution of the Livonian Confederation brought Poland-Lithuania into the conflict, while Sweden and Denmark both intervened between 1559 and 1561. Swedish Estonia was established despite constant invasion from Russia, and Frederick II of Denmark bought the old Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek, which he placed under the control of his brother Magnus of Holstein. Magnus attempted to expand his Livonian holdings to establish the Russian vassal state Kingdom of Livonia, which nominally existed until his defection in 1576. In 1576, Stefan Batory became King of Poland as well as Grand Duke of Lithuania and turned the tide of the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581, including the joint Swedish-Polish-Lithuanian offensive at the Battle of Wenden. This was followed by an extended campaign through Russia culminating in the long and difficult siege of Pskov. Under the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski, which ended the war between Russia and Poland-Lithuania, Russia lost all its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland-Lithuania. The following year, Sweden and Russia signed the Truce of Plussa with Sweden gaining most of Ingria and northern Livonia while retaining the Duchy of Estonia.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. There are many differences between having a freshwater aquarium versus having a saltwater aquarium. These differences include how you initially set up the aquarium and all ongoing care, maintenance, everyday chores, and costs requirements. There are several key issues you will need to consider while you choose:  Saltwater aquariums cost more. Saltwater aquariums have specific water requirements that need extra tools and equipment to maintain it, as opposed to maintaining a freshwater aquarium. For example, most saltwater aquariums need protein skimmers or a foam fractionator in addition to the regular filter system that all aquariums need. Unlike a regular aquarium filter, protein skimmers completely remove dissolved organics from the water which is vitally important for saltwater aquariums where a buildup of nitrates can be deadly. Water changes are easier for freshwater tanks. All aquariums need weekly or bi-weekly partial water changes. For freshwater aquariums, simply doing a 10% to 20% water change with an aquarium vacuum and refilling the tank with dechlorinated tap or filtered water is enough. However, saltwater aquariums will require you to mix new saltwater days before your scheduled partial water change. There are more saltwater invertebrates and fish to choose from. In terms of aesthetic and choice, there are more options available if you are choosing to have a saltwater aquarium. You can find stunning saltwater fish like angelfish, clownfish, and lionfish and a vast array of invertebrates available like starfish, shrimps, worms, and corals. Saltwater fish may need special diets. In most cases, getting freshwater fish to eat flakes is not a problem. However, if you choose saltwater fish, especially those that need to be caught from the wild, they may need special diets or be weaned into eating conventional fish flakes and food. Giving fish an inadequate diet can lower their immune systems and cause diseases, which can eventually lead to death. A small fish tank set up is generally more economical than a large fish tank. There are several issues you should consider when choosing the size of your tank:  Where will you put your aquarium? The best place to put a fish tank is away from direct sunlight and heater vents. Fluctuations in temperature and sunlight can cause green algae to form and dirty the water quality of your tank. In some cases, the best location for an aquarium can restrict the size of your tank. Your aquarium stand should be able to withhold the weight of the tank. For each gallon (4 litres) of water, there is approximately 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) of weight. Obviously, smaller tank would hold less weight than a larger one. It’s harder to maintain the quality of water in a small fish tank. This means you will need to do more partial water changes than if you had a large fish tank. The size of your tank will determine what type of fish you can have. Most fish require at least 5 gallons (20 litres) of water with the exception of betta fish that don’t need as much water. However, being able to survive in a certain condition doesn’t necessarily mean the fish is thriving or living a happy life. There are three main saltwater aquarium types: Fish Only, Fish Only with Live Rock (FOWLR), and the Reef Tank.   Fish Only Tanks: As the name suggests, this tank only houses saltwater fish. It is the least expensive way to set up a saltwater aquarium. However, it does have its disadvantages. Fish Only tanks take longer to set up, require more frequent tank maintenance and testing, and have a shorter shelf life than the other types of saltwater aquariums.  Fish Only with Live Rock: FOWLR tanks are set up like Fish Only tanks but with the addition of live rock and better aquarium lighting. The live rock acts as a natural biological filter for saltwater and keeps your tank healthier than a Fish Only tank. A live rock has hundreds of tiny creatures and biological organisms living inside and on the surface of the rock.  Reef Tank: If you choose this type of saltwater aquarium, you are most likely looking towards having invertebrates, corals, or anemones as the main focus of your aquarium and fish are just an afterthought. Reef tanks require daily water quality checks, high lighting levels, extra water supplements, heavy duty filtration systems and are generally the most expensive to maintain. Reef Tanks are recommended for more experienced aquarium hobbyists. The kind of lighting and the temperature of your aquarium depend on what kind of aquarium you have and who your tank inhabitants are. The type of light you choose also affects the overall temperature of your tank.   Aquariums that are Fish Only: This means your freshwater tank will not have real or live plants in it. In this case, you will most likely be using fluorescent lights that are between 18 and 40 watts.  Freshwater aquariums with plants: The type of lighting you’ll need will depend on the depth of your tank, the plant species you have, and the desired growth rate of the plant. Usually, you should provide 2 to 5 watts of light per gallon in a planted freshwater aquarium. Always research and consult with your aquarium expert when you plan to have plants in your tank.   Saltwater Reef Tanks: These tanks need high levels of light that are characteristic of high output fluorescent and metal halide lamps. Some corals may even need more intense levels of light that can be achieved with T5-HO, Very High Output (VHO), and metal halide lights. All filters have three functions to them, which include mechanically filtering the water by trapping or removing free floating particles, biologically filtering the water by growing good bacteria, and chemically filtering the water by dissolving wastes. There are various types of filter:   Mechanical Filter: The most popular type of filter is the corner filter that recycles water through the three-filtration stages. It usually sits at the top of the aquarium in the middle or in the corner and sucks up water through a tube and spits it out again.  Undergravel Filter: This filter provides good mechanical filtration since it is located underneath the gravel in plates, which forces the water to filter through the rocks, trapping and taking any fallen particles in the water.  Canister Filter: This high end filtration system operates by having multiple trays that mechanically, biologically, and chemically filter the water. It filters the water by pushing water from the bottom of the canister to the top.  Protein Skimmer: This filter is necessary if you have a saltwater aquarium. Protein skimmers remove dissolved organic materials from the water as opposed to other filtration systems that only trap it until you change the filter.

Selective-fire firearms usually have multiple firing modes, typically including semi-automatic, burst-fire, and fully automatic firing options. In this case, the mention of \\"Raffica\\" (which translates to \\"bursts\\" in Italian) indicates that the Beretta 93R does have burst-fire capabilities, a feature that is usually associated with firearms that also have fully-automatic firing options.

The University of Connecticut, or UConn, is a well-known institution with a strong reputation in sports, particularly basketball. The men's and women's basketball teams are frequently the subject of conversation among sports enthusiasts, as they both have strong records and notable successes. They have both managed to garner national and international attention, particularly when they win national championships. UConn's men's basketball team has enjoyed an illustrious history, with four national championships under their belt, many appearances in the NCAA Tournament, and numerous successful seasons. Many of their players have gone on to enjoy successful professional careers in the NBA and internationally. The team has also produced several esteemed coaches, including the legendary Jim Calhoun, who led the team to three of its national championships. The women's basketball team has been no less impressive, led by the legendary coach Geno Auriemma, who took over in 1985. The UConn women's team has become a dominant force in college basketball, boasting eleven national championships, nineteen Final Four appearances, and a record-breaking 111-game winning streak. Geno Auriemma himself has been named the Naismith College Coach of the Year a record eight times and has been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. While basketball holds a prominent place in UConn's athletic department, it is not the only sport that has earned respect and recognition. One such sport that, despite not garnering as many headlines, has been highly successful at UConn is soccer. Both the men's and women's soccer teams have earned accolades for their strong performances on the field and impact on campus. The UConn men's soccer team, established in 1920, has built a strong tradition of success in both the regular season and championship play.

This is consistent with the use of 'last night' in the sentence, which also denotes a past event.  Step 5: Check for subject-verb agreement: The subject 'policeman' is singular, and the verb 'met' agrees with this singular subject. Step 6: Check for proper sentence ending: The sentence correctly ends with a period, following English grammatical rules. Step 7: Consider overall coherency: The sentence is coherent, making a logical statement that the policeman met several young students in the park last night. Conclusion: After careful scrutiny, I confirm that the sentence \\"It was last night that the policeman met several young students in the park.\\" is a correct grammatical English sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The rise of multinational corporations  , global marketing, new communications technologies, and shrinking cultural differences have led to an unparalleled increase in global public relations or PR. Surprisingly, since modern PR was largely an American invention, America's relations is being threatened by PR efforts in other countries. Ten years ago, for example, the world's top five public relations agencies were American-owned. In 1991, only one was. The British in particular are becoming more sophisticated and creative. A recent survey found that more than half of all British companies include PR as part of their corporate   planning activities, compared to about one-third of U.S. companies.It may not be long before London replaces New York as the capital of PR. Why is America lagging behind in the global PR race? Firstly, Americans as a whole tend to be fairly provincial and take more of an interest in local affairs. Knowledge of world geography, for example, has never been strong in this country. Secondly, Americans lag behind their European and Asian counterparts   in knowing a second language. Less than 5 percent of Burson--Marshall's U.S.employees know two languages. Ogilvy and Mather have about the same percentage. Conversely, some European firms have half or more of their employees fluent in a second language. Finally, people involved in PR abroad tend to keep a closer eye on international affairs. In the financial PR area, for instance, most Americans read the Wall Street Journal. Overseas, their counterparts read the Journal as well as the Financial Times of London and The Economist, publications not often read in this country. Perhaps the PR industry might take a lesson from Ted Turner of CNN (Cable News Network). Turner recently announced that the word \\"foreign\\" would no longer be used on CNN news broadcasts. According to Turner, global communications have made the nations of the world so interdependent that there is no longer any such thing as foreign. It could be inferred that the author of the passage is  _  . A) an American B) a Briton C) Ted Turner D) an Asian A:","output":"To answer this question, let's analyze the given information: - The passage discusses the rise of global PR and mentions that America's influence in public relations is being threatened. - The passage states that Americans are lagging behind in global PR due to reasons such as being more focused on local affairs, not knowing a second language, and not keeping an eye on international affairs. - The passage doesn't provide any personal opinion or indication of the author's nationality directly. Given this information, it is not possible to accurately determine the author's nationality.

Write a title for this article: Tuesday, September 21st 2010, 4:00 AM The Bronx congregation that lost its bishop along with the bishop's wife and four other members in an out-of-town traffic accident was consoled last night by one person who can fully understand its loss. David Wright's church in Brooklyn lost its own spiritual leader and the leader's wife in an out-of-town accident two years ago. His grief was all the more searing because the victims were also his father and mother. The third fatality was his 14-year-old nephew. \\"I know what those people are feeling right now,\\" Wright said before his visit. One marked difference between the two tragedies was that the Rev. Timothy Wright of the Grace Tabernacle Christian Center initially survived after a drunken driver drove into his car, killing his wife and grandson. The elder Wright was paralyzed, and among those who reached out to offer comfort and counsel was the family of the late actor Christopher Reeve, who had been consigned to a wheelchair by a horse-riding accident. \\"He used to be Superman,\\" David Wright noted. The son would not forget the super strength the Reeve family gave him and his family over the nine months before the elder Wright succumbed to his injures. \\"To have somebody step forward who knows. ...\\" David Wright said. After hearing of last week's tragedy at the Joy Fellowship Christian Assemblies, Wright resolved to bring them the comfort of somebody who knows. \\"It brought back memories of my mom and my dad's accident,\\" he said Monday. He also would be going as his father's 32-year-old successor as pastor of their Brooklyn church. The Rev. David Wright was heartened to see news reports of a service at the Bronx church. The faithful there were still able to praise and even thank the Almighty. \\"That's exactly what they need to do now,\\" he said. \\"That's the same thing that got us through. Their faith in God is what's going to get them through.\\" He knows all too well that keeping your faith can become a struggle when you are struck by ungodly tragedy. \\"Why do bad things happen to good people? That's the big question,\\" he said. \\"My mom and my dad, they never did any wrong to anybody.\\" The same is being said about Bishop Simon White and his wife, Zelda White, in the Bronx. The big question looms as large there as it did in Brooklyn. Yet heartbreak and hardship are what gave rise to faith in the first place, what have kept it going even while presenting it with a perpetual challenge. \\"If everything was peachy cream every day, there would be no need for faith,\\" Wright said. \\"When you go through hard times is when you need faith.\\" Without it, hard times just get even harder. \\"If you lose your faith, it just destroys you in the inside,\\" Wright said. \\"As long as you keep your faith, you know you'll be okay.\\" Wright was traveling from his church to the Bronx to offer proof that faith can indeed prevail. His father's Grammy-nominated choir is about to release a new CD. The Grace Tabernacle itself is thriving. The older members are adjusting to having the son as a pastor after two decades with the father. \\"It took a little bit of getting used to,\\" Wright said. \\"You actually watched your pastor grow up. People that used to baby-sit me, now I'm leading them spiritually.\\" He hoped his presence at Monday night's prayer meeting would bring the congregation hope. \\"Just let them know there is somebody there that went through that,\\" he said. \\"If I got through it, then they can.\\" When his turn came to speak, his words were as simple as his message. \\"God never says 'Oops,'\\" he told the packed church. \\"God would not have allowed this to happen if we could not handle it.\\" Title:","output":"United by Faith: Spiritual Leaders' Families Offer Comfort and Hope Amid Tragedy"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
