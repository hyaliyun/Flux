Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers.

The party turned for home after 73 days' southward travel. Rations had been cut several times to extend the return journey time beyond the original 110-day estimate. Shackleton now aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days, since according to Shackleton's prior orders Nimrod, having returned to take the expedition home, would depart on 1 March at the latest. The four men were now much weakened, yet in the following days they achieved impressive distances, reaching the head of the glacier on 19 January. As they began the descent they had five days' food at half rations, to last them until the Lower Glacier depot; during the ascent the same distance had taken 12 days. Shackleton's physical condition was by now a major concern, yet according to Adams \\"the worse he felt, the harder he pulled\\".The depot was reached on 28 January. Wild, ill with dysentery, was unable to pull or to eat anything but biscuits, which were in short supply. On 31 January Shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on Wild, a gesture that moved Wild to write: \\"BY GOD I shall never forget. Thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit\\". A few days later, the rest of the party were struck with severe enteritis, the result of eating tainted pony-meat. But the pace of march had to be maintained; the small amounts of food carried between depots would make any delay fatal. However, a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on the sledge and maintain a good marching rate. \\"We are so thin that our bones ache as we lie on the hard snow\\", wrote Shackleton. From 18 February onward they began to pick up familiar landmarks, and on the 23rd they reached Bluff Depot, which to their great relief had been copiously resupplied by Ernest Joyce.

She drinks 500 milliliters of water every after 2 hours. After how many hours will she be able to drink a total of 3 liters of water? Give me reasons, before answering the question","output":"To determine how many hours Sandy will take to drink a total of 3 liters of water, we must first convert the given units to the same unit and then find how many 500 milliliters intervals will add up to 3 liters. Step 1: Convert 3 liters to milliliters. 1 liter is equal to 1,000 milliliters, so 3 liters is equal to 3 x 1,000 = 3,000 milliliters. Step 2: Determine how many 500 milliliters intervals are needed to reach 3,000 milliliters. To do this, we will divide 3,000 milliliters by 500 milliliters. 3,000 ÷ 500 = 6 intervals of 500 milliliters each. So, Sandy needs to drink water 6 times in 500 milliliters portions to reach her goal of 3 liters. Step 3: Calculate the number of hours required to reach the goal. Since Sandy drinks 500 milliliters of water every 2 hours, we can calculate the total time by multiplying the number of intervals by the time taken for each interval. 6 intervals × 2 hours = 12 hours. Hence, Sandy will be able to drink a total of 3 liters of water after 12 hours."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question. What is the national animal of the United States?","output":"The national animal of the United States is the American Bison, also popularly known as the American Buffalo. The American Bison (Latin name: Bison bison) was officially declared the national mammal of the United States on May 9, 2016, when President Barack Obama signed the National Bison Legacy Act into law. This legislation was the result of a multi-year campaign by a coalition of various groups including conservationists, ranchers, and tribal groups who recognized the bison's integral role in America's history, economy, and ecology. Historically, the American Bison has held great significance to Native American cultures. It was a source of sustenance and played a metaphysical and religious role in many tribal societies. The American Bison is native to North and South America and Europe. Two subspecies exist: the plains bison (Bison bison bison), smaller in size and with a more rounded hump, and the wood bison (Bison bison athabascae), larger in size and with a taller and square-shaped hump. These majestic animals once roamed North America in vast herds and had a critical role in shaping the vegetation and landscape of the North American prairie. Bison are massive creatures — they can be up to 6 feet tall and weigh between 900 and 2,000 pounds. Indeed, they are the largest mammal in North America. With their shaggy, brown fur, large hump and sharp horns, they are impressive and beautiful creatures. In the 19th century, the American Bison population declined precipitously, due to overhunting and habitat loss. However, precarious as their situation seemed at the time, they have made a slow but noticeable recovery thanks to conservation efforts by both government and non-government organizations. Bison are seen as symbols of strength, endurance and freedom in America, traits that are very much associated with the national identity and character of the United States. While the bald eagle is commonly thought of and recognized as the national symbol of the United States because it serves as the country's national bird and is featured prominently on the nation's Great Seal, it is the majestic American Bison that holds the title of the national mammal and creature of the U.S. In conclusion, the American Bison, an animal that holds historical, cultural, and ecological importance, is the national mammal of the United States of America, symbolizing the strength, resilience, and freedom that the country stands for."},{"instruction":"Washington (CNN) -- The Pacific island nation of Palau has agreed to take in 17 Chinese Muslims held at the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the country's ambassador to the United States said Wednesday.

But Kyota said his country, a former U.S. Pacific trust territory, has agreed to take in the ethnic Uighur detainees \\"for humanitarian reasons\\" and because of the \\"special relationship\\" between Palau and the United States. U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly would not comment on the announcement, telling reporters, \\"We're still involved in ongoing discussions.\\" The agreement includes some U.S. aid for Palau, Kyota said, but he said those details remained to be worked out as well. The country, with a population of about 20,000, is about 1,000 miles southeast of Manila, Philippines, and about 4,600 miles west of Hawaii. Palau has received nearly 900 million in U.S. aid since independence in 1994, according to congressional auditors, and depends on Washington for defense. The \\"Compact of Free Association\\" between Palau and the United States is up for review, but Kelly said any additional aid offer \\"is not linked to any other discussions we may be having with the government of Palau.\\" The Uighurs were accused of receiving weapons and military training in Afghanistan.

Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. Now, I have a new situation: In the ant world a war has been waged. Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity. Answer this question please: In which battle day group A would have more openings in their nest thatch, battle day three or battle day four? Answer:","output":"In this situation, based on the background information provided, Group A would have more openings in their nest thatch on battle day four. The reason being that Acromyrmex heyeri ants are known to create more openings in their nest thatch when the internal nest temperature goes up (between 20-30°C) and close the openings when the air humidity decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. On battle day three, Group A's territory had low air humidity, which would prompt the ants to close the openings in their nest thatch to conserve water. On battle day four, however, Group A's territory had high air humidity which means there would be no need to close the openings to preserve water. Furthermore, considering the high air humidity, battle day two had a 22°C temperature, which falls within the range that could lead ants to create more openings for temperature regulation.

Answer:","output":"Can't answer"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Distance decay is a geographical term which describes the effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions. The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease. With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1] Now, I have a new situation: Two neighboring countries with similar economies, followed different political and economical agendas. Niger developed its infrastructure and communications technology, while Nigeria didn't. Answer this question please: Which country experiences a more noticeable distance decay effect? A:","output":"Based on the background information provided, Nigeria would likely experience a more noticeable distance decay effect compared to Niger due to its lack of development in infrastructure and communications technology. Distance decay is essentially the diminishing of social, cultural or economic interactions due to increasing physical or metaphorical distance. The rate of decay is not merely dependent on geographical separation, but it is also significantly impacted by the ease of transportation and communication - in other words, how \\"connected\\" one place is to another. One of the strategies used to mitigate the impact of distance decay is through the development of infrastructure, such as roads, railways, airports, internet connectivity, etc., which facilitates the movement of people, goods, services and information. In this case, Niger has taken steps to develop its infrastructure and communications technology, hence increasing its \\"connectedness\\" with other locales, even those that are geographically distant. On the other hand, Nigeria, by not keeping up with similar infrastructure and technology enhancements, is more likely to suffer a higher impact of distance decay. Without modern infrastructure and quick communication technologies, it becomes more challenging for Nigeria to maintain strong interactions with locales that are farther away, and even with those that are closer by, if compared to Niger. Walkable distances in Nigeria might effectively become much larger because, for example, poor road conditions could increase the time and effort it takes to travel. Even though the two countries are geographically adjacent and have similar economies, the political and economical decisions that drive infrastructure and technological developments can notably affect the degree to which distance decay is experienced. In conclusion, the lack of development in infrastructure and communications technology in Nigeria means that it would likely experience a more noticeable distance decay effect compared to Niger. Furthermore, this could also have broader implications. For instance, the higher distance decay effect in Nigeria might contribute to slower economic growth, as the flow of goods, services, and information – vital elements of a thriving economy – may be hindered. Thus, it underlines how crucial infrastructural and technological developments are for economic, social, and cultural connectivity in the modern world."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you're given the title of a story consisting of five sentences, numbered 1 through 5.

He has served as Prime Minister since 1985, making him the longest serving head of government of Cambodia, and one of the longest serving leaders in the world. From 1979 to 1986 and again from 1987 to 1990, Hun Sen served as Cambodia's foreign minister. His full honorary title is Samdech Akeak Moha Sena Padey Techo Hun Sen (meaning \\"Lord Prime Minister, Supreme Military Commander Hun Sen\\"). Born Hun Bunal, he changed his name to Hun Sen in 1972 two years after joining the Khmer Rouge. - FUNCINPEC is a royalist political party in Cambodia. Founded in 1981 by Norodom Sihanouk, it started off as a resistance movement against the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) government. In 1982, it formed a resistance pact, the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK), together with the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) and the Khmer Rouge. It was one of the signatory parties of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords, which paved the way for the formation of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). In 1992, FUNCINPEC became a political party and participated in the 1993 general elections organised by UNTAC. It won the elections, and formed a coalition government with the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), with which it jointly headed. Norodom Ranariddh, Sihanouk's son who had succeeded him as the party president, became First Prime Minister while Hun Sen, who was from the CPP, became Second Prime Minister. - Barack Hussein Obama II (; born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. He was the first African American to serve as president, as well as the first born outside the contiguous United States. He previously served in the U.S. Senate representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008, and in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 to 2004. - The incumbent is the current holder of a political office. This term is usually used in reference to elections, in which races can often be defined as being between an incumbent and non-incumbent(s). For example, in the 2012 United States presidential election, Barack Obama was the incumbent, because he had been the president in the previous term while the election sought to determine the president for the current term. A race without an incumbent is referred to as an open seat. - Norodom Ranariddh (born 2 January 1944) is a Cambodian prince, politician and law academic. He is the second son of Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia and a half-brother of the current king, Norodom Sihamoni. Ranariddh is the president of FUNCINPEC, a Cambodian royalist party. He was also the First Prime Minister of Cambodia, serving between 1993 and 1997, and subsequently as the President of the National Assembly between 1998 and 2006. - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country. - General elections were held in Cambodia on 27 July 2003 to elect members of the National Assembly . The election was won by the incumbent Prime Minister Hun Sen 's Cambodian People 's Party , who claimed a majority of 73 seats in the 123 - seat parliament . However , due to the requirement for a two - thirds majority to elect a Prime Minister , a new government was not formed until July 2004 when a deal was reached with the Funcinpec party . - A prime minister is the most senior minister of cabinet in the executive branch of government, often in a parliamentary or semi-presidential system. In many systems, the prime minister selects and may dismiss other members of the cabinet, and allocates posts to members within the government. In most systems, the prime minister is the presiding member and chairman of the cabinet. In a minority of systems, notably in semi-presidential systems of government, a prime minister is the official who is appointed to manage the civil service and execute the directives of the head of state. In parliamentary systems fashioned after the Westminster system, the prime minister is the presiding and actual head of government and head of the executive branch. In such systems, the head of state or the head of state's official representative (i.e. the monarch, president, or governor-general) usually holds a largely ceremonial position, although often with reserve powers. - The Prime Minister of Cambodia is the head of government of Cambodia. The prime minister is also the chairman of the Cabinet and leads the executive branch of the Royal Cambodian Government. The prime minister is required to be a member of parliament, and is appointed by the monarch for a term of five years. Since 1945, there have been 36 prime ministers. - Norodom Sihanouk (31 October 192215 October 2012) was the King of Cambodia from 1941 to 1955 and again from 1993 to 2004. Affectionately known to the Cambodian people as Samdech Euv (father prince), Sihanouk became king in 1941. After the Second World War, he campaigned for Cambodia's independence from French rule, which took place in 1953. In 1955, Sihanouk abdicated the throne in favour of his father Norodom Suramarit, and went on to form the political organisation Sangkum. Sihanouk led the Sangkum to victory in the 1955 general elections, and became the Prime Minister of Cambodia. After his father's death in 1960, Sihanouk introduced a constitutional amendment which made him the Head of State of Cambodia, a position which he held until 1970. Between 1955 and 1970, Sihanouk governed Cambodia under one-party rule, and cracked down on political dissent from the Democrat party and Pracheachon. While he was officially neutral in foreign relations, in practice he was friendlier toward communist countries, particularly China, than to the United States and its anti-Communist allies.

An object with more mass is pulled by gravity with greater force. Mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes. On Earth, the force of gravity is the same everywhere. So how does the force of gravity change? It doesnt if you stay on Earth. What if we travel to another planet or moon in our solar system? Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong in the Figure. They were the first humans to walk on the moon. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than he would on Earth. This is because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. If the astronaut weighed 175 pounds on Earth, he would have weighed only 29 pounds on the moon. If his mass on Earth was 80 kg, what would his mass have been on the moon? [Figure 3] What question would one ask from this paragraph?","output":"The mass of an object does not change based on its location; mass is an inherent property of matter. However, the weight of an object is determined by the force with which it is attracted towards the center of a massive body, such as a planet or moon, due to gravity. The force of gravity varies between celestial bodies depending on their mass and size. To calculate an object's weight in Newtons, the following formula is used: Weight (N) = Mass (kg) × Acceleration due to gravity (m/s²) On Earth, the average acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.81 m/s². Since your mass is 50 kg, your weight in newtons can be calculated as follows: Weight (N) = 50 kg × 9.81 m/s² = 490.5 N Therefore, on Earth, your weight is approximately 490.5 newtons. Now, considering the astronaut in the scenario provided, his weight changes when he is on the moon due to the difference in gravitational force. The moon's gravitational force is about 1/6th that of Earth's gravity. However, his mass remains the same at 80 kg, whether he is on Earth or the moon. A suitable question that could be asked from the paragraph is: What would be the astronaut's weight in newtons on the moon, given that his mass is 80 kg and the moon's gravity is about 1/6th that of Earth's gravity? To answer this question, we first need to determine the acceleration due to gravity on the moon. Since the moon's gravity is 1/6th that of Earth's gravity, the acceleration due to gravity on the moon is: Moon's gravity (m/s²) = (1/6) × Earth's gravity = (1/6) × 9.81 m/s² ≈ 1.63 m/s² Next, we can calculate the astronaut's weight in newtons on the moon using the same formula as before: Weight (N) = Mass (kg) × Acceleration due to gravity (m/s²) Weight (N) = 80 kg × 1.63 m/s² ≈ 130.4 N Thus, the astronaut's weight on the moon would be approximately 130.4 newtons."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes . Paragraph: Mike is a biochemist, working for a science lab. Today, he has two organisms to investigate, organism A and organism B. He notices that organism A has enzymes, but organism B lacks enzymes. He needs to figure out how these conditions would affect the organisms. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Under normal conditions, in which organism the chemical reactions would be more plausible, organism A or organism B? The answer is:","output":"Organism A. Under normal conditions, chemical reactions are more plausible in organism A as it possesses enzymes that act as catalysts. Enzymes are essential in living organisms, as they allow biochemical reactions to occur at a faster rate than would be possible without them. These reactions are critical for carrying out various life processes, such as metabolism, energy production, and cellular repair. Organism A, with its enzymes, can significantly increase the rate of chemical reactions within its cells. The presence of enzymes allows reactions to occur at the lower temperatures and concentrations typically found within cells, ensuring that various life processes can proceed efficiently. On the other hand, organism B lacks enzymes, which puts it at a significant disadvantage compared to organism A. Without enzymes, the chemical reactions within organism B will proceed at a much slower rate, as they are not catalyzed. This means that most of the reactions are unlikely to happen quickly enough to support the life processes in organism B, making it less viable under normal conditions. In summary, organism A has a better chance of sustaining life due to the presence of enzymes, which enable the chemical reactions necessary for life to occur at an adequate pace. Organism B, lacking enzymes, will struggle to maintain these reactions at a sufficient rate, making it less plausible that it can survive and thrive under normal conditions."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following movie (choose your answer from the options) review sentence? \` red shoe diaries Pick from: [I] negative.

ATHENS — Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets in Greece on Tuesday, unfurling banners over the Acropolis to rail against new austerity measures aimed at helping the debt-ridden country stave off economic disaster. Investors took fright across Europe and on Wall Street, sending the euro to a fresh one-year low. A leading indicator of European blue-chip stocks was off more than 3 percent by the end of the day, while the Dow Jones industrial average was down 2 percent in afternoon trading amid persistent worries that Europe's debt crisis would spread. At a news conference in Brussels, the Spanish prime minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, rejected the idea that his country - which is headed into a second year of recession with a soaring budget deficit and an unemployment rate of 20 percent - might also require a Greek-style bailout. ''That's something I would not give any credit to,'' Mr. Zapatero said. ''It is complete madness.'' But markets did not seem reassured. In Madrid, the IBEX 35 index fell 5.4 percent to close at 9,859.10 points. In Athens, the Athex composite index plunged 6.7 percent to 1,729.68. And in Portugal, whose fiscal position is also regarded as precarious, the PSI general index slid 3.8 percent to 2,485.43. ''There is a still a feeling of nervousness around the Greece rescue package and problems in the peripheral economies,'' Giles Watts, head of trading at City Index, told Reuters. Earlier in the day, dozens of protesters from the Communist Party broke the locks at the entrance to the Acropolis, the country's most famous tourist attraction, and hung banners saying: ''Peoples of Europe - Rise Up.'' The Socialist government of Prime Minister George Papandreou on Sunday announced belt-tightening measures intended to save ¤30 billion, or 39 billion, over the next three years. The plan is part of an effort to clear the way for a ¤110 billion rescue package from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund aimed at preventing the country from defaulting on its debt. The measures, including freezes in public sector salaries, cuts in pensions and higher sales taxes, amount to a cultural revolution in the social contract between state and citizen. Public sector workers, including teachers and hospital employees, began striking Tuesday. A nationwide general strike planned for Wednesday aims to bring services like public transport to a halt across the country. Some analysts said the strikes could mark the beginning of a long hot summer of social unrest that threatened to unhinge desperately needed economic changes and could undermine the country's recovery by stifling growth. But thus far the demonstrations have been largely peaceful and muted by Greek standards, suggesting that a majority of Greeks are resigned to the fact that there is little choice other than to wait and endure David Jolly reported from Paris.

In recent years, scientists and researchers have been observing an alarming decline in the global bee population. Bees play a crucial role in agriculture as they are the primary means of pollination for many of the world's food crops. Pollination is essential for plant reproduction, including the growth of fruits and vegetables that humans consume. Thus, the continuous decline of the bee population poses a significant threat to global food production, and it may lead to higher food prices and shortages in the future. Various factors have been identified as potential causes of this decline, including habitat loss, pesticides, climate change, and disease. Although some governments and organizations have introduced measures to protect bee populations, there is still much more work to be done. In addition, numerous questions still persist – particularly in understanding the specific reasons behind the decline, as well as the extent of their combined impact on global agriculture. Hypothesis: The use of neonicotinoid pesticides is a leading contributor to the decline in bee populations, and implementing stricter regulations on the use of these pesticides will significantly contribute to the recovery of bee populations. Various studies have identified neonicotinoids, a class of neuro-active insecticides, as a major factor contributing to the decline in bee populations. Neonicotinoids are systemic pesticides, which means that they are absorbed by the plant and are present in all its tissues, including nectar and pollen. Consequently, when bees come into contact with these substances, it can lead to negative effects, such as disorientation, impaired memory, reduced fertility, and sometimes even death. To test this hypothesis, researchers could conduct several experiments. One approach would be to perform controlled studies on bee colonies in different agricultural settings, where one set of colonies would be exposed to neonicotinoids, while a second set of colonies would be exposed to alternative pesticides or no pesticides at all. By comparing the health and survival rates of these colonies over time, researchers can determine the extent to which neonicotinoids affect the bee population. A second approach that could provide further confirmation of this hypothesis would be to monitor changes in bee populations in regions where neonicotinoid regulations have been strictly enforced. If a significant increase in the bee population is observed in these areas after the implementation of these regulations, this would indicate a strong correlation between neonicotinoid usage and bee population decline. If the hypothesis is proven to be accurate, then further steps can be taken to reduce or eliminate the use of neonicotinoid pesticides in agriculture. This could involve developing alternative, less harmful pesticides or promoting integrated pest management strategies that minimize the need for chemical pesticides. By taking these measures, it is predicted that the decline in the bee population would slow or even reverse, thereby safeguarding the future of global food production."},{"instruction":"What is a question about this article?

I read these big three books.","output":"The sentence \\"I read these big three books\\" is linguistically acceptable, but it may feel slightly awkward due to the order of the adjectives. To evaluate the acceptability of the sentence, let's look at it in terms of grammar, syntax, and adherence to the conventions of adjective order. 1. Grammar: The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ('I'), verb ('read'), and object ('these big three books'), and all the elements are appropriately conjugated and agree in tense and number. 2. Syntax: The syntax of the sentence is also correct. The word order is logical and clear for English readers, with the subject before the verb and the object after it. 3. Adjective order: The only point of contention in the sentence might be the order of the adjectives ('big' and 'three'). In English, there is a general convention that dictates the order of adjectives when modifying a noun. The typical order is as follows: a. Quantity or number b. Quality or opinion c. Size d. Age e. Shape f. Color g. Proper adjective (i.e., nationality, origin, or material) h. Purpose or qualifier According to this convention, the numeral adjective ('three') should come before the size adjective ('big'). Therefore, a more conventional way of phrasing the sentence would be: \\"I read these three big books.\\" While the sentence \\"I read these big three books\\" may feel a bit awkward to some native English speakers, it is still linguistically acceptable, as it is grammatically and syntactically correct. The unconventional ordering of the adjectives may simply draw attention from the overall meaning. However, following the general adjective order convention will likely make the sentence more pleasing to the ear and easier to understand for most readers."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.

'' He is the author of the 1992 book Death by Chocolate . - A kitchen is a room or part of a room used for cooking and food preparation in a dwelling or in a commercial establishment. In the West, a modern residential kitchen is typically equipped with a stove, a sink with hot and cold running water, a refrigerator, counters and kitchen cabinets arranged according to a modular design. Many households have a microwave oven, a dishwasher and other electric appliances. The main function of a kitchen is serving as a location for storing, cooking and preparing food (and doing related tasks such as dishwashing), but it may also be used for dining, entertaining and laundry. - A chef is a highly trained and skilled professional cook who is proficient in all aspects of food preparation of a particular cuisine. The word \\"chef\\" is derived (and shortened) from the term \\"chef de cuisine\\", the director or head of a kitchen. Chefs can receive both formal training from an institution, as well as through apprenticeship with an experienced chef. - Emeritus, in its current usage, is an adjective used to designate a retired professor, pastor, bishop, pope, president, prime minister, or other person. - Williamsburg is an independent city in the U.S. state of Virginia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 14,068. In 2014, the population was estimated to be 14,691. - Death by Chocolate is a colloquial descriptive or marketing term for various desserts that feature chocolate (especially dark chocolate or cocoa) as the primary ingredient. Some chocolate cakes are called Death by Chocolate cakes. Bennigan's restaurants have purveyed a dessert by the name that used several chocolate-based ingredients, and also purveyed a Death by Chocolate Martini cocktail. The phrase has been trademarked. Various Death by Chocolate-themed and -named events have occurred. - Professor (commonly abbreviated as \\"prof.\\") is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries. Literally, \\"professor\\" derives from Latin as a \\"person who professes\\" being usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of the highest rank. - A cuisine (; from French , in turn from Latin \\"coquere\\" \\"to cook\\") is a style of cooking characterized by distinctive ingredients, techniques and dishes, and usually associated with a specific culture or geographic region. A cuisine is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade. Religious food laws, such as Hindu, Islamic and Jewish dietary laws, can also exercise a strong influence on cuisine. Regional food preparation traditions, customs and ingredients often combine to create dishes unique to a particular region. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - A president is the leader of a country or a division or part of a country, typically a republic, a democracy, or a dictatorship. The title \\"president\\" is sometimes used by extension for leaders of other groups, including corporate entities and social groups. - A prime minister is the most senior minister of cabinet in the executive branch of government, often in a parliamentary or semi-presidential system. In many systems, the prime minister selects and may dismiss other members of the cabinet, and allocates posts to members within the government. In most systems, the prime minister is the presiding member and chairman of the cabinet. In a minority of systems, notably in semi-presidential systems of government, a prime minister is the official who is appointed to manage the civil service and execute the directives of the head of state. In parliamentary systems fashioned after the Westminster system, the prime minister is the presiding and actual head of government and head of the executive branch. In such systems, the head of state or the head of state's official representative (i.e. the monarch, president, or governor-general) usually holds a largely ceremonial position, although often with reserve powers. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - Bennigan's is an Irish pub-themed casual dining restaurant chain founded in 1976 in Atlanta by restaurateur Norman E. Brinker as one of America's original casual dining concepts. The chain operated under the restaurant division of Pillsbury for most of its history, until Pillsbury was bought out by British liquor conglomerate Grand Metropolitan Known. Due to laws preventing liquor manufacturers from operating liquor sellers, the chain was sold to Texas-based Metromedia restaurants, until the company filed for bankruptcy in 2008. The chain then went through a series of restructuring and ownership changes until it was purchased by Legendary Restaurant Brands, LLC in 2015. It is now operating out of Dallas, Texas.

Please do chain-of-thought reasoning. Which of the following sentences is nonsensical? Options: - Sentence A: \\"Mouse is made of plastic\\" - Sentence B: \\"Mouse is made of rubber\\"","output":"To determine which of the two sentences is nonsensical, let's analyze the meaning and context of each sentence. Sentence A: \\"Mouse is made of plastic\\" This sentence implies that a mouse is made of plastic material. There are two possible interpretations of \\"mouse\\": 1. A computer mouse: A computer mouse can be made of plastic materials. Therefore, in this context, the sentence makes sense. 2. A living rodent: If \\"mouse\\" refers to a small mammal, then this sentence is incorrect as mice are living organisms and not made of plastic. Sentence B: \\"Mouse is made of rubber\\" Similar to Sentence A, there are two possible interpretations of \\"mouse\\": 1. A computer mouse: Although a computer mouse is typically not made of rubber, some parts may contain rubber. A computer mouse can also come in various designs made from different materials, including rubber. In this context, the sentence is less common but still plausible. 2. A living rodent: If \\"mouse\\" refers to a small mammal, then this sentence is nonsensical as mice are living organisms and not made of rubber. Upon analysis, we can conclude that: - Both sentences are nonsensical if \\"mouse\\" refers to a living rodent, as neither living rodents nor their biological elements are made of plastic or rubber. - Both sentences make sense if \\"mouse\\" refers to a computer mouse, although a rubber-made computer mouse is less common.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"Translation: Support for exception handling when working with Interbase and Firebird through ADODB. In the context of working with Interbase and Firebird databases through ActiveX Data Objects DataBase (ADODB) in software development, it is crucial to ensure a robust exception handling mechanism. This will allow the application to manage errors effectively and provide a smooth user experience. Interbase and Firebird are relational databases that provide advanced features such as support for transactions, stored procedures, and triggers, which helps developers create reliable and scalable applications. ADODB is an interface that allows a client to manipulate and retrieve data from databases like Interbase and Firebird. Exception handling plays a crucial role in facilitating fault-tolerant applications, as it ensures that errors are caught and dealt with appropriately, rather than leading to program crashes or incorrect output. To implement exception handling when working with Interbase and Firebird through ADODB, the following key aspects should be considered: 1. Wrapping code blocks in Try-Catch-Finally statements: Protect critical sections of your code that interact with ADODB using try-catch-finally statements. This will allow the application to catch database-related errors and handle them gracefully without crashing. 2. Inspecting and logging errors: When an exception is caught in a catch block, it's essential to inspect the error object and log relevant information. This information can be used for debugging and support purposes. 3. Managing transactions: Since Interbase and Firebird support transactions, it is necessary to handle exceptions within transactions appropriately. If an error occurs, the transaction should be rolled back to the previous state, and an error message should be displayed to the user. 4. Implementing custom error handling: Once exceptions have been caught and logged, you could choose to display a user-friendly error message or perform an action (such as retrying the operation). This helps maintain a positive user experience throughout the interaction with the application. 5. Monitoring resource usage: Ensure that all database resources like connections and command objects are properly closed and disposed of after use to prevent memory leaks and resource exhaustion. When using ADODB to interact with Interbase or Firebird databases, follow the mentioned best practices to make your application robust and responsive in the face of possible errors and provide a better experience to your users."},{"instruction":"Write a b. tweet.

After the British took over the native's land by force and spread a variety of unseen diseases to the people, tt was apparently sold by the Neponset leader Chickatabot to William Pynchon in the late 1620s. In 1633, however, Chickatabot died in a smallpox epidemic that decimated nearby Neponset, Narragansett and Pequot communities. Because Chickatabot and Pynchon's deal left no written deed, the Massachusetts General Court ordered \\"those Indians who were present when Chickatabot sold lands to Mr. Pynchon, or who know where they were, to set out the bounds thereof\\". Fifty years later, Chickatabot's grandson Josias Wampatuck brought a land claim against Medfield and the other towns created within the borders of the Chickatabot purchase, for which he received payment. Of those lands, Dedham was the first town formed. Dedham was incorporated in 1636, and Medfield was first settled in 1649, principally by people who relocated from the former town. The first 13 house lots were laid out on June 19, 1650. In May 1651, the town was incorporated by an act of the General Court as the 43rd town in Massachusetts. The Rev. Ralph Wheelock is credited with the founding of Medfield. He was the first schoolmaster of the town's school established in 1655, and now has an elementary school named after him. Question: What did the British do to the natives? Answer:","output":"The British did some not-so-nice things to the native people when they came to the land where Medfield is now.

Her laughter subsides as she takes in my appearance, considering the fact that I had just emerged from what was supposed to be a simple shower. Her eyes widen, and she quickly bites her lip, trying to suppress another burst of laughter. \\"I'm sorry,\\" she says, still chuckling, \\"I didn't mean to make fun of you.

In spite of my annoyance, a small smile tugs at my lips. \\"Well, I suppose being compared to a cute, wet puppy isn't the worst fate in the world,\\" I say, with a sigh. Her laughter turns into a genuine smile, the warmth in her eyes melting away the last of my embarrassment. She reaches out to take the towel from me, and tenderly dries my hair, her touch gentle and soft. \\"You should be more careful next time, sleepyhead,\\" she chides me with a mixture of affection and concern. \\"You could catch a cold, or worse, slip and hurt yourself.\\" I nod, acknowledging the truth in her words. \\"I promise, I'll be more careful next time,\\" I say, my gratitude for her understanding and kindness lending gravity to my voice. She gives me a soft pat on the cheek, and then returns to drying my hair, each stroke releasing the tension that has built up inside of me. After a few more moments, she steps back, critically examining her handiwork. I glance at myself in the mirror, noticing how my damp appearance has been transformed into a somewhat presentable state. \\"There, all better,\\" she announces, satisfied with her efforts. As I continue to take in my reflection, a wave of warmth washes over me – not just from being dried off, but from the realization that loved ones can find humor during our weakest moments, and still be there to pick us up when we stumble. In that instant, I understand the value of such relationships, and I am grateful for her presence in my life. Feeling a surge of affection, I take her hand in mine, giving it a light squeeze. \\"Thank you,\\" I whisper, my eyes meeting hers in a tender gaze. We may laugh at each other's shortcomings, and poke fun at one another's vulnerability, but beneath all the teasing lies a bond of love, understanding, and mutual support that will continue to grow, no matter what challenges life throws our way. And as I stand there, hand in hand with my dearest friend, I can't help but think that with her by my side, everything will be alright."},{"instruction":"The East Asia/Pacific region has reached its goals on nutrition, in part due to the improvements contributed by China, the region’s most populous country.

South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city. - Communication (from Latin \\"commnicre\\", meaning \\"to share\\") is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules. - Classic rock is a radio format which developed from the album-oriented rock (AOR) format in the early 1980s. In the United States, the classic rock format features music ranging generally from the late 1960s to the late 1980s, primarily focusing on commercially successful hard rock popularized in the 1970s. The radio format became increasingly popular with the baby boomer demographic by the end of the 1990s. - Album-oriented rock (abbreviated AOR) is an American FM radio format focusing on album tracks by rock artists. AOR evolved from progressive rock radio in the mid-1970s, using research and formal programming to create an album rock format with greater commercial appeal. - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - A radio format or programming format (not to be confused with broadcast programming) describes the overall content broadcast on a radio station. Radio formats are frequently employed as a marketing tool, and are subject to frequent change. Music radio, old time radio, all-news radio, sports radio, talk radio and weather radio describe the operation of different genres of radio format and each format can often be sub-divided into many specialty formats. - Public broadcasting includes radio, television and other electronic media outlets whose primary mission is public service. In much of the world, funding comes from the government, especially via annual fees charged on receivers. In the United States, public broadcasters may receive some funding from both federal and state sources, but generally most financial support comes from underwriting by foundations and businesses ranging from small shops to corporations, along with audience contributions via pledge drives. The great majority are operated as private not-for-profit corporations. - The radio spectrum is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum from 3 Hz to 3000 GHz (3 THz). Electromagnetic waves in this frequency range, called radio waves, are extremely widely used in modern technology, particularly in telecommunication. To prevent interference between different users, the generation and transmission of radio waves is strictly regulated by national laws, coordinated by an international body, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). - A fee is the price one pays as remuneration for rights or services. Fees usually allow for overhead, wages, costs, and markup. - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent agency of the United States government, created by Congressional statute (see and ) to regulate interstate communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. The FCC works towards six goals in the areas of broadband, competition, the spectrum, the media, public safety and homeland security, and modernizing itself. - A radio station is a set of equipment necessary to carry on communication via radio waves. Generally, it is a receiver or transmitter, an antenna, and some smaller additional equipment necessary to operate them. Radio stations play a vital role in communication technology as they are heavily relied on to transfer data and information across the world. - A broadcast license is a type of spectrum license granting the licensee permission to use a portion of the radio frequency spectrum in a given geographical area for broadcasting purposes.

It is the tribal headquarters of the Oglala Sioux Tribe on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. - A census-designated place (CDP) is a concentration of population defined by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes only. CDPs have been used in each decennial census since 1980 as the counterparts of incorporated places, such as cities, towns, and villages for the purposes of gathering and correlating statistical data. CDPs are populated areas that generally include one officially designated but currently unincorporated small community, for which the CDP is named, plus surrounding inhabited countryside of varying dimensions and, occasionally, other, smaller unincorporated communities as well. CDPs include small rural communities, colonias located along the U.S. border with Mexico, and unincorporated resort and retirement communities and their environs. - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - The term non-commercial educational (NCE) applies to a radio station or TV station that does not accept on-air advertisements (TV ads or radio ads), as defined in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). NCE stations do not pay broadcast license fees for their non-profit uses of the radio spectrum. Stations which are almost always operated as NCE include public broadcasting, community radio, and college radio, as well as many religious broadcasting stations. - The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation (Wazí Aháha Oyáke in Lakota, also called Pine Ridge Agency) is an Oglala Lakota Native American reservation located in the U.S. state of South Dakota.

The answer to this complex question is a simple one: education. While it is widely accepted that there is no one solution to lift the millions across our globe out of poverty, it is also equally accepted that a key cornerstone of addressing some of the world's most pressing challenges is through providing a quality education to all children, especially girls. Despite increasing numbers attending school in recent years, 126 million children remain out of primary school and lower secondary school around the world. Some 65 million of these children are girls. The highest rate of girls not in school is across the African continent, where in sub-Saharan Africa nearly four out of five poor rural girls are not completing primary school. There are an estimated 250 million children worldwide of primary school age who can't read, write or do basic math -- more than half of whom have completed four years of schooling. It is unacceptable that in 2014 -- less than a year away from the deadline the international community agreed to get all children into school -- that 30 million girls in Africa are denied their basic human right to a quality education. Ensuring that every child goes to school, stays in school and learns something of value while there will require firm commitments and action by governments to invest in education and prioritize the education of its girls. Africa's economy has grown at more than 5% annually over the past decade -- some of the highest economic growth in the world -- leading many to use the phrase of \\"Africa Rising\\" when describing its countries. However, a country's economic growth does not always lead to development or improvement for its poorest citizens. To truly rise as a nation by building an equitable, sustainable and peaceful society, governments must ensure that spending on education is prioritized and used well. According to recent research, the estimated economic gain from achieving universal primary education exceeds the estimated increase in public spending required to achieve it. One extra year of schooling can increase an individual's earnings by 10%. Girls who complete a primary education are likely to increase their earnings by 5 to 15% over their lifetimes. Each additional year of schooling could raise average annual gross domestic product growth by 0.37%. If all women had a primary education, child marriages and child mortality could fall by a sixth, and maternal deaths by two-thirds. Investing in girls' education could boost sub-Saharan Africa's agricultural output by up to 25%. Some countries lose more than 1 billion a year by failing to educate girls to the same level as boys. Without education, how can a country's future citizens take part in growing their economy and reap benefits? Without education how can a country grow? More from African Voices. It is however, not good enough to only increase the number of children receiving education. Children and young people must learn basic knowledge, skills and competencies, such as reading, writing, critical thinking, problem solving and math, that are needed to live healthy, safe and productive lives. In Liberia, across the African continent and, indeed, around the world, it is becoming increasingly apparent that going to school is not the same as learning. This is of grave concern given that many of the social and economic returns from an education are found to come from learning outcomes rather than number of years in school. To accomplish this, more financial resources that are better spent are needed to build a strong education system capable of improving both access and learning for all. But making informed decisions about those resources requires good data. Information on teachers, how to best support them to do their jobs, and information on how students are learning are crucial for knowing what policies and programs will be effective. By using our resources more effectively and focusing them on those children that are currently left behind, we can have some of the best educated citizens in the world -- citizens who will be responsible for building a peaceful and prosperous future. At current rates, the poorest girls in sub-Saharan Africa will only achieve universal primary completion in 2086. To not invest in and prioritize girls' education, we as African leaders are telling our women that we do not care about you and your child's future. As one of those women, I will not accept this and I urge all our leaders to invest in our children's future. Investing in girls' education is not only a moral imperative, it is a smart investment. On the 16th of June, the Day of the African Child, young people from across Africa will stand at the African Union Headquarters in Addis Abba, Ethiopia, and across Africa, to call on their governments to dedicate more resources -- the recommended 20% of national budgets -- to education and develop strong and transparent monitoring systems to track effectiveness and impact. Better information on learning outcomes and public spending is key to achieving our goals. These young people want a brighter reality and they demand that their governments stand up to meet their responsibilities and commitments, in order to build a future for their children, a future for their country. When nearly 60 developing countries come together in Brussels at the end of June, as part of the Global Partnership for Education, they will be asked to commit to increase education spending. If they do, we will know if they have listened to these young people, and then the phrase, \\"Africa Rising,\\" can be used in all truthfulness. Plan International's Because I Am A Girl campaign announces its #10DaysToAct initiative, beginning on June 16 at the African Union meeting in Addis Ababa. Read this: Africa is rising, but for whom?

IBM, or International Business Machines Corporation, is a leading multinational technology and consulting firm headquartered in Armonk, New York. With a rich history spanning over a century, IBM has developed and marketed a wide range of innovative products and services, contributing significantly to the modernization of the global technological landscape. IBM's origins date back to the early 20th century when three independent companies – the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR), the International Time Recording Company (ITR), and the Tabulating Machine Company (TMC), were merged to form the CTR in 1911. CTR's early focus was on producing and selling a range of machinery, including time recorders, punched card equipment, tabulators, and automated scales. Charles Ranlett Flint, the founder, played a crucial role in uniting these companies. In 1914, Thomas J. Watson Sr. was appointed as General Manager and later promoted to President of CTR. Under Watson's leadership, the company shifted its focus to developing and selling cutting-edge business machines. Watson established a strong corporate culture, emphasizing superior customer service and a commitment to technological innovation. In 1924, CTR was renamed the International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM – a name that reflected the company's expanded geographical presence and growing ambition. Throughout the 20th century, IBM achieved several important milestones that showcased its technology prowess. Some notable accomplishments include the development of the first electric typewriter in the 1930s, the invention of the Automated Sequence Controlled Calculator (known as the \\"Harvard Mark I\\") during World War II, and the introduction of the IBM 701, its first electronic computer, in the early 1950s.

Despite the widespread objections from the community, authorities remain steadfast in their decision to move forward with these updates, sparking a contentious debate on the balance between preserving the natural environment and accommodating visitors. Parking Charges as a Necessity The local authorities argue that the growing popularity of the beauty spot has led to an increase in visitor traffic, causing significant congestion issues and difficulty for visitors in finding parking spaces. The introduction of paid parking is expected to deter excessive vehicle use and encourage alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit, cycling, and walking. Ultimately, the parking charges aim to reduce the environmental impact caused by the influx of cars and mitigate overcrowding in the area. Furthermore, the revenue generated by the parking charges is said to be allocated towards the improvement and regular upkeep of facilities within the beauty spot. This includes adding additional amenities, enhancing existing infrastructures, and promoting sustainable tourism practices that benefit both visitors and local residents. The local authorities assert that the parking fees will also contribute to administrative costs, such as personnel expenses, security measures, and area maintenance. Residents' Opposition Despite the proposed benefits put forth by the local authorities, many residents have voiced their strong opposition to the parking charges and infrastructural improvements. The primary concerns stem from the fear that these measures will limit access to the beauty spot, especially for lower-income families and elderly individuals who rely on personal vehicles for mobility. The imposition of parking charges is seen as an unfair financial burden for a location that has long served as a communal space for nature and relaxation. Additionally, residents argue that the construction and improvement of facilities may result in disruption of the pristine conditions of the beauty spot, with natural habitats being potentially encroached upon. The delicate balance of the ecosystem could be upset, further exacerbating the environmental issues that the parking charges were originally intended to address. The Local Authorities’ Response In light of the overwhelming opposition from local residents, authorities have attempted to reach a compromise by offering concessionary rates for resident parking permits. This measure is aimed at easing the financial impact of the changes on locals, while still addressing the core concerns of vehicular congestion and maintenance. Nonetheless, many residents remain unconvinced and continue to protest against the implementation of the parking charges, calling for a complete reevaluation of the plans. Navigating the Future As protestors and local authorities debate the merits of parking charges and infrastructural improvements at the beauty spot, the resolution to this issue remains uncertain. Key stakeholders must weigh the underlying motivations of each faction and seek a delicate balance between providing accessible public spaces and preserving the natural environment. Community engagement and well-considered alternatives may be the pathway to a more satisfactory outcome. This might include park-and-ride systems, collaboration with local organizations to create environmental programs, and fostering dialogue to advocate for better public transportation accessibility to the beauty spot. Conclusion The situation regarding the parking charges and facility improvements at the beauty spot serves as a microcosm for the struggle between urban development and the preservation of natural spaces. As more individuals seek outdoor leisure opportunities, maintaining the delicate balance between enjoying these spaces and ensuring their longevity is vital for future generations. Through holistic planning, collaborative stakeholder engagement, and open communication, a successful outcome can be achieved for all those who hold the beauty spot dear."},{"instruction":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The Phantom Thief Kid sends a heist notice, warning of another heist.

The first stable line-up consisted of Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica), Mick Jagger (lead vocals), Keith Richards (guitar, backing vocals), Bill Wyman (bass), Charlie Watts (drums), and Ian Stewart (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985. Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974. Context: Before leaving Atlantic, the Rolling Stones released Undercover (UK 3; US 4) in late 1983. Despite good reviews and the Top Ten peak position of the title track, the record sold below expectations and there was no tour to support it. Subsequently, the Stones' new marketer/distributor CBS Records took over distributing the Stones' Atlantic catalogue. By this time, the Jagger/Richards rift had grown significantly. To Richards' annoyance, Jagger had signed a solo deal with CBS Records, and he spent much of 1984 writing songs for his first album. He also declared his growing lack of interest in the Rolling Stones. By 1985, Jagger was spending more time on solo recordings, and much of the material on 1986's Dirty Work was generated by Richards, with more contributions by Wood than on previous Rolling Stones albums. The album was recorded in Paris, and Jagger was often absent from the studio, leaving Richards to keep the recording sessions moving forward. In June 1985, Jagger teamed up with David Bowie for \\"Dancing in the Street\\", which was recorded as part of the Live Aid charity movement. This was one of Jagger's first solo performances, and the song reached No. 1 in the UK, and No. 7 in the US. In December 1985, Stewart died of a heart attack. The Rolling Stones played a private tribute concert for him at London's 100 Club in February 1986, two days before they were presented with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Dirty Work (UK No. 4; US No. 4) was released in March 1986 to mixed reviews despite the presence of the US Top Five hit \\"Harlem Shuffle\\". With relations between Richards and Jagger at a low, Jagger refused to tour to promote the album, and instead undertook his own solo tour, which included Rolling Stones songs. As a result of the animosity within the band during this period, they almost broke up. Jagger's solo records, She's the Boss (UK 6; US 13) (1985) and Primitive Cool (UK 26; US 41) (1987), met with moderate success, and in 1988, with the Rolling Stones mostly inactive, Richards released his first solo album, Talk Is Cheap (UK 37; US 24). It was well received by fans and critics, going gold in the US. Richards has subsequently referred to this late-80s period, where the two were recording solo albums with no obvious reunion of the Stones in sight, as \\"World War III\\". The following year 25x5: The Continuing Adventures of the Rolling Stones, a documentary spanning the career of the band was released for their 25th anniversary. Question: where there any others?. Whats the answer?","output":"The question seems unclear, but I assume you are asking if there were any other solo projects or issues within the band during the period mentioned. Besides the solo projects of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, which were previously mentioned, there were no other significant solo projects from the Rolling Stones members during that time. The main issue within the band during that period was the growing rift between Jagger and Richards, which almost led to the band breaking up."},{"instruction":"Q: Corn can be used to make ethanol, which is a fuel for some cars.

The statement mentions that Ludwig Ruckdeschel was the Nazi \\"Gauleiter\\" of Bayreuth during the final month of the \\"Gau's\\" existence before the collapse of Nazi Germany in 1945. This suggests that the year 1945 was significant as it marked the end of Nazi Germany's regime. In a broader historical context, Nazi Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, indeed fell in 1945. The country was embroiled in World War II from September 1, 1939, until the surrender of German forces on May 7, 1945. World War II itself lasted until September 2, 1945, with the official surrender of Japan. Throughout the war, Nazi Germany had caused the deaths and suffering of millions of people, including the Holocaust - in which six million Jews were systematically murdered. In addition, other groups, such as Poles, Romani people, and Soviet POWs, were executed, enslaved, or otherwise persecuted under the Nazi regime. During the war's final stages, Allied forces closed in on Germany from both the East and the West. Soviet forces reached Berlin in late April 1945, and Hitler committed suicide in his underground bunker on April 30, 1945. Following his death, Admiral Karl Dönitz became President of the Reich and head of state, effectively serving as Hitler's successor. Dönitz authorized the surrender, and on May 7, 1945, Germany's unconditional surrender was signed. The official surrender took effect on May 8, 1945, now known as Victory in Europe (VE) Day, marking the end of World War II in Europe and the end of Nazi Germany as a regime.

From its source in Hopkinton the river flows in a northeasterly direction (after first coursing due south through Milford), traveling through 23 cities and towns before reaching the Atlantic Ocean at Boston. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states) and powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others). Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but a common timeframe is the period (the second half of the 20th century) between 1947, the year the Truman Doctrine (a U.S. policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism) was announced, and 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed. - Engineers design materials, structures, and systems while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety, and cost. The word \\"engineer (\\"from the Latin \\"ingeniator\\"\\")\\" is derived from the Latin words \\"ingeniare\\" (\\"to contrive, devise\\") and \\"ingenium\\" (\\"cleverness\\"). The foundation education of an engineer is typically a 4-year bachelor's degree or in some countries, a master's degree in an engineering discipline plus 46 years peer-reviewed professional practice culminating in a project report or thesis. Engineers who seek a professional engineer license in N. America will be required to take further exams in ethics, law and professional practice. - Radar is an object-detection system that uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects. It can be used to detect aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and terrain. A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the object(s). Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information about the object's location and speed. Radar was developed secretly for military use by several nations in the period before and during World War II. The term \\"RADAR\\" was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging or RAdio Direction And Ranging. The term \\"radar\\" has since entered English and other languages as a common noun, losing all capitalization. - Michael Stanley Dukakis (born November 3, 1933, Greek: ) is an American politician who served as the 65th and 67th Governor of Massachusetts, from 1975 to 1979 and 1983 to 1991 respectively.

Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. Researchers worked on computers, radar, and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian. The current campus opened in 1916 and extends over along the northern bank of the Charles River basin. - Civil Engineering History of the civil engineering profession. Engineering has been an aspect of life since the beginnings of human existence. The earliest practice of civil engineering may have commenced between 4000 and 2000 BC in ancient Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization, and Mesopotamia (ancient Iraq) when humans started to abandon a nomadic existence, creating a need for the construction of shelter. During this time, transportation became increasingly important leading to the development of the wheel and sailing. - A civil engineer is a person who practices civil engineering the application of planning, designing, constructing, maintaining, and operating infrastructures while protecting the public and environmental health, as well as improving existing infrastructures that have been neglected.

The nucleus of most atoms consists of protons and neutrons. The structure of an atom can be divided into two primary components: the nucleus, located at its center, and the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus. The nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons, whereas the electrons occupy the spatial region surrounding it. Protons are positively charged particles, and neutrons are neutral particles with no charge. The mass of these particles is almost equal, and they are collectively referred to as nucleons. The atomic number (Z) of an element represents the number of protons in an atom's nucleus. The presence of a specific number of protons determines the identity of an element. For example, an atom with one proton is hydrogen, while an atom with six protons is carbon. Neutrons, being neutral, contribute to the mass of an atom but do not affect its chemical properties. The number of neutrons in an atom can vary, resulting in different isotopes of the same element. Isotopes of an element have the same atomic number but different mass numbers since their neutron count differs. The mass number (A) of an element refers to the sum of the total protons and neutrons within an atom's nucleus. Electrons, on the other hand, are negatively charged particles that occupy the space around the nucleus in what is referred to as electron clouds or orbitals. These electrons are responsible for determining an atom's overall chemical properties and play a vital role in chemical bonding. Electrons have a much smaller mass compared to protons and neutrons. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons, thus balancing the overall charge of the atom. In summary, the nucleus of most atoms consists of protons and neutrons (option B), while the electrons surround the nucleus, determining the atom's chemical properties and behavior."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence that contains a fact.","output":"Step 1: Choose a subject for the sentence.

She sold 1/4 of the remaining watermelons today: 72 watermelons * (1/4) = 18 watermelons Step 5: Find out how many watermelons are left to be sold tomorrow. 72 watermelons - 18 watermelons = 54 watermelons So, Alice has 54 watermelons left to be sold tomorrow."},{"instruction":"Q: What tides occur during the new moon and full moon? A: Available options: (I) autumn (II) high (III) bottom (IV) spring Answer:","output":"During the new moon and full moon, the tides that occur are (II) high and (IV) spring tides. High tides are the highest level (peak) that water reaches as the tide rises, while spring tides are the tides with the largest difference between high and low tide levels. Spring tides occur when the gravitational forces of the moon and the sun combine to create a more pronounced tidal effect on Earth's oceans. This happens when the moon is either at its full or new phase, as the sun, moon, and Earth are aligned during these times, which leads to higher high tides and lower low tides, generating the larger tidal range known as spring tides."},{"instruction":"Text: \`\`The Holly and the Ivy'' is a traditional British folk Christmas carol.

(b). yes.","output":"To determine whether \\"The Holly and the Ivy\\" is a hymn, we will consider the characteristics of a hymn and examine the content and purpose of the song. Step 1: Define a hymn A hymn is typically defined as a song of praise to God, often sung by a congregation in a religious setting. Step 2: Examine the content of \\"The Holly and the Ivy\\" The song \\"The Holly and the Ivy\\" is a traditional British Christmas carol featuring various symbols and images associated with the season. While it does have some religious context as many Christmas carols do, its primary focus is on these traditional symbols rather than direct praise to God.

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules.

There are a few reasons for this: 1. Ambiguity and contradictions: The premise presents both belief in the possibility of finding solutions and doubt in their existence. While the statement acknowledges the existence of alternative ways to fix the problem, it also admits that sometimes there might not be any solution. This ambiguity makes it difficult to reach a definitive conclusion about the hypothesis. 2. Scope of the problem: The premise does not provide a specific context or problem that is being addressed. Without clearly defining the problem, it is difficult to determine whether or not there is a way to fix it. Some problems can have multiple solutions, while others may have none. A better understanding of the context and the problem would help in evaluating the hypothesis more accurately. 3. Subjective perspective: The premise seems to be based on the speaker's personal beliefs and experiences rather than objective facts or evidence. Personal opinions and diverse perspectives can lead to differing interpretations of what constitutes a viable solution. It is important to consider objective facts, empirical evidence, and various perspectives when assessing the truthfulness of the hypothesis. 4. Lack of elaboration on alternatives: While the premise suggests the existence of other ways to fix the problem, no further explanation or examples are provided. This makes it challenging to assess the feasibility of these alternative solutions and whether they might serve as evidence in favor of or against the hypothesis. 5. Context-dependent nature of solutions: Whether a problem can be fixed or not often depends on the specific situation, constraints, resources, and other contextual factors at play. Given that the premise does not provide adequate context or information on the problem at hand, it is difficult to determine if the hypothesis holds true universally or just in specific instances. In conclusion, to determine the validity of the hypothesis \\"I don't think there is ever a way to fix it.\\", one would need to examine the context, problem at hand, available evidence, and feasibility of alternative solutions. The given premise is ambiguous, contradictory, and lacking in context, which prevents reaching a definitive conclusion about the truthfulness of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Solar energy Commercial CSP plants were first developed in the 1980s.

Over time, the scale of CSP plants has increased, with projects exceeding 1 GW in development. One prime example is the 354 MW Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) installation in California, which was the largest solar power plant globally when it was built.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods.

In Gigantica, people grew to be different sizes, just like how our pets can be small like a hamster or big like a dog. So, even though Justin was small like a dwarf, he was still very special. One sunny day, Justin and Ian decided to go on an adventure in the magical Gigantica forest. Justin being small had its own advantages like he could fit into tiny spaces. Ian, on the other hand, being tall, could help reach things that were way up high. As they walked through the forest, they saw many beautiful plants and butterflies that were all different colors, just like a rainbow! It was super-duper pretty! They played fun games and discovered new hiding spots since Justin could easily sneak into tiny spaces while Ian could quickly spot him from up high. Then, they came across a hidden cave with sparkly gems and shiny stones. Justin's small size allowed him to squeeze through the narrow entrance, but because Ian was so tall, he had to wait outside. Justin found a glowing crystal and brought it out to show his friend. The crystal had magical powers that brought them good luck, and they shared the wonderful treasure. Justin and Ian's special sizes made their adventure an amazing experience. They learned that being different from each other is what made their friendship so special.

In China, I had English classes five times a week since fifth grade. However, I didn't know how different textbook English could be from everyday English until I came to Hotchkiss School, Connecticut. When I first studied English, I was told to say,\\"I am fine\\" when people say \\"How are you?\\" But in the US, I found that people say, \\"I am good\\" or \\"I'm tired\\". One day, someone greeted me with \\"What's up?\\" It made me _ . I thought for a moment and then smiled because I didn't know what to say. Since then, I have discovered more and more differences between Chinese and US cultures. To my surprise, US girls spend a lot of time in the burning sun to get a tan . However, in China, girls try every possible way to get their skin paler, or \\"whiter\\". I was also surprised by how hardworking US students are .

Answer:","output":"Based on the given review, which states \\"Booringgg Very boooring,\\" I would lean towards recommending this app to a friend with caution. My suggestion would fall within the \\"Maybe\\" category. The reason for this cautious recommendation is that the provided review lacks sufficient details and context to form a comprehensive assessment of the app. It is important to consider that individuals have varying preferences and tastes, and what may be considered boring for one person might be engaging or useful for another. In addition, the reviewer provided no information about the functionality, user interface, stability, or any other aspect of the app. When evaluating a recommendation for an app, it is ideal to consider multiple reviews and sources of information, as well as the specific needs and preferences of the person you are recommending it to. Here are some factors to consider when deciding whether to recommend the app to a friend: 1. Determine what your friend is looking for in an app. Identify their specific needs and preferences in terms of functionality, design, and content. If the app you are considering meets those criteria, then it may still be worth recommending despite a single negative review. 2. Look for other user reviews and ratings to gain a broader perspective on the app's performance and user satisfaction. One review may not provide enough information or may be biased by the reviewer's personal preferences. 3. Try the app yourself to form your own opinion. By experimenting with the app, you may discover its strengths and weaknesses, and it will help you gain a better understanding of whether it would be a good fit for your friend. 4. Consider alternative apps within the same category to compare their features, user reviews, and ratings. This will help you provide a more informed recommendation to your friend. In conclusion, while the given review is decidedly negative, it is not sufficient to completely dismiss the app as a potential recommendation. By thoroughly evaluating the app based on the factors mentioned above and considering the needs and preferences of your friend, you can decide if the app is a good fit for them and provide a more informed recommendation."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person whose film career is almost ended?

Later they became precious family heirlooms passed from generation to generation, but as medieval art fell out of fashion in the early modern period, their provenance was often lost. The earliest record of a collection is the 1598 inventory of the dukes of Bavaria, which contain several boxwood miniatures.Of the surviving works, over one hundred re-emerged in the 19th century Parisian antiquarian market, then the leading market for medieval art. During this period, they were acquired by collectors such as the British collector Richard Wallace (1818–1890), who purchased Count van Nieuwerkerke's (1811–1892) entire collection, including two boxwood prayer nuts, the Vienna-born collector of objets d'art Frédéric Spitzer (1815−1890), and Ferdinand de Rothschild (1839–1898). Spitzer was not a purist and commissioned metalsmiths to produce modern versions, or copies, of a variety of medieval artworks. Today, there are four surviving boxwood carvings he had augmented for the market.When the American financier J. P. Morgan purchased Baron Albert Oppenheim's collection in 1906, he acquired four boxwood miniatures, including a triptych with the Crucifixion and Resurrection, and a prayer nut showing the Carrying of the Cross, all of which are now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The Canadian publishing magnate Kenneth Thomson was an important collector for over 50 years, and his collection included the world's largest gathering of boxwood miniatures, including two skulls, two triptychs, and six prayer beads.

How to groom a cockatiel Provide a small dish for the bird to clean itself. Birds often enjoy bathing themselves and keeping clean. Offer your bird a small dish or bowl filled halfway with lukewarm, chlorine-free, filtered water.","output":"Step 1: Introduce the bathing dish to the cockatiel Before placing the dish inside the cockatiel's cage, let the bird see and examine the dish from the outside. This will help the bird become familiar with the dish and avoid unnecessary stress. Step 2: Place the bathing dish in a suitable location inside the cage Find a flat, open area of the cage where the bird feels comfortable and can easily access the dish. Keep the dish away from food and water containers to maintain cleanliness. Step 3: Observe the cockatiel's response to the dish Allow the bird some time to explore the dish and the water. The bird may jump onto the edge of the dish, dip its head in the water, or splash around. Be patient and allow it to explore and bathe at its own pace. Some cockatiels might take a while to become comfortable with the idea of bathing in the dish. Step 4: Regularly change the water in the dish To ensure the water stays fresh and clean for the cockatiel, change it frequently, ideally once a day or every time the water is visibly dirty. Step 5: Ensure grooming and preening opportunities After bathing, the cockatiel will preen itself to clean, oil, and maintain its feathers. Make sure the bird has enough time to dry off and preen its feathers in a safe, comfortable space. Step 6: Monitor the bird's health Keep an eye on the bird's overall health, ensuring that their feathers are clean and molt naturally.

Context: WASHINGTON — Legal experts cast doubt Tuesday on a list of questions the special counsel purportedly wants to ask President Donald Trump, saying they would expect the veteran prosecutor to ask more and more pointed questions. The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller — or any prosecutor for that matter — would ask an interview subject. \\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\\" Jaso said.

Freud was born to Galician Jewish parents in the Moravian town of Freiberg, in the Austrian Empire. He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the University of Vienna. Upon completing his habilitation in 1885, he was appointed a docent in neuropathology and became an affiliated professor in 1902. Context: During this formative period of his work, Freud valued and came to rely on the intellectual and emotional support of his friend Wilhelm Fliess, a Berlin based ear, nose and throat specialist whom he had first met 1887. Both men saw themselves as isolated from the prevailing clinical and theoretical mainstream because of their ambitions to develop radical new theories of sexuality. Fliess developed highly eccentric theories of human biorhythms and a nasogenital connection which are today considered pseudoscientific. He shared Freud's views on the importance of certain aspects of sexuality -- masturbation, coitus interruptus, and the use of condoms -- in the etiology of what were then called the \\"actual neuroses,\\" primarily neurasthenia and certain physically manifested anxiety symptoms. They maintained an extensive correspondence from which Freud drew on Fliess's speculations on infantile sexuality and bisexuality to elaborate and revise his own ideas. His first attempt at a systematic theory of the mind, his 'Project for a Scientific Psychology' was developed with Fliess as interlocutor. Freud had Fliess repeatedly operate on his nose and sinuses to treat \\"nasal reflex neurosis\\", and subsequently referred his patient Emma Eckstein to him. According to Freud her history of symptoms included severe leg pains with consequent restricted mobility, and stomach and menstrual pains. These pains were, according to Fliess's theories, caused by habitual masturbation which, as the tissue of the nose and genitalia were linked, was curable by removal of part of the middle turbinate. Fliess's surgery proved disastrous, resulting in profuse, recurrent nasal bleeding - he had left a half-metre of gauze in Eckstein's nasal cavity the subsequent removal of which left her permanently disfigured. At first, though aware of Fliess's culpability - Freud fled from the remedial surgery in horror - he could only bring himself to delicately intimate in his correspondence to Fliess the nature of his disastrous role and in subsequent letters maintained a tactful silence on the matter or else returned to the face-saving topic of Eckstein's hysteria. Freud ultimately, in light of Eckstein's history of adolescecent self-cutting and irregular nasal and menstrual bleeding, concluded that Fliess was \\"completely without blame\\", as Eckstein's post-operative hemorrhages were hysterical \\"wish-bleedings\\" linked to \\"an old wish to be loved in her illness\\" and triggered as a means of \\"rearousing [Freud's] affection\\". Eckstein nonetheless continued her analysis with Freud. She was restored to full mobility and went on to practice psychoanalysis herself. Freud, who had called Fliess \\"the Kepler of biology\\", later concluded that a combination of a homoerotic attachment and the residue of his \\"specifically Jewish mysticism\\" lay behind his loyalty to his Jewish friend and his consequent over-estimation of both his theoretical and clinical work. Their friendship came to an acrimonious end with Fliess angry at Freud's unwillingness to endorse his general theory of sexual periodicity and accusing him of collusion in the plagiarism of his work. After Fliess failed to respond to Freud's offer of collaboration over publication of his Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality in 1906, their relationship came to an end. Question: Was the treatment successful? Answer:","output":"The treatment performed by Wilhelm Fliess on Emma Eckstein, based on his eccentric theories of human biorhythms and a nasogenital connection, was not successful. Fliess's surgery on Eckstein's nose to treat her leg pains, stomach pains, and menstrual pains proved disastrous, causing profuse and recurrent nasal bleeding. The mistake Fliess made during the surgery, which involved leaving a significant amount of gauze in Eckstein's nasal cavity, led to her permanent disfigurement after the gauze's removal. Initially, Freud had trouble admitting Fliess's mistakes and tried to delicately address the issue in their correspondence. Freud later concluded that Fliess was \\"completely without blame,\\" attributing Eckstein's post-operative hemorrhages to hysterical \\"wish-bleedings\\" connected to her desire for affection. Despite the failed treatment, Eckstein continued her analysis with Freud and eventually recovered from her symptoms, regaining full mobility. She went on to practice psychoanalysis herself. Freud's friendship with Fliess eventually deteriorated due to disagreements over theories and accusations of plagiarism. In conclusion, the treatment performed by Fliess on Eckstein was not successful, but she later regained her health through continued analysis with Freud."},{"instruction":"Question: What reaction would a fan have if they met their idol? Options: - go crazy - cool air - hot shower - come in many sizes - cool room Explain why a human would choose \\"go crazy\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"go crazy\\" to answer the question above because it is the only option that matches the emotional response a fan might have upon meeting their idol. This phrase doesn't necessarily mean losing control or becoming irrational; in this context, it typically refers to a heightened state of excitement and joy, which can often be overwhelming and make a person appear ecstatic or \\"crazy\\" out of happiness. The other options reflect properties or effects of physical objects or situations, not emotional responses: 1. \\"Cool air\\" is a phrase that describes the temperature or quality of the air, which is unrelated to a fan meeting their idol. 2. \\"Hot shower\\" is an activity someone might do for comfort or cleanliness, also not related to the fan-idol scenario. 3. \\"Come in many sizes\\" is a descriptive phrase usually used for tangible items, indicating different dimensions. This holds no relevance to emotional reactions of meeting an idol. 4. \\"Cool room\\" is similar to \\"cool air,\\" describing a physical environment, not an emotional response.

Answer:","output":"Baltimora was an Italo disco and New Wave band that was active from 1985 to 1987. Originating in Milan, Italy, the group was best known for its unique sound and stylish performances, which heavily integrated the talents of its charismatic frontman, Jimmy McShane. The band was formed in the mid-1980s as a musical venture that sought to capture the spirit and energy of the burgeoning Italo disco and New Wave scenes. The group's name, Baltimora, was chosen to pay homage to both the city of Baltimore, Maryland, and the unique sound that was taking over the European music market at that time. Assembled by the Italian music producer Maurizio Bassi, Baltimora gained popularity with the help of EMI Italiana, one of the major record labels during that era. The key driving force behind Baltimora was its lead singer Jimmy McShane, who was born in Derry, Northern Ireland, on May 23, 1957. McShane was a talented dancer and singer and his flamboyant stage presence quickly became one of the defining features of the group. Baltimora's other past members provided instrumental support and backing vocals, contributing to the overall lively and energetic sound that characterized the group's music. Baltimora reached the zenith of their fame with their debut single, \\"Tarzan Boy,\\" which was released in 1985. The song became an instant global hit, catapulting the band to international stardom. \\"Tarzan Boy\\" was noted for its catchy melodies, memorable lyrics, and the distinctive \\"jungle call\\" that punctuated the chorus. The single peaked at number 13 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and enjoyed similar success in other countries, including the United Kingdom, where it reached number six on the charts. Following the phenomenal success of \\"Tarzan Boy,\\" Baltimora released their debut album, \\"Living in the Background,\\" in 1985. The album enjoyed moderate success and showcased a range of musical influences that helped to solidify the group's status as a notable Italo disco act. However, despite the promising start, none of the subsequent singles managed to achieve the same level of commercial success as \\"Tarzan Boy.\\" Throughout their career, Baltimora maintained a strong visual element, often featuring elaborate and eye-catching costumes, stage design, and promotional artwork. The band's music videos also played a significant role in building their image and gaining popularity. The blend of colorful visuals, spirited performances, and infectious tunes helped to create a distinct identity in the often crowded and competitive music landscape of the 1980s. Baltimora disbanded in 1987, and Jimmy McShane returned to his native Northern Ireland. Despite facing a decline in his music career, he remained active in the entertainment industry, continuing to perform in clubs and various showbiz events. Unfortunately, McShane's life was tragically cut short at the age of 37, when he passed away on March 29, 1995, after battling AIDS-related complications. Baltimora's brief but impactful presence in the music world left a lasting legacy, with \\"Tarzan Boy\\" remaining their most iconic and enduring hit. Reflecting the spirit of the 1980s, the band's fusion of Italo disco and New Wave music continues to resonate with fans and audiences worldwide."},{"instruction":"Information: - Eric Idle (born 29 March 1943) is an English comedian, actor, voice actor, author, singer-songwriter, musician, writer and comedic composer.

Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction.

Does it follow that \\"That makes no sense.\\"? OPT: [I] yes. [II] it is not possible to tell. [III] no.","output":"In order to provide a detailed and long answer, let me first analyze the context and the question at hand. The original statement is a quote from a character or person stating, \\"That is absurd, Mr. Inglethorp,\\" which suggests that the person is disagreeing or arguing with someone named Mr. Inglethorp. Without further context, we can deduce that the person believes that Mr. Inglethorp's views, actions, or words are unreasonable or nonsensical. The question that follows asks whether the phrase \\"That makes no sense.\\" is a suitable alternative to the original statement. We are provided with three options: [I] yes, [II] it is not possible to tell, and [III] no. To evaluate these options, let's explore their meanings: [I] Yes: This answer implies that \\"That makes no sense.\\" conveys the same meaning as the original statement and can be used interchangeably. [II] It is not possible to tell: This answer suggests that, without additional context, we cannot determine if these two statements are equivalent or if there's a subtle difference in meaning or intent. [III] No: This response indicates that \\"That makes no sense.\\" is not an appropriate alternative, and there's a significant discrepancy between the two statements. Upon examining the phrases, it becomes apparent that both \\"That is absurd, Mr. Inglethorp\\" and \\"That makes no sense\\" express disagreement and suggest that something is irrational or illogical. Both statements convey similar sentiments, which denote a sense of confusion or disbelief. In \\"That is absurd, Mr. Inglethorp\\", the use of the word \\"absurd\\" emphasizes the intensity of the disagreement, while using \\"That makes no sense\\" is a more neutral way to express the same thought. Additionally, the original statement specifically addresses Mr. Inglethorp, which gives the context of a conversation or debate. However, the alternative statement omits this direct address. Given this analysis, one could argue that the two phrases are not entirely equivalent, due to the difference in intensity and directness. However, they do share a similar underlying meaning. Considering these points, the most suitable response would be [II] it is not possible to tell. While both phrases convey a sense of disagreement and confusion, the original statement has a stronger and more pointed tone than the alternative provided. Without additional context, it is difficult to determine if the alternative would carry the exact same meaning or impact in the specific situation where the original statement was used."},{"instruction":"The highest point of a wave is the crest. The lowest point is the trough. The vertical distance between a crest and a trough is the height of the wave. Wave height is also called amplitude. The horizontal distance between two crests is the wavelength. Both amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size. The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be.

Here, I'll describe a simple step-by-step method for making a fruit smoothie, including ingredients and proper blending technique to achieve a smooth and creamy texture. Ingredients: - 2 cups of your choice of fresh or frozen fruits (e.g., strawberries, blueberries, mangoes, bananas, peaches, etc.) - 1 cup of liquid (e.g., milk, yogurt, almond milk, coconut milk, or fruit juice) - 1/2 cup of ice (optional, especially if using frozen fruits) - Sweetener (optional, e.g., honey, maple syrup, or a splash of vanilla extract) - Optional add-ins (e.g., spinach, kale, chia seeds, flaxseeds, or protein powder) Equipment: - A blender - A measuring cup Step 1: Prepare the ingredients Wash and chop the fruits of your choice. If using larger fruits like mangoes or peaches, remove the pits and skin. Smaller fruits such as berries can be used whole. If using frozen fruits, you may want to allow them to thaw slightly before blending. Step 2: Add fruits to the blender Place the chopped or whole fruits into the blender. Try to pack them evenly to ensure they blend smoothly and uniformly. Step 3: Add the liquid Pour your choice of liquid (milk, yogurt, or a dairy-free alternative) into the blender. The amount of liquid needed may vary based on the type and freshness of the fruits. If you prefer a thinner smoothie, you can add more liquid. Consider the sweetness of your chosen liquid and adjust the amount of sweetener accordingly. Step 4: Add ice and sweetener (optional) If you prefer a thicker, more refreshing smoothie, you can add ice to the blender. If using frozen fruits, you may not need ice. Taste your fruit and liquid mixture, and if necessary, add a sweetener such as honey or maple syrup to reach your desired level of sweetness. Remember that some fruits are naturally sweeter than others, so adjust accordingly. Step 5: Optional add-ins For added nutritional value, consider incorporating leafy greens (spinach or kale), seeds (chia or flaxseeds), or a scoop of protein powder. These extras will not only boost the health benefits of your smoothie but may also provide additional flavor and texture. Step 6: Blend the smoothie With all of your ingredients in the blender, blend the mixture on high speed until fully combined and smooth. This may take a few minutes, depending on your blender's power and the combination of ingredients. Scrape down the sides of the blender if necessary and continue blending until all ingredients are fully combined and no chunky pieces remain. Step 7: Taste and adjust After blending, taste your smoothie to see if it needs any adjustments. You may want to add more sweetener, liquid, or other ingredients to achieve the desired flavor and texture. Blend again to incorporate any additional elements. Step 8: Serve and enjoy Once you're satisfied with the taste and consistency of the smoothie, pour it into a glass and enjoy your delicious and nutritious fruit smoothie. You can garnish with additional fruits, seeds, or a dollop of yogurt if desired. In conclusion, making a fruit smoothie is a quick and straightforward process requiring a few key ingredients and a blender. By following these steps, you can easily customize your smoothie for taste preferences and dietary requirements while reaping the health benefits of a wide variety of fruits."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task you will be given a claim and a perspective.

The perspective presents an argument that vegetarians have the same mortality rate as those who eat meat. To determine if the perspective supports or undermines the claim, we need to analyze the perspective. The perspective does not address the ethical, environmental, or health concerns usually associated with the vegan argument. It only focuses on the mortality rate of vegetarians, which is not directly related to veganism. The perspective neither supports nor undermines the claim since it does not directly address the reasons why someone might argue for or against veganism.

In 1902, Gilbert told a correspondent that this had happened accidentally. He and Sullivan had arrived in New York to produce the new opera, but the composer discovered that he had left his sketches behind in England. Fortunately, the entrance chorus from Thespis fitted the situation almost exactly, so it was substituted instead.Several scholars have doubted that explanation. In Sullivan's autograph score for the later work, the first part of \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\" is actually taken from a Thespis copyist score, with the Thespis words cancelled and the new words written in, which raises the question of why Sullivan had a Thespis score to hand, if not for that purpose.Some suggest that other music from Thespis could have been used in Pirates. Goldberg suggests that \\"It is reasonable to believe that Sullivan made generous use of his Thespis music in other operettas: perhaps owing to the circumstances under which The Pirates of Penzance was written, it contains more than one unacknowledged borrowing from the unlucky firstling of the lucky pair.\\" Reginald Allen says that \\"it seems certain\\" from its \\"rhythmic structure\\" that part of the Act I finale of Thespis, \\"Here's a pretty tale for future Iliads and Odysseys\\" became the original Act II finale in Pirates, \\"At length we are provided with unusual felicity\\", which was later deleted. Tillett and Spencer propose that most of Act I of Pirates was taken from Thespis. However, there is only circumstantial evidence for these suggestions. Except for \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\", neither author admitted to borrowing from Thespis for later works.","output":"The last names of the \\"lucky pair\\" that Goldberg speaks of in the article are Gilbert and Sullivan. The \\"lucky pair\\" refers to the duo of English dramatist W. S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan who together created a series of internationally successful and much-loved operas, including 'The Pirates of Penzance'. They are described as a 'lucky pair' perhaps due to their successful collaboration and the popularity of their works. The specific context of the 'lucky pair' phrase in Goldberg's comment is a suggestion that music from their less successful operetta 'Thespis' was reused in later, more successful operas. The term 'lucky' could, therefore, also be referring to their ability to repurpose their work, turning the 'unlucky' 'Thespis' into parts of their other, 'lucky', successful works."},{"instruction":"Abweichungen oder Unrichtigkeiten müssen sofort bei der Betreiberin reklamiert werden.

On Tuesday, at the front of a glitzy news conference, the media circus was called to attention, with the eight-time Olympic champion pulling his 'to the world' pose under a shower of ticker tape. Above him shone the slogan 'forever fastest'. It was a subtle, but telling, change to his sponsor's usual 'forever faster' tagline. For Bolt is now pushing boundaries through sheer weight of gold-medal metal rather than an ever-lighter imprint on the clock. His fastest 100m time so far this year is 9.95 seconds. At the same stage last year - in the build-up to the Rio Olympics - he had run 9.88. Before the World Championships in Beijing in 2015, he had clocked 9.87. Heading into Moscow 2013, his best was 9.85. Before London 2012, it was 9.76. Each time, he improved to win gold, but in progressively slower times as the years advanced. That 9.58-second scorched-earth world record from Berlin 2009 belongs to the same man, but a different, irrevocable era. Bolt, now 30, comes into this London edition of the World Championships, not as a sensation heralding a revolution, but instead hanging onto his empire against the challenge of Father Time and young pretenders. With three rounds of the 100m, roughly 30 seconds of action, left of his career, could Bolt, weighed down with 19 World and Olympic gold medals, possibly bow out in defeat? Bolt may never have been slower before a major championship, but the threats to him have rarely been less clear. The fastest man this year is Christian Coleman. The American's best of 9.82 seconds was one of six occasions on which he dipped under 10 seconds this season. Just 21, Coleman's expanding portfolio of performances attracted a seven-figure sponsorship deal from Nike as the sportswear giant made him their bet as Bolt's long-term successor. Coleman has a marked lack of major championship experience however. He told the Daily Telegraph that he was \\"pretty much a deer in the highlights\\" at the Rio Olympics where he appeared in the heats of the 4x100m relay. The final of the United States trials - the biggest race of his season - delivered only his fifth-fastest time of the year and second place. Bolt's old sparring partner Justin Gatlin was the man who beat Coleman. The 35-year-old claims he feels back to his 100m heyday when he won Olympic and world titles in 2004 and 2005, a time predating both Bolt's emergence and his own two doping bans. He will need to be. He has only beaten Bolt once in his long career - at a Diamond League meeting in Rome in 2013. By contrast in major finals in 2012, 2013, 2016 and most notably at the world championships in Beijing 2015 when Gatlin came into the final faster and favoured, he was left in the Jamaican great's wake. If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please click here to vote. Yohan Blake is the second fastest man in the world this year - and of all time, behind Bolt. He profited when Bolt fouled out of the 2011 World Championships and did the 100m-200m double in his compatriot's absence in the Jamaican trials this year. But the 27-year-old has been hindered by a run of injuries in recent seasons and pulled out of the Diamond League meeting in Rabat in mid-July with a groin problem. If Nike plumped for Coleman, Puma - Usain Bolt's own shoe sponsor - signed up Andre de Grasse in a multi-year, multi-million deal in 2015 as their pick for the next 100m superstar. It seemed a good choice when the Canadian won bronze in Rio last summer. Less so this season however. Having struggled for form - he is only the 23rd fastest in the world - he has now pulled out of London 2017 with a hamstring tear. Media playback is not supported on this device Former 1500m world champion and BBC Sport commentator Steve Cram Usain Bolt would not have given this field a second thought two or three years ago. He is not as good as he was. But he doesn't have to be. Whatever we have seen so far, he will be better in London. And what we have seen so far, in my opinion, is not that bad. In Monaco, where he ran his season's best of 9.95 seconds a fortnight ago, I thought he looked pretty good. Media playback is not supported on this device I don't think he has been pushing harder than he has to to win so far this season - he has been steady out of the blocks, getting up to speed, pulling clear and then throttling off. He has managed to adapt the demands he makes on himself pretty well in the last few years. You also have to look around. Bolt is not as fast as he was, but where is the threat coming from? Coleman is a bit of a raw talent without the experience that counts for so much in major finals. Blake has had a couple of injuries, and then you come back to the same-old in Justin Gatlin. South Africa's Akani Simbine has been under 10 seconds eight times this season, but has tended to run his fast times early in the season at home and then has not reproduced in major finals. There would be a lot of people very surprised if he stepped up to that level. I would always rather be in Usain Bolt's camp than anyone else's. Maybe London 2017 doesn't really matter anyway. Less than victory would end Bolt's gold run in the blue riband event, but it would be a blemish to bother only the most particular completists. The specifics of Saturday's night final at London Stadium will slowly fade to footnotes on Bolt's career. It won't be the heap of titles or spreadsheets seconds, but yawning winning margins as wide as Bolt's grin that define his legacy. Before Bolt arrived, sprinting was a serious, testosterone-soaked business. The likes of Linford Christie, Leroy Burrell, Maurice Greene and Donavon Bailey snarled and strutted on the start-line, as quick to take offence as they were over the ground. Bolt ushered in an era of slacker-chic. He shunned the twitchy thousand-yard stare and instead clowned his way to greatness. And his rivals have, for the most part, aped his example. He has rewritten not just record books, but sprinting etiquette, transforming the culture of the sport's headline event. Crucially Bolt's performances have been as natural as his act. After former relay team-mate Nesta Carter tested positive for a banned substance in January, only nine of the 33 fastest 100m times in history remain untainted by drugs bans. All were run by Bolt. Media playback is not supported on this device On Tuesday, he warned that if doping continued it could undermine the public's faith so fatally that athletics as a whole could die off. Whether fellow athletes heed that call to save the golden goose or instead cheat their way towards the vacuum he leaves behind, only time will tell.","output":"Usain Bolt, the eight-time Olympic champion, is pushing boundaries by the sheer weight of his gold-medal haul rather than on speed alone. Bolt's fastest 100m time this year is 9.95 seconds. His world record 2009 time of 9.58 seconds at the Berlin world championships is now of a different, irrevocable era. The now 30-year-old Bolt is taking on the challenge of hanging onto his empire against Father Time and the young pretenders. His 19 World and Olympic gold medals might weigh heavy on his career, but his rivals—American Christian Colman, Jamaica's Yohan Blake and South Africa's Akani Simbine—remain far from taking the title \\"fastest man in the world.”"},{"instruction":"In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . . that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens...

The New Yorker declared it \\"skilled, unpretentious, and totally ingenious\\", and The Atlantic Monthly's reviewer rated it as \\"pleasant, undemanding reading\\", but found the narrative voice—\\"a six-year-old girl with the prose style of a well-educated adult\\"—to be implausible. Time magazine's 1960 review of the book states that it \\"teaches the reader an astonishing number of useful truths about little girls and about Southern life\\" and calls Scout Finch \\"the most appealing child since Carson McCullers' Frankie got left behind at the wedding\\". The Chicago Sunday Tribune noted the even-handed approach to the narration of the novel's events, writing: \\"This is in no way a sociological novel. It underlines no cause ... To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel of strong contemporary national significance.\\"\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"In the given context, the character that got left behind at the wedding is Frankie, from Carson McCullers' novel \\"The Member of the Wedding.\\" The Time magazine's 1960 review of Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" compares the appeal of Scout Finch to that of Frankie, who is portrayed as an endearing and fascinating young girl. Frankie is the protagonist of \\"The Member of the Wedding,\\" a coming-of-age novel written by Carson McCullers and published in 1946. The story revolves around a 12-year-old tomboy girl named Frankie Addams, who becomes obsessed with her older brother's upcoming wedding and longs to be a part of something greater than herself. This desire to escape her mundane life and the isolation she feels leads her to insistent on being included in the wedding ceremony, to the point that she aims to accompany the newlyweds on their honeymoon. In the end, Frankie is left behind as the couple embarks on their new life together, marking a powerful and heartbreaking moment in the novel. Similarly, Scout Finch, the protagonist of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" is a precocious six-year-old girl who navigates the complex issues of race, morality, and social justice in her small, segregated Southern town. The novel, narrated from Scout's point of view, portrays her innocence and curiosity as she learns valuable life lessons from her father, Atticus Finch, who serves as a moral compass throughout the story. As Time magazine's review highlights, both Scout and Frankie are portrayed as highly appealing and relatable child characters in their respective novels. However, as mentioned by The Atlantic Monthly's reviewer in the same context, the narrative voice of Scout, a young girl with the prose style of an educated adult, may be seen as implausible by some readers. Nonetheless, both characters capture the hearts of readers through their honest depictions of childhood struggles and adventures, making them enduring symbols in American literature. In conclusion, the character mentioned in the context as being left behind at the wedding is Frankie from Carson McCullers' \\"The Member of the Wedding.\\" Time magazine's 1960 review of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" draws a parallel between the appeal of Scout Finch and Frankie's character, noting their significance in the world of literature as memorable and relatable young protagonists grappling with complex issues and emotions during their coming-of-age journeys."},{"instruction":"Solve 290*l - 316 - 239 = 315 for l.

Roughing Vane over, Reilly discovers he has taken a missing person's case in which an insurance company is trying to locate someone named Alex Pleshette. However, when Reilly presents himself to the insurance office to drop the case, the owner Max Arnett claims he never hired his agency to begin with. On the way out however, Arnett's receptionist inadvertently gives away the truth that Reilly was in fact hired. Heading back to his office, Reilly is confronted by two thugs in an alley who beat him and tell him to lay off the Pleshette case. In his office a short time later, a beautiful young woman in black arrives. Presenting herself as Mrs. Pleshette, Reilly assumes she is Alex Pleshette's wife, however she curtly informs him that her husband is dead, and that she is actually Alexandra, better known as Alex Pleshette. She tells him to stop interfering as she is now no longer missing, and departs â leaving him even more confused. Next day, Reilly finds out from his police detective friend Jack Bosley that Alex Pleshette witnessed the murder of her husband, a wealthy tycoon named Donald Pleshette who was at the time being investigated for company insurance fraud. However, she was knocked unconscious by the killer and as a result is unable to remember the event. Not long after this, she went missing and no one knew where she was, not even her lover Gabe Preston, her husband's disgruntled business partner. Reilly recognizes that Preston would thus have a motive for murder, but Bosley explains that he has a strong alibi. Later, Reilly gives Vane a camera and instructs him to follow Arnett and take photos of anything that appears interesting.

Talk to your doctor before to get these prescriptions. Typical medications that are prescribed are: Doxycycline only requires a single pill. It is not recommended for children or pregnant women due to possible effects on tooth development, but should still be used if it is the only option.

Elliptic geometry has a variety of properties that differ from those of classical Euclidean plane geometry. For example, the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always greater than 180°. - Ezra Cornell (January 11, 1807 December 9, 1874) was an American businessman, politician, philanthropist and educational administrator. He was the founder of Western Union and a co-founder of Cornell University. He also served as President of the New York Agriculture Society and as a New York state Senator. - In mathematics, particularly in the theories of Lie groups, algebraic groups and topological groups, a homogeneous space for a group \\"G\\" is a non-empty manifold or topological space \\"X\\" on which \\"G\\" acts transitively. The elements of \\"G\\" are called the symmetries of \\"X\\". A special case of this is when the group \\"G\\" in question is the automorphism group of the space \\"X\\" here \\"automorphism group\\" can mean isometry group, diffeomorphism group, or homeomorphism group. In this case \\"X\\" is homogeneous if intuitively \\"X\\" looks locally the same at each point, either in the sense of isometry (rigid geometry), diffeomorphism (differential geometry), or homeomorphism (topology). Some authors insist that the action of \\"G\\" be faithful (non-identity elements act non-trivially), although the present article does not. Thus there is a group action of \\"G\\" on \\"X\\" which can be thought of as preserving some \\"geometric structure\\" on \\"X\\", and making \\"X\\" into a single \\"G\\"-orbit. - In Riemannian geometry, the sectional curvature is one of the ways to describe the curvature of Riemannian manifolds. The sectional curvature \\"K\\"() depends on a two-dimensional plane in the tangent space at a point \\"p\\" of the manifold. It is the Gaussian curvature of the surface which has the plane as a tangent plane at \\"p\\", obtained from geodesics which start at \\"p\\" in the directions of (in other words, the image of under the exponential map at \\"p\\"). The sectional curvature is a smooth real-valued function on the 2-Grassmannian bundle over the manifold. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Andrew Dickson White (November 7, 1832 November 4, 1918) was an American historian and educator, who was the cofounder of Cornell University and served as its first president for nearly two decades.

This can be a real-world problem, such as computing the orbits of the planets in the solar system, or a problem of a more abstract nature, such as Hilbert's problems.<br> It can also be a problem referring to the nature of mathematics itself, such as Russell's Paradox. - In mathematics, hyperbolic geometry (also called BolyaiLobachevskian geometry or Lobachevskian geometry) is a non-Euclidean geometry. In hyperbolic geometry the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry is replaced with: - Cornell University is an American private Ivy League and federal land-grant doctoral university located in Ithaca, New York. Founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, the university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledgefrom the classics to the sciences, and from the theoretical to the applied. These ideals, unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell's motto, a popular 1865 Ezra Cornell quotation: \\"I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.\\" - Euclidean geometry is a mathematical system attributed to the Alexandrian Greek mathematician Euclid, which he described in his textbook on geometry: the \\"Elements\\". Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians, Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and logical system. The \\"Elements\\" begins with plane geometry, still taught in secondary school as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of formal proof. It goes on to the solid geometry of three dimensions. Much of the \\"Elements\\" states results of what are now called algebra and number theory, explained in geometrical language. - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems. - Daina Taimina ( Latvian : Taimia ; born August 19 , 1954 ) is a Latvian mathematician , currently Adjunct Associate Professor at Cornell University , known for crocheting objects to illustrate hyperbolic space . - Mathematics (from Greek \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics. - In mathematics, hyperbolic space is a homogeneous space that has a constant negative curvature, where in this case the curvature is the sectional curvature. It is hyperbolic geometry in more than 2 dimensions, and is distinguished from Euclidean spaces with zero curvature that define the Euclidean geometry, and elliptic geometry that have a constant positive curvature. - Classics or classical studies is the study of classical antiquity. This covers the ancient Mediterranean world, particularly ancient Greece and Rome. It encompasses the study of ancient languages, literature, philosophy, history, and archaeology. Traditionally in the West, the study of the Greek and Roman classics was considered one of the cornerstones of the humanities and a necessary part of a rounded education. Since the 20th century, however, Classics is no longer a part of a typical elite education. - In geometry, Euclidean space encompasses the two-dimensional Euclidean plane, the three-dimensional space of Euclidean geometry, and certain other spaces.

She has made significant contributions to the field of topology, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of properties of spaces that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, twisting, and bending. Taimina's work specifically focuses on the relationship between topology and hyperbolic geometry, a type of non-Euclidean geometry that has a constant negative curvature, as opposed to the Euclidean geometry we are more familiar with in everyday life. She has developed an innovative method for illustrating hyperbolic space by using crochet. Her crocheted models provide a tangible and visual representation of hyperbolic space, allowing for a better understanding of the unique properties and structures found in hyperbolic geometry. These models have proven to be valuable educational tools in the study of topology, as they offer a hands-on approach to exploring and grasping complex mathematical concepts. Through her groundbreaking work in using crochet to model hyperbolic space, Daina Taimina has established a strong connection between her research and the field of topology. By creating these physical representations of abstract mathematical ideas, she has expanded our understanding of hyperbolic geometry and its applications and offered new insights into the broader area of topology."},{"instruction":"Jerry Alan Fodor (; April 22, 1935 - November 29, 2017) was an American philosopher and cognitive scientist. He held the position of State of New Jersey Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at Rutgers University and was the author of many works in the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive science, in which he laid the groundwork for the modularity of mind and the language of thought hypotheses, among other ideas. He was known for his provocative and sometimes polemical style of argumentation and as \\"one of the principal philosophers of mind of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. In addition to having exerted an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since 1960, Fodor's work has had a significant impact on the development of the cognitive sciences.\\" Jerry Fodor was born in New York City on April 22, 1935, and was of Jewish descent. He received his A.B. degree (summa cum laude) from Columbia University in 1956, where he studied with Sydney Morgenbesser, and a PhD in philosophy from Princeton University in 1960, under the direction of Hilary Putnam. From 1959 to 1986 Fodor was on the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. From 1986 to 1988 he was a full professor at the City University of New York (CUNY). From 1988 until his retirement in 2016 he was State of New Jersey Professor of philosophy and cognitive science at Rutgers University in New Jersey, where he was emeritus. Besides his interest in philosophy, Fodor passionately followed opera and regularly wrote popular columns for the London Review of Books on that and other topics. Philosopher Colin McGinn, who taught with Fodor at Rutgers, described him in these words: Fodor (who is a close friend) is a gentle man inside a burly body, and prone to an even burlier style of arguing. He is shy and voluble at the same time ... a formidable polemicist burdened with a sensitive soul.... Disagreeing with Jerry on a philosophical issue, especially one dear to his heart, can be a chastening experience.... His quickness of mind, inventiveness, and sharp wit are not to be tangled with before your first cup of coffee in the morning. Adding Jerry Fodor to the faculty at Rutgers [University] instantly put it on the map, Fodor being by common consent the leading philosopher of mind in the world today. I had met him in England in the seventies and ... found him to be the genuine article, intellectually speaking (though we do not always see eye to eye). Fodor was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He received numerous awards and honors: New York State Regent's Fellowship, Woodrow Wilson Fellowship (Princeton University), Chancellor Greene Fellow (Princeton University), Fulbright Fellowship (University of Oxford), Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He won the first Jean Nicod Prize for philosophy of mind and cognitive philosophy in 1993. His lecture series for the Prize, later published as a book by MIT Press in 1995, was titled The Elm and the Expert: Mentalese and Its Semantics. In 1996-1997, Fodor delivered the prestigious John Locke Lectures at the University of Oxford, titled Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong, which went on to become his 1998 Oxford University Press book of the same name. He has also delivered the Patrick Romanell Lecture on Philosophical Naturalism (2004) and the Royce Lecture on Philosophy of Mind (2002) to the American Philosophical Association, of whose Eastern Division he has served as Vice President (2004-2005) and President (2005-2006). In 2005, he won the Mind & Brain Prize. He lived in New York with his wife, the linguist Janet Dean Fodor, and had two grown children. Fodor died on November 29, 2017, at his home in Manhattan. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Do they have any kids?","output":"Yes, Jerry Fodor and his wife Janet Dean Fodor had two grown children."},{"instruction":"on former associate professor at department of computer science at university of copenhagen hasse clausen by associate professor at diku erik frøkjær Capitalize this past sentence correctly.","output":"On Former Associate Professor at Department of Computer Science at University of Copenhagen, Hasse Clausen, by Associate Professor at DIKU, Erik Frøkjær In this analysis, we will explore insights on former Associate Professor Hasse Clausen from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen.

Here's a step-by-step approach and justification for this recommendation: Step 1: Choose a self-tanning product or a professional spray tan service. - Justification: Both methods are designed to give a suntanned appearance without exposing your skin to harmful UV rays, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of skin cancer. Step 2: Perform a patch test. - Justification: It's essential to test the product on a small area of your skin first to check for any allergies or irritation before applying it to larger areas. Step 3: Exfoliate your skin. - Justification: Removing dead skin cells through exfoliation will allow the self-tanner or spray tan solution to penetrate evenly, resulting in a more natural-looking tan. Step 4: Apply the self-tanning product evenly or get a professional spray tan. - Justification: Follow the instructions provided with the self-tanner or book an appointment for a professional spray tan to ensure an even, streak-free application. Step 5: Allow the product to dry completely. - Justification: Allowing the product to dry fully before putting on clothes will prevent any staining or transfer and make the tan last longer. Step 6: Maintain your tan. - Justification: Using a good moisturizer and following proper aftercare can help prolong the life of your sunless tan. Avoid excessive scrubbing or exfoliating during this time.

Pawn is a bait used as a distraction for accomplishment of the scheme. People make schemes for personal benefits. People often use other people as pawns for their own schemes. The question and answer pair are described below.","output":"Question: What is the relationship between schemes and using people as pawns? Answer: The relationship between schemes and using people as pawns lies in the strategic manipulation of individuals for the purpose of achieving a desired outcome. A scheme is a well-thought-out plan or plot, often devised to gain personal benefits, accomplish a specific goal, or manipulate a situation to one's advantage. In some cases, people involved in devising such schemes may use others as pawns, meaning they treat them as expendable or easily manipulated tools in the pursuit of their objectives. Using people as pawns typically involves exploiting their vulnerabilities, emotions, loyalties, or desires, without concern for their well-being or dignity. This could be in the form of deception, persuasion, or coercion to manipulate them into performing certain actions or making specific decisions that ultimately serve the schemer's aims. In this context, a pawn is a person treated as a disposable resource, rather than as a valued and respected individual. In summary, the relationship between schemes and using people as pawns is rooted in strategic manipulation and using individuals as tools to achieve selfish goals or objectives. It is often characterized by deception, exploitation, and a disregard for the well-being or dignity of the people being used."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to French: This Directive lists information requirements and procedures for assessment, and is available at http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/food/biotechnology/index_en.htm Health testing The purpose of health testing is to provide sufficient information to determine whether the MPCA will cause human health effects, including infectivity, pathogenicity and toxicity.","output":"Cette directive énumère les exigences en matière d'information et les procédures d'évaluation, et est disponible à http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/food/biotechnology/index_en.htm Les tests de santé ont pour but de fournir suffisamment d'informations pour déterminer si le MPCA causera des effets sur la santé humaine, y compris l'infectiosité, la pathogénicité et la toxicité.

Reliable intelligence and databases don't exist in Syria, making it difficult if not impossible to thoroughly vet each asylum applicant. The ISIS terror army is based in Syria and has vowed to take its Holy War to Europe and beyond.","output":"Title: The Complexities of Allowing Syrian Refugees into the United States: A Closer Look Introduction The ongoing Syrian refugee crisis has sparked intense debate in the United States. As millions continue to flee their homes in search of safety and stability, members of the U.S. Congress are deliberating whether or not it's wise to admit Syrian refugees into the country. Though an existing group of Syrian refugees has already been admitted, the situation remains mired in controversy. In attempting to understand the argument against accepting these refugees, it is important to consider the difficulties surrounding the lack of reliable intelligence and databases, the threats represented by the ISIS terror army, and the State Department's plans over the next few years. Current State of Affairs As of now, 524 Syrian refugees have been granted asylum and allowed into the United States. While the number might seem insignificant compared to the thousands that are displaced, the State Department is in the process of planning for the admission of multiple thousands more refugees. These plans are being met with resistance by members of Congress who fear the potential security threats this may pose. Difficulty of Thorough Vetting One of the primary arguments against admitting additional Syrian refugees is the lack of reliable intelligence and databases in the war-torn country. This absence makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to completely vet each asylum applicant arriving from Syria. To ensure the safety of Americans, it is imperative that the United States government be able to verify the identities and backgrounds of those entering the country. ISIS Threats Moreover, the ISIS terror army, which is based in Syria, has vowed to extend its Holy War to Europe and beyond. This assertion has raised even more concerns about allowing Syrian refugees into the country, since it may provide a gateway for ISIS members or sympathizers to enter the United States. Being cognizant of this potential danger, members of Congress have advocated for a more cautious approach to asylum for Syrians. Balancing Compassion and Security As the State Department works towards admitting thousands of Syrian refugees over the coming years, it is crucial to weigh the risks and benefits of this endeavor. While these refugees undoubtedly need humanitarian aid and safe havens, the lack of reliable intelligence from Syria and the threat posed by ISIS cannot be ignored. Adapting a balanced approach that incorporates both empathy for the Syrian refugees and the practical steps necessary to safeguard the security of the United States is essential. Conclusion The issue of admitting Syrian refugees into the United States is a complex one that requires a nuanced discussion. While the addition of 524 Syrians may not have immediately altered the demographic landscape, the state department's future plans reignite concerns about properly vetting and verifying the backgrounds of these refugees. Ultimately, finding a balance between extending aid to those in need and ensuring the safety of American citizens continues to be the primary objective in this ongoing debate."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Kathy and Jacob are two coworkers out having a drink at a bar after a day at the office. They both wear glasses and Kathy comments that she hates that she is so farsighted and wishes there was a surgery to fix it. Jacob says that he finds it amusing she is farsighted because he himself is nearsighted. They both laugh at the opposite nature of their eye condition, and then both look at the menu on the other side of the room to decide what drinks to order next. But I can use this background: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it. What is an answer for this question: Which person will not have convex lenses in their glasses? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Jacob will not have convex lenses in his glasses. To understand why, let's first recap the details about the coworkers' eye conditions and the lens types used to correct them. Kathy is farsighted, which means she has hyperopia, a condition where distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. This occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal, causing images to be focused behind the retina. To correct this issue, farsighted individuals wear convex lenses, which help to focus the images farther forward in the eye, ensuring they fall on the retina. On the other hand, Jacob is nearsighted, meaning he can see nearby objects clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, occurs when the eyeball is longer than normal, causing images to be focused in front of the retina. To correct myopia, nearsighted individuals wear concave lenses, which help to focus the images farther back in the eye, ensuring they fall precisely on the retina. Given this information, it is clear that Jacob, the nearsighted coworker, will not have convex lenses in his glasses, as those are used to correct farsightedness (hyperopia). Instead, Jacob's glasses will be equipped with concave lenses to correct his nearsightedness (myopia)."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Hypothesis: A child dismounts a swing. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, given the premise that \\"a child jumps off of a swing while it is in motion,\\" we can conclude the hypothesis that \\"a child dismounts a swing.\\" Let's break down the reasoning behind this conclusion. First, let's analyze the premise. When it is stated that a child jumps off of a swing while it is in motion, we can understand that the child's action involves leaving the swing deliberately, prior to the swing coming to a stop. The swing is moving, and the child chooses to exit the swing by jumping off of it. Next, let's examine the hypothesis. When we say a child dismounts a swing, it essentially refers to the action of the child getting off or leaving the swing. Dismount signifies the act of getting off a mode of transport, in this case, a swing. Now, let's compare the premise and the hypothesis. Both the premise and hypothesis describe the action of a child leaving the swing. The premise goes further by providing details about the manner and timing of leaving the swing (jumping off while it is in motion). Given that, here's the connection between the premise and hypothesis: Premise: The child is on the swing while it is in motion, and they jump off, exiting the swing. Hypothesis: The child exits the swing (dismounts) As we can see, both the premise and hypothesis involve the action of a child leaving a swing. While the premise offers more specifics, the core action (leaving or dismounting the swing) is present in both statements. Therefore, we can conclude that given the premise, \\"a child jumps off of a swing while it is in motion,\\" it supports the hypothesis that \\"a child dismounts a swing.\\""},{"instruction":"Write an article with the title: \\"Chevy Bolt EV enters pre-production a year ahead of Tesla Model 3\\"","output":"Title: \\"Chevy Bolt EV enters pre-production a year ahead of Tesla Model 3\\" Introduction: (Introduce the main topic of the article - Chevy Bolt vs Tesla Model 3) The race to dominate the electric vehicle market has gained momentum, with Chevrolet's fascinating new Bolt EV entering pre-production, a year ahead of Tesla's eagerly anticipated Model 3.

The Ruth Galloway series revolves around Ruth, a forensic archaeologist, who becomes involved in various police investigations and murder mysteries in the English county of Norfolk. Through this series, Griffiths expertly portrays the unique atmosphere of the Norfolk countryside, its history, and archaeology, often using local legends to enrich the plot.

These books are set in the post-World War II era England, when the country was still recovering from the turmoil of war. The Stephens and Mephisto series showcases the classic British detective story, with Edgar Stephens and Max Mephisto solving crimes, typically murder mysteries, while exploring the world of British music halls and the entertainment industry. Both central characters – the British police detective and the British magician – interact with various other British personalities and scenarios, delivering a distinctly British atmosphere within this crime series.

Unfortunately, the movie falls short of this ambitious goal, leaving viewers feeling nothing but bitter disappointment. From the outset, the film's premise had the potential to be a groundbreaking addition to the dystopian genre. Instead, it becomes mired in clichés and tired tropes – an uninspired mess that offers little to no originality. The setting, a post-apocalyptic metropolis, is nothing more than a bland rehash of countless other films, complete with generic landscapes, rubble, and shadows. \\"Inferior City\\" fails to establish a distinct visual identity of its own, leaving audiences with a sense of déjà vu as they watch the overly familiar scenes play out on screen. The characters in \\"Inferior City\\" are remarkably one-dimensional, possessing neither depth nor complexity. The protagonist, Alex (played by a clearly disinterested Chris Starlord), is the stereotypical brooding, reluctant hero, whose personal struggles are entirely predictable and lacking any nuance. The supporting cast is even more forgettable, none of the characters given enough development to warrant any emotional investment from the audience. This is a shame, as the cast comprises talented actors who seem woefully underused and wasted on this film. Moreover, the film's dialogue is nothing short of cringe-worthy. It's riddled with heavy-handed exposition and stilted conversations that come across as unnatural and unrealistic. \\"Inferior City\\" attempts to explore profound themes such as freedom, humanity, and survival – yet these topics are handled in such a ham-fisted manner that it evokes more eye-rolls than thought-provoking moments. As for the plot, it unfolds at a snail's pace, with long stretches that feel like nothing of consequence occurs. This lack of action means the film often feels tedious and dull, leaving audiences eagerly anticipating its end. When the climax does finally arrive, it is both contrived and underwhelming, characteristic of the rest of the film. To further compound these issues, \\"Inferior City\\"'s visual effects are a glaring weak point. In an age where CGI can elevate a movie to visually-stunning heights, it's baffling to see a film that relies so heavily on special effects suffer from such shoddy work. The subpar CGI severely detracts from the film's overall aesthetic and serves as a constant reminder of its shortcomings. Even the soundtrack of \\"Inferior City\\" fails to impress. Instead of adding an atmospheric soundscape that could lend tension or emotional weight to the film, the score is a grating cacophony of generic, uninspired tracks that only serve to heighten the audience's dissatisfaction. In summary, \\"Inferior City\\" is a deeply flawed film that squanders its potential at every turn. A clichéd, bland setting, uninteresting characters, awkward dialogue, a plodding plot, lackluster visual effects, and a forgettable score all come together in a disheartening mix. Regrettably, this film cannot be recommended, as it offers little more than disappointment and frustration to audiences. One can only hope that future attempts at exploring a dystopian world will learn from the failures of \\"Inferior City.\\""},{"instruction":"Here are some keywords about a restaurant: name = Midsummer House, food = Japanese, customer rating = low, near = Café Rouge.

Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied? Title: Inexpensive but flawed Review: As some previous people have commented, the bottom wiring and even screws are exposed. This leads to discomfort while using as on the lap as opposed to another surface. The wiring is loose and can in some instances be snagged on loose items. This happened to me where the connections near the on/off switch (which are very exposed) caught on a something and were pulled free.From my experience the fans are not as quiet as some people have said. They are regular fans used in most PCs, just serialized and set onto a lightweight frame. The only advantage the whole unit has is the frame itself which does help to distribute some heat and is angled for airflow.Luckily the unit is inexpensive and may be worth buying if you want a cheap, alternative to having your laptop lay flat.","output":"The customer appears to be dissatisfied with the product based on the issues they mentioned in their review such as the exposed wiring and screws, the discomfort experienced while using the product on the lap, the snagging issue due to loose wiring, noise from the fans, and the quality of the frame.

I scoured Consumer Reports and this was in the top three. The unit I received (a four slice model) had a faulty control on the left side. The lever in the slot was supposed to have three settings so that you could put something small in the toaster (like a mini bagel) and it would raise it above the housing so you wouldn't have to dig for it. Unfortunately, this nice feature (great on the right, but not on the left) was faulty. Another feature I was looking for was a cord that was retractable, and although this one is, the directions say NEVER to operate the toaster unless the cord is out fully. Also the unit is HUGE and takes up a lot of counter space. I'm really disappointed after spending about 2 hours on research to find the perfect toaster for my needs and it didn't measure up. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","output":"This product review conveys a negative sentiment. The reviewer expresses their disappointment with the toaster they purchased, stating that it did not meet their expectations despite extensive research. There are a few reasons for the negative sentiment: 1. Faulty control on the left side: The reviewer mentions that the lever in the slot on the left side of the toaster was supposed to have three settings, a feature that would make it easy to retrieve smaller items like mini bagels. However, this feature was malfunctioning, and it negatively impacted the user's experience. 2. Retractable cord issue: The reviewer was looking for a toaster with a retractable cord, and although this toaster has one, the directions state that the toaster should never be operated unless the cord is fully out. This condition contradicts the reviewer's expectation for a more convenient and space-saving design. 3. Large size: The reviewer points out that the toaster is huge and takes up a lot of counter space, indicating that the size is not suitable for their needs or preferences. Overall, the review denotes dissatisfaction with the product and the investment of time the reviewer spent on researching to find the perfect toaster. The various issues discussed in the review, such as faulty controls, contradictory features, and a large size, led to a negative sentiment."},{"instruction":"Likethecartoon,Masyanyaonlinegamescanbetoooutspokenforthekids,andthecomplex.

Let's analyze both questions step-by-step: 1. Understanding the questions: - The first question is asking for ways to maintain a clean toothbrush, which suggests the user is concerned about the hygiene and cleanliness of a toothbrush. - The second question is asking for methods of cleaning teeth without involving a toothbrush, which suggests the user is searching for alternative methods to clean teeth, possibly when a toothbrush is unavailable or impractical. 2. Justifying the difference: The distinction between the two questions lies in the focus of each. The first question concentrates on the toothbrush itself and maintaining its cleanliness, while the second question looks beyond the toothbrush and seeks alternative methods for oral hygiene."},{"instruction":"Translate to Finnish: Given the need for food and energy security, we must develop alternative energy supply sources and minimise food waste both at EU and national levels.","output":"Ottaen huomioon elintarvike- ja energiaturvallisuuden tarpeen, meidän on kehitettävä vaihtoehtoisia energianlähteitä ja vähennettävä ruokahävikkiä sekä EU:n että kansallisella tasolla. Koska elintarviketurva ja energiaturva ovat keskeisiä kysymyksiä kaikille Euroopan unionin jäsenvaltioille, on tärkeää, että etsimme keinoja näiden tavoitteiden saavuttamiseksi. Tämä sisältää sekä uusien energiamuotojen kehittämisen että toimintatapojen parantamisen, jotta vähennämme hukkaan heitettyä ruokaa. Yksi tärkeä strategia tämän tavoitteen saavuttamiseksi on vaihtoehtoisten energianlähteiden kehittäminen ja toiminta. Tämä voi sisältää muun muassa uusiutuvien energialähteiden, kuten aurinko-, tuuli- ja vesivoiman, lisäämisen sekä vähemmän tunnettujen teknologisten ratkaisujen tutkimuksen, kuten biomassan jalostamisen tai geotermisen energian käytön. Näiden energiamuotojen kehittäminen ei ainoastaan auta vähentämään riippuvuutta fossiilisista polttoaineista, vaan myös vähentää kasvihuonekaasupäästöjä ja taistelee ilmastonmuutosta vastaan. Toinen välttämätön osa elintarvike- ja energiaturvallisuuden tavoitteen saavuttamista on ruokahävikin vähentäminen. Ruokahävikki on valtava ongelma niin Euroopan unionissa kuin maailmanlaajuisestikin. Euroopassa arvioidaan, että noin kolmannes kaikista tuotetuista tai jalostetuista elintarvikkeista päätyy jätteeksi. Tämä tarkoittaa resurssien, kuten energian, veden ja viljelysmaan, epäasianmukaista käyttöä. Ruokahävikin vähentämiseksi on tärkeää puuttua ongelmaan sekä EU:n laajuisella tasolla että kansallisella tasolla. EU voi esimerkiksi edistää tutkimusta, julkista tietoisuutta ja mahdollisia säädöksiä, joiden avulla jäsenvaltiot voivat puuttua ruokahävikin ongelmaan tehokkaammin. Kansallisella tasolla valtiot voivat toteuttaa omia toimia, joihin voi sisältyä esimerkiksi tiettyjen hävikkiä aiheuttavien käytänteiden kieltäminen, kansalaisten valistaminen ruokahävikin vähentämisen tavoista sekä taloudellisten kannustimien kehittäminen elintarvikeketjun toimijoille, jotta ne voisivat toimia paremmin ja vastuullisemmin. Yhteenvetona, elintarvike- ja energiaturvallisuuden varmistaminen edellyttää sellaisten vaihtoehtoisten energianlähteiden kehittämistä, jotka vähentävät riippuvuuttamme fossiilisista polttoaineista ja vastaavat samalla ilmastonmuutoksen haasteisiin. Samalla on tärkeää vähentää ruokahävikkiä ja parantaa ruokateollisuuden tehokkuutta sekä Euroopan unionin että kansallisella tasolla."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Over thirty thousand years ago,people from northern Asia went to America.Today, we call these people Indians .

A) People from northern Asia B) People from Europe C) People from Germany D) Columbus Answer:","output":"A) People from northern Asia Over thirty thousand years ago, people from northern Asia were the first to go to America. We refer to these individuals as Indians. They were motivated to migrate to America due to the weather changes in northern Asia, which became extremely cold to the point where everything froze. They had no choice but to move or face death. The first Indians made their journey to America by walking, utilizing the land connection that existed between Asia and America at that time. This incredibly long journey occurred thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. Later, in 1492, Christopher Columbus discovered the New World, thereby bringing the existence of the Americas to the attention of Europeans. Initially, only a small number of Europeans followed Columbus' footsteps and traveled to America using boats. However, over the next three hundred years, approximately 500,000 people made the voyage across the Atlantic to the New World. The migration to the United States increased significantly between 1815 and 1915, with over thirty-two million Europeans leaving their countries in search of better opportunities and a better life. The most significant groups of immigrants during this time came from Germany and Italy, with various other countries also represented. These Europeans spoke a wide range of languages and, for the most part, took very little money with them as they sought to build better lives in America. In conclusion, the first people to go to America were from northern Asia, known to us today as Indians. They embarked on this journey due to the changing weather conditions in their region, which threatened their survival. Thousands of years later, Europeans, led initially by Columbus, began their own migrations to the United States, greatly expanding the diversity of people living in America."},{"instruction":"Grocery retailer Kroger Co. signed a tentative three-year agreement with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1099, the union said.

The reason it is indirect is because the predators specifically do not have an impact on any of the individual steps of nest building or mating itself.

Since my son was home schooling, he went with me to the church every day. Most mornings, we'd stop at a local store, and get a chocolate drink for him and a cup of coffee for me. The clerk at the store made our lives more enjoyable each day, and so we returned again and again. She had found her own way of enjoying life and her job. I'm not even sure if she realized that her warmth and brightness put a smile upon the face of each customer . When a customer brought cakes to the counter, any other clerk could have asked: \\"Would you like some milk with those cakes?\\" Instead, she asked: \\"Would you like a lottery ticket with those cakes?\\" She might have asked me if I wanted sugar with my coffee. But instead, she asked: \\"Would you like some batteries with that coffee?\\" Yes, life is what you make of it. This clerk's method of dealing with what some think is a boring job, and with the customers she met daily, made the hours in her day more enjoyable. In doing that, she also refreshed the lives of others and made them laugh. Sometimes, if my day at the church had been very tiring, we'd stop at that store before going home. We'd giggle as we left the store, the clerk's words echoing behind us. \\"Would you like some shampoo with that orange juice?\\" What was the clerk like? A) She was serious. B) She was lively.

Bring joy - Although babies do bring joy to their mothers, this option doesn't address the baby's thirst. Hence, it doesn't seem like the correct answer. 3. Nurse - Nursing refers to the act of breastfeeding a baby. Breast milk provides the baby with nutrition and hydration. Since the baby is thirsty, the most reasonable action for the mother would be to nurse the baby. So, this option seems like the correct answer. 4.

The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.

Visual elements employed during Nine Inch Nails concerts have often included numerous lighting, stage and projection effects employed to accompany and augment presentation. Prior to the Fragility tour in 2000, Reznor reflected that \\"I’ve adopted a philosophy of the way to present Nine Inch Nails live that incorporates a theatrical element. I want it to be drama. I want my rock stars to be larger than life, you know? The Kurt Cobains of the world, I’m sick of that shit. I don’t want a gas station attendant being my hero. I grew up with Gene Simmons. I grew up with Ziggy Stardust.\\"Many songs are typically accompanied with specially designed visual aids, including synchronized lighting effects and projected stock-footage montages. Early performances of the song \\"Hurt\\", for example, were accompanied by a projected montage of clouds, charred bodies, mushroom clouds, maggots, and war refugees, a performance of which is featured in the song's music video. Recent performances of the song, however, have featured less lighting effects. Since 1999, the visual presentation of Nine Inch Nails live shows have been directed by Rob Sheridan, while Bill Viola designed a large triptych display for the Fragility tour. The images displayed on the triptych focused on storm and water imagery. And All That Could Have Been features an audio commentary track by Viola describing the display and his inspirations for it.For the Live: With Teeth tour, Roy Bennett and Martin Phillips were responsible for the lighting design and stage design respectively. Bennett explained in a 2005 interview that much of the lighting was done using a series of LED lights arranged in \\"stalactites or stalagmites [formations] to tie in to the album artwork\\". DLP projectors were also used to project images onto a gauze screen in front of the stage.

Their website was a success. d). not enough information If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts.

Lommel is truly the Ed Wood of the new millennium. This film is as shoddy and laughable as the best-worst of EW. I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I watched it in toto, morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set. The answer is: subterranean; Lommel dug a pit and buried it. The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies. Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face. The main character, a villainous beat cop, is played by a German actor with a thick German accent. Aside from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in LA. Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody, then drags them into his home (which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse), and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners, the LAPD refuses to investigate, going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment. The sets are excruciatingly bad. The production designer's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint \\"Precinct 707\\" on a cardboard wall. Since the actors were obviously unpaid non-professionals--a sad assortment of European emigres (possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands), bimbos, mimbos, and desperate middle-aged women--and since little if any money was spent on sets, special efx, locations or other production value, it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine-looking police uniforms. Sadly, they couldn't afford a police car; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental. More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him. One of these young actors is especially pitiable because he's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies. The other fits right in, with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured Brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated. The latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie, as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her. Don't ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered, just accept Lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride. After much prolonged hand-clawing out of straw-covered roadside graves, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance. They look exactly as they did before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor make-up generously airbrushed around their eyes. Looking nothing like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway. At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll, and injects large doses of cheesy Euro-trash techno into the soundtrack. We're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise. Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty. Unlike other zombies, Lommel's girls speak and function as normal... er, I mean, as they did before becoming zombified. This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog. Yes, a golden shower it is. I won't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending.

Mary has taken a karate class, but Rachel never has, so","output":"Mary and Rachel decided that it would be a great idea to share their interests and skills by participating in each other's favorite activities. Naturally, this meant that Mary, with her newfound karate enthusiasm, would guide Rachel through some basic karate moves and techniques to give her a feel for the discipline. Rachel, on the other hand, would later lead Mary in her favorite activity, which was book club discussions. Before beginning their karate lesson, Mary sat down with Rachel to explain the history and principles of karate and its origin in Okinawa, Japan. She highlighted the importance of practicing karate not just for self-defense, but also for improving self-discipline, focus, and overall well-being. Once Rachel had a general idea of what karate was all about, they began with some warm-up exercises to prepare their bodies for the more rigorous and intense movements that lied ahead. Mary guided Rachel through stretching exercises that targeted all the essential muscle groups, especially focusing on their legs and hips, as karate requires flexibility and strength in those areas. After warming up, Mary introduced Rachel to some basic karate stances, such as the \\"zenkutsu dachi\\" (front stance) and the \\"kiba dachi\\" (horse stance). She emphasized the importance of proper foot placement and keeping the knees slightly bent to maintain balance. They spent some time practicing these foundational stances, with Mary gently correcting Rachel's movements to ensure that she was practicing the stances correctly. Next, it was time for Rachel to learn some basic karate techniques. Mary started with teaching the \\"kihon,\\" or fundamental techniques, like punches, blocks, and kicks. Rachel found the \\"oi-zuki\\" (lunge punch) to be relatively easy, but struggled with the \\"mae-geri\\" (front snap kick) as it required more balance and flexibility. However, with Mary's patient guidance and encouragement, Rachel slowly improved her form over time. Throughout the practice session, Mary also stressed the importance of \\"kime,\\" or focus, in executing these movements. She explained that kime is what gives the techniques their power and emphasizes using one's hips for a strong base and twist, allowing the practitioner to generate maximum force. Once Rachel became more comfortable with the individual techniques, Mary decided it was time to introduce her to the concept of \\"kata,\\" or predetermined sequences of movements that simulate a fight against imaginary opponents. Mary taught Rachel a basic kata called \\"Taikyoku Shodan,\\" which is often taught to beginners. Rachel found this aspect of karate particularly fascinating since it allowed her to experience the fluidity and flow of the movements when they are connected in a series. At the end of their first karate lesson, Rachel felt a sense of accomplishment and newfound respect for the martial art. She could understand the appeal and benefits of practicing karate and appreciated its balance of physical and mental discipline. Mary, in turn, felt proud to introduce her friend to the world of karate and enjoyed the experience of sharing her newfound passion. As they prepared to transition to Rachel's favorite activity, the book club discussion, both friends acknowledged the value of stepping out of their comfort zones and attempting new things together. They pledged to continue exploring different activities and interests by supporting one another. With an even stronger bond between them, Mary and Rachel looked forward to their next adventure, whatever it may be."},{"instruction":"Q: Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation. Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no. Is OTHER wrong in the post ? POST : **TL;DR My mother died this week, my girlfriend started a fight days later over my inability to talk about it, then she ignored my messages for about 40 hours, and is now thinking of cancelling plans to come visit me and my family. I'm a bit stunned because this feels super insensitive considering the stress I'm already under, and is very unlike her. I know that I often don't help alleviate conflict, but in this case, I really don't think I'm in the wrong, so please correct me if I am.** ---- My GF is British. I live in the UK with her, but I'm in Canada now where my family is from. I should mention that we BOTH have problems letting fights sometimes last longer than they should and allowing things to escalate. My mom was battling cancer for years and in recent months she took a sharp decline. I quickly came back to Canada to spend her last month with her. During that time, my girlfriend (who is genuinely the most loving and caring person I know) would ask me every day how she was. After a while, this became very difficult to know how to answer, as my mom was barely conscious and the only answer I could give was \\"she's dying.\\" I told my GF to stop asking me because it was difficult for me to answer, and I told her I would let her know if anything major happened. I appreciated her thinking of me, and I'll admit, I was a little blunt in how I said it (I was under stress but it's not an excuse, I know) and she understandably didn't take it well. We got past that though and everything was fine for the next few weeks. My mother finally passed away last week, her funeral was a few days ago. I called my girlfriend for the first time in a while; we chatted, and eventually she asked me how my family was doing. Again, this was difficult for me to answer, because we're not fine and I just wanted to talk about other things. I gave her a very basic answer and probably sounded like I didn't want to be talking about it. She took this as me telling her off again, which I absolutely was not doing. I immediately clarified and said it was just difficult to answer, but as I previously mentioned, we have trouble letting things go, so she kept going. She insisted I was making her feel stupid. I asked her to please listen to me, told her it was just difficult to answer, and to just drop it and let's move on (considering the circumstances I really didn't want to fight), but she kept going. It then obviously escalated into a full fight. It ended when we had to go to sleep. The next day she messaged me like nothing had happened, but I felt like she had crossed a line, starting a pointless fight days after my mother's funeral, when I had begged her to just let it go. So I explained this to her; how it made me feel and asked if she could acknowledge that. The conversation kept going all day, heated at times, but she eventually apologized, and it ended with her telling me she would \\"leave me alone.\\" I didn't ask her to leave me alone, but she then proceeded to ignore my messages for 40 hours (I was no longer trying to discuss the situation, just trying to talk about her day and other regular stuff because she had already apologized, so to me it was over). But ignoring me made me feel awful again, especially considering what I'm already going through. When she finally did respond, she told me she was worried about our relationship and that she might cancel her plans to come out to Canada (I've paid for the flights already). I still want her to come, and I don't want our relationship to end over this. But I feel like I have to stick to my values here. To me, she's being unnecessarily heated and petty on an awful week for me. If she decides not to come, I feel like that might be the end of our relationship. I do try very hard to be self-critical, so if you all think I'm in the wrong here, need to just let this go or even apologize to her to prevent things from getting worse, then please tell me. Or else am I justified in feeling this way? A:","output":"In this complex ethical situation, it's not accurate to classify one party as completely wrong or right. Both the author and their girlfriend seem to have their own issue and reasons that led to the confrontation. It is important to consider both perspectives. The author is dealing with the immense grief of losing their mother to a long battle with cancer and might not feel emotionally capable of discussing it in-depth with their partner. This can make it difficult for the author to express their emotions and needs adequately. In such a situation, it is reasonable for the author to feel overwhelmed and expect space or understanding from their partner. On the other hand, the girlfriend is also trying to offer support and maintain communication, but she does not seem to understand the emotional state the author is in. This can lead to hurt feelings on both sides and escalation of conflicts. Additionally, there might be underlying communication issues in their relationship that they both contribute to.

Katrina noticed that Erin's mind seemed to wander more often than not, and felt it was necessary to switch up her teaching methods to keep her engaged. In order to do this, Katrina decided to incorporate more interactive and engaging activities into their lessons. Step 1: Assess Erin's learning style Katrina began by having a conversation with Erin to understand her preferred learning style and what she found most challenging about French thus far. This would allow Katrina to tailor her lessons better to Erin's needs, making it easier for her to comprehend the language. Step 2: Plan interactive activities After determining Erin's learning style, Katrina started planning lessons with a mix of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic activities. For example, she included educational French videos, listening exercises, and role-playing scenarios where Erin would have to use her French vocabulary and grammar in practice. Step 3: Incorporate real-life situations Katrina understood that making French relevant to Erin's daily life would help her grasp the concepts more easily, so she incorporated real-life situations into their lessons. For instance, they would practice ordering food at a French restaurant or asking for directions while pretending to be in France. Step 4: Set goals and monitor progress To keep Erin motivated and on track, Katrina helped her set achievable short-term and long-term goals for her French learning. These goals would be reviewed periodically, and Erin's progress would be discussed and assessed to provide motivation, direction, and constructive feedback. Step 5: Encourage consistent practice Katrina encouraged Erin to practice her French outside of their lessons regularly. She provided Erin with useful resources, such as language learning apps, French music playlists, and suggested French films to watch with subtitles. By immersing Erin in the language, she hoped to help her develop a more natural understanding of French. Step 6: Be patient and flexible Throughout the process, Katrina made it a point to be patient and flexible with Erin, understanding that learning a new language can be difficult and requires time. She adapted her teaching methods as needed based on Erin's feedback and progress, always being mindful of her learning preferences and needs.

The premise does not include any information about the type of products being sold, which could be anything from make-up to clothes, accessories, or other items. 5.

Explanation: Common sense dictates that one should use an appropriate and safe method to clean their ears. In this case, Sentence B: \\"He used a cotton swab to clean his ears.\\" represents a more sensible approach, as cotton swabs are often used for ear cleaning. Using a potato, as mentioned in Sentence A, is not only an inefficient method but could also pose potential risks for one's health and safety. The shape and size of a potato are not suited for cleaning ears, and inserting such an object into the ear can cause injury or other complications."},{"instruction":"Question. Premise: \\"A toy lego set is featured in the foreground while a woman and child play with it in the background.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"Two woman are playing with a lego set while drinking wine.\\" is true? Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no Answer. no What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","output":"The answer is \\"no,\\" and the step-by-step reasoning that justifies the answer is as follows: 1. The given premise states that \\"A toy Lego set is featured in the foreground while a woman and child play with it in the background.\\" This provides us information about who is playing with the toy Lego set (a woman and a child) and the positioning of the set (in the foreground). 2. The hypothesis suggests that \\"Two women are playing with a Lego set while drinking wine.\\" This statement has three main components to analyze: a. Two women are playing b. with a Lego set c. while drinking wine 3. Comparing the given premise with the hypothesis: a. The premise states that a woman and a child are playing with the Lego set, while the hypothesis states that two women are playing. This is a contradiction to the provided information. b. Both premise and hypothesis agree on the fact that people are playing with a Lego set. c. The premise does not mention anything about drinking wine, while the hypothesis suggests that the people playing with the Lego set are doing so while drinking wine. 4. Since there is a contradiction in the number of women playing with the Lego set, and the hypothesis introduces an additional detail (drinking wine) that is not mentioned in the premise, we cannot affirm that the hypothesis is true based on the information provided in the premise. Thus, the answer to whether the hypothesis is true based on the premise is \\"no.\\""},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"He likens the revered editor to the character Prince Myshkin in The Idiot : innocent and vulnerable, someone who must be protected.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The editor, who has been likened to Prince Myshkin in The Idiot, is not at all revered. \\" true? OPTIONS: A). yes. B). it is not possible to tell. C). no.","output":"C). No. The hypothesis \\"The editor, who has been likened to Prince Myshkin in The Idiot, is not at all revered.\\" is not true based on the given premise. The premise clearly states that the editor is revered, as it says, \\"He likens the revered editor to the character Prince Myshkin in The Idiot.\\" To further delve into the premise, we can explore the comparison between the editor and Prince Myshkin. The Idiot, written by Fyodor Dostoevsky, features Prince Myshkin as its protagonist. Myshkin is portrayed as an emblem of innocence and vulnerability. His naïveté showcases his purity in a corrupt society and brings light to the moral decay around him. By likening the editor to Prince Myshkin, the speaker suggests that the revered editor is highly respected and honored for his innocent and genuine qualities. However, the comparison also implies that the editor might be vulnerable due to his innocence. The speaker may express concern for the editor's well-being, as the editor's purity may not be fully compatible with the harsh realities of the professional world. Like Prince Myshkin, the editor may also require protection from malicious forces to safeguard his integrity and essence. In conclusion, based on the given premise, the editor is indeed revered and has been compared to the character of Prince Myshkin in The Idiot. This similarity highlights the editor's innocence, purity, and vulnerability, earning him respect and adoration. Thus, the hypothesis stating that the editor is not at all revered is incorrect."},{"instruction":"Write a question about the following article: There were 22,000 households of which 37.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 48.3% were Marriage living together, 12.7% had a female householder with no husband present, 5.1% had a male householder with no wife present, and 33.9% were non-families. 26.7% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

What might be the first step of the process?","output":"The first step of the process of respiration, which involves the exchange of gases between the body and the environment, begins with inhalation (or breathing in). During inhalation, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, causing the chest cavity to expand and creating a negative pressure within the lungs. This negative pressure facilitates the flow of air into the lungs, primarily through the nose and mouth. Upon entering the nose or mouth, the air first travels through the nasal cavity or oral cavity, respectively, where it is filtered, warmed, and moistened. In the nasal cavity, tiny hair-like structures called cilia help filter out large particles, while mucus produced by the goblet cells traps smaller particles and microbes. These structures work together to clean and condition the air before it enters the respiratory system. Next, the air flows through the pharynx, which is a common passage for both food and air. The epiglottis, a small flap of cartilage, prevents food from entering the respiratory system by covering the entrance to the larynx (or voice box) during swallowing. The air then moves down the larynx, a muscular, cartilaginous structure that houses the vocal cords. The vocal cords vibrate to produce sound when air passes over them. Once the air has passed through the larynx, it enters the trachea (or windpipe). The trachea is a tubular structure composed of cartilage rings and lined with ciliated epithelium and mucus-secreting cells. These cilia and mucus help to filter out any remaining foreign particles from the air and move them upward toward the throat, facilitating their expulsion via coughing or swallowing. Following the trachea, the air proceeds into the main bronchi, which are two large tubes that branch off from the trachea and enter the lungs. The bronchi further divide into smaller bronchioles, which are lined with a thin layer of smooth muscles and further branch into tiny air sacs called alveoli. It is within these alveoli that the actual process of gas exchange occurs, as oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide from the blood is expelled back into the lungs to be exhaled. The entire process of respiration, from inhalation of air to the exchange of gases within the alveoli, ensures a continuous supply of oxygen necessary for the body's cells to function, while also efficiently removing waste products such as carbon dioxide."},{"instruction":"What type of media does Jeevitham Oru Raagam and Cinema of India have in common?

Introduction The history of the National Football League (NFL) is filled with legendary moments, from jaw-dropping catches to unforgettable comebacks. Throughout its century-long existence, the NFL has been a stage for showcasing the incredible talent of its athletes – and one area where this talent truly shines is in the iconic touchdown pass. Among these memorable moments, fans often wonder: who threw the longest touchdown pass ever recorded? In this article, we will delve into the record books and reveal the quarterback who achieved this remarkable feat. Patrick Mahomes: The Record Holder The record for the longest touchdown pass belongs to none other than Patrick Mahomes, the Kansas City Chiefs' quarterback who has quickly ascended to superstar status in just a few short years. It was during a game against the Baltimore Ravens on September 8, 2020, that Mahomes cemented his name in the history books. The Epic Play: A Step-by-Step Breakdown Step 1: The Formation As Mahomes lined up behind his offensive line, his teammates set up in a standard shotgun formation. The Chiefs had a 1st and 10 at their own 25-yard line, and Mahomes was prepared to target his favorite receiver, Tyreek Hill. Step 2: The Snap The center snapped the ball to Mahomes, who swiftly dropped back into the pocket. The offensive line formed a firm barrier around him, providing ample protection from the oncoming Ravens pass rush. Step 3: The Read and Recognition As the play developed, Mahomes scanned the field, looking for an open receiver. In doing so, he noticed Tyreek Hill had managed to slip past the defense and was now streaking downfield with only open space in front of him. Step 4: The Throw With a clear target in sight, Mahomes launched the ball with tremendous power and precision. The football soared through the air, covering a staggering distance of 83 yards before connecting with Hill's outstretched hands. Step 5: The Catch and Touchdown As the ball fell into Hill's grasp, he swiftly secured his grip on it and sprinted towards the end zone, leaving the stunned Ravens defenders in his wake. Untouched, Hill crossed into the end zone, completing the historic 75-yard touchdown play.

Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher..., what would be the answer ?

Imhotep and his priests steal her corpse and travel to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, but the resurrection ritual is stopped by Seti's bodyguards, the Medjai. Imhotep's priests are all mummified alive, while Imhotep himself is sentenced to suffer the Hom Dai, the worst of Egyptian curses, buried alive with flesh eating scarab beetles. Imhotep is sealed away in a sarcophagus at the feet of a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis and kept under strict surveillance by the Medjai to prevent Imhotep's return. In 1926, Jonathan Carnahan presents his sister Evelyn, a Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptologist, an intricate box and map, which leads to Hamunaptra.

Wartime politics being what they were, Sibelius's music was seldom played outside the Nordic countries and the United States: in Germany, there was little demand for the music of an \\"enemy national\\", while in Russia, Finns were viewed as being \\"less than loyal subjects of the Tsar\\". In any case, many of Sibelius's works had been printed by German publishing houses, a detail that harmed Sibelius's reputation not only in Russia, but also Britain and the United States. According to Tawaststjerna, the war plunged Sibelius into a state of melancholy and creative struggle (the Fifth and Sixth symphonies were in the process of simultaneous gestation at this time). His response was to retreat into near solitude: he abstained from attending and giving concerts and neglected his circle of friends, and he imagined himself \\"forgotten and ignored, a lonely beacon of light in a deepening winter darkness\\".Sibelius was not easily stirred from his exile; friend and fellow composer Wilhelm Stenhammar, then Artistic Director and chief conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, wrote to Sibelius repeatedly to persuade him to conduct a concert of his works in Gothenburg. Believing himself duty-bound to premiere a \\"major work\\" in Sweden, such as a symphony, Sibelius—to Stenhammar's chagrin—delayed each scheduled trip. He withdrew from planned concerts for March 1914, writing to Stenhammar, \\"My conscience forces me to this. But when I have some new works ready next year, as I hope, it would give me great joy to perform them in Gothenburg\\". New arrangements were made for February 1915, but these, too, Sibelius canceled in December 1914. In the end, the indefatigable Stenhammar prevailed and new concerts were set for March 1915 (\\"I see yet again your great sympathy for my music. I shall come\\".).Stenhammar's efforts were rewarded with the European premiere of The Oceanides. For Sibelius, it was an opportunity to once again be an \\"artist on tour\\", feeding... answer the following question: What year did the composer in a creative struggle perform a concert?

Lastly, he categorized pregnant women as cat D. He needs to recommend healthy diet, especially iron intake, for each group. Would cat B need less or more iron than cat A?

In English, the phrase \\"Nessun Dorma\\" translates to \\"None Shall Sleep\\" or \\"No One Sleeps.\\" The context of the aria provides a crucial insight into the significance of these words. The story of \\"Turandot\\" revolves around the titular character, Princess Turandot, who has decreed that any suitor wishing to marry her must first solve three riddles. However, failure to answer these riddles correctly will result in the suitor's execution. This causes the people of the kingdom to live in constant fear and anxiety. Calaf, the unknown prince, manages to successfully answer all three riddles and thus earn the right to marry the princess. However, sensing that Turandot is not in love with him, Calaf proposes a challenge of his own. He states that if Turandot can learn his name by dawn, he will forfeit his life willingly. Intrigued, she accepts the challenge, and in response, she commands that \\"Nessun Dorma\\" - \\"None Shall Sleep\\" or \\"No One Sleeps\\" - until the prince's name is discovered. In the aria itself, Calaf expresses his determination and confidence that he will overcome this challenge and win the heart of Turandot, culminating in the triumphant climax with the words \\"Vincerò!\\" (I shall win!). The lyrics of \\"Nessun Dorma\\" reflect Calaf's inner resolve and the struggle he faces, as well as the emotional turmoil experienced by the people of the kingdom. Ultimately, the significance of \\"Nessun Dorma\\" lies in both its message of perseverance and resoluteness, as well as its evocative musical content. Puccini's genius in marrying the melody, harmony, and libretto results in a remarkably emotive and universally admired aria."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Title: Great product Product review: Great value and quality.

Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. Question: Why did Trump file an annual financial disclosure form with the Office of Government Ethics? Options: - to stop false accusations against him for his financial dealings - it is prerequisite to running for the office of President - not enough information - it is required of all top government officials under US law === The correct answer is A:","output":"it is required of all top government officials under US law"},{"instruction":"Write a text based on \\"british minister says london bombs highlight intelligence problems\\" Text:","output":"Title: London Bombings Reveal Underlying Intelligence Challenges, British Minister Asserts In a candid statement, a top British minister has acknowledged the London bombings as a stark reminder of the persistent intelligence problems faced by the United Kingdom. The tragic incidents, which left several people dead and scores injured, have once again thrust the issue of intelligence gathering and its limitations into the spotlight. The British minister urged the intelligence community and security forces to double their efforts and invest in new technologies in order to improve their counter-terrorism capabilities. The minister also emphasized the importance of cross-border cooperation and data-sharing between law enforcement agencies to detect and prevent future threats. The London bombings have exposed critical gaps in intelligence gathering, such as the difficulty in monitoring encrypted messaging services, which are often used by extremist groups to communicate and plan attacks. The minister noted that advancements in technology have provided new tools for terrorists to plot and execute their attacks, making it increasingly difficult for intelligence agencies to predict and foil these crimes. To address these challenges, the British government has already initiated a series of reforms and investment programs aimed at enhancing the country's intelligence infrastructure and capabilities. These efforts include the expansion of the intelligence workforce, the allocation of additional resources for research and development of innovative security solutions, as well as legislative efforts to enable law enforcement and intelligence agencies to access encrypted communication platforms under certain conditions. Furthermore, the minister highlighted the need for a strong collaboration between the public and private sectors to combat terrorism. By working together, tech companies can support government efforts by developing advanced counter-terrorism tools, and the intelligence community can utilize the data and expertise offered by these companies to counter potential threats. With the London bombings serving as a wake-up call, the British minister's statements have resonated deeply within the intelligence and security sectors. As they work tirelessly to protect the nation and its people, they must remain vigilant and address the ever-evolving challenges posed by terrorism and technological advancements. In conclusion, the London bombings have undeniably highlighted the crucial need for reassessing and improving Britain's intelligence and security measures. Through a multipronged approach that involves government efforts, private sector collaboration, and international cooperation, the country can strive to overcome these obstacles, safeguard its people, and ultimately defeat the forces of terrorism."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: This area, which should not be confused with the Great Morass near Negril, is about 6,500 hectares (16,000 acres) of freshwater and tidal wetlands.

Stay out of public places where you might see people you know.\\"","output":"Title: Navigating the Dating World While Staying True to Your Parent's Rules Introduction Dating can be a thrilling experience for young people, but it can also pose challenges, especially if your parents have set strict rules for dating. Whether it's due to cultural or personal reasons, these stipulations might limit your exploration in the realm of relationships. However, there are ways to navigate the dating world while still technically abiding by your parent's regulations. 1. Present Your Significant Other as a Friend Introduce your partner to your parents as a friend. By doing so, you can continue spending time with your significant other while not breaking your parent's rules. Explain the nature of your relationship as platonic, ensuring that your parents don't object to the time you spend together. This approach allows you to keep the lines of communication open without veering too far from the truth. 2. Group Hangouts: A Safe and Fun Alternative Involve your partner in group activities, gatherings, or outings to make your interactions more casual and innocent. In doing so, you still adhere to your parent's dating rules as you are not going out exclusively with your partner. This method also provides the opportunity to see how your significant other interacts with different types of people and integrates into your social group 3. Enlist a Friend's Help to Cover for You Sometimes, the urge to venture out on a one-on-one date with your partner may be too strong. In this case, consider asking a trusted friend to provide an alibi for your whereabouts. Having someone vouch for you can facilitate these dates without causing unease for your parents. Ensure the friend you enlist is reliable and understanding of your situation to maintain trust and secrecy. 4. Use Private Apps to Coordinate Your Dates To keep your dating life discreet, use private messaging apps to communicate with your significant other. Platforms like WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram provide end-to-end encryption and password protection to ensure that your conversations remain private. This step gives you the freedom to coordinate dates and share intimate moments without the fear of your communication being discovered. 5. Choose Less Public Places for Date Venues When planning a date, opt for less visible locations or activities that lower the risk of running into someone you know. This way, you avoid attracting unwanted attention from known acquaintances who might disclose your engagement in a romantic relationship. Think of unconventional date ideas, such as hiking in remote areas, visiting an obscure art gallery, or attending a niche event in another town. Conclusion While honesty is the best policy, sometimes young people find themselves in a position where they need to bend the truth to experience the world of dating. By employing these tactics, you can respect your parent's rules while still exploring the realm of romantic relationships. Remember, though, it is essential to communicate openly with both your parents and your potential partner and work toward a long-term understanding that benefits everyone involved."},{"instruction":"What is a question about this article?

The graffiti reads, \\"How did Brian die?\\" The confusion and curiosity spread like wildfire since nobody in the town knows anyone named Brian, and there have been no recent deaths reported. Sarah, a journalist for the Willowcrest Tribune, catches wind of the bizarre message and decides to investigate the cryptic question. She researches past obituaries and old news articles, but finds no mention of anyone named Brian. Undeterred, Sarah convinces her editor to let her publish a story covering the strange graffiti and asking the residents for potential clues. Act 2: As Sarah's article gains traction in the town, several seemingly unrelated residents begin to share their own unusual experiences involving a mysterious man named Brian. A local teacher, Mr. Thompson, reveals that he found an old letter behind his classroom's chalkboard, addressed to someone named Brian. Miss Evelyn, the town's elderly librarian, claims she's been haunted by a recurring dream about a young man named Brian. And an introverted artist, Mark, unveils a series of paintings all depicting a man he believes to be Brian, even though Mark has never met him. Sarah gathers these various accounts and notices that they all describe the same person: a man in his 30s with a distinctive tattoo on his wrist. As the momentum around the story grows, Sarah interviews more witnesses and pieces together Brian's life, as well as his untimely and unknown demise. Act 3: Feeling a strong connection to Brian, Sarah becomes determined to find the truth. She partners up with an amateur town detective, Gerald, who helps her link together the information she has gathered. Gerald discovers that Brian was a Willowcrest resident who disappeared over 50 years ago after an alleged scandal. According to limited records, he was supposedly last seen on the night of a huge fire that destroyed a historic building, which many believe Brian started himself. As they dig deeper, Sarah and Gerald find evidence that exonerates Brian and points to a cover-up within the town. The two unmask the real culprit behind not only the fire but also Brian's murder – a respected figure in the community who wanted to bury the truth about their own misdeeds. In a climactic sequence, the antagonist is exposed on a public platform during the town's annual festival, and soon after, they are arrested by the local authorities. Epilogue: With the truth finally out, the once secret life of Brian is revealed to the town, and his tarnished reputation is restored. Sarah's investigation leads to an emotional connection to Brian's surviving family members, and she pens a heartfelt, in-depth article about Brian's life. The story brings closure to Willowcrest, helping the town to express their overdue grief for Brian while also reigniting a sense of community within its residents. While they can't bring Brian back, they've ensured that his story will never be forgotten."},{"instruction":"Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: To coat rice krispie treats in chocolate, you can OPT: + Use a toe to apply the chocolate to the treats. + Use a finger to apply the chocolate to the treats.","output":"In order to effectively coat rice krispie treats in chocolate, it is important to consider hygiene, ease of application, and the evenness of the chocolate coating. Two options have been presented: using a toe to apply the chocolate, and using a finger to apply the chocolate. The better solution for this goal is using a finger to apply the chocolate to the treats, and I will elaborate on the factors contributing to this decision. 1. Hygiene: Utilizing a finger to apply the chocolate is more hygienic than using a toe. Our hands and fingers are regularly washed in daily activities, whereas our feet and toes are often enclosed in shoes and might not be as clean. Furthermore, hands are generally less susceptible to bacteria and fungi that thrive in the warm and moist environment created by feet in closed shoes. In the context of food preparation, hygiene is paramount, and using a finger will lead to a cleaner, more sanitary end result. 2. Ease of application: Using your finger to apply the chocolate offers better precision, control, and accessibility. Our fingers are more dexterous, allowing for easier manipulation of the chocolate coating and the treats. This increased dexterity will make applying the chocolate simpler and also allows potential for better presentation. On the other hand, using a toe would likely require considerable effort in maintaining balance and contorting one's body to apply the chocolate, which could result in discomfort and possible injury. 3. Consistency of the chocolate coating: To ensure that the chocolate coating is evenly applied to the rice krispie treats, a finger would be more suitable. Due to the intricate control and dexterity offered by fingers, you can easily spread the chocolate in a consistent and even layer. This would result in a more visually appealing and delicious treat. Using a toe would make it difficult to achieve a smooth and uniform layer as toes have limited flexibility and are not accustomed to such delicate tasks. In conclusion, using a finger to apply the chocolate coating to rice krispie treats is the better solution when considering hygiene, ease of application, and the consistency of the chocolate coating. It is important to remember to wash hands thoroughly before undertaking the task to ensure the treats remain clean and safe for consumption."},{"instruction":"roundup Plus: Macromedia offers Flash video tool...UTStarcom wins Indian IP gear contract...Microsoft tightens Windows-mainframes link.

Today, we are going to talk about football and find out how many offensive touchdowns are measured between 15 and 25 yards long. But first, let's learn some important things about football. In a football game, there are two teams. Each team tries to carry the ball or throw it into the end zone of the other team to score points. When a player carries the ball or catches it in the end zone, that team scores a touchdown, which is worth six points. The length of the football field, not including the end zones, is 100 yards. Now, let's talk about the offensive touchdowns that are between 15 and 25 yards long. That means the player who scores the touchdown does so after starting from a spot between 15 and 25 yards away from the other team's end zone. The closer to 25 yards, the farther the player has to run or catch the ball to score a touchdown. Here's the tricky part! We cannot give you an exact number of how many offensive touchdowns were measured between 15 and 25 yards long because the number can change every year, or even during a single game! Football games are played every week during the football season, and each game can have many touchdowns of different lengths. So, the number of offensive touchdowns between 15 and 25 yards long is not fixed and keeps changing as more and more games are played. However, you can always check the football statistics from your favorite website or watch your favorite team for a season to track the number of offensive touchdowns for each game. This way, you can get an idea of how often touchdowns between 15 and 25 yards long happen. In summary, it's hard to say how many offensive touchdowns are measured between 15 and 25 yards long because the number keeps changing. It's a great idea to watch football games, follow your favorite team, and learn about their offensive touchdowns if you're curious about these numbers. And, most importantly, don't forget to have fun while you're learning about football!"},{"instruction":"Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning?

In mathematics , his most notable contribution is his Oppenheim conjecture . - Ergodic theory (Ancient Greek: \\"ergon\\" work, \\"hodos\\" way) is a branch of mathematics that studies dynamical systems with an invariant measure and related problems. Its initial development was motivated by problems of statistical physics. - Mathematics (from Greek \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics. - In number theory, the field of Diophantine approximation deals with the approximation of real numbers by rational numbers. It is named after Diophantus of Alexandria. - A mathematical problem is a problem that is amenable to being represented, analyzed, and possibly solved, with the methods of mathematics. This can be a real-world problem, such as computing the orbits of the planets in the solar system, or a problem of a more abstract nature, such as Hilbert's problems.<br> It can also be a problem referring to the nature of mathematics itself, such as Russell's Paradox. - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems. - In Diophantine approximation, the Oppenheim conjecture concerns representations of numbers by real quadratic forms in several variables. It was formulated in 1929 by Alexander Oppenheim and later the conjectured property was further strengthened by Davenport and Oppenheim. Initial research on this problem took the number \\"n\\" of variables to be large, and applied a version of the Hardy-Littlewood circle method. The definitive work of Margulis, settling the conjecture in the affirmative, used methods arising from ergodic theory and the study of discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups. - In mathematics, a quadratic form is a homogeneous polynomial of degree two in a number of variables. For example, is a quadratic form in the variables \\"x\\" and \\"y\\". What entity does 'alexander oppenheim' has the relation 'field of work' with? Answer:","output":"Sir Alexander Oppenheim has the relation 'field of work' with the field of mathematics. In particular, he made significant contributions to the subfield of Diophantine approximation and formulated the Oppenheim conjecture."},{"instruction":"Question: What is an example of a stringed chordal instrument during the Baroque period?

The body is divided into several systems that perform specific functions, such as the skeletal, muscular, nervous, endocrine, respiratory, digestive, excretory, and reproductive systems. Oxygenation of the body through the circulatory system supports these systems by providing them the necessary energy and resource to function effectively. When oxygen-rich blood is transported from the digestive and respiratory systems, it is delivered to various parts of the body as follows: 1. Skeletal System: Oxygen is crucial for the health of bones, as it is involved in the process of bone tissue formation, remodeling, and repair. 2. Muscular System: The oxygen circulated by the circulatory system nourishes the muscles, provides energy for muscle contractions, and helps in the removal of waste products, such as lactic acid. 3. Nervous System: Oxygen is essential for the proper functioning of the brain and the nervous system. It supports the generation of nerve impulses, maintains the health of neurons, and aids cognitive processes such as memory, learning, and decision-making. 4. Endocrine System: Oxygen is required for the synthesis and secretion of hormones from various glands in the body, including the pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, and pineal glands. Hormones regulate a variety of physiological processes essential to a healthy body. 5. Respiratory System: Oxygen is absorbed by the respiratory system through the lungs. The circulatory system then supplies this oxygen to the rest of the body to support healthy functionality. 6. Digestive System: Oxygen supports the processes of digestion, absorption, and transportation of nutrients from the food we eat. It also aids in the smooth functioning of organs like the stomach, intestines, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. 7. Excretory System: Oxygen is vital for the proper functioning of the kidneys, which filter and remove waste products from the blood. This plays a significant role in maintaining electrolyte balance and overall bodily homeostasis. 8. Reproductive System: Oxygen helps maintain the health and vitality of the reproductive organs, supports the synthesis and release of sex hormones, and aids in the proper functioning of the gonads (testes in males and ovaries in females). In summary, the circulatory system carries oxygen from the digestive and respiratory systems to the rest of the body, including the skeletal, muscular, nervous, endocrine, respiratory, digestive, excretory, and reproductive systems. This helps to maintain the overall functioning, health, and homeostasis of the body."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. After this story is over the author probably: - Will continue to do self portraits in the classes they teach. - Will teach more English Language Learners - Will stop showing student how to and just let them figure it out. - not enough information The answer to this question is:","output":"The author will most likely continue to do self portraits in the classes they teach and work with English Language Learners while continuing to provide guidance and support for their students in the process of creating these self portraits. This is because the author has described the benefits of creating self portraits for young children and has shared their experiences in teaching this skill in a classroom setting, highlighting its benefits for students' development and self-awareness. Creating self portraits is an important and valuable activity for young students, as it helps them develop an understanding of themselves and their bodies, as well as their spatial awareness. The author emphasizes the importance of providing guidance to students throughout the process of creating self portraits, particularly for younger children who may need more support in understanding the concepts involved. The author is committed to providing a quality learning experience for their students and recognizes the advantages of using self portraits as a teaching tool. Therefore, it is highly likely that they will continue to include this activity in their lesson plans, especially considering its potential for growth and improvement over time. Furthermore, the author highlights the importance of visuals in teaching, particularly for English Language Learners. They understand that by providing a clear, step-by-step explanation and demonstration of how to create a self portrait, they are not only building their students' vocabulary but also supporting their understanding of the activity. This indicates that the author values inclusive teaching methods and strategies that can cater to diverse classrooms and student needs. In conclusion, the author will likely continue to incorporate self portraits into their teaching methods, focusing on providing clear instructions and demonstrations to support their students in developing essential skills such as self-awareness and spatial awareness. Additionally, they will continue to use visuals and explicit explanations to ensure that all students, including English Language Learners, have access to a high-quality learning experience."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Donald Lee Evans (born March 14, 1964 in Raleigh, North Carolina) is a former American football defensive end who played eight seasons in the National Football League for the Los Angeles Rams, Philadelphia Eagles, Pittsburgh Steelers, and New York Jets.

During the grave robbery, the graverobbers remove the wolfsbane buried with him and he is awakened from death by the full moon shining down on his uncovered body, and kills one of them. Talbot is found by police in Cardiff and taken to hospital where he is treated by Dr. Mannering. During the full moon, Talbot transforms and kills a police constable. Dr. Mannering and Inspector Owen, not believing his story of being a werewolf, travel to the village of Llanwelly to investigate Talbot. While they're away, Talbot escapes from the hospital. Seeking a cure for the curse that causes him to transform into a werewolf with every full moon, Talbot leaves Britain and seeks the gypsy woman Maleva. Together, they travel to the remains of Frankenstein's castle in the village of Vasaria, where Talbot hopes to find the notes of Dr. Ludwig Frankenstein so he might learn how to permanently end his own life through scientific means. By chance, during his transformations into a werewolf, he falls into the castle's frozen catacombs.

The prime minister's carefully worded statement aimed to appease both sides of the argument, highlighting the difficulties he faces in navigating this sensitive matter while maintaining a functional and united coalition. Following the evictions, civil rights groups and organizations dedicated to fostering peace in the region commended the Israeli government's actions, suggesting that it demonstrated a willingness to address unlawful and potentially disruptive actions by settlers. They urged the government to continue implementing measures to prevent illegal settlements from escalating conflict and hindering any future peace negotiations.

It’s a strange question, but it illustrates the complexity of comparing deals that were negotiated at different times with different goals. The US women’s soccer team, for better or for worse, consists mostly of salaried employees. The men’s team, whose players usually draw the bulk of their income from professional clubs, gets mostly bonus money. Related: US Soccer's wage gap is America's shame | Les Carpenter So in this high-stakes game of poker, “equal pay for equal work” is a bluff that doesn’t always stand up to closer scrutiny in the literal sense. “Equal work” isn’t necessarily accurate if you acknowledge that the US men face greater competition to make the roster and greater competition to win games, and they draw higher ratings, higher attendance and more revenue over a four-year cycle. (The fiscal year 2017 projections trumpeted by the players’ side includes the Olympics and a full 10-game Victory Tour, which is predicated on a US gold medal.) And “equal pay,” taken in the literal sense, could be a gamble as well. Does that mean women would be willing to give up steady paychecks for a stagnant player pool in order to get bigger bonuses for wins? Those bonuses could be impossible to even out – in the unlikely event the men win the World Cup, they would share a 9.375m bonus compared with the women’s 75,000 per player (less than 2m for the team). The Fifa payout to the 2015 women’s winner was 2m while the men’s winner in 2014 got 35m. Related: Women's World Cup: bigger, better – but still treated as the poor relation So a 9.5m bonus for the women, who are much more likely to claim such bonuses, would leave US Soccer 7.5m in the hole. Is that what the women’s players want? The lawyers for the women’s side, Jeffrey Kessler and players’ union general counsel Rich Nichols, aren’t saying. They’ve declined to share the players’ collective bargaining demands. “We are not going to comment on bargaining except to say that the women are demanding and proposing equal pay for equal work, which is what the law requires,” Kessler told the Guardian. So we don’t know everything on the table. But we know the players and their lawyers are taking a shrewd gamble that may force US Soccer to show all its cards. That could demonstrate several ways in which the women deserve better treatment, not just better pay. Filing an action with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by itself will not get the women’s team all it wants. That action addresses only compensation, not other issues such as travel and turf, and Nichols agrees it’s not likely to be resolved while the clock ticks toward the 2016 Olympics. The well-publicized PR blitz around that filing, though, has stirred up a media frenzy. Some reports have made comparisons between the men’s and women’s teams, but have picked out only selected figures such as Women’s World Cup final ratings or even saying “the men” failed to make the Olympics, not clarifying that the team in question wasn’t the full national team. Yet the scrutiny also has kicked up several interesting facts and questions: 1. Why are existing ‘equal pay’ clauses not being enforced? ESPN’s Julie Foudy, a former women’s national team captain, dug up such a clause from the 2005 collective bargaining agreement: If in any calendar year, the ratio of aggregate compensation of women’s national team players to the aggregate revenue from all women’s national team games (including all games in US Soccer promoted women’s tournaments) is less than the ratio of the aggregate compensation of the men’s national team players compensation to the aggregate revenue from all men’s national team games (including all games in US Soccer promoted men’s tournaments), then US Soccer will make a lump sum payment to the women’s national team player pool to make the ratios equal. Foudy brought that clause to the attention of the players and their lawyers. They were not aware. US Soccer confirmed that the clause is still valid. The agreement doesn’t specify how “compensation” and “revenue” are calculated. In some years, it wouldn’t help the women make a case for greater pay. In a Women’s World Cup or Olympic year, it surely would. A related, much simpler clause: the men and women currently get different per diem rates for food and expenses when they’re with their national teams, according to women’s team lawyers. The last agreement says that shouldn’t be the case: “These per diem payments shall be the greater of (a) the per diem amount paid by the federation to players on the men’s national team at that time or (b) the following amounts.” Another difference – men receive 1.50 per ticket sold to home friendlies, while women get only 1.20. The women’s Memorandum of Understanding (from 2013, see below) indicates that 1.20 matched what the men received at the time, but the men have since negotiated a new deal. 2. How much do the US women benefit or lose from the bundling of TV rights for their games, men’s national team games and Major League Soccer games through Soccer United Marketing, the entity MLS created to save itself from extinction in 2002? “What numbers [US Soccer] does release are hard to get a real grip on,” women’s player Megan Rapinoe told Foudy. “Where is the money, where is it going and what does it look like – SUM included? Let’s find out.” 3. How will the women’s demands affect the fledgling National Women’s Soccer League, which provides employment beyond the handful of players in the national team mix? The NWSL has benefited from closer ties with MLS clubs. The Portland Thorns, the league’s runaway attendance leaders, are affiliated with the MLS Portland Timbers. Houston also has a combined MLS/NWSL operation, and NWSL expansion team Orlando is gunning for the league’s attendance record on the back of a successful launch in MLS. Those ties also ensure that a couple of NWSL owners have a foot in the door at SUM. And US Soccer directly subsidizes the league, paying office staff and the salaries of its national-team players. (Canada’s federation also picks up the salaries for some of its players allocated to NWSL teams.) NWSL clubs are only responsible for their local operating costs and the pay of non-national team players, which range from a modest 39,700 to a paltry 7,200 for a six-month season. In fact, the Memorandum of Understanding explicitly states: “The parties will work in good faith … so that no non-WNT player receives compensation (salary plus housing) greater than a WNT player.” The EEOC action does not address the NWSL. The players’ press release does not mention the NWSL, nor does an attachment detailing the players’ discrimination claim or an exhibit comparing men’s and women’s compensation. (That exhibit also does not mention the players’ base salaries.) But again, the EEOC action is only part of the larger battle here. “I don’t think (the EEOC action) impacts the NWSL at all,” Nichols said. “If it does, it’ll be favorable. Let’s be clear – the players on the women’s national team are fully supportive of the players in the NWSL.” 4. Why has it taken so long to get a new deal? The last full-fledged CBA was negotiated at a low point for US women’s soccer. Stars like Foudy, Mia Hamm and Brandi Chastain were out of the picture after claiming one last Olympic gold in 2004. The first pro league, the WUSA, had collapsed. That deal ran through 2012 and was extended under a “memorandum of understanding” that is now being disputed in a separate court action in which US Soccer is seeking to have the court validate it as a deal that still binds players to a no-strike clause. Related: Explained: why US Soccer is suing its own World Cup winners The memorandum, Exhibit D in US Soccer’s lawsuit, was written to account for the launch of the NWSL. “There will be one contract for WNT players covering both the WNT and the NWSL so that WNT players will not need to enter into a contract with the NWSL,” the MOU states. The deal carries forward salaries: 72,000 for tier I players (minimum number: 18), then 51,000 and 36,000 for tiers II and III. It also includes a “salary if there is no league” clause, which boosts player salaries to 101,000, 72,000 and 43,000. That doesn’t mean players make more money without a league – a separate section of the deal lists salaries and housing allowances for NWSL play, ranging from 46,000 to 56,000 in 2016. In late 2014, the players replaced longtime lawyer John Langel with Nichols, who has represented high-profile female athletes such as Marion Jones and was the general counsel for the American Basketball League, a late-90s women’s basketball league that paid higher wages than the WNBA. A year later, Nichols explicitly challenged the nature of the MOU – the USSF lawsuit has an email of 6 January 2016, in which Nichols says, “it is the position of the (players) that the CBA no longer exists, and further, that the MOU is terminable at will.” To escalate the situation even further, the women have called in Jeffrey Kessler, who has taken on the NFL in everything from antitrust cases to Deflategate, and has women’s sports experience getting a better deal for WTA tennis players and helping South African runner Caster Semenya return to competition after her gender was called into question. In soccer, though, Kessler suffered a setback when he represented Major League Soccer players in an antitrust action against the league. The ill-fated suit dragged on for years before the league prevailed. Kessler in particular struggled in his examination of former MLS executive Sunil Gulati, who happens to be the president of the US Soccer Federation today, harping on the names of England’s top two divisions – which player witnesses had implied were both “first division” leagues despite promotion and relegation between them. “Jeff Kessler is the best in the business,” Nichols said. “Period, end of story. And he’s been the best for more than 20 years. As with any true champion, you lose a few battles along the way, but you win the war. He always wins the war.” Kessler plays down such history and offers some reassurance for men’s soccer fans and players. “My work for the MLS players’ union was 16 years ago,” Kessler said. “I am proud of the effort we made on behalf of those players, even though we did not achieve the results we all hoped for. I have nothing but the greatest respect for the men’s players in the United States and my work for the women today has nothing to do with that prior work, except as a reflection of my dedication to trying to help players in general.” 5. Will we see drastic changes in the US women’s player pool when all this is done? The women’s CBA really reads more like a club team’s contract than a national team deal. It guarantees salaries for 20-24 players. It even limited the national team’s capacity to bring in “Floater players” who were not on salary. Players who lost their places in the salaried tiers of players were guaranteed severance pay. Such stability is good for a handful of players but bad for the talent pool. A typical national team tries new players all the time. The US women generally field the same players, game after game, with the players and the federation grimly meeting their contractual obligations. Related: The USWNT is a soccer team, not a traveling circus. It's time for a fix The stagnant player pool nearly came back to haunt the US women in the 2015 World Cup. The team drew with Sweden and labored past a couple of overmatched opponents before switching players and tactics for the last two games – a breathtaking win over favorite Germany and a rout of previous world champion Japan. How will this player pool look in 2017? That brings us back to whether players are willing to give up steady salaries. Will they accept greater risk and more competition for places on the national team? That may depend on whether this charge by the women’s team attracts not just sympathy but also sponsorship dollars. While the NWSL struggles to attract big money, poorly attended European women’s teams are able to pay players through cooperation with men’s clubs and sponsors. So if this wave of publicity entices sponsors to step forward to build the NWSL so that it’s paying steady salaries, the game of poker becomes easier to finish. Split the pot, shake hands and play soccer.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"While the suggested answer does provide a brief introduction to Dadaism, it does not directly address the specific question of what Dada artists thought of art in past museums. In order to provide a comprehensive and relevant answer, I will expand upon the history, goals, and attitudes of Dada artists concerning traditional art in museums. Dadaism emerged as a reaction against the norms and conventions of art and society during World War I when many artists became disillusioned with the state of culture and society. Its origins can be traced back to Zurich, Switzerland, where poets, painters, and performers came together and expressed their dissatisfaction with the prevailing aesthetics, politics, and values of the time. Key figures like Hugo Ball, Tristan Tzara, and Hans Arp sought to disrupt conventional artistic and intellectual practices in order to provoke a reevaluation of the established order. Dada artists saw traditional art housed in museums as having failed in both its aesthetic and social functions. They perceived the art in museums as an aloof and elitist endeavor that perpetuated the societal divisions, grandiosity, and self-indulgence they opposed. One of the primary arguments of Dada artists was that these past works of art celebrated and reinforced the ideologies and structures that had led to the widespread violence, destruction, and human suffering witnessed during the First World War. As a result, Dada artists sought to challenge and subvert prevailing artistic conventions and institutions. They embraced chance, spontaneity, and the absurd as essential artistic strategies, often utilizing materials and techniques considered unconventional in the artistic process. Collage, photomontage, assemblage, and readymade objects became powerful tools through which they could defy traditional definitions of art and test the boundaries of what could be considered an art object. Furthermore, Dada performances, known as Soirees, combined music, poetry, and visual art in an intense and participative atmosphere that vastly differed from the quiet contemplation often associated with visiting an art museum. The Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich and the Dada Fair in Berlin were examples of platforms that brought together diverse practices to ignite a revolutionary spirit in art. By mocking artistic masters, conflating artistic genres, and rejecting the accepted norms of composition, Dada artists sought to undermine the very idea of what art should be. Their works, such as Marcel Duchamp's \\"Fountain,\\" a urinal signed as a piece of art, exemplified the Dadaists' aim to reject those works that were celebrated as high culture and displayed in museums. In summary, Dada artists had a fundamentally critical perspective on art in past museums. They viewed traditional art as perpetuating the social and political ills of their time and sought to disrupt the idea of the elite, untouchable status of those art pieces. By undermining and deconstructing artistic conventions and questioning the very definition of art, Dada artists epitomized a distinctive and radical period within the history of modern art. As such, the suggested answer does not fully address the question and should not be validated without the inclusion of the broader context, ideas, and practices at the core of Dadaism and its relation to art in past museums."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Given the below context: In an undercover mission, Major Sloane kills Professor Ragheeb, an ancient hieroglyphics expert at Oxford University and steals a hieroglyph-encrypted message.

In contrast, real wages declining means that the wages are decreasing in value, with the purchasing power deteriorating at a faster pace than slow wage growth. The premise, \\"Real wages continue to grow slowly,\\" implies that there is an increase in real wages, albeit at a slower pace than desired. This could result from factors such as increased productivity, cost of living adjustments, and other aspects that lead to the growth of real wages, albeit slow, in the economy. However, the individuals may still face difficulties in meeting their expenses or maintaining their standard of living due to the slower growth in comparison to the rate of inflation. On the other hand, the hypothesis, \\"Real wages are continuing to decline,\\" suggests a more severe situation where the wages are not only growing slowly but are, in fact, decreasing in value. This could occur due to factors such as high inflation, economic stagnation, or reduced demand for labor, leading to a decline in the value of wages received by individuals. In this scenario, employees are losing purchasing power and facing more significant challenges in managing their expenses and maintaining their standard of living. Now, to assess whether the premise entails the hypothesis, it is important to determine if the premise implies or leads to the conclusion reached in the hypothesis. In this case, the premise states that real wages are growing slowly, whereas the hypothesis asserts that real wages are declining. These two claims propose different situations: one depicts a slow increase, while the other describes an actual decrease in real wages. Hence, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise and hypothesis describe different scenarios regarding the growth or decline of real wages. Though both situations imply that individuals may face challenges in managing their living costs, they do not present the same severity of economic conditions. The premise suggests a slow increase in real wages, while the hypothesis indicates a more concerning situation with real wages decreasing in value."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Give the pan 1 or 2 minutes to heat up. If you don't have a cast iron skillet, any nonstick frying pan should work adequately well. Ideally, you should not add any oil to this pan before or after it heats up. If you need to add some type of nonstick coating, apply a light layer of nonstick cooking spray to the surface before heating the pan. Place three dough patties on the hot skillet. Cook the dough for 1 minute, flip, then continue cooking for another minute. Arrange the dough patties on the skillet with at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between them. You should cook the dough patties until they brown and blister on both sides. This should be a quick process as long as the pan is adequately hot. Remove the sopes from the pan and allow them to cool for 30 to 60 seconds, or until they are cool enough to handle safely. Do not wait for the sopes to cool completely. If they cool too much, you won't be able to shape them. Use your fingers to pinch around the outer edge of each sope, forming a 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) rim around the entire circumference. You should form this raised edge on the side of the sope cooked first to help protect your fingers from the hot dough. While not strictly necessary, you could also pinch a smaller ring around the center of each patty. Doing so may help prevent the sope from falling apart after you fill it. After shaping your first three sopes, continue shaping the remaining nine dough patties in the same manner. Work with only three patties at once. If you try to do too many, the patties may burn or cool too quickly. Set aside the shaped sopes while working on the flat patties. Try to keep them warm. Summary:","output":"This article is about cooking dough patties on a hot skillet to make sopes, a type of Mexican food, and then shaping them while they're still warm."},{"instruction":"Kai stayed home from school after realizing she was running a fever.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"I fed my teddy bear.\\" - Sentence B: \\"I fed my dog.\\" Please answer this question gradually:","output":"To answer this question, we will first analyze what each sentence communicates: - Sentence A: \\"I fed my teddy bear.\\" - Sentence B: \\"I fed my dog.\\" Sentence A is discussing an action towards a \\"teddy bear,\\" which is an inanimate object generally made of cloth and stuffing - it is not alive and cannot eat. So, it doesn't make much sense to say that you fed your teddy bear. Sentence B is mentioning the action of feeding a \\"dog\\" - a domesticated animal that indeed requires nourishment by eating food. This sentence makes logical sense as it is a standard and reasonable action taken by pet owners. Therefore, it can be concluded that: Sentence A: \\"I fed my teddy bear.\\" doesn't make sense as it's referring to feeding an inanimate object that doesn't require food.

They were both into collecting rare specimens of plants and wildlife. They would often complain about the weather. Which friend experienced warmer weather? Hint: East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. Weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the centre cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended periods. Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22 metres (48 in) in 48 hours have been recorded. Answer:","output":"Considering the given hint, it is evident that East Antarctica experiences colder weather due to its higher elevation, and weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent. This leaves the central region freezing and dry. Although the coastal part of the continent experiences heavy snowfalls, it does not affect the overall average temperature of East Antarctica. On the other hand, West Antarctica, despite being part of the same continent, experiences comparatively warmer weather. Since Jim lived in West Antarctica and Joe in East Antarctica, we can conclude that Jim, residing in the western region, experienced warmer weather than Joe, who lived in the colder, eastern region of the continent.

Instead, most of them use wood, coal or even animal waste to heat and cook in their homes ,which also gives off greenhouse gases, causing indoor air pollution that kills 1.6million people a year, most of whom are children and women. It's not expected to improve much, and in Africa it's becoming worse now. By 2030, when the Earth's population will be likely to top 8billion, 1.3 billion people will still lack electricity. Of those, 700 million will be in Africa, and 490 million in South Asia. Ghana, in West Africa, most of the northern half of the country lives without lights. As a result, three out of four Ghanans in the north are without electricity to refrigerate with and to cook with, to study with and to start businesses with.

What structured data could we extract from this sentence?","output":"Structured data is information that has been organized into a formatted repository, typically a database, so that its elements can be readily accessed, managed, and analyzed. Here, our task is to break down information from the given sentence \\"Adam Koc fought in World War I\\" into structured data that can be catalogued into database columns, which can later be accessed, managed, and analyzed for various purposes. The structured data that could be extracted from the sentence are: 1. \\"Adam Koc\\": Name of the person. This can be broken down into two elements: first name and last name or can be recorded as a full name. Therefore the two data fields (or columns in a database) could be 'First Name' and 'Last Name', or a single column for 'Full Name'. 2. \\"fought\\": Action. This denotes the activity in which Adam Koc was involved. It can be categorized under the column titled 'Action'. 3. \\"in\\": Preposition or a relational word. This is not generally useful as a structured data but it may have implicit importance in certain context-based databases where the relationship between the entities is of significance. 4. \\"World War I\\": Event in which the action took place. This can be considered as a valuable piece of information providing the historical context of the action. It can be placed under the column titled 'Event'. Furthermore, additional deductions or inferences from the sentence could yield more data for structuring: 5. Implicit knowledge - as Adam Koc fought in World War I, we can infer that his role was likely that of a soldier or a military serviceman (possibly an officer, private, etc.). This could be recorded in a column titled 'Role'. 6. Time period - As Adam Koc participated in World War I, we know that this would place his active period between 1914 and 1918 when the war occurred. This can be recorded in columns such as 'Active Start Year' and 'Active End Year'. In summary, the structured data extracted from the sentence could ideally be formatted into the following fields/tables: 1. 'First Name' 2. 'Last Name' 3. 'Full Name' (optional) 4. 'Action' 5. 'Event' 6. 'Role' (deduced) 7. 'Active Start Year' (deduced based on historical context) 8. 'Active End Year' (deduced based on historical context) A database can then be created using this structured data, making it easier for researchers, historians, or other interested parties to look up and examine comprehensive information on World War I participants."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a question and an answer, you would be asked to create the sentence based on the Question-Answer provided.

Question 2: Do Hispanics distrust Asians? Choose your answer from: 1). no; 2). yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"The two questions posed are not asking the same thing. The first question focuses on the physical appearances that some Hispanics may share with Asians, whereas the second question discusses the existence of distrust between the Hispanic and Asian communities. Question 1: Why do some Hispanics look Asian? The reason some Hispanics may bear physical resemblances to Asians traces back to the complicated history and genetic backgrounds of these populations. It's essential to understand that the term \\"Hispanic\\" refers to an ethnic group with origins in countries where Spanish is spoken. \\"Asian\\" is a term that covers various ethnic groups from the world's most diverse continent. There are two primary factors contributing to this physical similarity: 1. Genetic diversity and indigenous roots: Latin America comprises people of diverse backgrounds, which includes a significant indigenous population. Many indigenous peoples from the Americas, such as the Native Americans and the Inca of Peru, share genetic connections to ancient East Asian populations. Studies suggest that these groups migrated from Siberia, crossing the Bering Strait to establish themselves in the Americas. As a result, some Hispanics who have predominantly indigenous backgrounds may have physical features similar to those of East Asians, such as almond-shaped eyes and straight, dark hair. 2. Historical connections: Spanish colonization of Latin America in the 15th and 16th centuries led to the mixing of Spanish, indigenous, and African ancestries. Additionally, during the Philippines' colonization by the Spanish in the 16th to 19th centuries, trade and migration between the Philippines and Latin America took place. This historical connection with Asian populations may have also contributed to a blending of physical features among today's Hispanic individuals. Question 2: Do Hispanics distrust Asians? It's inappropriate to make blanket statements about entire ethnic groups, as opinions and attitudes can differ significantly among individuals. There may be a variety of social, cultural, or individual factors that influence someone's perspective on different communities. However, from a general viewpoint: 1. Cultural misunderstanding: Some misunderstandings may exist between Hispanic and Asian communities that can result in confusion or mistrust. These misunderstandings could arise from differences in language, traditions, values, and history. It's crucial to promote cross-cultural communication to help bridge these gaps and foster understanding between diverse groups. 2. Racism, discrimination, and implicit biases: Just like any other cultural or ethnic group, some members of the Hispanic community may carry unconscious biases toward another community. These biases could be fueled by stereotypes, misinformation, or sustained discrimination. It is essential that individuals remain vigilant about addressing and dismantling these biases in order to promote inclusivity and understanding. In conclusion, while the two questions posed concern the Hispanic and Asian communities, they tackle distinct aspects. The first question attends to physical appearances and genetic histories, while the second delves into potential societal attitudes and relationships between the two communities."},{"instruction":"- clubs is centre chiefs uniao flamengo santos - position is striker - nationalcaps is 1 - years is 1995 -- 2006 2006 -- - nationalyears is 2004 - nationalgoals is 0 - fullname is kgosietsile mampori - nationalteam is botswana - birth place is botswana Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

On rare occasions, the GPC opposed Gaddafi's suggestions, sometimes successfully; notably, when Gaddafi called on primary schools to be abolished, believing that home schooling was healthier for children, the GPC rejected the idea. In other instances, Gaddafi pushed through laws without the GPC's support, such as when he desired to allow women into the armed forces. Gaddafi proclaimed that the People's Congresses provided for Libya's every political need, rendering other political organizations unnecessary; all non-authorized groups, including political parties, professional associations, independent trade unions and women's groups, were banned.\\" Answer: The answer is:","output":"Rare. The question asks about a specific state of meat when it is cooked, with the center being cool and red in color, but not raw and cooked on the outside. This is known as \\"rare\\" cooking. In the context provided, the debate within the GPC (General People's Committee) was limited and mostly served as a rubber stamp for Gaddafi's policies in Libya. The text discusses the instances where the GPC rejected or disagreed with Gaddafi's suggestions, which showcases that there were indeed rare occasions when dissent emerged. Connecting the answer to the context, these instances of the GPC opposing Gaddafi's decisions can be seen as \\"rare\\" instances, much like the rare state of cooked meat. The term \\"rare\\" serves a dual purpose in this context, referring both to the specific way meat is cooked and to the infrequent occasions when the GPC would oppose Gaddafi's policies.

As his career blossoms, rumors start to circulate about how he is always intimately connected to each crime he solves. His uncanny intuition and inexplicable inner knowledge raise suspicions among his colleagues. Meanwhile, a string of bizarre and seemingly unrelated crimes are committed throughout the city. The department is overwhelmed as it fails to find any tangible link between the incidents. Out of desperation, the department assigns these cases to Trevor Howard. Act 2 - Shattered Illusions As Detective Howard begins to dive deep into each case, he starts experiencing strange and vivid flashbacks that seem to push him closer to solving the crimes. His colleagues, already suspicious of his successes, become increasingly skeptical and wary of him. The department assigns a skilled detective named Sarah Matthews to work alongside Trevor and keep a close eye on him. Unbeknownst to Trevor, Sarah is more than just a coworker – she has been sent with ulterior motives and a personal connection to the crimes. What appears to be just a professional partnership starts growing into a bond of friendship, as Trevor opens up about the flashbacks he's having. Upon realization that Sarah has been sent to monitor him, Trevor is hurt but motivated to discover more about his own discovery. Act 3 - Confronting the Past As Trevor inches closer to solving the case, his flashbacks grow more intense, and he begins uncovering both memories and evidence that suggest he could be connected to the unsolved crimes. His investigation leads him to a mysterious psychiatric facility, where he finds a series of confidential patient files – files that include his name. He realizes that he's been a patient there before, and part of his brain has been manipulated to store criminal data in coded form. The final act sees Trevor uncovering his own past, his connection to the crimes, and the hidden truth behind Sarah's alliance.

It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry. The only essential difference between U-238 and U-235 is their atomic masses; as a result, the two isotopes are separated by a physical means that takes advantage of the difference in mass. and the situation: John is a nuclear scientist who works at the Fermi lab. Today, in front of him he has four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. Sample A is the naturally occurring uranium. Sample B is enriched uranium. Sample C is the U-238, and sample D is the U-235. He needs to figure out how to best use them. Answer the following question: Which smaple would not be fissionable, sample C or sample D? The answer to this question is:","output":"Sample C would not be fissionable. This is because Sample C is U-238, and only U-235 is fissionable."},{"instruction":"Charming , innocent looking and barely legal , but Ingrid is one hundred percent horny all of the time .

She derives much mirth from the fact that I was born something less than nine or ten months after my parents wed and hints that this indicates a certain amount of premarital hanky-panky. Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour. Headed south, the problem became keeping your car under control so that you didn't go shooting into the trees when the road curved to the left. My parents were taking a trip to the Miramachi in December of '56 and were driving a Pontiac borrowed from one of my father's friends. My mother was pregnant with a bundle of bad attitude and misery that would turn out to be me. I assume that my father was driving with that mix of panache and insouciance that my mother tended to describe as reckless behaviour.

Add 1.5 lbs (750 g) meat of your choice. Add the stock spices. Boil on medium low for several hours, adding water when necessary. Use immediately or store for later.\\" Article:","output":"Title: The Art of Preparing Homemade Meat Stock: A Comprehensive Guide Preparing a savory homemade meat stock isn’t necessarily a complex task, but it is one that requires a careful balance of ingredients and time. The process can be boiled down (pun intended) to four basic steps—boiling water, adding meat, spicing the broth, and maintaining the boil. This article explores this process based on the directions: \\"Boil 6 cups (1400 mL) water. Add 1.5 lbs (750 g) meat of your choice. Add the stock spices. Boil on medium low for several hours, adding water when necessary and use immediately or store for later.\\" Step 1: Preparing the Water Begin by boiling six cups, the equivalent of approximately 1400 milliliters, of water. This initial quantity of water serves as a good base for your stock, considering the meat and stock spices to be added. High-quality filtered or spring water could potentially enhance your stock's final flavor. Step 2: Adding the Meat Once the water starts boiling, it's time to add the star of the show—1.5 lbs (750g) of meat. The choice of meat is a variable left to personal preference or specific recipe requirements, be it chicken, beef, or pork. It's worth noting that every type of meat will impart a distinct flavor to your stock. For example, beef will yield a hearty and robust flavor, whereas chicken provides a more subtle, delicate taste. Step 3: Spicing up the Stock Only water and meat would produce a rather bland broth. This is where stock spices enter the frame. The choice of spices significantly influences your stock's aroma and taste. Basic stock spices often include bay leaves, peppercorns, and aromatic vegetables like carrots, celery, and onions, with optional additions like garlic, herbs such as thyme or rosemary, depending on the desired flavor profile. Step 4: The Slow Boil Post adding the spices, the flame should be reduced to medium-low, ensuring a gentle, steady boil. This process can take several hours, as extracting a deep and rich robust flavor from the meat and spices isn't a task that can be rushed. During this duration, it's important to observe the water level. If the water reduces significantly, add more to keep the ingredients submerged, facilitating uniform extraction of flavors. Lastly, after these simple yet artistic processes, your homemade meat stock is ready to be used immediately or stored for later use. When cooled, the stock can be portioned and frozen, thereby providing a flavorful base for soups, gravies, sauces, and stews in future culinary endeavors. To conclude, creating a homemade meat stock from scratch may seem cumbersome, but it's a labor of culinary love. Guided by patience and the bliss of slow cooking, creating a flavorful stock can upgrade simple meals to gourmet experiences right in your kitchen."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A military train carrying soldiers has derailed south of Egypt's capital Cairo, killing at least 19 people and injuring more than 100, officials say.

Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu Islands and Nanpō Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.The average winter temperature in Japan is 5.1 °C (41.2 °F) and the average summer temperature is 25.2 °C (77.4 °F). The highest temperature ever measured in Japan 41.1 °C (106.0 °F) was recorded on July 23, 2018. The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching Hokkaido in late July. In most of Honshu, the rainy season begins before the middle of June and lasts about six weeks. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain. A:","output":"The Pacific Ocean climatic zone experiences very heavy precipitation in Japan. This zone features a humid subtropical climate with milder winters and hot, humid summers due to the southeast seasonal wind."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

They are currently in the kitchen eating a snack together. Greg is eating a stalk of celery while Tony is eating out of a bowl of candy. Tony remarks that he doesn't know how Greg enjoys such a bland snack. Greg just gives Tony an angry glare before getting up to go into the living room. On the living room table, Greg finds a glass of milk and a bowl of milk. The glass of milk has started to get thick, but the bowl of milk appears to be still fresh. Greg rolls his eyes at the mess and walks away. But I can use this background: Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy. What is an answer for this question: Which person will experience more tooth decay? Answer:","output":"Although both Tony and Greg are consuming snacks that may contribute to tooth decay, it is likely that Tony will experience more tooth decay than Greg. This assumption is based on the information provided in the background, which specifically mentions the process of lactic acid fermentation and its role in tooth decay. Lactic acid fermentation is a process carried out by some bacteria and fungi, as well as in our own muscles during strenuous exercise. Lactic acid, a waste product of this process, is responsible for causing tooth decay. Tooth decay occurs when bacteria use the sugars in our mouth for their energy needs, producing lactic acid as a byproduct which then breaks down the enamel of the teeth. In the situation described, Tony is eating a bowl of candy, which is likely high in sugars. The high sugar content provides an ample source of energy for the bacteria in Tony's mouth, leading to increased lactic acid production and subsequently, tooth decay. On the other hand, Greg is eating a stalk of celery, which has a much lower sugar content. The lower sugar content in celery would result in a reduced amount of lactic acid production in Greg's mouth, which subsequently would lead to less tooth decay. Additionally, the snacks that the brothers are eating have different textures, which can also contribute to tooth decay. Candy, especially sticky and chewy types, can stay on the teeth for longer periods, providing more time for bacteria to produce lactic acid. In contrast, the fibrous texture of celery can help clean the teeth as it is being chewed, potentially reducing the accumulation of bacteria and lactic acid. In conclusion, based on the differences in sugar content and the texture of the snacks they are consuming, it is more likely that Tony will experience a greater amount of tooth decay than Greg. It is important to note that this analysis is based solely on the specific situation provided and does not take into account other factors that may contribute to tooth decay, such as oral hygiene practices, genetics, and overall diet."},{"instruction":"Middle Ages In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages (or Medieval Period) lasted from the 5th to the 15th century.

Choose from: I. no II. yes Is this statement correct \\"are the medieval and middle ages the same\\"?","output":"II. yes The statement \\"are the medieval and middle ages the same?\\" is correct. The terms \\"Middle Ages\\" and \\"Medieval Period\\" are often used interchangeably to describe the same period in European history that lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. This era started with the decline and eventual fall of the Western Roman Empire and transitioned into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is considered as the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history, which are classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. To further examine the Middle Ages, historians subdivide it into three phases: the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. During the Early Middle Ages (approximately 5th-10th centuries), Europe witnessed a series of invasions and migrations by barbarian tribes, leading to the fragmentation of political power. This period also marked the spread of Christianity, which played a significant role in uniting disparate populations under a shared religious and cultural umbrella. The High Middle Ages (approximately 11th-13th centuries) were characterized by the development of feudalism, the revival of trade, the emergence of powerful kingdoms and nation-states, and the growth of the Catholic Church's influence. This period also saw the rise of Gothic architecture, the establishment of universities, the flowering of chivalry, and the beginnings of the Crusades. Lastly, the Late Middle Ages (approximately 14th-15th centuries) faced several crises, including the Great Famine, the Black Death, and the Hundred Years' War, which significantly curtailed Europe's population and economic growth. Despite these challenges, this period laid the groundwork for the Renaissance, as people began to question traditional authority and explore new ideas in various fields, such as art, literature, and science."},{"instruction":"Question: Where did Von Neumann study as a PHD candidate?

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose smoke filled air happens, how will it affect more oxygen for blood vessels. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of smoke-filled air will have an effect, both direct and indirect, on the process of oxygen absorption and carbon dioxide exchange for blood vessels. A direct effect of smoke-filled air is that it has a higher concentration of particles, including harmful chemicals and gases like carbon monoxide, which can interfere with the normal functioning of the alveoli. When smoke is inhaled, this can reduce the overall oxygen concentration and potentially impair the ability of the alveoli to absorb oxygen effectively. Carbon monoxide, in particular, has a higher affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen, leading to a reduction in oxygen-carrying capacity in the blood vessels. An indirect effect of the smoke-filled air is that it can lead to inflammation, irritation, and damage to the respiratory system's tissues, including the bronchial tubes, bronchioles, and alveoli. Prolonged exposure to smoke can cause chronic respiratory problems and lead to diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or lung cancer. This damage can further compromise the effectiveness of gas exchange in the lungs, affecting the bloodstream's oxygen levels.

The friends' dinnertime conversation turned to politics.","output":"The effect of the friends' dinnertime conversation turning to politics is multifaceted and can have both positive and negative consequences. 1. Stimulating intellectual debate: When friends discuss politics, they often engage in intellectually stimulating conversations that can challenge their beliefs and opinions. This open exchange of ideas can lead to a greater understanding of different political perspectives, fostering critical thinking and analytical skills. The dinnertime conversation can, therefore, become a fruitful platform for personal growth. 2. Gaining new knowledge and perspectives: The discussion of politics during the dinner conversation can also provide an opportunity to learn about different political ideologies, specific policies, and current events. Engaging conversations may spark the participants' interest in politics, driving them to become more informed and politically active citizens. This could lead to them being more aware of how political decisions affect their day-to-day lives and encouraging them to be more involved in how their society is governed. 3. Building and testing friendships: Political discussions can reveal the values and principles each participant holds dear, giving the friends a chance to discover commonalities and differences in their views. These conversations can help strengthen friendships if people find out that they share similar political opinions, as they relate to their core values. However, if there are significant disagreements, it can lead to tension and strain on friendships. How the friends approach and handle these differences can test the resilience and maturity of their relationship. 4. Potential for conflict: One of the challenges of discussing politics with friends is the risk of triggering emotional and heated debates, particularly if there are deep-rooted differences in opinion. As people tend to have strong feelings about their political beliefs, it can lead to arguments and disagreements, potentially causing discord among the friends and possibly dampening the mood of the evening. 5. Impact on group dynamics: The effect of turning the dinnertime conversation to politics can also impact the group dynamics. If political discussions are a regular occurrence among the friends, they may already have established ground rules or have found ways to manage such debates amicably. However, for groups who do not typically discuss politics, it can cause discomfort, alienation, or boredom for some individuals, especially if they don't share the same passion for political discourse or merely prefer lighter topics of conversation during dinner. In conclusion, the effect of the friends' dinnertime conversation turning to politics depends on the individuals, their beliefs, and the dynamics of their relationship. It can lead to intellectual stimulation, personal growth, and deeper bonds. At the same time, it can also provoke emotional reactions, conflict, and discomfort. The long-term impact will be determined by how the group handles these discussions and if they can navigate any disagreements respectfully and constructively."},{"instruction":"James Mason and Orson Welles began their acting careers here.

Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, so he had more people coming in, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks. But I can use this background: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] What is an answer for this question: Which town had fewer cyclists riding in slippery conditions? A:","output":"Rob's town likely had fewer cyclists riding in slippery conditions. This is because it is situated in the valley, near parks which typically have less precipitation and less hilly terrains compared to Bob's hilly town filled with bike trails."},{"instruction":"Article: Exactly three weeks after the Nov. 1 shooting at Los Angeles International Airport, travelers who heard the loud boom of a car crash outside the airport thought they heard gunfire and evacuated the airport. At the same time in another terminal, police responded to anonymous call about a man with a gun, a report that turned out to be false. Airport operations slowly went back to normal after police cleared the terminals. Beverly White reports for the NBC4 News at 11 p.m. Friday, Nov. 22, 2013. (Published Saturday, Nov. 23, 2013) At the same time the sound of a car crash scared passengers into thinking shots were fired at Los Angeles International Airport Friday, travelers in another terminal were evacuated and thousands of flights were delayed after a false report of a man with a weapon, airport officials said. Police received a call about 7:30 p.m. of possible shots fired, but upon investigation realized the loud noise of a multiple-car crash outside a parking structure between Terminal 4 and Terminal 5 incited a panic, LAX Police Sgt. Ortiz told NBC4. After hearing the crash, travelers began to evacuate the airport on their own, Ortiz said. No shots were fired at the airport, he said. \\"Part of that (reaction), we believe, is some hypersensitivity to what occurred on Nov. 1, three weeks ago,\\" said LAX Police Chief Patrick Gannon during a news conference outside the airport. He was referring to shooting in which a lone gunman opened fire near Terminal 3, killing a TSA officer and wounding four others. Aerial video Friday showed officials investigating what appeared to be a wrecked SUV or van on the curb near a parking structure. About 8:20 p.m., crowds could be seen gathered outside as police evacuated Terminal 4 and Terminal 5 after an anonymous caller reported a man with a weapon was at Gate 45, airport officials said. At least 2,000 passengers either left the airport on their own or were evacuated by airport police, LAX officials said. About 4,600 arriving and departing travelers were impacted by the incidents, officials said. Delta Airlines (Terminal 5) and American Airlines (Terminal 4) reported a total of 60 delayed flights but no cancellations. Police found no weapon and cleared both terminals for people to return inside just before 9 p.m. Flight operations in Terminal 4 were disrupted as police cleared the airport, and slowly resumed as passengers were screened by security and returned to their gates, officials said. Ambulances could be seen lining the roadway in the pick-up and drop-off area of the airport. ||||| An apparent false alarm Friday evening caused panicked travelers and employees to flee at least one terminal at Los Angeles International Airport. The incident occurred three weeks to the day after a gunman sprayed bullets across a crowded Terminal 3, killing a Transportation Security Administration officer. Los Angeles World Airports spokeswoman Nancy Castles said that shortly before 7:30 p.m., airport police responded to a report of shots fired at Terminal 5. When they arrived, they found that a traffic accident outside the terminal had caused a loud noise, prompting travelers to evacuate onto the sidewalk. At the same time, an anonymous caller reported seeing a man with a weapon at one of the gates in Terminal 4, Castles said. Police responded, evacuating and sweeping the terminal \\"out of an abundance of caution,\\" she said. No gunman was found. Castles said Terminal 4 has been secured and cleared and that passengers are being allowed back in for rescreening. TV news footage showed a minivan that had crashed into a stairwell of a parking structure across from Terminal 5. It was surrounded by fire and police personnel. Witnesses described sheer panic unfolding as law enforcement tried to grasp what was happening. Peter Ward, a 34-year-old IT consultant from Australia, said he was at the Oneworld Lounge on the second floor of Terminal 4 when he saw some commotion downstairs. “People were diving behind counters at the restaurants. Then people ran and evacuated very quickly,” said Ward, who watched the drama unfold below from the lounge windows. He turned to see several officers running through the main entrance and into the terminal with guns drawn. Many of them seemed to order passengers out of the terminal through the main entrance, he said. At least two dozen more officers joined them, some with long rifles and others with bomb-sniffing dogs, Ward said. About 15 of them formed a “human barricade” near the security checkpoint, he said. The rest of the officers continued to sweep the area downstairs, while Ward said he and other passengers in the lounge were told they were being kept on lockdown. Several airport police sources reached by phone confirmed that it was a false alarm. “There was no incident at Terminal 4,” said one officer, who declined to give his name because he was not authorized to comment. “Everybody’s out and they are sweeping the area. The situation is under control and contained.” The officer said that a vehicle had been involved in a hit-and-run, that the driver had fled but was apprehended near Terminal 6. The noise of the accident, he said, may have prompted TSA employees to report hearing shots. “I can understand why they’re gunshy,” he added.

A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth. The researchers present a complete temperature... Two teams of researches studied Antarctica's climate. The team studied two different regions. The US team studied East Antarctica, while the Swiss team studied West Antarctica. Which team didn't learn about a region that doesn't show signs of appreciable melting despite the large amount of surface warming?

Over time, Gondwana gradually broke apart, and Antarctica as we know it today was formed around 25 million years ago. Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms. John was reading about a fascinating story of a scientist in a science fiction book. In that novel the scientist met with a mysterious wormhole while visiting Antarctica. First, the wormhole started the time travel in present day, which was designated as point A. Then it sent the scientist to 170 million years in the past, which was designated as point B. The scientist had the rare experience of visiting Antarctica in two different time periods, 170 million years apart. Which point would see less ice sheets, point A or point B? A:","output":"Point B would see less ice sheets, as it refers to 170 million years ago when Antarctica was part of the supercontinent Gondwana, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, and was covered in forests."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article in one sentence. The Pharaohs suffered a shock 1-0 loss away to Chad in the first leg of their tie last week but will have home advantage on Tuesday to help them erase the deficit. Ezechiel Ndouassel scored Chad's winner, which also gave new coach Rigobert Song a brilliant start to his reign. While the odds are against Chad completing the job, former Cameroon midfielder Song will be hoping his side can produce another stunning upset. Ghana, Algeria and Nigeria also came away from road trips with surprise results as they were all held by opponents they had been expected to beat. The Black Stars' 0-0 draw with Comoros - the lowest ranked African side still in the qualifiers and 159 places below Ghana - was, perhaps, the most embarrassing result suffered by the continent's big names. Captain Asamoah Gyan is in determined mood to make amends. \\"We know we were not up to the task in the first game so we will make sure we turn things around, \\" he said. Algeria, who have only just lost their place as Africa's number one side, also need to put in a strong display with their tie with Tanzania level at 2-2. The two away goals give the Desert Foxes an advantage but they will have been disappointed that their defence was breached twice. Tanzania had taken a two-goal lead in the first match only for Islam Slimani to rescue Algeria with a brace. The striker will want to finish the job in Blida. While Nigeria did not concede in their first leg with Swaziland, the Super Eagles will be concerned by their lack of goals. Coach Sunday Oliseh was rocked by the retirement of striker Emmanuel Emenike last month and he must quickly find a forward line that will provide a cutting edge. Oliseh played with three strikers against Swaziland and he brought on Obafemi Martins and Kelechi Iheanacho in the second half. It will be interesting to see how he sets his team up for the game in Port Harcourt. Kenya have hurt their chances of protecting their 1-0 lead over Cape Verde after a row over payments delayed their departure. The Harambee Stars, who have a nine-hour flight, will arrive less than 24 hours before kick-off. Elsewhere, Mali face a shock elimination unless they can overturn a 2-1 deficit against Botswana. Mali have finished third in the Africa Cup of Nations in 2012 and 2013 and were heavy favourites to knock out the Zebras. Senegal should see off the challenge of Madagascar, who achieved a superb 2-2 draw in the first leg but are unlikely to be able to resist the Teranga Lions on their own ground. The 2002 World Cup quarter-finalists will look to their big names, such as first-leg scorers Mame Biram Diouf and Sadio Mane, to dominate the India Ocean island side. The 14 overall winners will join the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Guinea, Morocco, Uganda and Zambia in the group stage, which kicks off next October.

She is ultimately crowned Queen Lucy the Valiant, co-ruler of Narnia along with her two brothers and her sister. Lucy is the central character of the four siblings in the novels. Lucy is a principal character in three of the seven books (\\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\", \\"Prince Caspian\\", and \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\"), and a minor character in two others (\\"The Horse and His Boy\\" and \\"The Last Battle\\"). - In C.

Its output includes most of the more widely acclaimed Soviet-era films, ranging from works by Andrei Tarkovsky and Sergei Eisenstein (commonly considered the greatest Soviet directors), to Red Westerns, to the Akira Kurosawa co-production \\"Dersu Uzala\\" (') and the epic \\"War and Peace\\" ('). - The Ostern (Eastern) or Red Western (also known as \\"Borscht Western\\") was the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries' take on the Western. The term refers to two related genres: - Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director in 1943, during World War II, with the popular action film \\"Sanshiro Sugata\\" (a.k.a. \\"Judo Saga\\"). After the war, the critically acclaimed \\"Drunken Angel\\" (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films. His wife Yko Yaguchi was also an actress in one of his films. - The Russian Civil War was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future. The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants. In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites. Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920. Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923. Armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934. There were an estimated 7,000,000-12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians. The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen. - The Elusive Avengers (translit. \\"Neulovimye mstiteli\\") is a 1967 Soviet adventure film directed by Edmond Keosayan and made by Mosfilm. It is loosely based on the novel Little Red Devils by Pavel Blyakhin, under its original name. The film is an example of Ostern, set in Russian Civil War era Ukraine. - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south. - The New Adventures of the Elusive Avengers ( Russian : , translit . Novye prikluchenya Neulovimykh ) is a 1968 Soviet action movie , a sequel of The Elusive Avengers , directed by Edmond Keosayan and made on Mosfilm . The movie was followed by The Crown of the Russian Empire , or Once Again the Elusive Avengers released in 1971 . - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Crown of the Russian Empire, or Once Again the Elusive Avengers (translit. \\"Korona Rossiyskoy Imperii, ili Snova Neulovimye\\") is a 1971 Soviet action movie, a second sequel of \\"The Elusive Avengers\\", directed by Edmond Keosayan and made on Mosfilm. Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'narrative location' with the subject 'the new adventures of the elusive avengers'. Choices: - atlantic ocean - europe - iran - japan - russia - russian empire - soviet union - turkey - ukraine Answer:","output":"The correct choice of the object entity that exhibits the relation 'narrative location' with the subject 'The New Adventures of the Elusive Avengers' is Ukraine. The film is an example of the Ostern or \\"Borscht Western\\" genre, which typically depicts settings in the Eastern Bloc, often during the time of the Russian Civil War. More precisely, 'The New Adventures of the Elusive Avengers,' just like its predecessor 'The Elusive Avengers,' is set in the era of the Russian Civil War in Ukraine. Therefore, Ukraine is the narrative location, i.e., the location where the story unfolds. In a broader sense, since Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union during the film's making and the story's setting, the Soviet Union could be considered as another valid answer. However, for a direct and more specific answer regarding the narrative location, Ukraine is the most accurate. Most of the Red Western films were focused on individual Soviet Republics' local conditions and wars, signifying their landscapes, thus providing unique settings pivotal for the narrative. Edmond Gareginovich Keosayan, the celebrated Armenian Soviet film director, and Mosfilm, the largest and oldest film studio in Russia and Europe, capture the essence of these landscapes and the atmospheric tension of the Civil War era through their film 'The New Adventures of the Elusive Avengers.' They skillfully use the geographical and cultural reality of Ukraine to enhance the narrative of the film, thereby connecting the subject with its narrative location."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"The woman is wearing a red hat that is decorated with a huge orange feather.\\" can we conclude that \\"The woman is sitting on the couch.\\"?

Use a hot glue gun to glue each individual CD to your door..","output":"In order to adhere a Christmas CD wreath to your door, the two methods suggested are: (I). Use a hanger and nail to adhere your wreath to your door. (II). Use a hot glue gun to glue each individual CD to your door. Considering these two options, I would recommend going with option (I) - using a hanger and nail to adhere your wreath to your door. Here is a detailed explanation of each option and why option (I) makes more sense: Option (I) - Use a hanger and nail to adhere your wreath to your door: This method involves using a wreath hanger - a simple, curved metal hook that can hang over the top of your door - and a nail, if necessary, to secure the hanger in place. This option allows for easy installation and removal of the wreath, and it also minimizes damage to your door. To use this method, follow these steps: 1. Purchase or create a wreath hanger. These can be found at most craft or home improvement stores, or you can easily make one by bending a wire coat hanger into the desired shape. 2. Slightly open your door and slide the wreath hanger over the top, ensuring that the hook faces outward. The flat part of the hanger should rest flush against the door. 3. If the wreath hanger is slightly loose on the door, use a small nail or a removable adhesive strip to hold the hanger in place. Take care not to damage your door when using a nail. 4. Attach your CD wreath to the hook by its ribbon or wire loop. Ensure that the weight is evenly distributed, and the wreath is securely in place. Option (II) - Use a hot glue gun to glue each individual CD to your door: This method involves applying hot glue directly to the back of each CD and then adhering it to your door, creating a wreath shape. While this may create a more secure bond between the CDs and the door, it has several downsides: 1. Hot glue can be challenging to remove, potentially leading to damage when trying to remove the CDs from the door in the future. 2. Gluing each CD individually is a more time-consuming and labor-intensive process. 3. The door's surface and material may not be compatible with hot glue, resulting in a weak bond or potential damage to the door's finish. In conclusion, option (I) - using a hanger and nail to adhere your wreath to your door - makes more sense for this goal as it is easier, less time-consuming, and less likely to cause damage to your door. Additionally, with this method, your Christmas CD wreath can be easily removed and stored, allowing you to reuse it in the future."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Title: Sadly its a flawed product Product review: The book is attractively laid out and the history and biographical sketches of famous or important slide players adds something to the overall product. However, as another reviewer has noted, the titles of the tracks as cited in the text does not match up with the tracks on the CD. You will have to go through all 54 tracks and write the number of the actual track onto the text. Pete Madsen might be a fine player, but the publisher needs to fire the editor that let this product out the door. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer is:","output":"The review depicts the product in an unflattering light. Step 1: Analyze the review's content - The review mentions both positive and negative aspects of the product. Step 2: Weigh the positive aspects - The book is \\"attractively laid out\\" and the \\"history and biographical sketches\\" add value to the product. Step 3: Weigh the negative aspects - The reviewer points out a significant flaw in the product, where the titles of the tracks do not match the tracks on the CD. This requires the user to manually fix the issue. Additionally, the reviewer suggests that the publisher should fire the editor responsible for the product's release. Step 4: Compare the positive and negative aspects - While the positive aspects focus on the appearance and content, the negative aspects target the product's functionality and quality control. The negative aspects seem to outweigh the positive aspects. Based on the steps above, we can conclude that the review depicts the product in an unflattering light, as it emphasizes the product's flaws rather than its positive features."},{"instruction":"Citing the reduction of competition in the broadband and cable industries that would result from the merger, the Department of Justice planned to file an antitrust lawsuit against Comcast and Time Warner Cable in an effort to block it. On April 24, 2015, Comcast announced that it would withdraw its proposal to acquire TWC. Afterward, TWC would enter into an agreement to be acquired by Charter Communications. are comcast and time warner the same company? Available choices: 1). no; 2). yes;","output":"1). No, Comcast and Time Warner are not the same company. The two companies were planning on merging together, but on April 24, 2015, Comcast withdrew its proposal to acquire Time Warner Cable (TWC) due to concerns from the Department of Justice regarding the potential reduction of competition in the broadband and cable industries that would have resulted from the merger. As a result of Comcast's withdrawal, Time Warner Cable eventually entered into an agreement to be acquired by Charter Communications, another independent company. Comcast and Time Warner Cable remain separate entities that provide cable television, broadband internet, and telephone services across different regions in the United States. Therefore, they operate as distinct companies with their own corporate structures, service offerings, and pricing strategies. It is important to note that while both Comcast and Time Warner Cable have been involved in mergers and acquisitions with other telecommunications companies over the years, their proposed merger did not materialize due to antitrust concerns. The U.S. Department of Justice determined that such a merger would have had negative consequences for both competition and consumers in the telecommunications industry. As a result, the two companies continued to operate independently and eventually pursued different paths for growth and expansion. In the end, Time Warner Cable was acquired by Charter Communications, which then rebranded its newly acquired operations as Spectrum. Comcast, on the other hand, has continued to operate under its own name and has expanded its footprint in various regions across the United States. In summary, Comcast and Time Warner Cable are not the same company, and their plans for a merger ultimately did not come to fruition due to antitrust concerns. Both companies have since continued to operate independently, providing a range of telecommunications services to customers across the United States."},{"instruction":"How does this story end?

If one balloon is full and another is only half full does the full balloon have a higher or lower pressure? Catherine is throwing her friend a birthday party and is starting to put up decorations. She has finished hanging streamers and now she has to fill the balloons. Having never used a helium tank before, she wants to test how much to fill each balloon. Hint: All fluids exert pressure like the air inside a tire. The particles of fluids are constantly moving in all directions at random. As the particles move, they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path. These collisions cause pressure, and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions. When particles are crowded together in one part of an enclosed space, such as the air particles first entering a tire, they quickly spread out to fill all the available space. That’s because particles of fluids always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. This explains why air entering a tire through a tiny opening quickly fills the entire tire. The answer to this question is:","output":"The full balloon has a higher pressure. When the balloon is filled with more air (or helium, in this case), the particles are crowded together in a confined space. This causes them to continuously bump into each other and into the balloon walls, generating higher pressure. In comparison, the half-full balloon has fewer particles in the same confined space, leading to fewer collisions and thereby resulting in lower pressure. The particles in fluids, including gases, always tend to move from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure, which is why air quickly fills an enclosed space like a tire or a balloon when introduced."},{"instruction":"According to Jean Ziegler , mortality due to malnutrition accounted for 58% of the total mortality in 2006: \\"In the world, approximately 62 millions people, all causes of death combined, die each year.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The last step of the process following a forest fire where trees and plants burn, animals lose their homes, they may die from smoke inhalation, and the plants that provide food are gone, would likely be the stage of ecological recovery and regrowth. After such a devastating event, the ecosystem will undergo a process of recovery called ecological succession. This process can be broken down into several stages: 1. Initial Colonization: In the immediate aftermath of the fire, hardy pioneer species such as fire-resistant plants, weeds, and fungi will begin to take root in the burned ground. These plant species are often adaptive to the harsh conditions and require direct sunlight for their growth. As these plants grow, they begin stabilizing the soil, allowing other more complex organisms to move in eventually. 2. Soil Formation and Nutrient Cycling: The pioneer plants will help to retain water in the soil and prevent rapid evaporation, supporting the recovery of key underground microorganisms responsible for soil development and nutrient cycling. As dead organic matter decomposes, nutrients are added back to the soil, which will attract animals and insects that aid in seed dispersal and pollination. 3. Development of a Grassland or Shrubland Ecosystem: As the vegetation cover increases, grasses and shrubs will develop, creating a new ecosystem that supports various animal species. This new ecosystem provides homes and food sources to herbivores, which in turn attract predators and other higher-order species to the area. 4. Forest Regrowth and Climax Community: Over time, the grassland or shrubland ecosystem will gradually transition back into a forest ecosystem as trees start to germinate and grow, aided by available resources such as water, sunlight, and nutrients. As the forest regrows, animals that lost their homes during the fire will start to repopulate the area. In the long term, the ecosystem will reach its equilibrium or climax community, where the biodiversity and species composition will stabilize until another disturbance, such as a forest fire, occurs again. This last step of the process emphasizes the resilience of ecosystems, which have evolved to adapt, recover, and regrow after significant disturbances like forest fires. Fire plays a natural role in shaping many ecosystems, and those ecosystems, in turn, have various mechanisms in place to rebound following such events. Despite the initial devastation, the process of ecological succession highlights nature's ability to heal and regenerate over time, as well as the interconnectedness and dependencies of different species within an ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Available options: (i) Yes. (ii) No. Given those answer options, answer the question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"where on plates do earthquakes most often occur? \\" is \\"near the shoreline\\", given that most earthquakes occur at or near plate margins? A:","output":"As an AI language model, I cannot provide subjective opinions, but I can give you an analysis based on available information. The original question pertains to the location of earthquakes concerning their occurrence on plates. It is important to establish a clear understanding of the relationship between plate tectonics and earthquakes to thoroughly answer the question. First, let's understand the concept of plate tectonics. The Earth's lithosphere (outer rigid layer) is broken into several tectonic plates, which move relative to one another. The interactions and movements of these plates lead to various geological events, including the formation of earthquakes. Most earthquakes occur at or near the boundaries of these tectonic plates, which can be classified into three main types: 1. Divergent boundaries: Occur where two plates are moving away from each other, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Earthquakes at these boundaries are generally less severe. 2. Convergent boundaries: Occur where two plates are moving towards one another, which can lead to subduction (one plate being forced underneath another) or continental collision. These boundaries are responsible for some of the most powerful earthquakes, such as those occurring along the Pacific Ring of Fire. 3. Transform boundaries: Occur where two plates slide past one another horizontally, such as the San Andreas Fault in California. Earthquakes at these boundaries can also be quite powerful. Now, let's examine the given answer option, \\"near the shoreline.\\" Shorelines, or coastlines, can sometimes align with plate boundaries, as seen in the case of the Pacific Ring of Fire, which affects multiple countries bordering the Pacific Ocean. This area is known for both its earthquakes and volcanic activity because of the convergence of several tectonic plates. However, using \\"near the shoreline\\" as a blanket statement for the location of earthquakes can be misleading, as not all shorelines correspond with plate boundaries. Additionally, earthquake activity can occur in continental interiors, such as the New Madrid Seismic Zone located in the central United States, which is far from any coastline. Considering the information provided, it may not be completely accurate to say the right answer to the question \\"where on plates do earthquakes most often occur?\\" is \\"near the shoreline.\\" While earthquakes often occur at or near plate boundaries, and these boundaries sometimes coincide with shorelines, it would be more accurate to specify the relationship between earthquakes and plate boundaries rather than shorelines."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence in the following story.

PHNOM PENH - Cambodia #39;s legislature agreed Monday to prosecute former Khmer Rouge leaders for their role in the deaths of nearly two million people in the late 1970s.","output":"The context you provided relates to the historical event that unfolded in Cambodia involving the Khmer Rouge regime and their subsequent prosecution for the atrocities committed during their reign. In the late 1970s, Cambodia was under the brutal rule of the Khmer Rouge, a communist regime led by Pol Pot. During their reign, from 1975 to 1979, nearly two million people died out of a population of 8 million. This mass tragedy is often referred to as the Cambodian genocide. The Khmer Rouge came to power amidst the chaos of the Cambodian Civil War, promising a utopian Marxist society. However, they transformed Cambodia into a strictly stratified society, where cities were evacuated and residents were forced to labor on rural farms or in work camps. Intellectuals, minority groups, and perceived political enemies were systematically exterminated. Many people died from starvation, disease, or overwork, as the regime strictly controlled food distribution and healthcare. The necessity for justice and accountability relating to these crimes against humanity was agreed upon domestically and internationally. Thus, upon your context's reference, the Cambodian legislature decided to proceed legally against the former leaders of the Khmer Rouge. This event you mentioned specifically refers to a decision taken by Cambodia's legislature to criminally prosecute the ex-leaders of the Khmer Rouge for their involvement in the genocide. The tribunal put in place for this purpose is known as the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) or the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, which was established in 2001 through a law passed by the Cambodian parliament and further endorsed by the United Nations. The prosecutions were crucial to address the crimes of the past and provide justice to the victims. They helped build the rule of law in Cambodia, provided an opportunity for the Cambodian people to understand their history, and aimed to prevent such atrocities from happening again. The trials were also important on an international scale as they set a precedent for dealing with issues of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The tribunal and its processes faced many challenges like funding shortages, alleged political interference, criticisms about its efficiency and effectiveness, and the advanced age and frail health of the accused, which prolonged the trial duration and raised concerns about their ability to stand trial. Despite the criticism and difficulty, the ECCC persisted, and it eventually managed to convict two significant leaders of the Khmer Rouge — Nuon Chea, the former deputy secretary of the Communist Party, and Khieu Samphan, the former head of state — of crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide in separate judgments."},{"instruction":"Summarize: A German criminal investigation into the crash concluded in January that Lubitz bore sole responsibility for crashing the jet. The final accident report by the French authorities answered many questions - but some are still a mystery. Investigators ruled out terrorism early on and their position did not change when it was revealed that they believed Lubitz had deliberately crashed the aircraft. That was upheld in the final report, which found that he had been suffering from psychiatric issues he had hidden from his colleagues. The co-pilot did not behave in a peculiar or extreme manner and people who knew him expressed shock over the event. \\"He's not the type of guy who would try and kill other people - absolutely not,\\" a neighbour said. \\"He was really just a very normal, not very remarkable, nice young man,\\" said Klaus Radke, the president of the club near Montabaur in Germany where Lubitz had learned to fly. Lubitz had battled depression before, suspending his training for medical reasons in 2008. The final crash investigation report detailed his medical history and showed he had started to suffer from a \\"severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms\\". During that period, he considered suicide and \\"made several 'no suicide pacts' with his treating psychiatrist and was hospitalised\\", the report says. In April 2009, his medical certificate was not revalidated \\"due to depression and the taking of medication to treat it\\". In July that year, he was declared \\"entirely healthy\\" and given a one-year medical certificate, with a note that it must be renewed each year. It was renewed annually without incident until December 2014. It was then that Lubitz consulted doctors about \\"vision problems and sleep disorders\\" but eye specialists could not find a physical cause. Instead, investigators say, he was diagnosed with a \\"psychosomatic disorder\\" - a physical illness caused by a mental factor. In February 2015, he was given a sick certificate for eight days, which he did not forward to the airline. Over the next month, he would be issued several more medical certificates, none of which his employer saw; was prescribed insomnia and antidepressant medication; and was referred \\"for psychiatric hospital treatment due to a possible psychosis\\". Traces of the medications were found in his remains during a post-mortem toxicology exam. \\"On the day of the accident, the pilot was still suffering from a psychiatric disorder, which was possibly a psychotic depressive episode, and was taking psychotropic medication,\\" the report found. \\"This made him unfit to fly.\\" Prosecutors in Duesseldorf at the time of the crash found torn-up sick notes, including for the day of the crash. In April 2015, German prosecutors said Lubitz had researched \\"ways to commit suicide\\" on his tablet at home in the week before the crash. Another of his internet searches was for \\"cockpit doors and their security provisions\\". The German tabloid paper Bild said (in German) it had seen documents that said he was suffering from a \\"personal life crisis\\", having recently broken up with a girlfriend. But even when we have a fuller picture of Lubitz's state of mind before the crash, some of his actions may remain a mystery forever. For example, after he had decided to kill himself and everyone else on board the plane, why did he set the aircraft on a controlled, rather than a sudden, descent? Depression is a serious illness, and it affects everyone differently. People experiencing depression can reach such a state of alienation that they risk taking their lives - but the vast majority of people with depression would never harm anyone other than themselves. Writing in the Times, Jennifer Wild, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, has said that the irrational thinking evident from Lubitz's actions in the cockpit may have been triggered by depression, possibly caused by a recent traumatic episode. \\"Perhaps in his state he did not consider the consequences of his actions, or perhaps he did not care because he was consumed with ending his life,\\" she wrote, adding that drug-taking or a bout of extreme anger might also explain his actions. The black box recording of Lubitz's calm breathing as he pressed the controls to send the aeroplane hurtling to the ground may lead some to believe he was a psychopath but Dr Wild notes that psychopaths generally avoid harming themselves. Sir Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said that millions of people in Britain suffered from depression, which is a treatable illness. He told the BBC that this included pilots who \\"resume flying, perfectly safely, for maybe tens of years afterwards\\". The fact that Lubitz appears to have been signed off as sick raises the question of whether there was - or should have been - contact between his doctors and the airline. Medical practitioners take an oath to maintain patient confidentiality but some US states have expanded doctors' duty of care to the community at large. This allows them to warn third parties if they think it necessary. In Germany, trainee pilots are subjected to medical examinations which include oral psychological assessments. There is some debate as to whether such assessments are thorough enough. One question an examiner might ask a pilot is, \\"Do you have a butterfly collection at home?\\", the Suddeitsche Zeitung reported (in German). At the time of the crash, Lufthansa said that after they hired pilots they did not subject them to regular psychological examinations. This is obligatory in other countries, such as the US and UK. Airline staff are encouraged to report strange behaviour on the part of their colleagues but a former pilot told the BBC that peer pressure could act as a brake on this process. And Carsten Spohr, Lufthansa's chief, admitted: \\"All the safety nets we are all so proud of here have not worked in this case.\\" But Mr Spohr also said: \\"No matter your safety regulations, no matter how high you set the bar, and we have incredibly high standards, there is no way to rule out such an event. This is an awful one-off event.\\" Aircraft-assisted pilot suicides are rare. A 2014 study by the Federal Aviation Authority identified eight such instances in the US between 2003 and 2012, accounting for 0.29% of all fatal aviation aircraft accidents. All the pilots involved had been medically screened and none had demonstrated mental disorder, depression or suicidal thoughts. Some people are asking why there is no system for wresting control of a plane from a control tower. In fact, such a system does exist, reports the Daily Mail, but it is not being used. In 2006, Boeing was awarded a patent for an \\"uninterrupted autopilot system\\" with its own power supply that could be activated by those on board a plane or on the ground. However, safety concerns - including the possibility that such a system could be hacked - have prevented its roll-out. The crash also raises questions about the cockpit door mechanism which Lubitz used to keep the pilot out. The system, which allows a pilot to override the coded entry mechanism on the outside of the door, was designed in the event of a terrorist emergency. Airlines are going to have to balance those concerns against the possibility that individuals like Lubitz might decide to do harm, said the BBC's transport correspondent Richard Westcott. Lubitz was able to fly the plane into the ground without interruption since he seized the opportunity to lock the cockpit doors while the plane's pilot was going to the toilet. Some airlines enforce a \\"rule of two\\" - that there should never be fewer than two people left in the cockpit. For these airlines, a member of the cabin crew enters the cockpit when appropriate to ensure this rule is followed. After the Germanwings crash, several airlines, including Lufthansa, announced they were adopting this rule. The European Aviation Safety Agency has recommended that at least two people be present in the cockpit at all times. China's aviation authority has also introduced the rule and the UK's Civil Aviation Authority has contacted all UK airlines \\"to require them to review all relevant procedures\\". What relatives of plane crash victims need most are answers, experts say. But the more we learn about Lubitz, the more heartbreaking the Germanwings crash seems. Evidence from research suggests that trauma inflicted by other humans on purpose is more difficult to come to terms with than natural disasters, clinical psychologist Roderick Orner told the BBC. Acts of violence are also harder to process than accidents due to negligence or mechanical failure. \\"Violence is often experienced as an attack on human integrity,\\" says psychiatrist Lars Weiseth. \\"This aspect causes increasing anger, loss of trust in companies and people, and sharply increases the risk to mental health.\\" The fact that Lubitz seemingly had no agenda for his actions does not necessarily make things easier, since the deaths could seem meaningless. If he had been a terrorist, Prof Weiseth says, relatives might be able to see their family members as \\"involuntary participants in an important struggle for democratic values\\".","output":"A man named Lubitz was flying a plane but he was very sad and not feeling well. He decided to crash the plane on purpose which was a very bad thing to do. Investigators found out that he had hidden his sickness from his friends and the people he worked with. Even though they now know more about Lubitz, there are still some questions that may never be answered. Now, airplane people are making some changes to make sure this doesn't happen again. But sometimes, bad things can still happen even when people try their best to be safe."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: A.C.

And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. Question: When should sportspeople consider taking protein supplements? Options: - When they are fasting - When they are traveling - not enough information - When they are eating a high protein meal === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"When they are traveling."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Step 1: Choose a language other than English.

The film also has comedic elements, including repeatedly frustrated attempts by the newlywed couple to find a moment alone with each other. The story begins when Peter is sent to Manhattan to retrieve his playboy cousin Keith (Ellison) and immediately falls in love with Francey. After a whirlwind one-day courtship, Peter and Francey get married, and they and Keith return to the Morgan family's home, where Peter teaches at the university run by his father Peter Morgan Sr. (Coburn). Mr. Morgan is known for being a proud, overbearing man, so Peter is afraid to tell him about the marriage. When they arrive, Mr. Morgan and Peter's high-society fiancÃ©e Helen (Mercer) initially take Francey for another of Keith's girlfriends. While Peter decides how to approach his father with the news, Francey stays at a women-only hotel, and Peter and Keith introduce her as a new botany student. Peter mentions Francey to his father twice, but on both occasions, Mr. Morgan interrupts and ignores his son, and when Peter becomes insistent, his apparently ailing mother (Bondi) has a flare-up of her heart condition, making any further conversation impossible. For his third attempt, Peter decides to announce the marriage to his parents at the university's student-faculty prom. Keith brings Francey to the prom as his own guest, and Francey, still posing as a student, develops a friendly rapport with Mrs. Morgan, but gets into a nasty brawl with Helen in which Francey accidentally punches Peter's father. Peter says nothing at the prom, but blurts the news to his father just as Mr. Morgan is about to give an important speech, resulting in another argument and another flare-up of Mrs. Morgan's heart condition.

Where might he got for more? Options: - windows 95 - school - ammunition shop - office supply store - desk The answer is \\"office supply store\\" because The answer is:","output":"\\"Office supply store\\" because an office supply store specializes in providing various office-related items and equipment that are essential for the smooth functioning of day-to-day activities, be it for personal use, use in schools and colleges, or businesses. One of the common and most sought-after items in an office supply store is a clipboard, which is a significant accessory for maintaining documents in an organized manner. Firstly, let's take a look at the provided options and understand why the other options might not be suitable for Sam to get more clipboards: - Windows 95: Windows 95 is a long-outdated operating system software developed by Microsoft. It was released in 1995 as part of the Windows operating system family. It is unrelated to clipboards or any physical office supplies. Rather, it’s a software with no connection to the current hardware need. - School: While it's true that schools might have clipboards in their inventory, they are not the ideal place for Sam to acquire more clipboards. Schools are educational institutions meant for learning and not for retail sale of office supplies. Moreover, even if Sam is affiliated with a school, it would make more sense for him to buy clipboards from a dedicated store rather than sourcing it from within the school's inventory. - Ammunition shop: An ammunition shop primarily deals with the sale of firearms, ammunition, and other tactical gear. It is an unlikely place to find clipboards as their primary focus lies in catering to the needs of gun enthusiasts and law enforcement personnel, rather than providing office supplies. - Desk: A desk, be it at home or in the office, might have a couple of clipboards lying around, but this doesn't mean that it would have an adequate supply of clipboards if Sam were to run out of them. A desk is a piece of furniture that provides space for work and storage, but it is not a location where additional clipboards can be sourced if needed. Now, focusing on why the office supply store is the most appropriate option: - Office supply store: Office supply stores are dedicated to providing a wide range of office essentials, including stationery, furniture, storage solutions, and various office accessories. The primary reason Sam would choose an office supply store to get more clipboards is that such stores offer a variety of options in terms of size, material, and design. Sam can easily find a suitable clipboard that meets his requirements and preferences. Additionally, office supply stores often provide volume discounts and cater to bulk orders, which might be beneficial if Sam requires a large number of clipboards. In conclusion, an office supply store is the most logical and convenient place for Sam to obtain more clipboards as it focuses on offering diverse office related products, meeting a wide range of preferences and requirements. On the other hand, other options like Windows 95, school, ammunition shop, and desk either don't provide any connection to the hardware or serve a different purpose altogether, making them inappropriate choices for Sam's needs."},{"instruction":"Consider the question.

Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help.

Anti-IS group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently said 32 were killed in one district alone. There was no immediate comment from the coalition, which is supporting Kurdish-led fighters seeking to capture Raqqa. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance launched a ground assault in early June and is now believed to hold more than half of the city, which is the de facto capital of the \\"caliphate\\" proclaimed by IS in 2014. The Syrian Observatory, a UK-based group that monitors the six-year-old civil war through a network of sources, said on Tuesday that 19 children and 12 women were among those killed in Monday's air raids on the Sukhani and Badu districts. The figures took to 167 the number of civilians killed in coalition strikes since 14 August, it said. \\"The tolls are high because the air strikes are hitting neighbourhoods in the city centre that are densely packed with civilians,\\" Syrian Observatory director Rami Abdul Rahman told AFP news agency. \\"There are buildings full of civilians that are trying to get away from the front lines.\\" The coalition has not yet responded to the report, but said it had conducted 20 air strikes in the Raqqa area on Monday, engaging 13 IS tactical units and destroying 24 fighting positions, a vehicle, a logistics node and communications infrastructure. At the start of June, the coalition said its 22,983 air strikes in Syria and Iraq since 2014 had unintentionally killed at least 624 civilians. However, human rights groups believe the true figure is far higher. Airwars, an organisation that tracks allegations of civilian deaths, said that as of 8 August, coalition air strikes were likely to have killed at least 4,487 civilians in three years. On Monday, UN spokesman StÃ©phane Dujarric told reporters that it was deeply concerned for the safety of up to 25,000 civilians trapped inside Raqqa, many of them women and children. Tens of thousands of people had fled the city, but those remaining faced severe restrictions of movement in and out of the city, which had dwindling food and water supplies, he said. \\"The UN stresses again that all parties to the fighting are obligated to protect civilians under international humanitarian law, as well as the need for sustained and unhindered access to those who need help,\\" Mr Dujarric added.","output":"At least 42 civilians were killed in Raqqa, Syria, in air strikes conducted by a US-led coalition on areas held by the Islamic State, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following tweet? Tweet:Boreddddd. got my Camera today","output":"Step 1: Identify the key terms in the tweet which can indicate sentiment. The key terms in the tweet are 'Boreddddd' and 'got my Camera today.' Step 2: Analyze each key term for sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). 'Boreddddd' indicates a negative sentiment as it expresses the feeling of boredom. 'got my Camera today' indicates a positive sentiment as it expresses the satisfaction of acquiring a new item (a camera). Step 3: Combine the sentiments of each key term. In this step, we need to consider whether the sentiments expressed by the key terms are strong enough to impact the overall sentiment of the tweet or whether they are neutralized by each other. In this case, the negative sentiment of 'Boreddddd' is not strong enough to negate the positive sentiment of 'got my Camera today.' Step 4: Determine the overall sentiment of the tweet. As the positive sentiment outweighs the negative sentiment, the overall sentiment of the tweet is positive. Note: It's important to keep in mind that sentiment analysis can sometimes be ambiguous due to the limitations of natural language understanding and the complexity of human emotions.

We have this equation: 988 * y - 10553 - 5255 = 0 First, we need to add the two numbers that we need to subtract: -10553 - 5255 = -15808 So our equation now looks like this: 988 * y - 15808 = 0 Now, we want to find the value of y. To do that, let's add 15808 to both sides of the equation: 988 * y = 15808 Finally, we need to find out how many times 988 \\"fits\\" in 15808. We do that by dividing 15808 by 988: y = 15808 ÷ 988 y = 16 So the answer is: y = 16"},{"instruction":"Test for natural language inference.

New Order were formed in the demise of their previous post-punk band Joy Division, following the suicide of vocalist Ian Curtis. They were joined by Gillian Gilbert on keyboards later that year. Their integration of post-punk with electronic and dance music made them one of the most critically acclaimed and influential bands of the 1980s. The initial release as New Order was the single \\"Ceremony\\", backed with \\"In a Lonely Place\\". These two songs were written in the weeks before Curtis took his own life. With the release of Movement in November 1981, New Order initially started on a similar route as their previous incarnation, performing dark, melodic songs, albeit with an increased use of synthesisers. The band viewed the period as a low point, as they were still reeling from Curtis' death. Hook commented that the only positive thing to come out of the Movement sessions was that producer Martin Hannett had showed the band how to use a mixing board, which allowed them to produce records by themselves from then on. More recently, Hook indicated a change of heart: \\"I think Movement gets a raw deal in general really - for me, when you consider the circumstances in which it was written, it is a fantastic record.\\" New Order visited New York City again in 1981, where the band were introduced to post-disco, freestyle and electro. The band had taken to listening to Italian disco to cheer themselves up, while Morris taught himself drum programming. The singles that followed, \\"Everything's Gone Green\\" and \\"Temptation\\", saw a change in direction toward dance music. The Hacienda, Factory Records' own nightclub (largely funded by New Order) opened in May 1982 in Manchester and was even issued a Factory catalogue number: FAC51. The opening of UK's first ever superclub was marked by a nearly 23-minute instrumental piece originally entitled \\"Prime 5 8 6\\", but released 15 years later as \\"Video 5 8 6\\". Composed primarily by Sumner and Morris, \\"Prime 5 8 6\\"/\\"Video 5 8 6\\" was an early version of \\"5 8 6\\" that contained rhythm elements that would later surface on \\"Blue Monday\\" and \\"Ultraviolence\\". 1985's Low-Life refined and sometimes mixed the two styles, brandishing \\"The Perfect Kiss\\"--the video for which was filmed by Jonathan Demme--and \\"Sub-culture\\". In February 1986, the soundtrack album to Pretty in Pink featuring \\"Shellshock\\" was released on A&M Records. An instrumental version of \\"Thieves Like Us\\" and the instrumental \\"Elegia\\" appeared in the film but were not on the soundtrack album. Later that summer, New Order headlined a line-up that included the Smiths, the Fall, and A Certain Ratio during the Festival of the Tenth Summer at Manchester's G-Mex. Brotherhood (1986) divided the two approaches onto separate album sides. The album notably featured \\"Bizarre Love Triangle\\" and \\"Angel Dust\\" (of which a remixed instrumental version is available on the UK \\"True Faith\\" CD video single, under the title \\"Evil Dust\\"), a track which marries a synth break beat with Low-Life-era guitar effects. While New Order toured North America with friends Echo & the Bunnymen, the summer of 1987 saw the release of the compilation Substance, which featured the new single \\"True Faith\\". Substance was an important album in collecting the group's 12-inch singles onto CD for the first time and featured new versions of \\"Temptation\\" and \\"Confusion\\"--referred to as \\"Temptation '87\\" and \\"Confusion '87\\". A second disc featured several of the B-sides from the singles on the first disc, as well as additional A-sides \\"Procession\\" and \\"Murder\\". The single, \\"True Faith\\", with its surreal video, became a hit on MTV and the band's first American top 40 hit. The single's B-side, \\"1963\\"--originally planned on being the A-side until the group's label convinced them to release \\"True Faith\\" instead--would later be released as a single in its own right several years later, with two new versions. In December 1987, the band released a further single, \\"Touched by the Hand of God\\", with a Kathryn Bigelow-directed video parodying glam-metal. The single reached number 20 on the UK Singles Chart and number 1 in the UK Independent Singles chart, but would not appear on an album until the 1994 compilation The Best of New Order. The group reconvened in 1998 at the suggestion of Rob Gretton. Nearly five years had passed since they had last seen each other. Sumner said, \\"We decided before we agreed to doing any gig, to have a meeting, and if anyone had any grudges to bear, to iron them out.\\" By the second meeting everyone agreed to continue playing, scheduling their reunion gig for the Phoenix Festival that same year. In addition to rarer songs, New Order also decided to begin playing Joy Division songs again. When the Phoenix Festival was cancelled due to low ticket sales, New Order instead played the last night of that year's Reading Festival. Their 2001 release Get Ready largely departed from their more electronic style and focused on more guitar oriented music. According to Sumner, \\"Get Ready was guitar-heavy simply because we felt that we'd left that instrument alone for a long time.\\" Longtime fan Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins played guitar and sang back-up on the track \\"Turn My Way,\\" and in 2001 toured with the band on dates in the UK, US, and Japan for a short period of time. Phil Cunningham (formerly of Marion) joined the band in a live capacity, deputising for Gilbert who declined to tour in favour of caring for her and Morris' children. Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie provided vocals on the track \\"Rock the Shack\\". Singles from the album included Crystal, 60 Miles an Hour and Someone Like You. In 2002, Q featured New Order on their list of the \\"50 Bands to See Before You Die\\", although this was as part of a sub-list of \\"5 Bands That Could Go Either Way\\". Both New Order and Joy Division were portrayed in the Michael Winterbottom film 24 Hour Party People, depicting the rise and fall of Factory Records as seen through the eyes of label founder Tony Wilson. Cameos by Wilson himself, along with Mark E. Smith of The Fall and former members of Happy Mondays and Inspiral Carpets, lent a degree of legitimacy to the proceedings. The film touched on some of Factory's other artists, including Happy Mondays and The Durutti Column. The soundtrack featured the new track Here to Stay, produced by the Chemical Brothers, which was released as a single.

The script manages to throw everything into a near-fever pitch, but without making it incoherent. The speed of this thriller is not to chosen to cover up a weak script, but rather to accurately reflect the drug-addled reality. As director, James Cox as a very peculiar way of working his actors. Most of the characters are perpetually on edge, and often because they're rather quite ugly personalities. Val Kilmer has described John Holmes to be a hustler, able to manipulate and control. No offense to Kilmer, but his version of Holmes seems only able to control the drastically weak-minded. Nonetheless, it's a stunning performance. Comparing this to Kilmer's more 'Hollywood' roles like in \\"The Saint\\" it seems to prove he is far more at home in gritty indie flicks. The actors are the main force holding all together. There are various little performances that stand out - especially the women. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth, and Lisa Kudrow all have limited screen time next to their male counterparts, but they are all fantastic. Aside from Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott give a weird, stunning energy to their roles. I originally put off watching \\"Wonderland\\" because I assumed it was a film about a porn actor, in the strictest sense. Yes, the story revolves around John Holmes, but it has literally nothing to do with his professional career. Basically, this film is a murder mystery, and as such - it's excellent.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Don't Change the Subject Movie plot: The movie begins with frank, humorous interviews of two men who set out to kill themselves and then moves into a Day Of The Dead celebration where the guests celebrate the lives of those whom they have lost. Director Stutz questions his family about his mother's suicide in 1979 and how little they've actually discussed it, visiting his mother's grave site with his sister and listening to old tapes of their mother. He talks to several survivors and experts before commissioning several artists to come up with works about suicide: A band (The Bigfellas) agrees to make a song about suicide \\"that you can dance to\\"; an illustrator (Patrick Horvath) is to make short animated films (which run through the documentary as interstitials); a choreographer (Danielle Peig) chooses to create a dance piece based on two autopsy reports; and a standup comedian (Duncan Trussell) compiles material for his act about suicide with the help of several top comedy writers. Meanwhile, Stutz continues to interview and engage his family about his mother's death, eventually staging his mother's suicide (where he discovered her unconscious at the age of 12) on screen with members of the \\"avant-garde circus\\" troupe, The Lucent Dossier Experience. As some of the interviews take a turn from the dark to the more cathartic, the tone of the movie brightens at the end during the performances of the artistic material. The interview subjects give positive, inspiring messages to the audience about things they can actively do to help prevent suicides and connect more deeply with those they love.

The two Australians, jailed in Kerobokan Prison, applied for clemency from the country's former president two years ago but it was ignored. 'I will reject clemency request submitted by 64 death convicted of drugs cases,' Mr Joko said during a lecture at Gadjah Mada University on Tuesday. If Mr Joko's comments are taken at face value it means Chan and Sukumaran now have no hope for avoiding the death penalty. According to Indonesian news website Kompas.com, Mr Joko said most of the prisoners had 'destroyed the future of the nation'. Scroll down for video. Bali Nine enforcer, Myuran Sukumaran (left) and mastermind Andrew Chan in a holding cell at Denpasar Court after they were sentenced to death for heroin trafficking in Denpasar, Bali, on February 14, 2006. Sukumaran has turned to art during his time in the notorious prison and entered a self-portrait for consideration for the Archibald Prize this year. He said the rejection of clemency served as 'important shock therapy' for drug dealers, traffickers and users. Mr Joko also revealed during an appearance at a Yogyakarta State University for Human Rights Day that the requests for clemency had remain untouched for years under his predecessor Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. 'I'm asking now, what should I do? For years no decisions have been taken. I say now I will issue no pardon for drugs [criminals],' he clarified. Mr Joko's new policy will condemn Chan, Sukumaran and more than 60 other drug prisoners to the firing squad. President of Indonesia Joko Widodo says drug convicts have 'destroyed the future of the nation' Myuran Sukumaran, then 24, and Andrew Chan, then 22, fromSydney, were arrested along with seven other Australians.

The comments come just a week after the president's office announced that five convicts would be executed by the end of the month. Chan and Sukumaran, from Sydney, were arrested in 2005. Chan was stopped at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Bali's capital Denpasar and Sukumaran was arrested in a room at the Melasti Hotel in Kuta with three others. According to court testimonies of convicted drug mules, Chan and Sukumaran were the co-ringleaders of a heroin smuggling operation from Indonesia to Australia. Police found 334 g (11.8 oz) of heroin in a suitcase in the room with Sukumaran which was allegedly going to be smuggled. After a criminal trial, on 14 February 2006 Chan and Sukumaran were sentenced to execution by firing squad by the Denpasar District Court. The men's friends and family have been running an appeal, pleading for mercy, for years and say since they have been in prison they have admitted and apologised for their crimes. They both pleaded for clemency from former Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono before he left office. In June, Daily Mail Australia reported how Sukumaran had entered a self-portrait for consideration for the Archibald Prize from his jail cell in Bali - but his painting wasn't considered because he was locked up abroad. He had hoped to compete for the prestigious art prize that includes 75,000 in cash. Sukumaran turned to art while serving his death row sentence in Bali, while Chan has turned to Christianity and hopes to become a pastor if he is released. Both criminals pleaded for clemency from former Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono before he left office. Sukumaran flew a self-portrait of himself to the Art Gallery of NSW for consideration. The men's friends and family have been running an appeal, pleading for mercy, for years. Brigid Delaney co-founder of the Mercy Campaign, an online petition collecting signatures of people appealing for clemency for the men, said that the campaign would continue. 'Please visit the Mercy Campaign website and sign our petition if you believe that the lives of Myuran and Andrew should be spared.' Article 14 of the Indonesian Constitution gives the President a broad power to grant clemency. It doesn’t mean the prisoner walks free from jail; in a death penalty case it means the prisoner stays in jail but does not face execution. The Mercy appeal says: 'Andrew and Myuran have now admitted and apologised for their crimes. They are doing their best to better themselves and help those around them. 'Andrew and Myuran were convicted of trafficking drugs from Indonesia to Australia. They admit they committed that crime. They admit that they were selfish and greedy and they have now completely reformed. Their crime was not a violent one. 'Andrew and Myuran agree that they deserve punishment. They do not deserve to be executed by firing squad.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted Sukumaran's lawyer for comment. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Bali Nine inmates Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan are two people from Australia who did something very bad - they tried to bring illegal drugs from Indonesia to Australia. Because of this, they were put in jail and are going to be punished.

Following the slap, John is threatened with a dishonorable discharge, further adding to his sense of guilt and shame. However, the sudden death of Patton's longtime friend and confidante, Colonel James, who is killed during a surprise enemy attack, shifts Patton's perspective on the meaning of bravery. Realizing that courage comes in many forms, Patton approaches John and offers him a chance at redemption: help him lead a dangerous mission that could weaken the enemy's forces for good. As tensions heighten and the stakes rise, the soldiers must work together if they have any hope of survival. Despite their initial animosity, Patton and John find common ground and mutual respect through their shared experiences of loss and determination to win the war. As the mission unfolds, John faces his fears and showcases his heroic qualities, even saving Patton from enemy fire. In the end, the mission is a success, and John not only finds the inner strength to overcome his PTSD but also gains the admiration of both his comrades and General Patton, who publicly apologizes for his earlier actions and praises John for his unwavering bravery. No Greater Honor is a thrilling and heart-warming war film that explores themes of courage, friendship, and redemption. This uplifting story demonstrates that sometimes, the greatest battles we face are within ourselves, and even the most calloused of hearts can change."},{"instruction":"You are given a sentence in Galician.

The restaurant has truly outdone itself in delivering impeccable service, high-quality dishes, and an elegant ambiance. This place is a gem! Firstly, the decor strikes the perfect balance of sophistication and warmth. The soft lighting creates an intimate atmosphere, while the tasteful artwork showcases a touch of modern flair. The well-placed tables allow for comfortable conversations, and their outdoor courtyard setting, adorned with twinkling fairy lights, offers a magical, al fresco dining experience that's perfect for a romantic evening or a serene dinner with friends. Upon being seated, we were greeted with warm hospitality and genuine smiles from the servers and staff. Our waiter was extremely attentive, friendly, and well-informed about the menu selections, ensuring that we were aware of the day's specials and recommendations according to our preferences and dietary restrictions. They were also knowledgeable about the restaurant's impressive wine list, helping us choose the perfect wine pairing for our meal. The Gourmet Bistro boasts a diverse and creative menu, offering an array of dishes that cater to different tastes and dietary choices. From vibrant, refreshing salads to indulgent pasta dishes, each item on the menu piqued our interest. After much deliberation and input from our gracious server, we opted for the following dishes: - Starter: Seared Scallops with Cauliflower Puree & Hazelnut Pesto - The scallops were incredibly tender and perfectly seared, while the combination of cauliflower puree and hazelnut pesto offered a unique, earthy flavor profile that beautifully complemented the dish. Each bite was heavenly! - Main Course: Herb-Crusted Rack of Lamb with Seasonal Vegetables & Red Wine Sauce - The lamb was cooked to perfection, tender, and bursting with flavor from the herb crust. The seasonal vegetables were crunchy, fresh, and wonderfully seasoned, and the red wine sauce tied the whole ensemble together with a velvety, rich finish. We also decided on the handmade Truffle Gnocchi with Wild Mushrooms, and it was an absolute delight. The gnocchi was pillow soft, and the delectable aroma of the truffle and wild mushrooms made this dish an unforgettable part of our dinner. - Dessert: Chocolate Fondant with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream - A seemingly simple dessert but executed flawlessly. The fondant was rich and oozed molten chocolate with a slight crack of the spoon, while the ice cream was creamy, smooth, and redolent with the true flavor of vanilla bean. It was the perfect conclusion to a spectacular meal. Throughout the course of the evening, the staff continued to be attentive and thoughtful. The pacing of the meal was perfect, with each course arriving with just enough time in between to savor and share impressions about the dishes. The Gourmet Bistro has truly set the bar high for exceptional service, culinary mastery, and an enchanting atmosphere. It is a must-visit for anyone looking for a memorable and gratifying dining experience. I can't wait for my next visit!"},{"instruction":"Solve 0 = -844*t + 747*t - 2402 + 10453 for t.

Despite William Bruce's fall from political favour, and his intermittent imprisonment, he continued to practice. During the 1690s he completed Hill of Tarvit (1696), Craighall (1697–99) in Fife, and Craigiehall (1699) near Edinburgh. The latter, built for the Marquess of Annandale, still stands, and is used as the British Army's Scottish headquarters. From 1698 he was working on a new house for the young Charles Hope, later first Earl of Hopetoun. Hopetoun House, near Edinburgh, was completed in 1702, and represents Bruce's grandest country house design. The master mason was again Thomas Bauchop, and the inspiration was again Anglo-Dutch, with French rustication. The bulk of Bruce's work is now obscured by 18th-century remodelling, carried out by William Adam. Bruce was commissioned again by Hopetoun in 1708, to build a private aisle at Abercorn Kirk. The Hopetoun Loft overlooks the interior of the kirk, and connects to a retiring room with an oval \\"squint\\" giving a view of the pulpit.In 1702 Bruce was commissioned by the burgesses of Stirling to design a new tolbooth for the town. Bruce provided only sketch plans, which were executed by local masons between 1703 and 1705. Bruce's last country houses were Harden House (now known as Mertoun House), built for the Scotts in the Borders, and his smallest house, Auchendinny in Midlothian. His final work, in around 1710, was for Nairne House, for the Jacobite Lord Nairne. The house was not completed until two years after Bruce's death, and the extent of his involvement is unclear. Nairne House was demolished in 1760, although the cupola was retained and installed on the roof of the King James VI Hospital in nearby Perth.

During his stage life, he combined the traditions of the past with his own creations, shaping a style of his own and giving birth to \\"The Mei Lanfang School\\". He was also the first artist to introduce Peking Opera to an overseas audience, making it popular to the world. Mei Lanfang began his stage life at the age of 8. His teacher said he showed little hope because of his boring eyes. To improve this, he exercised them day after day. Thanks to his efforts, he managed to change his dull eyes into a pair of bright and expressive eyes and win national fame before the age of 20. In over 50 years on the stage, Mei Lanfang played no less than 100 different characters in the performance. He also wrote many new plays, designing the dances himself. The many dances he created form part of the great treasure that he left to Peking Opera. In 1930, Mei Lanfang started on a successful US tour. There his brilliant performances impressed the audience, making them realize that Peking Opera was a theatrical form of great value. Question: How long did it take Mei Lanfang to exercise his eyes into bright and expressive? Yes or no, is the answer \\"About 12 years.\\"? Answer:","output":"The information provided in the article does not give an exact duration for how long Mei Lanfang took to exercise and improve his eyes into bright and expressive ones. However, it is mentioned that Mei Lanfang began his stage life at the age of 8, and he managed to win national fame before the age of 20. Given this information, it can be inferred that it may have taken him around 12 years (or less) to exercise and transform his eyes into bright and expressive ones as he developed his skills and gained fame during this period.

The African Union has suspended Burkina Faso and threatened sanctions unless the junta releases all interim political figures from detention. The US and France have also condemned the coup in the former French colony. The coup leaders have agreed to the \\"principle of dialogue\\", as two West African leaders arrived in the country to mediate in the crisis. At least three people have died in protests in the capital, Ouagadougou, after an ally of ex-President Blaise Compaore was named leader on Thursday. The influential Balai Citoyen civil society group has put the number of people who have died in demonstrations against the presidential guard (RSP) , at 10. An unknown number of protesters have also been detained. The BBC's Laeila Adjovi in Ouagadougou says demonstrators gathered around the airport for the arrival of a delegation from the regional body, the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas). The delegation was led by Senegal's President Macky Sall, the current Ecowas chair, and Benin's leader Thomas Boni Yayi. Ahead of their arrival, the air and land borders were officially re-opened. Security forces again fired in the air on Friday to disperse to demonstrators who burned tyres and blocked streets in the city, our reporter says. Elections were due to be held in the West African nation on 11 October, nearly a year after a popular uprising forced Mr Compaore, the long-time ruler of the West African country, from power. Coup leader Gen Gilbert Diendere, who was Mr Compaore's former chief-of-staff, told reporters that Mr Kafando was now in his official residence. He was reportedly freed on Thursday but has not yet been seen in public. Two other minister have also been released, the coup leaders say. The decision to free them was made \\"as a sign of easing tensions and in the general interest\\", a statement read on national television said. Prime Minister Zida was the army officer who took charge after Mr Compaore was ousted. The lieutenant colonel was number two in the RSP, where he may still hold influence, which explains his continued detention, says BBC Afrique's Lamine Konkobo. The elite presidential guard has been trained, in part, by the US. It is the most powerful armed group in Burkina Faso and often disrupted the activities of the transitional government as it tried to cling to the privileges it enjoyed under Mr Compaore's rule. It is seen to be close to him, and is not popular on the streets. So its seizure of power could be a recipe for serious violence. The transitional government might have made two mistakes - preventing politicians loyal to Mr Compaore from running in next month's elections and allowing the Reconciliation Commission, formed to heal wounds after the end of his authoritarian rule, to release a report calling for the presidential guard to be disbanded. Some argue that a newly elected president would have had greater legitimacy to take such action. Mr Compaore is currently in exile and was accused of committing widespread abuses, and trying to change the constitution to extend his term in office. Some of his key allies had been barred from contesting the election. Gen Diendere has said he has had no contact with Mr Compaore and will do everything to \\"avoid violence that could plunge the country into chaos\\". An earlier announcement on state television said wide-ranging talks would be held to form a new interim government that would organise \\"peaceful and inclusive elections\\". Transitional parliamentary speaker Cheriff Sy called for people to \\"immediately rise up\\" against the coup, and declared himself the leader. The coup was announced on the day that a judge was due to give the results of DNA tests on the remains of former President Thomas Sankara, his widow Mariam Sankara told the BBC. Her husband was killed in a 1987 coup that saw Mr Compaore and fellow officers such as his close friend Gen Diendere take power.

First, we need to move the term containing t from the right side to the left side. We do this by subtracting 2094*t from both sides of the equation: (2104*t - 2094*t) - 60 = 2094*t - 2094*t Step 3: Now, simplify the equation: 10*t - 60 = 0 Step 4: To isolate t, we need to get rid of the constant term, -60, on the left side. We do this by adding 60 to both sides of the equation: 10*t - 60 + 60 = 0 + 60 Step 5: Simplify the equation: 10*t = 60 Step 6: Now, we have an equation where t is multiplied by 10 (10*t). To find the value of t, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 10: (10*t) / 10 = 60 / 10 Step 7: Simplify the equation and find the value of t: t = 6 The answer is t = 6."},{"instruction":"Question: Answer the question below: If you are at a loud rock concert what will not happen to your hearing increase or decrease? Assuming that: The louder the sounds are, the less exposure is needed to cause hearing loss. Answer:","output":"At a loud rock concert, the high sound levels and noise exposure can potentially cause hearing damage, depending on the intensity of the sound, duration of exposure, and individual hearing sensitivities. In this scenario, your hearing ability would neither increase nor decrease momentarily while exposed to the loud sounds. However, you could experience temporary or permanent hearing loss as a consequence of the concert, depending on the extent of the exposure and your auditory health. When attending a loud rock concert, noise levels can reach 100 - 120 decibels or even higher. Prolonged exposure to sounds at or above 85 decibels can lead to hearing damage, and the risk of damage increases as sound levels rise. The general rule, as you mentioned, is that the louder the sounds are, the less exposure is needed to cause hearing damage. During the concert, your ears will be exposed to loud noise, and you may experience some initial symptoms of hearing impairment, such as: 1. Temporary threshold shift (TTS): Your hearing might become temporarily less sensitive after leaving the concert due to a temporary threshold shift. This means that you might need to increase the volume of sounds you listen to or need others to speak louder to hear them properly. In most cases, TTS recovers within a few hours to a day or two after the noise exposure. 2. Tinnitus: Tinnitus is the perception of ringing, buzzing, or hissing in one or both ears without an external source of sound. Exposure to loud noises, such as at a concert, can cause temporary or persistent tinnitus, depending on the extent of the noise exposure and individual hearing sensitivities. If you regularly expose yourself to loud concerts or similar situations, your risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) increases. NIHL occurs as a consequence of cumulative damage to the delicate inner ear structures (specifically, the hair cells) that help transmit sound signals to your brain. Over time, this continued exposure to excessive noise can lead to permanent hearing loss. To minimize the potential for hearing damage at a loud rock concert, some precautions you can take include: 1. Wearing earplugs: This can significantly reduce the decibel levels reaching your ears and provide a level of protection. 2. Taking breaks: Give your ears a rest by stepping outside or finding a quieter area for a few minutes every hour. 3. Avoiding close proximity to speakers: The sound intensity increases as you get closer to the source, so maintaining a safe distance from the speakers can reduce the risk of hearing damage. 4. Limiting the duration of exposure: The longer you are exposed to high noise levels, the greater the risk of hearing damage. Limit your exposure time when attending loud concerts. In conclusion, your hearing ability will not increase or decrease during a loud rock concert. However, exposure to the excessive noise levels may lead to temporary or permanent hearing damage over time. To protect your hearing, take necessary precautions such as wearing earplugs, taking breaks, and maintaining a safe distance from the speakers."},{"instruction":"Summarize: Fill a cup or bowl with lukewarm water and add two or three drops of alcohol-free detergent.

Here's a question that has a factual answer: Question: What is the process of photosynthesis, and which organisms carry it out? Answer: Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria called cyanobacteria convert sunlight into chemical energy in the form of glucose, using water and carbon dioxide as reactants. The process generates oxygen as a byproduct, which is essential for the survival of most organisms on Earth. Photosynthesis is vital for life as it is the primary source of energy for all living beings, either directly or indirectly. Photosynthesis takes place in the chlorophyll, a green pigment found in the chloroplasts of plant cells and some algae. The process consists of two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions or the Calvin cycle. In the light-dependent reactions, pigments in the chlorophyll absorb photons from sunlight. This absorbed energy is used to split water molecules (photolysis) into hydrogen ions and oxygen molecules. The oxygen molecules are released into the environment as a waste product. The hydrogen ions and high-energy electrons generated in this process are used to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which are energy-rich molecules. The ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions provide energy and reducing power, respectively, for the light-independent reactions. In the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is fixed into an organic molecule through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. This organic molecule eventually becomes glucose, which can be used as a source of energy or as a building block for more complex organic compounds like cellulose, starch, or other carbohydrates. In summary, photosynthesis is a process carried out by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria to convert sunlight into chemical energy in the form of glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The process involves a series of light-dependent and light-independent reactions that take place in the chlorophyll found in the organisms' cells."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. Italy had two distinct regions. Northern region where the animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, and the southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress. Which region had more species go extinct? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the relationship between abiotic stress and species extinction - As abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases, making species more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct. Step 2: Analyze the abiotic stress in each region of Italy - Northern region: High abiotic stress - Southern region: Low abiotic stress Step 3: Determine which region has a higher likelihood of species extinction - Given the relationship between abiotic stress and species extinction, the region with higher abiotic stress would have a higher likelihood of species extinction. Step 4: Conclusion - Since the Northern region of Italy has higher abiotic stress, more species are likely to have gone extinct in this region compared to the Southern region. Therefore, the answer is the Northern region."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\").

There, she is confronted with the past she's been running from and the people she left behind. Worst of all, she crosses paths with Tom, her ex-boyfriend. Tom, a dashing but introverted local engineer with a soft spot for music, had once dated Ellen. They were high school sweethearts, poised to conquer the world together, their bond seemingly unbreakable. But Ellen's ambition to become a renowned violinist took her away from their little town, and she left Tom without looking back, a forced decision that both relieved and grieved her. Upon entering her mother's house, Ellen discovers old letters from Tom that she never read. The handwritten pages, filled with love, longing, and hurt, stir forgotten feelings within her. She realizes the extent of the pain and rejection she had caused Tom. Struggling with grief and guilt, she decides to apologize. In the meantime, Tom has been living a quiet life in town. Running into Ellen after all these years is a shock for him. He finds himself battling old feelings; love, anger, sadness and the feeling of abandonment. He's conflicted about meeting with Ellen because he thinks he might get hurt again. He avoided the outside world for so long, and years of introspection have made him forgive but not forget the past. Given the circumstances, Ellen seeks Tom out, hoping for forgiveness. Alongside these emotional encounters, Ellen joins the local music club where she and Tom used to play as teenagers in an attempt to show Tom a side of her that still cherishes the love of their past. Tom, witnessing Ellen's growth and the genuine remorse she holds, tentatively allows her back into his life. Traditional rom-com cliches are resisted as the plot progresses. The film's central pillar is their love, but the actual focus is forgiveness, growth, and understanding. Tom, despite being hurt, learns that he still loves Ellen and realizes that he too, has some growing up to do. Meanwhile, Ellen receives an offer to lead a renowned orchestra back in New York. Tempted by the offer, she's thrown into a whirlwind of emotions. Will she repeat the past and leave town, or will she choose a different path? The climax arrives when Ellen publicly declines the offer at a grand violin concert organized by the small town. She dedicates the concert to Tom, expressing in music the emotions she can't wrap in words. Overwhelmed, Tom rushes to the stage to confess his enduring love for her. The movie ends with Ellen staying in her hometown, rekindling her love with Tom, and taking up the responsibility of the local music club. She understands that success isn't just performing in grand theaters, but also touching people's hearts with music, especially someone's heart who has been waiting for her for long. \\"Ellen's Melody – An Unfinished Love Story\\" thus ends on a happy note, blending love, music, forgiveness, healing, and self-discovery into a well-rounded narrative that viewers could resonate with, leaving them with the beautiful echoes of Ellen's Melody."},{"instruction":"Read this and answer the question.

Add pomegranate juice (about 1/4 teaspoon) to your water when boiling eggs. It will help the eggshells peel off easier.. 2). Add baking soda (about 1/4 teaspoon) to your water when boiling eggs. It will help the eggshells peel off easier..","output":"Option 2: Add baking soda (about 1/4 teaspoon) to your water when boiling eggs. It will help the eggshells peel off easier. Easily peeling hard-boiled eggs can be a tricky task, but by incorporating baking soda into the boiling process, you can simplify this task. Baking soda helps to raise the pH level of the water, which in turn weakens the bond between the egg white and the shell, making the peeling process much easier. Here is a detailed step-by-step guide to using baking soda for easy egg peeling: 1. Prep your eggs: Select fresh eggs without any cracks on the surface. 2. Prepare a pot: Choose a pot that can comfortably accommodate the number of eggs you want to cook, ensuring they form a single layer at the bottom. 3. Add water and baking soda: Fill the pot with enough water to cover the eggs by at least one inch. Add approximately 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda per quart of water or use a ratio of about 1/2 teaspoon for four cups of water. Gently stir the water to dissolve the baking soda completely. 4. Add eggs: Carefully place the eggs into the pot, avoiding any breakages. Turn on the heat and bring the water to a rolling boil. 5. Cook eggs: Once the water reaches a boil, reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Allow the eggs to cook for about 12-15 minutes, depending on your desired yolk consistency. While the eggs are boiling, prepare an ice bath in a large bowl by filling it with ice and cold water. This ice bath will halt the cooking process once the eggs are removed from the boiling water, preventing overcooking. 6. Remove eggs from heat: After the cooking time has elapsed, use a slotted spoon or tongs to carefully transfer the eggs from the boiling water to the ice bath. 7. Cool eggs: Let the eggs cool in the ice bath for at least 5 minutes or until they are cool enough to handle. 8. Gently crack the eggs: To peel the eggs, first gently tap the egg on a hard surface, such as a countertop, until you notice small cracks all over the shell. Alternatively, you can roll the egg gently between your hands, applying just enough pressure to crack the shell without damaging the egg. 9. Begin peeling: Start peeling the egg from the larger end, where the air pocket usually resides. This will make it easier to get started as there should be a slight gap between the shell and the egg white. 10. Use running water or the ice bath to assist peeling: If you're having difficulty peeling the egg, you can hold it under running water or submerge the peeled portion in the ice bath. The water will help to loosen the membrane under the shell, making it easier to peel the egg. Following these steps will result in hard-boiled eggs that peel more easily thanks to the added baking soda. This method is a simple and effective way to create a smoother and more enjoyable egg-peeling experience."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Generate a 5-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package org.geometerplus.zlibrary.ui.android.

The cardboard traveled a greater distance across the snow than it did across the grass because there was more resistance on the (A) grass (B) snow. Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"snow\\" and \\"grass\\". The answer is:","output":"grass. The cardboard traveled a greater distance across the snow than it did across the grass because there was more resistance on the grass. There are several factors that contribute to the difference in resistance between the two surfaces. 1. Surface friction: One of the primary factors affecting the sliding distance is the level of friction between the cardboard and the surface it is sliding on. Snow, which is comprised of ice crystals, tends to have a lower level of friction compared to grass. Grass, on the other hand, has higher coefficients of friction due to its textured surface, made up of individual blades and potentially uneven ground beneath. This increased friction on the grass results in more resistance, slowing down the cardboard and causing it to travel a shorter distance than it would on snow. 2. Moisture Content: The moisture content of the surfaces also plays a role in the level of resistance encountered. Snow typically has some level of moisture content, which can act as a lubricant when sliding across it. The thin layer of water that forms between the snow and the cardboard reduces friction, allowing the cardboard to slide more easily. On the other hand, grass might be relatively dry (depending on weather conditions), causing the cardboard to experience more friction and resistance as it slides across the surface. 3. Surface compression: A key difference between snow and grass is the ability of the surface to compress under pressure. Snow is more easily compressed due to its ice crystal makeup. When the cardboard slides across the snow, the pressure applied compresses the snow, creating a smooth, less resistant path. In contrast, grass is less compressible and maintains its textured surface, generating more resistance as the cardboard slides across it. 4. Temperature: Temperature also has an impact on the sliding distance. In colder conditions, the snow remains in a more solid state, maintaining its lower friction. Warmer temperatures could cause the snow to melt slightly, which might increase the friction and resistance encountered by the cardboard. Grass, however, is not significantly affected by temperature in terms of sliding resistance. In summary, the cardboard travels a greater distance across the snow than across the grass due to the lower resistance experienced on the snow. This is primarily due to the lower surface friction, moisture content acting as a lubricant, surface compression, and the lesser effect of temperature variation on the surface."},{"instruction":"Raise a siege.

Goodall spoke exclusively to CNN in a Panamanian rain forest where she is exploring a partnership on behalf of Roots & Shoots, her global youth education program. The interview comes as a new version of the song, first released on Jackson's 1991 \\"Dangerous\\" album, is being recorded by a collection of artists for release in late October. Goodall became friends with Jackson about 20 years ago when he invited her to his Neverland Ranch, where \\"he talked about his dreams for the place to have animals running, looking free like they would in the wild. ... It was just a very charming day, very low key, nobody else was there,\\" she said.

Jackson asked her for tapes of animals in distress because \\"he wanted to be angry and cry\\" as he wrote the song, which became \\"Heal the World,\\" she said. The original CD cover notes credited Goodall for inspiring the song, she said. But, she added, the Jane Goodall Institute never saw any money from the song.

She just got out of a divorce. And I was wondering What will Robin want to do next? A:","output":"It's important to note that everyone's situation and response will be different, so these are just potential scenarios based on common patterns and behaviors. Having just gone through a divorce and deciding to keep the kids together, what Robin might want to do next can depend on several factors. Some possibilities could range from focusing on maintaining stability for her kids and establishing a new routine, managing financial affairs, pursuing personal and emotional growth, and seeking new opportunities in life. 1. Focusing on Family: Robin's priority might be to ensure her kids are adjusting well to the changes. She'd likely concentrate on keeping them emotionally sound and comfortable by maintaining a stable routine. Open communication would be essential at this point, reassuring her kids that both parents still love them, and despite the shift in dynamics, they'll always be there for them. 2. Managing Financial Affairs: With the divorce finalized, Robin might need to reassess her financial situation. She might need to update or create a new financial plan, adjust her budget, or even seek professional financial advice. It might also mean finding a new home or adapting to living on a single income if she was not the primary earner before the divorce. 3. Emphasizing Emotional Health: Robin might also seek counseling or therapy to process any residual feelings from the divorce. Expect her to take time for her own emotional health because maintaining your inner wellness is an essential part of being a capable and loving parent. Engaging with support groups or informal networks of friends and family can also be an important step in her healing process. 4. Personal Growth and New Hobbies: This could be an opportunity for Robin to pursue interests or hobbies she may have placed on the back burner during her marriage. Developing new skills and engaging in activities she enjoys can provide a positive focus and a sense of achievement, along with acting as a great stress-reliever. This might include going back to school, learning a new language, joining a fitness club, or even starting a new business. 5. Exploring New Relationships: While it's usually recommended to take some time to adjust to single life post-divorce, when ready, Robin may choose to step back into the dating scene. She might want to build new friendships and relationships, which can be an essential step in rebuilding her social life and finding companionship, romance, or just expanding her social circle. 6. Prioritizing Professional Life: If Robin had been out of the workforce or part-time employed during her marriage, she might now need to or decide to pursue greater career opportunities. This could mean going back to school, acquiring additional certifications, seeking job promotions, or landing a new job to provide for her family. Remember that everyone's journey is unique. Therefore, Robin's next steps would depend primarily on her specific circumstances, personal preferences, and the best interests of her family. Although divorce is challenging and difficult, it could also be a time of growth and new beginnings."},{"instruction":"You are presented with the quiz \\"What can cause animals to leave their homes?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints.

Since the 18th century, three scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during each specific phase. These quests are distinguished from earlier approaches because they rely on the historical method to study biblical narratives. While textual analysis of biblical sources had taken place for centuries, these quests introduced new methods and specific techniques to establish the historical validity of their conclusions. - The term \\"historical Jesus\\" refers to attempts to \\"reconstruct the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth by critical historical methods,\\" in \\"contrast to Christological definitions ('the dogmatic Christ') and other Christian accounts of Jesus ('the Christ of faith').\\" It also considers the historical and cultural context in which Jesus lived. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion. - John the Evangelist is the name traditionally given to the author of the Gospel of John. Christians have traditionally identified him with John the Apostle, John of Patmos, and John the Presbyter, though this has been disputed by modern scholars. - The Gospel According to John (also called the Gospel of John, the Fourth Gospel, or simply John) is one of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament. It traditionally appears fourth, after the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John begins with the witness and affirmation of John the Baptist and concludes with the death, burial, resurrection, and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus. - The New Testament (Koine Greek: , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music. - John the Apostle ( Aramaic : Yohanan Shliha ; Hebrew : Yohanan Ben Zavdai ; Koine Greek : ; Latin : Ioannes ; c. AD 6 -- c. 106 ) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament . He was the son of Zebedee and Salome . His brother was James , who was another of the Twelve Apostles . Christian tradition holds that he outlived the remaining apostles and that he was the only one not to die a martyr 's death ( excluding Judas Iscariot who died by suicide ) . The Church Fathers considered him the same person as John the Evangelist , John of Patmos , and the Beloved Disciple , although modern theologians and scholars have not formed a consensus on the relative identities of these mean . The tradition of some Christian denominations holds that John the Apostle is the author of several books of the New Testament . - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD. John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: Well, when we look at sentences, there are generally two types of clauses that can be used to construct them - independent clauses, which can stand alone as complete thoughts, and dependent clauses, which need to be combined with independent clauses to form a complete thought. Think of an independent clause, for instance, as a separate sentence; it has a subject and a predicate, and it functions on its own, without needing any additional context. Dependent clauses, on the other hand, usually have a subject or a verb but rely on an independent clause to complete the idea or make sense. They often start with words like \\"because,\\" \\"although,\\" or \\"when.\\" So when we talk about putting a sentence together, we generally look at how these two elements interact. Combined with appropriate punctuation and conjunctions, we can ensure that the sentence is clear, concise, and coherent, while also providing the necessary context for the reader. Sentence A: An independent clause expresses a complete thought on its own, while a dependent clause relies on an independent clause to create a meaningful sentence."},{"instruction":"Which US singer has had albums called 'Daydream', 'Butterfly', 'Rainbow' and 'Glitter'?","output":"The American singer who has had albums titled 'Daydream', 'Butterfly', 'Rainbow', and 'Glitter' is Mariah Carey.

By launching a giant magnetic shield into space to protect Mars from solar winds, the space agency says we could restore the Red Planet's atmosphere, and terraform the Martian environment so that liquid water flows on the surface once again. Mars may seem like a cold, arid wasteland these days, but the Red Planet is thought to have once had a thick atmosphere that could have maintained deep oceans filled with liquid water, and a warmer, potentially habitable climate. Scientists think Mars lost all of this when its protective magnetic field collapsed billions of years ago, and solar wind – high-energy particles projected from the Sun – has been stripping the Red Planet's atmosphere away ever since. Now, new simulations by NASA suggest there could be a way to naturally give Mars its thick atmosphere back – and it doesn't require nuking the Red Planet into submission, as Elon Musk once proposed. Instead, the space agency thinks a powerful-enough magnetic shield launched into space could serve as a replacement for Mars's own lost magnetosphere, giving the planet a chance to naturally restore its own atmosphere. In new findings presented at the Planetary Science Vision 2050 Workshop last week, NASA's Planetary Science Division director, Jim Green, said launching an \\"artificial magnetosphere\\" into space between Mars and the Sun could hypothetically shield the Red Planet in the extended magnetotail that trails behind the protective field. \\"This situation then eliminates many of the solar wind erosion processes that occur with the planet's ionosphere and upper atmosphere allowing the Martian atmosphere to grow in pressure and temperature over time,\\" the researchers explain in an accompanying paper. While the team acknowledges that the concept might sound \\"fanciful\\", they point to existing miniature magnetosphere research being conducted to protect astronauts and spacecraft from cosmic radiation, and think that the same technology on a larger scale could be used to shield Mars. \\"It may be feasible that we can get up to these higher field strengths that are necessary to provide that shielding,\\" Green said in his presentation. \\"We need to be able then to also modify that direction of the magnetic field so that it always pushes the solar wind away.\\" In the team's simulations, if the solar wind were counteracted by the magnetic shield, Mars's atmospheric losses would stop, and the atmosphere would regain as much as half the atmospheric pressure of Earth in a matter of years. As the atmosphere becomes thicker, the team estimates Mars's climate would become around 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer, which would be enough to melt carbon dioxide ice over the Red Planet's northern polar cap. If this happened, the carbon in the atmosphere would help to trap heat like it does on Earth, triggering a greenhouse effect that could melt Mars's water ice, giving the Red Planet back its liquid water in the form of flowing rivers and oceans. If all of this were to occur as the team anticipates – and admittedly, that's a pretty fantastical if – it's possible that, within the space of a couple of generations, Mars could regain some of its lost Earth-like habitability. \\"This is not terraforming as you may think of it where we actually artificially change the climate, but we let nature do it, and we do that based on the physics we know today,\\" Green said. The team acknowledges that the plan is largely hypothetical at this point, but it's a pretty amazing vision for what might be possible in the years ahead. The researchers intend to keep studying the possibilities to get a more accurate estimate of how long the climate-altering effects would take. If the concept does prove workable, there's no telling just how much it would alter the prospects of colonising Mars in the future. \\"Much like Earth, an enhanced atmosphere would: allow larger landed mass of equipment to the surface, shield against most cosmic and solar particle radiation, extend the ability for oxygen extraction, and provide 'open air' green-houses to exist for plant production, just to name a few,\\" the researchers explain. \\"If this can be achieved in a lifetime, the colonisation of Mars would not be far away.\\" The findings were presented at the Planetary Science Vision 2050 Workshop. ||||| Artist's conception of a terraformed Mars. Credit: Ittiz/Wikimedia Commons NASA proposes a magnetic shield to protect Mars' atmosphere This week, NASA's Planetary Science Division (PSD) hosted a community workshop at their headquarters in Washington, DC. Known as the \\"Planetary Science Vision 2050 Workshop\\", this event ran from February 27th to March 1st, and saw scientists and researchers from all over the world descend on the capitol to attend panel discussions, presentations, and talks about the future of space exploration. One of the more intriguing presentations took place on Wednesday, March 1st, where the exploration of Mars by human astronauts was discussed. In the course of the talk, which was titled \\"A Future Mars Environment for Science and Exploration\\", Director Jim Green discussed how deploying a magnetic shield could enhance Mars' atmosphere and facilitate crewed missions there in the future. The current scientific consensus is that, like Earth, Mars once had a magnetic field that protected its atmosphere. Roughly 4.2 billion years ago, this planet's magnetic field suddenly disappeared, which caused Mars' atmosphere to slowly be lost to space. Over the course of the next 500 million years, Mars went from being a warmer, wetter environment to the cold, uninhabitable place we know today. Artist’s rendering of a solar storm hitting Mars and stripping ions from the planet’s upper atmosphere. Credits: NASA/GSFC This theory has been confirmed in recent years by orbiters like the ESA's Mars Express and NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Mission (MAVEN), which have been studying the Martian atmosphere since 2004 and 2014, respectively. In addition to determining that solar wind was responsible for depleting Mars' atmosphere, these probes have also been measuring the rate at which it is still being lost today. Without this atmosphere, Mars will continue to be a cold, dry place where life cannot flourish. In addition to that, future crewed mission – which NASA hopes to mount by the 2030s – will also have to deal with some severe hazards. Foremost among these will be exposure to radiation and the danger of asphyxiation, which will pose an even greater danger to colonists (should any attempts at colonization be made). In answer to this challenge, Dr. Jim Green – the Director of NASA's Planetary Science Division – and a panel of researchers presented an ambitious idea. In essence, they suggested that by positioning a magnetic dipole shield at the Mars L1 Lagrange Point, an artificial magnetosphere could be formed that would encompass the entire planet, thus shielding it from solar wind and radiation. Naturally, Green and his colleagues acknowledged that the idea might sounds a bit \\"fanciful\\". However, they were quick to emphasize how new research into miniature magnetospheres (for the sake of protecting crews and spacecraft) supports this concept: The proposed method for creating an artificial magnetic dipole at Mars’ L1 Lagrange Point. Credit: NASA/J.Green \\"This new research is coming about due to the application of full plasma physics codes and laboratory experiments. In the future it is quite possible that an inflatable structure(s) can generate a magnetic dipole field at a level of perhaps 1 or 2 Tesla (or 10,000 to 20,000 Gauss) as an active shield against the solar wind.\\" In addition, the positioning of this magnetic shield would ensure that the two regions where most of Mars' atmosphere is lost would be shielded. In the course of the presentation, Green and the panel indicated that these the major escape channels are located, \\"over the northern polar cap involving higher energy ionospheric material, and 2) in the equatorial zone involving a seasonal low energy component with as much as 0.1 kg/s escape of oxygen ions.\\" To test this idea, the research team – which included scientists from Ames Research Center, the Goddard Space Flight Center, the University of Colorado, Princeton University, and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory – conducted a series of simulations using their proposed artificial magnetosphere. These were run at the Coordinated Community Modeling Center (CCMC), which specializes in space weather research, to see what the net effect would be. What they found was that a dipole field positioned at Mars L1 Lagrange Point would be able to counteract solar wind, such that Mars' atmosphere would achieve a new balance. At present, atmospheric loss on Mars is balanced to some degree by volcanic outpassing from Mars interior and crust. This contributes to a surface atmosphere that is about 6 mbar in air pressure (less than 1% that at sea level on Earth). At one time, Mars had a magnetic field similar to Earth, which prevented its atmosphere from being stripped away. Credit: NASA As a result, Mars atmosphere would naturally thicken over time, which lead to many new possibilities for human exploration and colonization. According to Green and his colleagues, these would include an average increase of about 4 °C (~7 °F), which would be enough to melt the carbon dioxide ice in the northern polar ice cap. This would trigger a greenhouse effect, warming the atmosphere further and causing the water ice in the polar caps to melt. By their calculations, Green and his colleagues estimated that this could lead to 1/7th of Mars' oceans – the ones that covered it billions of years ago – to be restored. If this is beginning to sound a bit like a lecture on how to terraform Mars, it is probably because these same ideas have been raised by people who advocating that very thing. But in the meantime, these changes would facilitate human exploration between now and mid-century. \\"A greatly enhanced Martian atmosphere, in both pressure and temperature, that would be enough to allow significant surface liquid water would also have a number of benefits for science and human exploration in the 2040s and beyond,\\" said Green. \\"Much like Earth, an enhanced atmosphere would: allow larger landed mass of equipment to the surface, shield against most cosmic and solar particle radiation, extend the ability for oxygen extraction, and provide \\"open air\\" greenhouses to exist for plant production, just to name a few.\\" These conditions, said Green and his colleagues, would also allow for human explorers to study the planet in much greater detail. It would also help them to determine the habitability of the planet, since many of the signs that pointed towards it being habitable in the past (i.e. liquid water) would slowly seep back into the landscape. And if this could be achieved within the space of few decades, it would certainly help pave the way for colonization. In the meantime, Green and his colleagues plan to review the results of these simulations so they can produce a more accurate assessment of how long these projected changes would take. It also might not hurt to conduct some cost-assessments of this magnetic shield. While it might seem like something out of science fiction, it doesn't hurt to crunch the numbers!

There's already research into inflatable structures that would create the mini-magnetosphere you'd need for this to work. The biggest challenge, as with many things in space, is time. While a shield would have a relatively rapid effect on radiation, it's not certain how long it would take to thicken the atmosphere and increase temperatures. A magnetic shield would amount to a kind of terraforming, after all, and even a relatively quick change could take decades. NASA and SpaceX would still have to visit a hostile planet in the years ahead. Still, the very fact that this is even on the table is noteworthy. It suggests that it would be realistic to preserve and even improve Mars' remaining atmosphere without the staggering effort that would be needed to directly alter the planet. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"NASA scientists have proposed a plan aimed at reintroducing Mars' atmosphere and making the planet habitable.

His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don’t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways. One of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box.

He has lived in the United States for over 40 years. His work ranges from pieces for solo performance to big band. Holland runs his own independent record label, Dare2, which he launched in 2005. During the 1990s, Holland renewed an affiliation, begun in the 1970s, with Joe Henderson, joining the tenor saxophonist on So Near (So Far), a tribute to Miles Davis, and Porgy & Bess. Holland also reunited with vocalist Betty Carter, touring and recording the live album Feed the Fire (1993). Fellow Davis alumnus Herbie Hancock invited Holland to tour with him in 1992, subsequently recording The New Standard. Holland joined Hancock's band again in 1996. He was also part of the sessions for River: The Joni Letters, winner of the 2008 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. As a leader, Holland formed his third quartet and released Dream of the Elders (1995), which introduced the vibraphonist Steve Nelson to his ensembles. Holland formed a quintet that includes tenor saxophonist Chris Potter, trombonist Robin Eubanks and, a more recent addition, drummer Nate Smith. Their recordings include Points of View, Prime Directive, Not for Nothin, Extended Play: Live at Birdland and Critical Mass. In addition to releasing four quintet albums on ECM, Holland debuted his Big Band, which released What Goes Around in 2002. The album won Holland his first Grammy as a leader, in the Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album category. The second Big Band recording, Overtime (2005), again won the Grammy in the Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album category; it was released on Holland's Dare2 label, which he formed that year.

The original statement contains three key pieces of information: 1. \\"A man\\" - This identifies the subject of the statement. It informs us that we are talking about a male human being, without specifying any further details about who he is. 2. \\"With brown hair\\" - This adds a descriptive element to the subject. It tells us that the man has brown hair.

United Kingdom - Consisting of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. 2. Canada 3. Australia 4. New Zealand 5. Jamaica 6. Barbados 7. The Bahamas 8. Grenada 9. Papua New Guinea 10. Solomon Islands 11. Tuvalu 12. Saint Lucia 13. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 14. Belize 15. Antigua and Barbuda 16. Saint Kitts and Nevis These 16 countries are independent nations, but they recognize Queen Elizabeth II as their respective head of state and maintain a constitutional monarchy system. Note that the Queen has also held the title as the monarch of several other countries in the past (e.g., South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon), but she no longer does due to changes in the country's constitutional arrangements or withdrawal from the Commonwealth."},{"instruction":"Teacher:A text is given in Gujarati.

One of the following sentences is nonsensical. Which one is it? Options: - Sentence A: \\"I like to eat cotton from plants.\\" - Sentence B: \\"I like to eat cotton candy.\\"","output":"To determine which sentence is nonsensical, let's analyze the meaning of each: Sentence A: \\"I like to eat cotton from plants.\\" Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll around the seeds of the cotton plant. It is a natural fiber primarily used for making fabrics and textiles or as a raw material for papermaking. Cotton is not typically consumed as a food, so the idea of eating cotton from plants seems nonsensical. Sentence B: \\"I like to eat cotton candy.\\" Cotton candy is a soft, sugary confection that is made by heating sugar, then spinning it out of a machine to create fine strands that are soft and fluffy like cotton. It is a sweet treat that is commonly found at carnivals, fairs, and other events. This sentence makes sense, as cotton candy is a type of food that people may enjoy eating. Given the explanations above, it can be concluded that Sentence A: \\"I like to eat cotton from plants\\" is the nonsensical one, as cotton from plants is not typically consumed as food."},{"instruction":"Determine the sentiment: Oh where to begin. The cinematography was great. When the movie first started because of the initial landscape scenes I thought that I was in for a good movie. Then the cgi Bigfoot showed up .It looked like a cartoon drawing of the Lion king and king Kong's love child.It totally took away from the believability of the character.Now I knew there wasn't a Bigfoot chasing people hiking around the woods for no apparent reason but a cheesy cgi cartoon.So from then on the whole movie was shot for me.The money they flushed down the toilet for the cgi they could of spent on a costume like roger Patterson did. His was the best Bigfoot costume ever no one else could match his.I am a hardcore cheesy Bigfoot movie fan and I was warned about this movie but my compulsion led me to watching this movie and I was disappointed like the previous reviews warned me about. I know after you read this review you will still say \\"I must watch Sasquatch hunters,must watch Sasquatch hunters.\\" Then you will say why did I waste my good hard earned money on such a excruciatingly bad boring movie!","output":"The sentiment expressed in this passage is predominantly negative. The author starts by praising the cinematography and landscape scenes but soon focuses on the numerous flaws they perceive in the movie, particularly the CGI Bigfoot. They find the CGI to be so poor that it ruins the entire movie experience, making the character seem unbelievable and cartoonish. The author also mentions their appreciation for the costume used in the Roger Patterson Bigfoot film and suggests the movie could have benefited from a similar approach. They emphasize their disappointment as a hardcore cheesy Bigfoot movie fan and acknowledge the warnings given by previous reviews. In conclusion, the author discourages others from spending money on this movie, calling it \\"excruciatingly bad\\" and \\"boring,\\" anticipating that others will share their disappointment."},{"instruction":"The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What legislation rebuilds the US military?

Writer David Lipsky is dismayed to hear about the suicide of novelist David Foster Wallace in 2008. He had interviewed the author over a period of days twelve years earlier, following the publication of Wallace's novel Infinite Jest, which received critical praise and became an international bestseller, a touchstone for numerous readers. He listens to the recordings he made during their time together. The film returns to the period shortly after the book's release. Although initially skeptical of the high praise Wallace's book is receiving, Lipsky – a writer having only marginal success – is awestruck after reading it. He persuades his editor at Rolling Stone magazine to give him an assignment to interview Wallace during his book tour. The journalist travels to meet Wallace at his home on the outskirts of Bloomington-Normal, Illinois (near Illinois State University where the author teaches writing). Lipsky finds the young author unassuming and amiable, but indifferent to being interviewed. Wallace permits Lipsky to tape-record their conversations, with the proviso that Lipsky won't use any direct quotes which Wallace asks to have taken \\"off the record\\" five minutes later. Wallace opens up to Lipsky on a variety of subjects, ranging from dogs to television to fame and self-identity, but remains somewhat guarded.

Deal joined Pixies in January 1986 as the band's bassist, adopting the stage name Mrs. John Murphy for the albums Come on Pilgrim and Surfer Rosa. Following Doolittle and The Pixies' hiatus, she formed The Breeders with Tanya Donelly, Josephine Wiggs and later introduced her identical twin sister Kelley Deal. The Pixies broke up in early 1993, and Deal returned her focus to The Breeders, who released the platinum-selling album Last Splash in 1993. Deal was born in Dayton, Ohio. Her father was a laser physicist who worked at the nearby Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Kim and her identical twin sister Kelley were introduced to music at a young age; the two sang to a \\"two-track, quarter-inch, tape\\" when they were \\"four or five\\" years old, and grew up listening to hard rock bands such as AC/DC and Led Zeppelin. When Deal was 11, she learned Roger Miller's \\"King of the Road\\" on the acoustic guitar. In high school, at Wayne High School in Huber Heights, she was a cheerleader and often got into conflicts with authority. \\"We were popular girls,\\" Kelley explained. \\"We got good grades and played sports.\\" Living in Dayton was for her like living in Russia: a friend of Kelley's living in California used to send them cassettes of artists like James Blood Ulmer, Undertones, [Elvis] Costello, Sex Pistols and Siouxsie [and the Banshees]. \\"These tapes were our most treasured possession, the only link with civilization\\". As a teenager, she formed a folk rock band named The Breeders with her sister. She then became a prolific songwriter, as she found it easier to write songs than cover them. Deal later commented on her songwriting output: \\"I got like a hundred songs when I was like 16, 17 ... The music is pretty good, but the lyrics are just like, OH MY GOD. We were just trying to figure out how blue rhymes with you. When I was writing them, they didn't have anything to do with who I was.\\" The Deals bought microphones, an eight-track tape recorder, a mixer, speakers, and amps for a bedroom studio. According to Kelley, they \\"had the whole thing set up by the time we were 17\\". They later bought a drum machine \\"so it would feel like we were more in a band\\". Following high school, Deal went to seven different colleges, including The Ohio State University, but did not graduate from any of them. She eventually received an associate degree in medical technology from Kettering College of Medical Arts and took several jobs in cellular biology, including working in a hospital laboratory and a biochemical lab. Why was this so terrible","output":"This period in Kim Deal's life may be seen as \\"terrible\\" due to several factors that contributed to her personal and artistic struggles at the time. 1. Conflicts with authority: As mentioned, Kim Deal often found herself in trouble with people in positions of authority during her high school years. This could have made her feel misunderstood and isolated, affecting her emotional wellbeing. 2. Feelings of disillusionment: Living in Dayton, Ohio, Kim felt as though she was living in a cultural wasteland. Her only connection to the outside world and the contemporary music scene at that time was through cassettes sent to her by a friend in California. This limited exposure to new and exciting music could have been frustrating for a budding musician like Kim, who craved more expansive experiences. 3. Inexperience and self-doubt: During her teenage years, Kim developed her songwriting skills, but she was critical of her early efforts. She confessed that the lyrics she wrote at that time were not indicative of who she really was, which may have left her feeling discouraged and questioning her abilities as a songwriter. 4. The struggle of finding stability: As a young adult, Kim Deal attended seven different colleges, but did not graduate from any of them. This constant change and instability in her educational life could have added to her feelings of uncertainty and discontent. 5. Balancing work and music: Although Kim ultimately earned an associate degree in medical technology and secured jobs in the medical field, her passion for music continued to be a driving force in her life. Juggling a demanding work life while also trying to make progress with her music career likely took a toll on her, both mentally and emotionally. Despite these challenges, Kim Deal eventually made her mark on the music scene by joining the Pixies and forming The Breeders. As evidenced by her story, overcoming adversity and pushing through difficult times can eventually lead to success and personal growth."},{"instruction":"Q:Title: The most boring book I've read in a long time.

This response suggests an overwhelmingly positive experience with the product or service being reviewed.

They also highlight specific helpful features that have made their user experience more enjoyable or efficient, such as the ability to connect to their server without any problems and the effective caching of songs for offline or low-connection scenarios. Moreover, they mention how the product works reliably even in difficult conditions, such as while driving in and out of service areas. This adaptability is a commendable quality in a product, mainly when it is meant to be used in various situations and circumstances. The only identifiable limitation is the lack of explicit critique or suggestion for improvement. However, simply because the reviewer doesn't indicate any downside doesn't mean the product is incapable of harboring any. Therefore, while it may seem like the user is entirely satisfied, we must also bear in mind that customer views can greatly vary, and what works for one might not work for another. Nevertheless, because of the positive points explained and the lack of negative elements, it seems reasonable to rate the review as highly favorable or a 5. This trend is predicated on the assumption that the reviewer means what they say, and there is no indicated disgruntlement or disillusionment.

You have to answer the question based on the given passage. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Why did Hill challenge his sentence?, Context: Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.

Article: A few years ago, I worked at a church . Since my son was home schooling, he went with me to the church every day. Most mornings, we'd stop at a local store, and get a chocolate drink for him and a cup of coffee for me. The clerk at the store made our lives more enjoyable each day, and so we returned again and again. She had found her own way of enjoying life and her job. I'm not even sure if she realized that her warmth and brightness put a smile upon the face of each customer . When a customer brought cakes to the counter, any other clerk could have asked: \\"Would you like some milk with those cakes?\\" Instead, she asked: \\"Would you like a lottery ticket with those cakes?\\" She might have asked me if I wanted sugar with my coffee. But instead, she asked: \\"Would you like some batteries with that coffee?\\" Yes, life is what you make of it. This clerk's method of dealing with what some think is a boring job, and with the customers she met daily, made the hours in her day more enjoyable. In doing that, she also refreshed the lives of others and made them laugh. Sometimes, if my day at the church had been very tiring, we'd stop at that store before going home.

Complete the following sentence. Amy went to a buffet. She couldn't finish eating the eggs but could eat all the tomatoes because there was a minuscule amount of the","output":"latter on her plate. As a result, she had no problems devouring them effortlessly. In contrast, the eggs were quite a different story. When Amy went to the buffet, she was initially drawn to the wide variety of mouth-watering dish options before her. Among them were fresh salads, cheesy pasta, assorted snacks, and a blend of cuisine influenced by different cultures. Despite the enticing variety, two items in particular caught her attention: the vibrant red tomatoes and the fluffy, steaming eggs that seemed to have a perfect golden hue. Amy, eager to delight her taste buds, carefully arranged both the tomatoes and eggs on her plate, anticipating the delicious feast that awaited her. As she sat at her table, Amy decided to start with the tomatoes. There was a minuscule amount of them on her plate, optimally cut into tiny wedge-like slices. Their juicy and slightly tangy flavor was enhanced by a delicate blend of herbs and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Amy slowly savored each piece, relishing in the delightful dance of flavors in her mouth. Happy with her decision, she also felt a sense of gratitude for the person who had prepared this appetizing dish. After finishing the tomatoes, it was time to move on to the eggs. The portion was quite generous compared to the tiny amount of tomatoes Amy had just consumed. As she began nibbling on the eggs, she couldn't help but notice that they tasted heavier and more filling than she initially expected. While they were masterfully cooked, with just the right amount of seasoning, Amy found herself struggling to finish the considerably larger portion on her plate. Halfway through, she paused and took a sip of water. Despite her best efforts, she knew she was unable to eat another bite of the eggs. Her stomach was filled to capacity, and she did not wish to end her dining experience feeling uncomfortably full. Therefore, Amy decided it was time to admit defeat – she could eat no more of the eggs. In the end, Amy learned that a thoughtful balance was crucial when it comes to portion sizes. Being too ambitious with portions, even with the most enticing dishes, could reduce one's enjoyment of them. The buffet acted as a teaching moment for her, as she realized how essential it was not to underestimate the little bite-sized pleasures of life. They might be minuscule in size, like the tomatoes on her plate, but they can often bring more satisfaction than a sizable dish that can't be finished, such as the eggs. This experience left Amy not just with a newfound appreciation for tomatoes, but also with a valuable lesson in moderation and treading carefully at a buffet."},{"instruction":"Pick your answer from: - No. - Yes.

During the 1750s Messiah was performed increasingly at festivals and cathedrals throughout the country. Individual choruses and arias were occasionally extracted for use as anthems or motets in church services, or as concert pieces, a practice that grew in the 19th century and has continued ever since. After Handel's death, performances were given in Florence (1768), New York (excerpts, 1770), Hamburg (1772), and Mannheim (1777), where Mozart first heard it. For the performances in Handel's lifetime and in the decades following his death, the musical forces used in the Foundling Hospital performance of 1754 are thought by Burrows to be typical. A fashion for large-scale performances began in 1784, in a series of commemorative concerts of Handel's music given in Westminster Abbey under the patronage of King George III. A plaque on the Abbey wall records that \\"The Band consisting of DXXV [525] vocal & instrumental performers was conducted by Joah Bates Esqr.\\" In a 1955 article, Sir Malcolm Sargent, a proponent of large-scale performances, wrote, \\"Mr Bates ... had known Handel well and respected his wishes. The orchestra employed was two hundred and fifty strong, including twelve horns, twelve trumpets, six trombones and three pairs of timpani (some made especially large).\\" In 1787 further performances were given at the Abbey; advertisements promised, \\"The Band will consist of Eight Hundred Performers\\".In continental Europe, performances of Messiah were departing from Handel's practices in a different way: his score was being drastically reorchestrated to suit contemporary tastes. In 1786, Johann Adam Hiller presented Messiah with updated scoring in Berlin Cathedral. In 1788 Hiller presented a performance of his revision with a choir of 259 and an orchestra of 87 strings, 10 bassoons, 11 oboes, 8 flutes, 8 horns, 4 clarinets, 4 trombones, 7 trumpets, timpani, harpsichord and organ. In 1789, Mozart was commissioned by Baron Gottfried van Swieten and the Gesellschaft der Associierten to re-orchestrate several... Answer:","output":"During his visit to Mannheim in 1777, Mozart heard a performance of Handel's work, \\"Messiah.\\" The composition, which had been gaining popularity in festivals, cathedrals, and concerts and had been incorporated into church services as anthems, motets, or concert pieces, left its mark on Mozart who encountered it for the first time in Mannheim. The \\"Messiah\\" was not performed in its original form but as a revised and re-orchestrated version to fit the prevalent tastes of the time. The performances that Handel himself oversaw, and those that occurred in the decades following his death, commonly involved large musical forces akin to what Burrows suggested as typical for the Foundling Hospital performance of 1754. Beginning in 1784, a trend for larger scale performances developed. This was exemplified by the series of commemorative concerts of Handel's music in Westminster Abbey under King George III's patronage, where a monumental group of at least 525 performers participated. In the rest of Continental Europe, a different form of departure from Handel's practice was noticeable, where original works were being significantly re-orchestrated to suit contemporary tastes. Hiller, for example, presented a revised and drastically re-orchestrated version of \\"Messiah\\" in Berlin Cathedral in 1786 and again in 1788, involving hundreds of performers. This massive re-orchestration and the large-scale performances offer a clue to what Mozart might have heard in Mannheim: a version of Handel's \\"Messiah\\" performed by a sizeable ensemble in a modified arrangement reflecting the musical preferences of the time."},{"instruction":"Generate a short summary this sentence: military officers knew a day after army ranger pat tillman was killed in afghanistan that the former nfl star 's death was probably caused by friendly fire , but before revealing the truth they led tillman 's family to believe for more than a month that he was shot by afghan insurgents .","output":"A day after Pat Tillman's death in Afghanistan, military officers deduced it was likely caused by friendly fire.

Antibiotics help eliminate bacterial infections, like strep throat or some types of pneumonia, but the statement does not mention any specific disease being eliminated. The statement is about how the overuse of antibiotics has caused a problem called antimicrobial resistance, which is when bacteria become resistant to the antibiotics that were supposed to kill them.

This review expresses dissatisfaction with both the waiting time for the food and the staff's absence. The customer felt extremely discouraged due to the long waiting time of 30 minutes just to get waffles and even mentioned they could have had a better experience at a fast food joint. Additionally, the staff's disappearance contributed to a negative experience, as it showed a lack of attention and care for the diner's needs.

Making the original text lower case, the passage becomes as above. In this passage, the author seems to be highlighting the significance of Down House, which was Charles Darwin's residence for much of his life, and also the place where he authored his groundbreaking work, \\"On the Origin of Species.\\" The author, Doherty, is inviting the audience to experience a unique and awe-inspiring interpretation of Darwin's numerous experiments. By setting the stage at Down House, Doherty intends to offer a deeper connection and empathy towards Darwin's work and environment, which may otherwise be difficult to grasp for contemporary viewers. The use of Down House as the backdrop for this immersive experience is an effective way of bringing the audience closer to the setting and circumstances in which Darwin conducted his research. This setting provides authenticity and allows the viewers to better appreciate the challenges and inspirations that Darwin faced in his daily life. Moreover, the mention that Doherty is presenting a rare empathetic and amazing interpretation could imply that other portrayals of Darwin's life and experiments may have fallen short of capturing the true essence of his work. This creative approach may offer a fresh perspective for those who are familiar with the story of Charles Darwin and his contributions to the scientific community. Overall, this passage is an invitation to embark on a journey through Charles Darwin's life and scientific discoveries by retracing his footsteps at Down House.

What is this text about?","output":"This text is about a significant event in which a United Airlines plane landed in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. This marked the first commercial American airliner to fly to the country since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. The event carries historical and symbolic importance, as it represents a milestone in the ongoing process of normalizing relations between the United States and Vietnam, two countries that were once engaged in a protracted and divisive conflict. The Vietnam War, which lasted from 1955 to 1975, saw the United States intervening in the conflict between North and South Vietnam. The intervention aimed to prevent the spread of communism in the region, but the war ultimately resulted in heavy casualties and a tremendous loss of resources for both the U.S. and Vietnam. With the fall of Saigon in 1975, the United States withdrew from the conflict and diplomatic relations between the two countries were severed. Since then, the U.S. and Vietnam have made significant efforts to rebuild and nurture diplomatic ties, ultimately reestablishing formal relations in 1995. Reconciliation and cooperation initiatives have been pursued in areas such as trade, investment, education, and cultural exchange. The resumption of commercial flights after decades serves as a powerful symbol of the progress made between the two nations. The landing of the United Airlines plane in Ho Chi Minh City suggests a continuation of positive developments in U.S.-Vietnam relations. As the first commercial American airliner to fly to the country since the war, this event highlights how far both nations have come in terms of moving beyond the painful memories and divisions of the past. This progress is crucial for fostering mutual understanding, trust, and cooperation across various sectors, including economic partnerships, security matters, and cultural connections. In summary, the text discusses the arrival of a United Airlines plane in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, marking the first commercial American flight to the nation since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. This event underscores the ongoing process of reconciliation and normalization of relations between the United States and Vietnam, reflecting the significant strides both countries have taken to move forward from the shared history of conflict and towards a more collaborative and peaceful future."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Context: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation is contraindicated in those with <1-year life expectancy.', 'The aim of this study was to develop a risk prediction score for 1-year mortality in patients with primary prevention ICDs and to determine the incremental improvement in discrimination when serum-based biomarkers are added to traditional clinical variables.', 'We analyzed data from the Prospective Observational Study of Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators, a large prospective observational study of patients undergoing primary prevention ICD implantation who were extensively phenotyped for clinical and serum-based biomarkers. We identified variables predicting 1-year mortality and synthesized them into a comprehensive risk scoring construct using backward selection.', 'Of 1189 patients deemed by their treating physicians as having a reasonable 1-year life expectancy, 62 (5.2%) patients died within 1 year of ICD implantation. The risk score, composed of 6 clinical factors (age ≥75 years, New York Heart Association class III/IV, atrial fibrillation, estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), diabetes, and use of diuretics), had good discrimination (area under the curve 0.77) for 1-year mortality. Addition of 3 biomarkers (tumor necrosis factor α receptor II, pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and cardiac troponin T) further improved model discrimination to 0.82. Patients with 0-1, 2-3, 4-6, or 7-9 risk factors had 1-year mortality rates of 0.8%, 2.7%, 16.1%, and 46.2%, respectively. Answer: Individuals with more comorbidities and elevation of specific serum biomarkers were at increased risk of all-cause mortality despite being deemed as having a reasonable 1-year life expectancy. A simple risk score composed of readily available clinical data and serum biomarkers may better identify patients at high risk of early mortality and improve patient selection and counseling for primary prevention ICD therapy. Output:","output":"What factors may help identify patients that have a higher risk of early mortality and enhance patient selection for primary prevention ICD therapy, even when they are initially deemed to have a reasonable 1-year life expectancy?"},{"instruction":"The New Year will bring with it a new era of late-night TV.

In the cover piece, available now online to subscribers, the \\"Saturday Night Live\\" writer opens up about his new show and his feelings about taking over the coveted spot.

After waiting almost an hour, our pizzas arrived at our table cold. The Margherita was soggy and lacking flavor, while the Supreme was overwhelmed with toppings and difficult to eat. We informed the server about the cold pizzas, but he didn't bother to address the issue or offer a replacement. Throughout the evening, our water glasses remained empty, and we had to ask multiple times for refills. We were hoping to enjoy some dessert, but after our experience with the pizza, we decided to skip it.

Israelis, he confided to the author and politician Shlomo Ben-Ami, were tired of war. Secular and pragmatic, the young generation dreamed of a life of prosperity and normalcy their parents had never known. Israel, he reasoned, was emerging as a place of individualism, hedonism, even – to use a phrase then in vogue – \\"post-Zionism\\". As a result of these changes, Zionism is in the ascendancy again – but in a new, coarsened form. Whereas it was once informed by the collectivist ethos handed down from the first, pioneering generation of Israeli state-builders, the Zionism of Benjamin Netanyahu and Naftali Bennett is rooted in something much more primal: fear. Like all demagogues, Netanyahu (who is sure to remain prime minister after the vote) knows the value of fear, and has spent the last four years frightening his people with the spectre of Iranian nukes, Palestinian terror and international anti-semitism. Even the squandering of his country’s most valuable strategic asset – its close relationship with the White House – has strengthened the Right, convincing voters that Israel is alone in a hostile world and must look inward for strength and safety. But this nationalist mood belies the fact that Israel is, in many ways, splitting at the seams. Trust – between Israelis and in their elected leaders – is at an all-time low. Two-and-a-half decades of privatisation and deregulation have turned it from among the most egalitarian of countries to the most unequal in the Western world, alongside the United States. Meanwhile outgoing foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman, currently facing charges of fraud, is just the latest Israeli leader who seems to spend as much time fighting lawsuits as making laws. As society becomes less equitable and the political class grows more squalid and corrupt, fewer Israelis than ever say they value the good of society above their personal interests: 28 per cent today, down from 64 per cent at the beginning of the 80s. The paradox of Israel today is that the more fractured and atomised it becomes, the more it glues itself together by resorting to a belligerent form of nationalism. It is a country that projects its insecurity outwards, finding a comforting unity only in the face of external perils, real or imagined. The irony is that, with the West Bank pacified and the Gaza front quiet, the threat from Palestinian terror is at an all-time low. When Israelis glance up at the lengthening shadows on the iron wall they have erected around themselves, the shapes that increasingly menace them are their own. Matt Hill is the author of the blog MuddledEast. He is on Twitter at @MuddledEast What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the current state of Israeli politics, which is characterized by a shift towards a more nationalistic and fear-driven form of Zionism. The author asserts that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, knowing the value of fear, has exploited the uncertainty surrounding threats such as Iranian nuclear weapons, Palestinian terror, and international anti-Semitism to strengthen the right-wing politics in Israel. The impact of fear-driven politics has led to increased trust in nationalist leaders and an inclination towards self-preservation rather than international cooperation. The article highlights Israel's growing internal fractures, due to rising social inequality and a corrupt political class, and argues that Israel finds unity when facing external threats, real or imagined."},{"instruction":"Article: Two helpers to lower her on to the sofa and her own personal toilet roll: Mariah Carey's diva-style behaviour on GMTV is revealed by Kate Garraway She insisted on bringing her own butterfly-shaped confetti to the X Factor and left the normally affable television host Phillip Schofield furious with her tardiness. And now presenter Kate Garraway has revealed more of Mariah Carey’s diva-style behaviour following the singer’s appearance on GMTV. Miss Garraway, 42, said the star - the world’s best-selling female artist - stunned producers by having two people to lower her on to the famous GMTV sofa. Scroll down to watch the GMTV interview Mariah seen on GMTV during the pre-recorded interview with Lorraine Kelly which was shown on television this morning GMTV's Kate Garraway said Mariah had two people to lower her on the sofa so that she didn't crush her dress She said the singer also had an entourage watching to ensure she was being filmed at her best angle and brought her own toilet roll to the studios. The blonde host, who has this month returned to work on the ITV breakfast programme after having her second child, son Billy, said: 'We had Mariah Carey in the GMTV studios last week, where she was pre-recording an interview with Lorraine Kelly. Mariah sang new single 'I Want To Know What Love is' on GMTV 'I've heard a lot of rumours about her being a diva over the years and guess what? It turns out it's all true!' Miss Garraway added: 'While Mariah was very nice, the amount of people she had in her entourage was hilarious. 'They outnumbered the entire GMTV crew! She had two people to lower her on to the GMTV sofa, in case her dress got crushed, one person to walk in front of her backwards at all times in case she fell over and several people behind the camera making sure she was going to be filmed from the right angle! 'Have you ever heard anything like it? Oh, and she brought her own toilet roll as well.' The presenter’s claims come after Miss Carey, 39, and her management made a host of demands to open Westfield shopping centre’s Christmas Wonderland last week. More than 14 million watched as the star performed her new single, I Want To Know What Love Is, on the X Factor on Sunday night. Some viewers questioned whether Miss Carey, who had pre-recorded her performance, was singing live. One fan said: 'How bad is her miming?! A \\"superstar\\" that has to mime, what a disgrace!'.' Inside story: Kate Garraway on GMTV with her co-presenter Ben Shephard yesterday Another viewer said: 'Yes, she was miming. You see it well in the part where she took the mic off the stand in the middle of her singing and the voice didn't change.' However, an X Factor spokeswoman insisted that Miss Carey had sung live as well as using a backing track. The star recently claimed she is not a diva, despite admitting her dogs have their own entourage. The singer said she had insisted on having assistants on hand for her Jack Russell pooches Cha Cha and JJ while filming a recent commercial, insisting: 'My puppies are starring in this ad with me, too. 'I had my team with me but the pups had a mini entourage of their own, of course! And why wouldn't they? It was a big shoot and even my entourage had an entourage - my stylist had an assistant, my security had extra security. Don't call me a diva: Mariah insists that she is no diva and is baffled by her reputation for being demanding 'The shoot was based on the fact that some people think I'm a demanding diva. I have no idea why people have that impression!' The 'Fantasy' singer has previously admitted to feeling baffled by her 'demanding' reputation. She said: 'I am baffled, shocked and appalled when I am called a diva. I've never done one diva-ish thing in my life. The actual definition of a diva is a woman who sings well. 'The secondary definition is a woman who is difficult to deal with. I hope I am the first, but I really don't think I am the second. I don't believe I am truly nasty and act in a bad way.' Miss Garraway was not in the studio at the same time as Miss Carey and her entourage. However a source close to the presenter said: 'Kate got in shortly afterwards and the place was abuzz with what had happened. It was not so much Mariah, as she points out - but her entourage.' Miss Carey’s spokeswoman called Miss Garraway’s claims are a 'clear, gross exaggeration'. She said: 'With regards to the \\"entourage\\", every star of Mariah’s calibre is surrounded by a working team and Mariah doesn't actually have any more people working with her than any other major star.'

Question: suppose less solar power being generated happens, how will it affect MORE solar power being generated. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"The amount of solar power being generated can depend on many factors, such as the efficiency of the photovoltaic cells, the amount of sunlight the cells are exposed to, and various environmental conditions. If less solar power is being generated, this will depend on how, where and why this is happening. Let's examine in more detail. If for instance, less solar power is being generated due to a decrease in the efficiency of the photovoltaic cells, then this means that the cells are no longer able to convert sunlight into electricity at their previous rate. This could be due to aging of the cells, damage, or perhaps sub-optimal conditions like excessive dirt or debris on the cell surfaces. This situation can negatively impact more solar power being generated because the overall system's power generation capability is reduced. Therefore, the answer in this scenario would be B - less. On the contrary, suppose less solar power is being generated because of a temporary environmental factor like cloudy weather, or if it's during the times when there's less sunlight like during the winter or at dawn or dusk. In such cases, when the environmental factor is no longer present, i.e., on clear, sunny days or during peak sun hours, the panels can generate more power to their maximum capacity. Here, the temporary decrease in power generation does not affect the maximum output. So, the answer would be C- no effect. If less power is being generated due to a systematic limitation or policy decisions like restrictions on the installation of new solar panels in a certain region then this might indeed affect more solar power being generated as it restricts the further deployment or development of solar energy in that region. Again, the answer here would be B - less. So, while generally speaking, less solar power being generated at any given moment doesn't necessarily impact the potential for more solar power to be generated, the reasons behind less power generation can absolutely have an effect. To answer the question definitively, you would need to understand the specific causes and conditions behind the decrease in solar power generation."},{"instruction":"News article: Senate advances unemployment benefits extension bill The Senate voted 60-37 to advance the unemployment extension bill. WASHINGTON — The Senate opened 2014 by narrowly voting to advance a bill extending federal unemployment benefits for three months, in a move President Obama and his Democratic allies hope will launch an ongoing bid to combat economic inequality. It was a dramatic win for Democrats, who entered the Tuesday morning vote pessimistic about their chances. They picked up support from six Republican senators. RELATED: SENATOR SUES TO STOP PAY FOR CONGRESS MEMBERS’ INSURANCE The 60-37 vote may set up passage of the measure later this week and Democrats hope it will put pressure on the Republican-run House. But GOP leaders there have said they will only back the three-month extension of the benefits if its 6.5 billion cost is offset by spending cuts elsewhere in the budget. Shortly after the procedural vote, President Obama praised the Senate's move and urged Congress to follow suit. “Unemployment insurance has been a vital economic lifeline,” Obama said. “For a lot of people it’s the only source of income they have to support their families while they look for a job.” “These aren’t people who are just sitting back waiting for things to happen. They desperately want work,” he added. “There’s still a lot of people struggling out there ... Congress should make things right.” Democrats plan this year to push other bills they say aim to address inequality, including a proposed minimum wage hike. They hope to they will either force Republicans to accept Obama's agenda or face fallout in the 2014 midterm elections from an electorate that appears increasingly concerned about economic fairness.

Evidence suggests that people lived in the northern Oregon Cascade Range as early as 10,000 years ago. By 2,000 to 3,000 years ago, settlements in the Clackamas River basin, adjacent to the Johnson Creek watershed, had moved to the river's lower floodplain. The area was the home of the Clackamas Indians, a subgroup of the Chinookan speakers who lived in the Columbia River Valley from Celilo Falls to the Pacific Ocean. The Clackamas lands included the lower Willamette River from Willamette Falls at what became Oregon City to its confluence with the Columbia River and reached into the foothills of the Cascades. When Lewis and Clark visited the area in 1806, the Clackamas tribe consisted of about 1,800 people living in 11 villages. Epidemics of smallpox, malaria, and measles reduced this population to 88 by 1851, and in 1855 the tribe signed a treaty surrendering its lands, including Johnson Creek.By the middle of the 19th century, the European American newcomers had begun to remove vegetation, build sawmills, fell trees, fill wetlands, and farm in the fertile soil along Johnson Creek. The creek is named for one of these newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 settled in what later became the Lents neighborhood of Portland and operated a water-powered sawmill. In early 1848 Lot Whitcomb, who would later found Milwaukie, filed a donation land claim and built a sawmill near the confluence of Johnson Creek and the Willamette River. In 1886, plans were made for train tracks along the creek. In 1903, the Springwater Division Line, also known as the Portland Traction Company Line, the Cazadero Line, and the Bellrose Line, was built along Johnson Creek to provide rail transport for passengers and freight. Sellwood, Eastmoreland, Lents, and Pleasant Valley were among the new communities that grew up along the line. By the 1920s, housing began to replace creekside farms.

He followed in his elder brother's footsteps, studying at Grangefield School, West Hartlepool College of Art and graduating from Sunderland Art School with a fine arts degree. At the age of 16 he appeared in Boy and Bicycle, a short film marking the directorial debut of his 23-year-old brother Ridley. Scott studied art in Leeds after failing to gain admission to the Royal College of Art in London at his first attempt. On 19 August 2012, at approximately 12:30 pm. PDT, Scott killed himself by jumping off the Vincent Thomas Bridge in the San Pedro port district of Los Angeles. Investigators from the Los Angeles Police Department's Harbor Division found contact information in a note left in his car, parked on the bridge, and a note at his office for his family. One witness said he did not hesitate before jumping, but another said he looked nervous before climbing a fence, hesitating for two seconds, and jumping into the water beside a tour boat. His body was recovered from the water by the Los Angeles Port Police. On 22 August, Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman Ed Winters said the two notes Scott left behind made no mention of any health problems, but neither the police nor the family disclosed the content of those notes.

They are observing the speed of the particles in the gases to see how fast they are moving. Gas A has particles moving very quickly, but Gas B has particles that are hardly moving at all. Which gas is at a lower temperature?","output":"Gas B is at a lower temperature. To understand why Gas B has a lower temperature, we need to first comprehend the connection between the temperature of a gas and the behavior of its particles, as well as the Kinetic Molecular Theory (KMT). The KMT is a model that explains the behavior of gases based on the motions of their particles. According to this theory, there are several postulates or assumptions: 1. Gases consist of large numbers of tiny particles that are in constant, random motion. 2. The combined volume of all particles of the gas is negligible compared to the total volume in which the gas is contained. 3. The attractive and repulsive forces between gas particles are negligible. 4. Collisions between gas particles, as well as collisions with the container walls, are perfectly elastic. This means that the kinetic energy is conserved during collisions. 5. The average kinetic energy of gas particles is proportional to the temperature of the gas. Given these postulates, particularly the fifth one, we can associate the temperature of a gas with the motion of its particles. The average kinetic energy of a gas can be defined as (3/2)kT, where k is the Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature of the gas (measured in Kelvin). When the temperature of a gas increases, the average kinetic energy also increases, causing the particles to move faster. Conversely, when the temperature decreases, the average kinetic energy decreases, resulting in slower particle motion. In the given scenario, scientists are observing Gas A with particles moving very quickly and Gas B with particles hardly moving at all. From the KMT and the relationship between temperature and particle motion, we can infer that Gas A has a higher temperature because of the rapid movement of its particles, while Gas B has a lower temperature as its particles are moving much slower. Therefore, Gas B is at a lower temperature compared to Gas A."},{"instruction":"Test for natural language inference.

King is known for her percussive and jazz-tinged melodies, energetic live shows, use of multiple tunings on acoustic and lap steel guitar, and her diverse range in different genres. In February 2006, Rolling Stone released a list of \\"The New Guitar Gods\\", on which King was the sole woman and youngest artist (beating Derek Trucks in age by two months as the youngest on the list). In addition to a 10-year career that includes six LP and two EP albums, King has also scored music for television and film. At the end of her tour for Legs to Make Us Longer in 2005, King departed from her previous musical direction out of a desire to escape being pigeonholed as a solo instrumental artist. She amicably parted ways with major label Sony/Epic and returned to her original label, Velour, to begin work on her third album ...Until We Felt Red. Released August 8, 2006, on Velour Records, the album features production work by Tortoise's John McEntire. With the prominence of electric guitar shoegazing and effect boxes on the new record, and the addition of a full band, the music website, The A.V. Club, called the sound a \\"post-rock makeover.\\" She supported the album by going on tour with Sarah Bettens from K's Choice. In early 2007, Dave Grohl invited King to appear as a guitarist on the track \\"Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners\\", a song penned by Grohl for an upcoming studio album by the Foo Fighters. King agreed and is credited on the album, entitled Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, released on September 25, 2007. On November 18, 2007, she joined Dave Grohl on stage to perform the track at the O2 arena in London. Grohl highly praised King's performance: \\"There are some guitar players that are good and there are some guitar players that are really fucking good. And then there's Kaki King.\\" King toured with the Foo Fighters on the Australian leg of the Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace tour. While on tour, King finished recording what became the Day Sleeper (Australian tour EP). It was released in late 2007 after King had finished working on August Rush, and with Eddie Vedder and Sean Penn on Into The Wild.

Let's break down each question and understand the nuances. 1. How would you improve yourself? This question is asking for potential ways one could improve themselves, and suggests that there might be some areas that need growth or betterment. The person asking this question might be looking for suggestions or guidance on self-improvement techniques or strategies. It implies a more hypothetical or theoretical angle, focusing on potential improvements rather than actual steps someone is taking. For example, a detailed answer to this question might include: To improve myself, I would identify my strengths and weaknesses, be open to feedback and criticism, and set clear, attainable goals. I could also read self-improvement books, take part in seminars or workshops, and continually focus on learning and developing new skills in my desired areas of improvement. 2. How do you improve yourself? This question, on the other hand, is asking for the self-improvement practices one may already be engaged in or have applied to their life. It shifts the focus from potential improvements to the actual steps one is taking to better themselves. The person asking this question might be interested in learning from others' experiences or gathering information on different self-improvement strategies that have worked for people. For example, a detailed answer to this question might include: To improve myself, I maintain a regular exercise regimen to stay fit and healthy, read books and articles to expand my knowledge and apply it to my personal and professional life. Additionally, I engage in mindfulness exercises, practice gratitude, and work on my communication skills through workshops and attending interactive group classes.

Among them is W.P. Inman (Jude Law), a carpenter who has fallen in love with Ada (Nicole Kidman), a minister's daughter, and finds their whirlwind courtship interrupted by the American Civil War. Three years later, Inman finds himself in the trenches of Petersburg, Virginia, during the Battle of the Crater. Union soldiers tunneling beneath Confederate fortifications detonate over 300 kegs of gunpowder, in a futile attempt to undermine the position prior to their assault. As the ill-fated attack begins, Oakley (Lucas Black) an old acquaintance of Inman's from Cold Mountain, is impaled on a bayonet and mortally wounded. Inman rescues him from the fighting and takes him to a field hospital. Later that day Oakley dies in the hospital, with Inman and Stobrod Thewes (Brendan Gleeson) beside him. The next night, Inman, along with his Cherokee friend Swimmer (Jay Tavare), are sent to flush out surviving Union troops trapped behind their lines.

Answer:","output":"\\"Whispers of Cold Mountain: A Tale of Love and War\\" This movie title captures the essence of the plot, highlighting the poignant love story between the main characters, Inman and Ada, set against the backdrop of the American Civil War. The use of \\"whispers\\" in the title suggests the yearning for connection and communication between the two lovers, despite the brutal circumstances that separate them. \\"Cold Mountain,\\" as both the central location and a symbol of the characters' struggle to find their way back to each other, adds depth and a sense of place to the title. Finally, \\"A Tale of Love and War\\" underscores the dual themes of romantic love and the devastating impact of war on both the individual and society as a whole."},{"instruction":"Density is also an important physical property of matter. The concept of density combines what we know about an objects mass and volume. Density reflects how closely packed the particles of matter are. When particles are packed together more tightly, matter is more dense. Differences in density of matter explain many phenomena. It explains why helium balloons rise. It explains why currents such as the Gulf Stream flow through the oceans. It explains why some things float in or sink. You can see this in action by pouring vegetable oil into water. You can see a colorful demonstration in this video. After reading the above, is \\"By watching the environment\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How can I understand density?\\"?","output":"Imagine you have a tiny box, and you want to put marbles in it. Density is like trying to see how many marbles you can fit in that box. If you can fit lots of marbles very close together, then it is very dense. If you can only fit a few marbles with some space between them, then it's not very dense. Now, let's talk about the question, \\"How can I understand density?\\" By watching the environment, like the vegetable oil in water example, you can see how different things (like oil and water) don't mix because they have different density levels - oil is less dense, so it floats on top of the water, which is more dense. So, yes, \\"By watching the environment\\" can be a correct answer to understand density because you can see how different things interact based on their density levels. Just like the helium balloons rise, because helium is less dense than the air around it."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a premise, a hypothesis, and an update. The premise sentence describes a real-world situation and is always assumed to be true. The hypothesis sentence describes an assumption or inference that you might make about that situation having read the premise. The update provides additional information about the situation that might weaken or strengthen the hypothesis. A weakener is a statement that weakens the hypothesis, that is, it makes you much less likely to believe the hypothesis is true. A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis, that is, it makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true. Your task is to answer with 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis, respectively. Problem:Premise: A child in a jester costume standing in front of a television set. Hypothesis: A child dressed as a jester is watching his favorite tv show. Update: The television set is broken. Solution:","output":"The task is asking you to determine whether the update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis, based on the premise given. 1. Understand the premise: A child in a jester costume standing in front of a television set. (This is considered true.) 2. Consider the hypothesis: A child dressed as a jester is watching his favorite tv show. (This is an assumption about the situation given in the premise.) 3. Read the update: The television set is broken. (This is additional information about the situation that might affect the hypothesis.) To find the answer, think about how the update influences the likelihood of the hypothesis being true: - Does the update make the hypothesis more likely to be true? If yes, the answer is 'strengthener.' - Does the update make the hypothesis less likely to be true? If yes, the answer is 'weakener.' In this case, the update indicates that the television set is broken, which means it is less likely that the child is watching his favorite tv show. Therefore, the answer is 'weakener.'"},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English.

The statement appears to express confusion or ambiguity about the movie. While it is not explicitly negative, it does not shed a positive light on the movie either. If we were to interpret the sentence, we could infer a sense of uncertainty or lack of clarity about the plot, acting, direction, or themes within the movie. This could be an indication that the movie is complex, requiring more in-depth analysis, or perhaps poorly executed, leaving audiences baffled by the narrative and overall direction. On the other hand, it is also possible that the reviewer is expressing their personal confusion or struggle to understand the movie, rather than criticizing the movie itself. In this case, the review might not necessarily reflect the movie's merits or demerits. Instead, it could be more of a reflection of the reviewer's subjective experience and understanding. In conclusion, the given sentence \\"'s really unclear\\" is neither directly positive nor negative, but it does suggest confusion or ambiguity.

It is the zone of a church accessible by the laity. - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount). - Minor basilica (in plural) is a title given to some Roman Catholic church buildings. According to canon law, no church building can be honoured with the title of basilica unless by apostolic grant or from immemorial custom. Presently, the authorising decree is granted by the Pope through the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. - The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando is a Roman Catholic diocese in Florida. It was established on June 18, 1968. Prior to that the Central Florida area was part of the Diocese of St. Augustine. Today the diocese encompasses nine counties including Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Marion, Lake, Volusia, Brevard, Polk, and Sumter, a total of about . William Borders, the first Bishop of the diocese, claimed in 1969 to Pope Paul VI that the then-active 1917 Code of Canon Law placed newly explored territory under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the port of departure, making the Diocese of Orlando responsible for the moon following the flight of Apollo 11. If true, the total area of the diocese would be , making it the largest Catholic diocese in existence. In 2010, the diocese contained 81 parishes, 10 missions, and 37 schools. St. James Cathedral serves as the seat of the diocese. Within the diocese are two minor basilicas, Mary, Queen of the Universe Shrine, a basilica which ministers to Catholic tourists, and St. Paul's in Daytona Beach. - The Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments is the congregation of the Roman Curia that handles most affairs relating to liturgical practices of the Latin Church as distinct from the Eastern Catholic Churches and also some technical matters relating to the Sacraments. Its functions were originally exercised by the Sacred Congregation of Rites, set up in January 1588 by Pope Sixtus V. - A pastor is usually an ordained leader of a Christian congregation. When used as an ecclesiastical styling or title, the term may be abbreviated to \\"Pr\\" (singular) or \\"Ps\\" (plural). A pastor also gives advice and counsel to people from the community or congregation. - A parish church (or parochial church) in Christianity is the church which acts as the religious centre of a parish. In many parts of the world, especially in rural areas, the parish church may play a significant role in community activities, often allowing its premises to be used for non-religious community events. The church building reflects this status, and there is considerable variety in the size and style of parish churches. Many villages in Europe have churches that date back to the Middle Ages, but all periods of architecture are represented. - The Basilica of the National Shrine of Mary , Queen of the Universe is a Latin Rite basilica located in Orlando , Florida at 8300 Vineland Avenue . It was built to service the large number of Catholic tourists who visit the attractions in the Greater Orlando area . While it is a 2,000 seat church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando and provides Mass for the faithful , it has also become a regional tourist attraction . In 2009 , it was designated as the 63rd minor basilica in the United States . Since it is not a parish , no regular sacraments are performed , and no weekly bulletins are distributed . The Shrine consists of the main church , the Rosary Garden , the Mother & Child Outdoor Chapel , the Blessed Sacrament Chapel , the Shrine Museum , and a gift shop . - The Latin word basilica (derived from Greek , lit. \\"royal stoa\\", serving as the tribunal chamber of a king) has three distinct applications in modern English. The word was originally used to describe an ancient Roman public building where courts were held, as well as serving other official and public functions. To a large extent these were the town halls of ancient Roman life. The basilica was centrally located in every Roman town, usually adjacent to the main forum. These buildings, an example of which is the Basilica Ulpia, were rectangular, and often had a central nave and aisles, usually with a slightly raised platform and an apse at each of the two ends, adorned with a statue perhaps of the emperor, while the entrances were from the long sides. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - The word diocese is derived from the Greek term \\"\\" meaning \\"administration\\". When now used in an ecclesiastical sense, it refers to a territorial unit of administration. In the Western Church, the district is under the supervision of a bishop (who may have assistant bishops to help him or her) and is divided into parishes under the care of priests; but in the Eastern Church, the word denotes the area under the jurisdiction of a patriarch and the bishops under his jurisdiction administer parishes. This structure of church governance is known as episcopal polity. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'religion' with 'latin church'. Answer:","output":"The entity that has the relation 'religion' with 'latin church' is the Roman Catholic Church."},{"instruction":"Information: - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Life is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased, or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate. Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses, viroids, or potential artificial life as \\"living\\". Biology is the primary science concerned with the study of life, although many other sciences are involved. - Southeast Asia or Southeastern Asia is a subregion of Asia, consisting of the countries that are geographically south of China, east of India, west of New Guinea and north of Australia. The region lies near the intersection of geological plates, with heavy seismic and volcanic activity. Southeast Asia consists of two geographic regions: - Java (Indonesian: Jawa; Javanese: ; Sundanese: ) is an island of Indonesia. With a population of over 141 million (the island itself) or 145 million (the administrative region) Census released in December 2015, Java is home to 56.7 percent of the Indonesian population and is the most populous island on Earth. The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is located on western Java. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the center of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally. - Borneo is the third-largest island in the world and the largest island in Asia. At the geographic centre of Maritime Southeast Asia, in relation to major Indonesian islands, it is located north of Java, west of Sulawesi, and east of Sumatra. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Vietnam to the west, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south. - Sumatra is a large island in western Indonesia that is part of the Sunda Islands. It is the largest island that is entirely in Indonesia (two larger islands, Borneo and New Guinea, are shared between Indonesia and other countries) and the sixth-largest island in the world at 473,481 km (including adjacent islands such as the Riau Islands and Bangka Belitung Islands). - Brackish water or briny water is water that has more salinity than fresh water, but not as much as seawater. It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water, as in estuaries, or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers. The word comes from the Middle Dutch root \\"brak\\". Certain human activities can produce brackish water, in particular civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish water pools for freshwater prawn farming. Brackish water is also the primary waste product of the salinity gradient power process. Because brackish water is hostile to the growth of most terrestrial plant species, without appropriate management it is damaging to the environment (see article on shrimp farms). - A Muslim is someone who follows or practises Islam, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion. Muslims consider the Quran (Koran), their holy book, to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet and messenger Muhammad. They also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (\\"sunnah \\") as recorded in traditional accounts (\\"hadith\\"). \\"Muslim\\" is an Arabic word meaning \\"one who submits (to God)\\". - Marine life, or sea life or ocean life, refers to the plants, animals and other organisms that live in the salt water of the sea or ocean, or the brackish water of coastal estuaries. At a fundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet. Marine organisms produce much of the oxygen we breathe. Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land. - An island country is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands. As of 2011, 46 (approximately 24%) of the 193 UN member states are island countries. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east.

Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - Bitung is a city on the northern coast of the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia . It is in the province of North Sulawesi , and faces Lembeh Island and the Lembeh Strait , which is known for its colorful marine life , in particular sea slugs . Bitung has a population of 187,932 at the 2010 Census . - Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula . This is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, as oxides the element makes up almost half of the Earth's crust. - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. - Manado (pronounced in Manado Malay, in Indonesian)) is the capital city of the North Sulawesi province of Indonesia. Manado is located at the Bay of Manado, and is surrounded by a mountainous area. The city had 408,354 inhabitants at the 2010 Census, making it the second-largest city in Sulawesi after Makassar.

One of the four Greater Sunda Islands, and the world's eleventh-largest island, it is situated between Borneo and the Maluku Islands. Within Indonesia, only Sumatra, Borneo and Papua are larger in territory, and only Java and Sumatra have larger populations. - The Maluku Islands or the Moluccas are an archipelago within Indonesia. Tectonically they are located on the Halmahera Plate within the Molucca Sea Collision Zone. Geographically they are located east of Sulawesi, west of New Guinea, and north and east of Timor. The islands were also the historical core of the Spice Islands known to the Chinese and Europeans, but this term usually included other adjacent areas such as Sulawesi. The name was due to the nutmeg, mace and cloves that were originally exclusively found there, and the presence of these sparked colonial interest from Europe in the 16th century. - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air. - North Sulawesi is a province of Indonesia.

The southernmost point of continental Eurasia, Tanjung Piai, is in Malaysia. Located in the tropics, Malaysia is one of 17 megadiverse countries on earth, with large numbers of endemic species. - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.

When not in use, store your silver with desiccating packets filled with silica gel. These can usually be purchased at craft stores, general retailers, and hardware stores. If you have small children or pets, be sure these packets are inaccessible to them. Eating these packets could be deadly. Alternatively, store a piece of chalk with your silver. Similar to the desiccating packets, the chalk will absorb moisture. Chalk will also be less dangerous to children and pets. Anything that contains lemon juice or vinegar will likely cause your silver to tarnish very quickly. Forego using your silver when serving any acidic food. Mustard, onions, and eggs are some of the most common foods that contribute to rapid oxidation. Food that has a sour taste often has acidic properties. When in doubt, use non-silver items with food like this. In some cases, perspiration may be acidic enough to cause oxidation. Other possible culprits include perfume, makeup, hair products, and cleaning products. Rubber and latex will have a strong negative reaction to silver. They can permanently deface its finish or cause the metal to be eaten away. Avoid storing your silver with other metals. Doing so can also make the silver oxidize more quickly. The detergent and heat of your dishwasher can cause oxidation and corrosion in your silver. Silver should be cleaned with cool water and a mild soap. Use a soft cotton cloth to wipe dirty silver clean when necessary. Opposite of what you might expect, using your silver and cleaning it thoroughly by hand after every use can defend against oxidation. Even using your silver once a week could keep it looking oxidation free for longer. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article would be: To prevent silver from tarnishing quickly, store it with desiccating packets filled with silica gel or a piece of chalk to absorb moisture. Avoid using silver with acidic foods, such as those containing lemon juice, vinegar, mustard, onions, and eggs. Limit contact with chemicals found in perfumes, makeup, hair products, and cleaning products, and do not store silver with rubber, latex, or other metals. Refrain from using a dishwasher to clean silver, and instead hand-wash it with cool water and mild soap. Regular usage and proper hand-cleaning of silver can help maintain its appearance and prevent oxidation."},{"instruction":"Answer this question: who plays sir gregor on game of thrones??","output":"Sir Gregor Clegane, also known as \\"The Mountain,\\" is a character in the popular HBO television series Game of Thrones. The show is based on the book series A Song of Ice and Fire by author George R.R. Martin. Sir Gregor Clegane is a fearsome and loyal knight, known for his immense size, brute strength, and violent temper. He is the head of House Clegane, a knightly house in the Westerlands sworn to House Lannister, and he serves as one of the key enforcers of the ruthless Lannister family.

The American public has been increasingly interested in transparency and accessibility to the highest levels of government, including the judicial branch. This widespread support can be attributed to the significant role the Supreme Court plays in shaping American society and the decisions that impact the lives of millions of citizens. In response to the poll, advocates for transparency in the legal system have called on the Supreme Court to reconsider its long-standing ban on cameras in the courtroom. They argue that televised proceedings would not only provide valuable educational opportunities for the public but would also contribute to increased trust in the judicial system by removing any perception of secrecy. Opponents of cameras in the courtroom, however, worry that televising the proceedings could lead to grandstanding by some justices, as well as potentially exploiting the privacy of the individuals involved in the cases. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the potential negative impact on the decision-making process, with justices potentially feeling pressured by public opinion, thereby undermining the independence that should define the court. In light of this debate, the Supreme Court has agreed to review its existing policies and will issue a decision regarding televised proceedings in the coming months. The outcome of this decision will undoubtedly have profound implications for both the American public and the future of the Supreme Court as an institution."},{"instruction":"Is this product review positive?

Researchers have discovered a protein that they claim is the missing link to the development of Alzheimer’s disease. They found that blocking this protein with an existing drug can restore memory in mice with brain damage that mimics the disease. The findings could offer hope of developing drugs to slow the degenerative illness. Alzheimer's causes a decrease in the size of the brain, shown here by the enlarged ventricle cavities (white, at centre of brain) and the widened pale blue regions. Researchers now believe they have found the 'missing link' that triggers the disease. 'What is very exciting is that of all the links in this molecular chain, this is the protein that may be most easily targeted by drugs,' said the study’s senior author Stephen Strittmatter at Yale School of Medicine. The study offers hope of developing drugs to slow the degenerative illness. 'This gives us strong hope that we can find a drug that will work to lessen the burden of Alzheimer’s.' During Alzheimer's disease protein 'plaques' develop in the structure of the brain, leading to the death of brain cells. People with Alzheimer's also have a shortage of some important chemicals in their brain involved with the transmission of messages within the brain. Scientists have already provided a partial molecular map of how Alzheimer’s disease destroys brain cells. In earlier work, Professor Strittmatter’s lab showed that the amyloid-beta peptides, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s, couple with prion proteins. By an unknown process, the coupling activates a molecular messenger called Fyn. The new findings, published in the journal Neuron, reveals the missing link in the chain, a protein within the cell membrane called metabotropic glutamate receptor 5, or mGluR5. When the protein is blocked by a drug similar to one being developed for Fragile X syndrome, the deficits in memory, learning, and synapse density were restored in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s. Prof Strittmatter stressed that new drugs may have to be designed to precisely target the amyloid-prion disruption of mGluR5 in human cases of Alzheimer’s and said his lab is exploring new ways to achieve this. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, currently affecting around 496,000 people in the UK. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"This article talks about researchers finding a protein that may be linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease.

I could do things the FBI thought impossible. I could memorize fingerprints. The nearby agencies, including local offices of federal agencies that had their own labs, came to me for help. One day in a trial a new-hatched defence attorney tried to make me seem neglectful because I hadn't sent the prints from the crime scene to the FBI for verification. The FBI will not look at prints that have already been identified locally. I tried to get that across to him. Finally I said, “Sir, you don't understand. I don't ask the FBI for help. The FBI asks me for help.” The courtroom went dead silent. The lawyer choked a bit and looked frantically at the judge, who knew me quite well. The judge slowly nodded. The lawyer choked a few more times, said, “No further questions,” and returned to his seat. I was the only person in the five-state area in which the silver burglar was hitting who got him on fingerprint evidence. He never left fingerprint evidence . . . except when he did. Every other police agency quit looking, because his MO was unmistakable. We didn't. A detective got prints from a bamboo tree he had used to climb in a window, and I got several prints from items he had handled inside the house. After the trial he was being led back to the jail and I was walking down the hall. He stopped and said, “I want to talk to that lady.” The bailiff told him he couldn't talk to the witness, but I said I wanted to hear what he had to say.

The Peterloo Massacre took place at St Peter's Field, Manchester, England, on 16 August 1819, when cavalry charged into a crowd of 60,000–80,000 who had gathered to demand the reform of parliamentary representation. The end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had resulted in periods of famine and chronic unemployment, exacerbated by the introduction of the first of the Corn Laws. By the beginning of 1819, the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the relative lack of suffrage in Northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism. In response, the Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, organised a demonstration to be addressed by the well-known radical orator Henry Hunt. Shortly after the meeting began, local magistrates called on the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry to arrest Hunt and several others on the hustings with him. The Yeomanry charged into the crowd, knocking down a woman and killing a child, and finally apprehending Hunt. The 15th Hussars were then summoned by the magistrate, Mr Hulton, to disperse the crowd. They charged with sabres drawn, and in the ensuing confusion, 18 people were killed and 400–700 were injured. The massacre was given the name Peterloo in an ironic comparison to the Battle of Waterloo, which had taken place four years earlier. Historian Robert Poole has called the Peterloo Massacre one of the defining moments of its age. In its own time, the London and national papers shared the horror felt in the Manchester region, but Peterloo's immediate effect was to cause the government to crack down on reform, with the passing of what became known as the Six Acts. It also led directly to the foundation of the Manchester Guardian, but had little other effect on the pace of reform. In a survey conducted by The Guardian in 2006, Peterloo came second to the Putney Debates as the event from radical British history that most deserved a proper monument or a memorial.

Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147\\", answer the following question.

Naive physics reasoning refers to the basic understanding and reasoning about the physical world that comes naturally to humans without any formal physics education. Solution 1: Heating Nutella One way to make Nutella runny is by heating it. When you heat Nutella, the temperature increases, and this causes the viscosity of the Nutella to decrease. The decrease in viscosity makes the Nutella flow more easily and become runnier. This is aligned with our naive understanding of the effect of heat on substances: when you heat a substance, especially fats or chocolate-based substances, they generally become less solid and more liquid-like. Therefore, using heat to make Nutella runny is a sound solution according to naive physics reasoning. Solution 2: Adding oil to Nutella Another possible solution is to add a small amount of oil, such as vegetable oil, to Nutella. When oil is mixed with Nutella, it changes the texture and consistency of the Nutella, making it smoother and more liquid. According to naive physics reasoning, mixing oil with other substances, especially those that are fat-based like Nutella, can help thin the mixture and make it easier to spread or work with. This can be observed in simple home cooking scenarios, where we often combine oil with other ingredients to create a smoother consistency. Thus, adding oil to Nutella can also be considered a sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning. Conclusion: Both solutions, heating Nutella and adding oil to Nutella, are sound in terms of naive physics reasoning. They each address the problem of making Nutella runny and easier to work with, based on our common understanding of the physical world. However, it is important to note that the choice of the solution depends on the specific needs and context. For example, if you're looking to maintain Nutella's original flavor, heating it up might be the best option, as adding oil could potentially dilute its taste. On the other hand, if external conditions or equipment make it difficult to heat the Nutella effectively, adding oil could be a quicker and more practical solution. From the perspective of naive physics reasoning alone, both options are viable to achieve the objective of making Nutella runnier and easier to work with."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Nice pls add this option Pls add option in profile status as like in whats up apps\\" Answer:","output":"Based on the content of the review, it is rather difficult to assign a definitive ★-rating.

They have good reason: to retrieve incriminating evidence against a powerful crime lord, Jorge \\"El Toro\\" Martinez. El Toro kidnapped Tim's younger brother and blackmailed Tim into stealing the evidence which would put him away for life. For Hotte, his beloved fiancée is being held captive as leverage. At the same time, a major rift within the police force threatens its stability. The elite task force, led by the strict and morally upright Captain Ray Miller, gets at odds with the corrupt police union. The union's president, Officer Charles Ford, has been involved in various illegal activities. There's a whistleblower report that's about to drop on the media; hence, the union is anxious to find and suppress it. Captain Miller focuses all his resources on not letting Ford succeed. Act II: Tim and Hotte use the ensuing chaos between the factions as cover for their infiltration. As the rift grows deeper, protests and strikes break out amongst the police ranks, putting the city on edge. The media frenzy is just beginning. Through a series of heists and risky operations, Tim and Hotte gather intel on both the rift and the location of the evidence. They manage to sneak into the Newford Police HQ as IT technicians and infiltrate the main database to pinpoint the vault containing the evidence. Meanwhile, Captain Miller discovers a mole on his team, who has been feeding information to Officer Ford. A subsequent confrontation between Miller and Ford inflames the already boiling situation in the department. Act III: Tim and Hotte, with their cover blown, hatch a daring plan to break into the vault on the night of the annual police gala. Utilizing the distraction of the event, Hotte disables the security system, while Tim stealthily navigates the police headquarters. A heart-pumping game of cat and mouse with Captain Miller ensues as he discovers their motives from a tip-off by Ford. As the rift in the department reaches a tipping point, Tim and Hotte manage to outwit their pursuers and break into the vault. During the heist, they come across the whistleblower report that Ford desperately wants to suppress. With this new power in their hands, Tim and Hotte decide they have the ammunition to take down both El Toro and Ford. Act IV: Tim and Hotte publicize the incriminating evidence against El Toro, leading to a citywide manhunt for the crime lord. They then confront Officer Ford and the corrupt union, using the whistleblower report as leverage. Captain Miller unexpectedly sides with Tim and Hotte during their tense negotiation, earning their trust. In a climactic showdown, Tim, Hotte, and Miller work together to expose and dismantle the corrupt police union. As El Toro and Ford face the consequences of their actions, Tim and Hotte reunite with their loved ones, basking in the camaraderie forged during the mission. With their lives returned to normal and the rift within the police department resolved, Tim and Hotte part ways but remain lifelong friends. However, they leave their mark on Newford's criminal underworld, sending a clear message that no one is untouchable."},{"instruction":"Question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet). - Planegg is a municipality in the district of Munich, in Bavaria, Germany.

I chose a gun instead of a knife for defense in the fight because the","output":"gun offers several advantages over the knife, which can ultimately be more effective in ensuring my safety during a confrontation. Here are the reasons why I made this decision: 1. Range: The primary advantage of a gun is that it can be used effectively from a distance. In a fight, maintaining a safe distance from an attacker is crucial for self-protection. With a knife, I would need to be in close quarters to the attacker, which increases the risk of getting injured. Using a gun, I can maintain a safe distance and still be able to defend myself. 2. Stopping power: A gun is more likely to incapacitate an opponent compared to a knife. While both can cause serious harm, a gunshot wound is typically more severe than a stab or cut. A well-placed shot can disable an attacker instantly, potentially ending the threat much quicker than with a knife. 3. Intimidation factor: A gun is often a more potent deterrent than a knife. The mere sight of a firearm may discourage an attacker from pursuing their intended course of action. In contrast, a knife might not have the same psychological impact on an assailant, potentially emboldening them to continue their attack. 4. Ease of use: Learning to use a gun properly takes time and practice, but once proficient, it is usually easier to use than a knife in a high-stress situation. The ability to aim and fire a gun can be more intuitive than attempting to use a knife effectively while under physical or emotional duress. 5. Multiple attackers: If faced with multiple attackers, a gun offers a more efficient means of defense than a knife. A firearm allows me to engage multiple targets in quick succession before they get too close, which would be difficult or nearly impossible to do with a knife. In conclusion, choosing a gun for defense during a fight provides me with a greater advantage in maintaining a safe distance, incapacitating the attacker quickly, and protecting myself from harm. While some may argue that a knife can be effective in certain situations, the benefits of using a gun outweigh the risks when considering self-defense."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given two lists A,B.

Thus, starting a story at the end is a characteristic feature of reverse chronology storytelling."},{"instruction":"Ask a question about Queen (band).","output":"What was the role of each member of Queen and how did they contribute to the band's success? Queen, a British rock band formed in 1970, is one of the most enduring and successful bands in rock history, having sold over 300 million records around the world. The band's unmatched popularity can be attributed to the distinctive musical styles, captivating live performances, and unique recordings of the four original members – Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon. Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara), was Queen's lead vocalist, pianist, and frontman. With his remarkable four-octave vocal range and theatrical stage presence, he captivated audiences and created a quintessential component of the Queen experience. Mercury was primarily responsible for writing many of the band's hits, including \\"Bohemian Rhapsody,\\" \\"Somebody to Love,\\" \\"We Are the Champions,\\" and \\"Don't Stop Me Now.\\" His unique songwriting style, combining various genres such as rock, opera, and gospel, set Queen apart from other bands and solidified their status as musical innovators. Brian May, the guitarist, served as Queen’s musical backbone, supplying the band's distinctive sound through his homemade \\"Red Special\\" guitar and innovative recording techniques. As an astrophysicist, May brought a methodical and scientific approach to music-making, carefully layering guitar harmonies to create the rich, melodic textures featured in songs like \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"Killer Queen.\\" Additionally, May contributed significantly to the band's songwriting efforts, composing anthems like \\"We Will Rock You,\\" \\"Fat Bottomed Girls,\\" and \\"The Show Must Go On,\\" among many others. Roger Taylor, the drummer, was essential to maintaining Queen's powerful rhythm section. With a background in various genres, including jazz, progressive rock, and hard rock, Taylor's versatile drumming style provided Queen with the foundation for their diverse musical catalog. Taylor was also a gifted vocalist, contributing harmonies and occasionally taking the lead, as evidenced in songs like \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" and \\"Radio Ga Ga.\\" Furthermore, Taylor's songwriting skills added memorable tracks like \\"Radio Ga Ga,\\" \\"A Kind of Magic,\\" and \\"These Are the Days of Our Lives\\" to Queen's discography. John Deacon, the bassist, was responsible for the underlying bass lines that supported the melodies and harmonies of Queen's music. With a degree in electronics, Deacon significantly contributed to the band's experimentation with synthesized sounds, as heard in songs like \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" and \\"I Want to Break Free.\\" Deacon's songwriting not only showcased his ability to write infectious bass lines, but also demonstrated a talent for crafting catchy pop melodies, as evidenced by hits like \\"You're My Best Friend\\" and \\"Spread Your Wings.\\" Overall, Queen's unparalleled success and iconic status can be attributed to the diverse musical backgrounds, exceptional talents, and collaborative spirit of its original members. Each member played a vital role, bringing their unique skills, creativity, and dedication to the band's artistic identity, which allowed Queen to create a lasting legacy that continues to inspire fans and musicians worldwide."},{"instruction":"My question: Does the following sentence make sense? \\"Biblical Mount Sinai stands next to Mount Everest.\\" Options: - yes - no Please think gradually:","output":"To determine if the sentence \\"Biblical Mount Sinai stands next to Mount Everest\\" makes sense, let us examine the information about these two mountains step-by-step. 1. Mount Sinai is mentioned in the Bible as the location where Moses received the Ten Commandments. It is a mountain located in the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt. 2. Mount Everest is the highest mountain on Earth, with a peak that rises 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level. It is part of the Himalayan mountain range and is situated on the border between Nepal and China. Since Mount Sinai is in Egypt and Mount Everest is on the border between Nepal and China, the two mountains are geographically far apart from each other. Therefore, the sentence \\"Biblical Mount Sinai stands next to Mount Everest\\" does not make sense, as these two mountains are not geographically close.

The answer is:","output":"Transpiration. To elaborate on this answer, it is important to understand the various processes involved in the water cycle and how they are interconnected. The water cycle refers to the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the Earth's surface. The main components of the water cycle are evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and transpiration. 1. Evaporation: This is the process of water changing from a liquid state to a gaseous state (water vapor). It occurs when water from the Earth's surface, such as oceans, lakes, and rivers, is heated by the sun. The water molecules absorb energy and gain enough kinetic energy to break free from the liquid state and enter the atmosphere as water vapor. 2. Condensation: Once the water vapor is in the atmosphere, it can encounter cooler temperatures, causing it to lose energy and change back into a liquid state. This is known as condensation and results in the formation of cloud droplets or ice crystals in the atmosphere. 3. Precipitation: When the cloud droplets or ice crystals in the atmosphere become too heavy to remain suspended in the air, they fall back to the Earth's surface as precipitation. Precipitation can occur in various forms, such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail, depending on the temperature and other atmospheric conditions. 4. Transpiration: This is the process of water vapor release from the surface of plants, particularly through leaf pores called stomata. Transpiration is an important part of the water cycle, as it returns water from the Earth's surface back into the atmosphere and contributes to humidity. In the presented question, it is stated that \\"water vapor moves from plants and falls to the earth's surface as rain and snow\\" which consists of two processes: transpiration (water vapor moving from plants into the atmosphere) and precipitation (water vapor falling back to the Earth's surface as rain and snow).

The name \\"Dallas\\" came from his love of the Dallas Cowboys. His brother, Rory, and sister, Sally, were raised by their maternal grandmother. Context: Page developed a yoga fitness program initially called Yoga for Regular Guys Workout or YRG after recovering from ruptures to his L4/L5 discs in 1998 and discovering the health benefits of yoga through his former wife, Kimberly. His favorite kind of yoga (according to his \\"Yoga for Regular Guys\\" book published in 2005) is \\"Power Yoga,\\" an American-style version of \\"Ashtanga Style\\" yoga. Page worked with Doctor of Chiropractic Dr. Craig Aaron, the \\"Yoga-Doc\\" and developed the Yoga for Regular Guys Workout. Page developed the book into a series of workout videos titled DDP YOGA (formerly YRG). DDP Yoga was featured in a video about Arthur Boorman in May 2012. The story was picked up by the mainstream media, including Good Morning America. The video describes the journey of Arthur Boorman, a disabled war veteran who was told by doctors he would never walk again. After 15 years on crutches, Boorman lost 140 pounds in 10 months and regained the ability to walk and run without his crutches, back braces or leg braces. On February 21, 2014, Page appeared on the ABC series Shark Tank, where he was seeking 200,200 for a 5% share in the company. He declined to sell a 50% share for that same amount. He had hoped to use the money to develop a mobile app. The investors believed the company's profits (800,000 in the previous year) would fall. Page later said he sold more than 1 million worth of product in the first six days after his appearance. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about this article. The answer lies in numerous facets of Page Joseph Falkinburg's life and his development of DDP Yoga. Key aspects include: 1. Page's early life and background: Born in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, Page was raised by his father after his parents divorced.

Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920.

Officials said they had lied when they applied for tourist visas and would not be allowed to work in Guatemala. The Dutch group, Women on Waves, offers free abortion services to women in countries where the procedure is banned. It takes women in the early stages of pregnancy out to international waters, where the abortion is performed. Abortion is only allowed in Guatemala when the mother's life is at risk. A spokeswoman for Women on Waves confirmed that they had been told to leave the country immediately, but she said its lawyers had appealed against the decision. La Prensa Libre newspaper said the four crew members being expelled were US citizens. It is not clear if other members of the group have also been ordered to leave the country. The Army said on Thursday it had been instructed by President Jimmy Morales to act, and would defend \\"human life and the laws of our country\\" by preventing the group from carrying out abortions. The Women on Waves' boat docked on the Pacific Ocean port of Quetzal, in the city of San Jose, on Wednesday. The group says it had a legal permit to sail in Guatemalan waters and the boat was being illegally \\"detained\\" by the authorities. The group says more than 60,000 illegal abortions are performed in Guatemala every year, and most of the women who put their lives at risk at the hands of untrained professionals are poor. \\"We respect religious beliefs but this [abortion] is a fundamental right in a democracy,\\" spokeswoman Leticia Zevich told La Hora Newspaper. However, Guatemala's Catholic Church, other religious leaders and politicians protested against the presence of the boat.

Bruno Latour (French: [latuR]; born 22 June 1947) is a French philosopher, anthropologist and sociologist. He is especially known for his work in the field of science and technology studies (STS). After teaching at the Ecole des Mines de Paris (Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation) from 1982 to 2006, he became Professor at Sciences Po Paris (2006-2017), where he was the scientific director of the Sciences Po Medialab. He retired from several university activities in 2017. After his early career efforts, Latour shifted his research interests to focus on laboratory scientists. Latour rose in importance following the 1979 publication of Laboratory Life: the Social Construction of Scientific Facts with co-author Steve Woolgar. In the book, the authors undertake an ethnographic study of a neuroendocrinology research laboratory at the Salk Institute. This early work argued that naive descriptions of the scientific method, in which theories stand or fall on the outcome of a single experiment, are inconsistent with actual laboratory practice. In the laboratory, Latour and Woolgar observed that a typical experiment produces only inconclusive data that is attributed to failure of the apparatus or experimental method, and that a large part of scientific training involves learning how to make the subjective decision of what data to keep and what data to throw out. Latour and Woolgar argued that, for untrained observers, the entire process resembles not an unbiased search for truth and accuracy but a mechanism for ignoring data that contradicts scientific orthodoxy. Latour and Woolgar produced a highly heterodox and controversial picture of the sciences. Drawing on the work of Gaston Bachelard, they advance the notion that the objects of scientific study are socially constructed within the laboratory--that they cannot be attributed with an existence outside of the instruments that measure them and the minds that interpret them. They view scientific activity as a system of beliefs, oral traditions and culturally specific practices-- in short, science is reconstructed not as a procedure or as a set of principles but as a culture. Latour's 1987 book Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers through Society is one of the key texts of the sociology of scientific knowledge in which he famously wrote his Second Principle as follows: \\"Scientist and engineers speak in the name of new allies that they have shaped and enrolled; representatives among other representatives, they add these unexpected resources to tip the balance of force in their favor.\\" Some of Latour's position and findings in this era provoked vehement rebuttals. Gross and Leavitt argue that Latour's position becomes absurd when applied to non-scientific contexts: e.g., if a group of coworkers in a windowless room were debating whether or not it were raining outside and went outdoors to discover raindrops in the air and puddles on the soil, Latour's hypothesis would assert that the rain was socially constructed. Similarly, philosopher John Searle argues that Latour's \\"extreme social constructivist\\" position is seriously flawed on several points, and furthermore has inadvertently \\"comical results.\\"","output":"This text is about Bruno Latour, a French philosopher, anthropologist, and sociologist known for his work in the field of science and technology studies (STS)."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place.

William Jefferson easily defeated his fellow Democratic opponent in a runoff election Saturday, despite an ongoing federal bribery investigation. In complete but unofficial returns, Jefferson, Louisiana's first black congressman since Reconstruction, received 57 percent of the vote over state Rep. Karen Carter, who had 43 percent. Carter was unable to capitalize on a scandal that included allegations the FBI found 90,000 in bribe money in Jefferson's freezer. In a concession speech, Carter embraced family members and pledged to work with Jefferson, especially on the area's recovery from Hurricane Katrina. \\"I guess the people are happy with the status-quo,\\" she said. Jefferson was forced into the runoff against Carter when he failed to win 50 percent of the vote in a crowded open multiparty primary. Carter had sought to become the first black woman from Louisiana elected to Congress. He described his win as \\"a great moment, and I thank almighty God for making it possible.\\" He called for regional unity to focus on the hurricane recovery and in bringing back evacuees who are still scattered across the country. His presence in Washington could be embarrassing for Democrats, who won control of Congress on a platform of cleaning up corruption. In June, incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, led a successful effort to remove Jefferson from the powerful House Ways and Means Committee as the probe unfolded. He was accused of taking bribes from a company seeking lucrative contracts in the Nigerian telecommunications market. He has not been charged with any crime and denies any wrongdoing. The scandal turned the race into a debate largely divided along racial lines, an age-old dynamic in this city that has intensified since Hurricane Katrina displaced large numbers of blacks and upended their demographic and political dominance. Whites, who overwhelmingly voted for Carter in the primary and have been her most enthusiastic financial backers, believed a Jefferson win would confirm this city's image as corrupt and untrustworthy as it asks the nation to fund its recovery from Katrina. City Councilman Oliver Thomas said Jefferson's success would make the recovery more difficult. \\"People are watching this election all around the country, and I can only imagine what they are thinking,\\" Thomas said. \\"It will be very difficult to go back to them and ask them to trust us with the money we need here.\\" Carter's campaign spokesman and father, Ken Carter, said he felt they had done all they could to compete against Jefferson, but regretted the tone of the campaign in the final stages. \\"Race is all too often a factor in campaigns in New Orleans,\\" Ken Carter said. \\"Here we had a candidate that tried to paint this young African-American woman as a pawn of the white establishment.\\" One white voter, George Christen, a registered independent, cast his ballot in a predominantly white precinct in the Algiers neighborhood, just across the Mississippi River from the French Quarter. \\"I just didn't want Jefferson in. Period,\\" said Christen, 42. \\"Jefferson is an embarrassment. He needs to be out.\\" Jefferson did get a vote from Jene Allen, who is black. \\"He started the job. Let him finish it,\\" said Allen, who wouldn't give her age. \\"I know Karen Carter would be the first black woman, but I think she played it dirty, too dirty.\\" Jefferson drew widespread support among blacks who are skeptical of the federal government's motives in its investigation of him. He repeatedly suggested the probe is groundless because he has yet to be indicted more than a year after the FBI raided his home in New Orleans. Carter, 37, raised nearly five times as much money as Jefferson, but she was largely outflanked in the endorsement game. Jefferson picked up the backing of Mayor Ray Nagin and other prominent black politicians. The endorsements spoke to Jefferson's solid footing in New Orleans politics. He arrived here in the 1970s as a Harvard-educated lawyer from rural north Louisiana, the sixth of 10 children brought up in a three-room country home. By 1980, he represented New Orleans in the state Senate. At 42, he became the first black from Louisiana in the House since Reconstruction. The law firm Jefferson founded became the largest black-owned practice in the South. He created a political organization, the Progressive Democrats, which fielded candidates for the school board, assessors' races, state House seats and mayoral contests. Before the bribery scandal erupted, Jefferson had climbed to the pinnacle of the Democratic Party. He was a confidant of former President Bill Clinton and held a seat on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. Copyright 2006 The Associated Press.

This valuable commodity is used to power a variety of industries and is the primary source of energy for millions of people worldwide. One of the methods for transporting oil is by rail. While rail transport has its advantages, such as lower costs and the ability to cover vast distances, it also raises several concerns. This article will explore the issues surrounding oil transport by rail, from environmental concerns to safety hazards, and the potential impact they can have on our society. Step 1: Identifying Environmental Concerns One of the most pressing issues with oil transportation by rail is the potential for environmental damage. Spills and leaks can occur during transportation, resulting in contamination of nearby water supplies, soil, and wildlife habitats. The emission of greenhouse gases from the trains that carry the oil further contributes to environmental pollution and climate change. These consequences can be particularly severe if an accident occurs in sensitive ecological areas or near population centers. Step 2: Examining Safety Risks Oil transport by rail also poses safety risks to both the environment and human populations. Derailments, collisions, and other accidents involving oil-laden trains can lead to devastating consequences. In recent years, several high-profile accidents have brought attention to the potential dangers of this form of transport. These accidents can result in catastrophic fires, explosions, and even loss of life. Step 3: Delving into Infrastructure Limitations As the demand for oil continues to grow, so too does the need for efficient and safe transportation methods. However, current rail infrastructure may not be equipped to handle the increased volume of oil transport. Tracks, bridges, and other components of the rail system may require significant upgrades or repairs to maintain their safety and efficiency. Inadequate infrastructure can lead to delays, accidents, and increased costs for the companies and consumers that rely on oil. Step 4: Evaluating Alternatives to Rail Transportation Given the concerns associated with oil transport by rail, it's essential to consider alternative methods for moving this vital resource. Pipelines are often seen as a more efficient and environmentally friendly option, though they are not without their own set of challenges and controversies. Additionally, technological advancements may pave the way for new transportation methods, such as electric vehicles and renewable energy sources, which could reduce the reliance on oil altogether. Step 5: Examining Regulations and Government Involvement To ensure the continued safe and efficient transport of oil by rail, government agencies and regulators must be vigilant. They must establish and enforce strict safety standards, invest in infrastructure improvements, and continually monitor industry practices. Collaboration between the government, industry, and communities can help mitigate the risks associated with oil transport by rail and work toward more sustainable solutions. Conclusion: Oil transportation by rail is a topic laden with complexities and concerns. Addressing the environmental, safety, and infrastructure issues associated with this mode of transport is essential to protect both the natural world and human populations. By evaluating alternatives and investing in improvements, society can work towards reducing the risks associated with oil transport by rail and creating a safer and more sustainable future for all."},{"instruction":"Write a summary based on this article: When Greg Smith resigned in March as an executive director and vice president of Goldman Sachs with an Op-Ed page article in The New York Times, he leveled some sweeping charges: Goldman’s culture was “toxic and destructive”; the firm promoted “morally bankrupt people”; and — most devastating to any professional organization — Goldman Sachs bankers were “ripping their clients off.” Mr. Smith’s letter clearly hit a popular nerve, coming as it did during a devastating financial crisis in which Goldman emerged as the rich, arrogant and unfeeling perpetrator of much of the financial wreckage still afflicting Americans. And it’s hard to quarrel with Mr. Smith’s overriding message: Wall Street should put clients interests’ first or risk oblivion. Indeed, that was Goldman Sachs’s own credo, “Our clients’ interests always come first.” But stripped of its incendiary conclusions, Mr. Smith’s manifesto was curiously short on facts. Other than the now-infamous reference to muppets — “I have seen five different managing directors refer to their own clients as ‘muppets,’ sometimes over internal e-mail” — there were no examples of a toxic culture at work, no actual names of morally bankrupt people and no examples of a client getting ripped off. Mr. Smith declined to elaborate after the article was published, heightening suspense and no doubt fueling the literary bidding that reached a reported 1.5 million for a book that would deliver the goods. That book, “Why I Left Goldman Sachs,” goes on sale on Monday. Despite tight security, copies of the book have been circulating, and I read one. The book not only fails to deliver concrete examples to back up his sweeping conclusions, but he admits changing “names or descriptors” for some (but not all) people and acknowledges that what he does disclose is “from memory.” He says he has tried “to retain the spirit” of what actually occurred. This makes it nearly impossible to verify much of what he says. Beyond that, from his perch on the equity trading desk he seems to have had a narrow view of the institution where he worked for nearly 12 years. His disillusionment comes across as heartfelt, but much of it seems to have come less from his own experiences than from news reports about the firm’s behavior in deals he wasn’t involved in. Mr. Smith’s book might even bolster Goldman’s reputation. After all, if Mr. Smith is the ultimate insider, and this is as bad as it gets — Mr. Smith in a hot tub at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas with a topless woman — then he hasn’t made much of a case. But Mr. Smith isn’t in much of a position to exonerate Goldman, either. The firm was deeply enmeshed in nearly all aspects of the financial crisis and its causes, including mortgage-backed securities. And after an injection of taxpayer support, it managed to profit handsomely and pay the lavish bonuses that Mr. Smith shared in. But you won’t find that story in “Why I Left.” Mr. Smith declined to discuss any of this before his scheduled appearance on Sunday on “60 Minutes.” Goldman Sachs responded to some of my questions with copies of parts of their internal investigation and made several employees available. Potential problems with Mr. Smith’s approach surface almost immediately. The first paragraph of Chapter 1 describes “an intern named Josh” who’s being “grilled” and asked to explain risk arbitrage but “was floundering badly.” Josh, Mr. Smith adds, is the son of a billionaire. There was no “Josh” in Mr. Smith’s group of interns, and only one son of a billionaire: Teddy Schwarzman, son of Stephen Schwarzman, the chairman and chief executive of the asset management firm Blackstone Group. “I was never grilled on risk arbitrage, or asked to give a presentation on it,” Mr. Schwarzman said when I contacted him this week. “I realize it was a long time ago, but I would certainly have remembered it if I had floundered.” Nor did anyone else in the class I spoke to recall such an episode. Mr. Smith also recounts what purports to be a verbatim exchange between a Goldman vice president and a fellow intern named Brynn Thomas who graduated from Brown University. Brynn is interrogated and humiliated by her lack of knowledge about Microsoft, and “starts to tear up and runs out of the room.” Goldman said it has no record of anyone named Brynn Thomas, and other members of Mr. Smith’s intern class said no one by that name was in his class. Nor did they recall any such incident. “The program wasn’t that cutthroat, and it certainly wasn’t abusive,” said Mr. Schwarzman, now a movie producer. “No one ever ran out of a room crying. They were trying to recruit us and also to shape us. They had high expectations, but I learned a tremendous amount.” (The actual person apparently described in the anecdote, a Brown graduate named Ebony Thomas who was an intern with Mr. Smith, didn’t respond to requests for comment.) On the larger issue of whether Goldman was “ripping off” clients, his principal evidence is that while he was working in London in the two years before his resignation, Goldman was urging clients to buy or sell options on European banks while countries like Greece and Portugal were in the midst of debt crises. In Mr. Smith’s telling, Goldman was trying to get clients to take positions that Goldman was trying to get rid of, which Mr. Smith describes as “axes.” “The firm believes, deep down, that one outcome is going to transpire, yet it advises the client to do the opposite, so the firm can then take the other side of the trade and implement its own proprietary bet.” But Goldman officials told me the firm never acted as a principal on any of those trades, and Mr. Smith doesn’t provide any specific examples where it did. Moreover, they noted, Mr. Smith sold United States equities and derivatives while he was in London, not European ones, so he would have had no direct knowledge of European options trading. Mr. Smith also faults Goldman for constantly changing its views on the outlook for European banks, requiring clients to keep trading and presumably generating more commissions for the firm. “No thinking client could believe that conditions on the ground could change that frequently. It was so obviously misleading and disingenuous,” he writes. But Goldman officials said that anyone immersed in the European debt crisis and government responses at the time would understand that conditions changed frequently, and it was Goldman’s obligation to keep clients informed. As for muppets — a mildly derogatory term common in British slang — Goldman officials said they had conducted an exhaustive search after Mr. Smith resigned. They said they found only one such reference to a client, and it was about educating the client, a midsize European bank, not taking advantage of it. The mere mention of Mr. Smith invokes passionate reactions at Goldman, but much of the initial anger seems to have dissipated. People I spoke to who had been close to him felt hurt, wronged and saddened by a broadside from someone they considered a friend and colleague, dedicated to the firm and its values, who was hard-working, reliable and humble. He seemed, they said, the last person to attack the firm and its culture. One of Mr. Smith’s fellow interns said, “I thought he loved the firm and its culture.” The former intern, now a managing director, said he helped organize a going-away party for him at SPiN, a Manhattan club with 17 Ping-Pong tables. (Mr. Smith was a table tennis champion in his native South Africa.) “In his book he makes every element of our intern program seem demeaning,” the former intern said. “It was intense and stressful, but it was fun. And we learned so much.” He showed me a yearbook he had saved from that summer with several photos of a beaming Mr. Smith. The Goldman officials I spoke to all asked not to be named because they didn’t want to be drawn into a public debate about the book. A partner who said he acted in many ways as Mr. Smith’s mentor and was in regular contact with him until shortly before he left, said: “He never raised any issue with me. I had no inkling. I thought he’d settled in in London and was doing fine. I know he was disappointed he hadn’t been made a managing director yet, but he just wasn’t ready. For some people it’s a sprint, but it took me 18 years to make managing director and 20 years to make partner. I told him to keep at it and good things will happen. Serve clients and they’ll serve you. Give them good ideas. London was a great opportunity for him, and I thought he was excited.” One thing Mr. Smith was clearly unhappy about was his compensation, which had peaked at 500,000 and, like the compensation of most Goldman employees, had recently declined slightly. After he asked for a 1 million bonus, his supervisor wrote in an e-mail, “Greg Smith off the charts unrealistic, thinks he shld trade at multiples, we told him there’s v little tolerance for reactions like that and he needs to tone it down.” The partner told me this week: “He was an outlier in London. Most people were disappointed but realistic. He had a complete disconnect from the macro environment. Europe wanted to outlaw bonuses. They were discussing bonus caps. We were laying people off. People were very sensitive to this.” The former intern added, “I was floored; I was beyond shocked” by Mr. Smith’s resignation and accusations. “He was making 500,000 at the age of 26 or 27 at a time when people were being laid off, and he complains? I can only conclude he was motivated by personal gain. The firm has been under attack, and I think he’s being opportunistic. None of it feels virtuous to me.” Virtuous or not, “Why I Left” will surely not be the last word — good or bad — on Goldman. Fabrice Tourre, the young Goldman trader at the center of a now-infamous subprime mortgage deal, is scheduled to go on trial for civil fraud next July. Unlike Mr. Smith, Mr. Tourre was involved in a deal in which Goldman misled investors, the Securities and Exchange Commission has said. That deal has come to embody many of the excesses of the subprime mortgage bubble — something that actually did help cause the financial crisis. Mr. Tourre has denied any wrongdoing and is on unpaid leave from Goldman while studying for a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago and doing volunteer work in Rwanda. Mr. Tourre hasn’t signed a seven-figure book deal, but he could surely get one — and if he does, it could be a tell-all worth reading. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| Should Goldman Sachs care about Greg Smith’s book? While “Why I Left Goldman Sachs: A Wall Street Story” does not contain any explosive accusations of wrongdoing, it does lay bare at least one man’s view of how the firm’s culture went haywire over the last decade. The believability of his story could have a long-term effect on the firm and its ability to recruit and retain new talent. Mr. Smith’s book is being released on Monday and was the subject of a segment on “60 Minutes” on Sunday night. On that program, Mr. Smith said Goldman, like other firms, started several years ago to use client information to bet with its own money, sometimes against its own clients. Getting an unsophisticated client, he said, became the “golden prize” because the “quickest way to make money on Wall Street is to take the most sophisticated product and try to sell it to the least sophisticated client.” Goldman rejects Mr. Smith’s claims, saying, “We have taken a look at those claims as they relate to his business and found no evidence whatsoever to support them.” Mr. Smith had a seat in the trenches as Goldman evolved from an old line investment bank into a trading power house. He was influenced, as most employees everywhere are, by both things he saw during his time there and by events he read about in the news. CBS News/60 Minutes “I knew in my heart there was simply something deeply wrong with the way people were behaving, in the way they didn’t care about the repercussions, in the way they saw their clients as adversaries,” Mr. Smith wrote in his book. “My human reaction was that it was bad for the future of the firm, a place that I had put lot of heart and soul into.” On the one hand, Mr. Smith comes across as naïve. Yes, there is gambling going on at the casino. But Goldman has long stood out on Wall Street for its ability to hang onto the partnership culture it had before it went public in 1999. That culture, which Goldman says promotes teamwork, integrity and putting the client first, is at Goldman’s core. It helps the bank maintain and attract talent, and Goldman hopes it instills in its employees a type of focus that will allow it to thrive for decades to come. Corporate culture can make or break a firm. Mr. Smith’s book is interesting because while the tone for corporate culture is set at the top, managers like the Goldman Sachs chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, rely on people like Mr. Smith to believe it and live by it. While the book is at its heart a story about how the firm’s culture broke down, it is oddly also a testament to some of the ways in which Goldman’s culture still works. For instance, Goldman is legendary for instilling the idea in traders that it is better to fess up to your mistakes, and the penalty for covering something up will be worse than if you had not spoken up. This lesson was drilled into Mr. Smith on his few months on the job, in the summer of 2000, when he was an intern and witnessed it in action throughout his career. The mantra of one of his first bosses, he says, was “no ambiguity, no error.” One morning he made a mistake on a trade, and came clean as the firm would hope he would. “We covered the error, traded out of it, and the correct trade was put on. In all that time – it seemed like 10 minutes but was probably 1 – the market had moved only one tick.” Mr. Smith noted that the error cost Goldman just 80, but the larger point he was making was reporting his error was the right thing, and encouraged by his managers. Another positive revelation: “Drugs were severely frowned upon at Goldman, even regarded with a certain horror.” And while Mr. Smith’s depiction of a bachelor party for a Goldman trader, replete with a topless woman in a hot tub, will not go down as Goldman’s finest moment, there was no obvious abuse of corporate funds at that party, or at anytime during his time there, at least that he cared to mention. He even goes out of his way to note that he once saw a partner who ordered a 400 bottle of wine and then paid for it himself because it exceeded the firm’s corporate spending guidelines. At the heart of Mr. Smith’s book, though, is what went wrong with Goldman’s culture. The firm’s overriding business principle is its clients’ interests always come first. He says traders in London frequently refer to clients as “muppets” and that their goal is to land elephant trades, transactions that will net the firm more than 1 million in revenue. Goldman, he said, “really had become more like a hedge fund, concerned more with helping itself than helping its clients with doing only the business we thought could make us a lot of money and ensure our survival,” he wrote. “Company culture and morale seemed to be bygone values.” Goldman could not disagree more. “Nothing that Greg suggested rang true to me,” said the head of human capital management, Edith W. Cooper, last week in an interview with Bloomberg TV. For years, the essential read for any new Goldman recruit has been a 1999 book, “The Culture of Success” by Lisa Endlich, a positive look at what sets Goldman apart from its rivals. Mr. Smith’s book will no doubt be added to the reading list of at least some students thinking about applying to Goldman. In the last few weeks, Goldman has adopted an uncharacteristically public attack plan, which has included media briefings and on the record interviews. Its effectiveness is critical because it will color the view of future recruits who pick up the book, and whether they believe (or even care) about his concerns. “I don’t see what he suggests are challenges at the firm,” Ms. Cooper said, “and I believe our culture is stronger than it’s ever been.” ||||| NEW YORK | NEW YORK (Reuters) - The tell-all book that Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) former equity derivatives salesman Greg Smith has delivered may end up being remembered more for the marketing skills he picked up at the Wall Street bank than for any bombshell revelations. Smith created a furor earlier this year when he resigned from the blue chip Wall Street firm, alleging in a New York Times Op-Ed column that the firm had engendered a \\"toxic\\" culture of treating clients as \\"muppets\\" - slang in Britain for idiots - and relieving them of their money. Smith then promised a book about the bank, building up expectations of an exposé with new insights about the culture at Goldman. The threat prompted a public relations campaign and internal inquiries at the bank, as it tried to avoid another hit to its image after suffering a barrage of bad publicity in recent years. Smith reportedly received 1.5 million as an upfront payment for the book, which is being published by Grand Central Publishing, a unit of Hachette. He has lined up a series of interviews, including one with Reuters, to talk about the book \\"Why I left Goldman Sachs\\", which will be released on Monday. Early reviews of Smith's 288-page book are now in, and they aren't good. Reviewers, who received copies of the full book, have panned it for being a sleepy read with no big revelations -- or worse, misleading. The tawdriest revelations are about a bachelor party in Las Vegas with a topless woman, and Smith having seen Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, in the buff after showering at the gym. \\"There were no examples of a toxic culture at work, no actual names of morally bankrupt people and no examples of a client getting ripped off,\\" wrote James Stewart, himself the author of top selling business books such as Den of Thieves, in his column in the New York Times. \\"Mr. Smith's book might even bolster Goldman's reputation. After all, if Mr. Smith is the ultimate insider, and this is as bad as it gets — Mr. Smith in a hot tub at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas with a topless woman — then he hasn't made much of a case,\\" said Stewart. Stewart also cast doubt on some of the anecdotes Smith tells in his story, interviewing people who were in his internship class, such as Teddy Schwarzman, son of Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) CEO Stephen Schwarzman. Schwarzman and others say the incidents Smith described, such as an intern running out of a room crying after being humiliated by a more senior Goldman executive, never happened. Other early reviews have also been critical. The financial blog Dealbreaker mocked less-than-revelatory anecdotes in Smith's book, including one in which a managing director threw out a \\"cheddar cheese salad\\" that an intern had brought him for lunch, instead of the cheese sandwich he had asked for. That anecdote led to more jokes on Twitter and other financial blogs about what, exactly, a cheddar cheese salad is. Smith's publicist, Jimmy Franco, did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Smith's ability to so easily build up buzz about his book over the past few months shows how difficult it has been for Goldman to try to counter perceptions that it is the poster child for all that's wrong on Wall Street. In 2010, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused the bank of betting against clients on a mortgage trade, charges that were later settled, but nevertheless led to a firestorm of criticism. One of its former traders, Fabrice Tourre, is due in court next summer to face civil charges for his involvement in those events. Smith's allegations had raised the same questions about Goldman's culture and ethics all over again. For its part, Goldman has characterized Smith as a disgruntled and mediocre employee who stirred up all this attention because he did not get the raise and promotion he wanted. Smith spent 12 years at the investment bank. By the time of his resignation, he was a vice president, earning about 500,000 a year, Goldman said. Goldman has said that it looked into Smith's assertions and did not find any evidence of employees misbehaving or treating clients poorly. Blankfein told CNBC recently that the firm \\"went over everything like crazy and, frankly, we could find nothing.\\" The marketing strategy for the book shines a spotlight on tactics used by publishers and authors to drum up sales for upcoming publications - and the problems that it can create when the book in question fails to deliver. It appears to be \\"a typical example of overpromising and under-delivering,\\" said George Belch, chair of the marketing department at San Diego State University and an expert on consumer behavior, who noted that he has not yet read the book. \\"What they do is try to drum up publicity and whet the public appetite, and clearly Goldman Sachs, for certain portions of the population, is intriguing. But that doesn't mean the book will do anything more than reinforce your disdain for the industry if you already feel that way.\\" Smith's failure to meet expectations also raises uncomfortable questions for the Times, which first published his allegations in an op-ed column. On Friday morning, New York Times business columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin said on CNBC he thought the newspaper might have been \\"duped\\" by Smith into publishing the op-ed in the first place, given the lack of substantial information in the book. A Times spokeswoman declined to comment. TRADER MENTALITY Smith, who vanished from the public spotlight after his Times op-ed appeared in March, will make his first television appearance on Sunday evening, on the CBS show \\"60 Minutes.\\" A clip of the show released on Friday has him recounting an incident in which he says a 24- or 25-year-old junior salesman calls a client a \\"muppet\\" after charging the client an additional 1 million for a trade. \\"Now you could think to yourself, 'Is this some rogue guy who's just talking callously about clients?'\\" Smith told CBS. \\"But his boss, who's a managing director, was sitting right next to him nodding and chuckling along.\\" In the interview, Smith wears a dark blue suit, white shirt and red tie, talking for the first time to the public in his native South African accent. Smith told CBS he does not think he betrayed Goldman and that he has gone on this public campaign to try to affect change at a firm he was once proud of. Belch, the marketing professor, said that by publicly slamming the firm, Smith might have done more harm than good, since the book appears to have little new information. \\"Here's another book about how we got taken to the cleaners by the financial services industry,\\" said Belch. \\"Well, yeah, what a shock.

He announced his departure from the investment bank with a blistering editorial in The New York Times, accusing Goldman of routinely deceiving clients and relentlessly pursuing profit at the expense of morality. And he struck a nerve. The essay went viral in the financial world and beyond. Smith was praised for uncloaking corruption that was crying out to be addressed, and also derided as a disgruntled employee. Goldman Sachs denies Smith's allegations about deceiving clients. The bank says it took his concerns seriously, thoroughly investigated them, and found no evidence to support them. Smith's book, \\"Why I Left Goldman Sachs,\\" is being released Monday. It's a window into a company that is notoriously tight-lipped, with stories about a swaggering place where interns arise for 5 a.m. meetings and business trips mean slapping down 150 for one person's dinner. What Smith hopes to do, he says, is educate people about how Wall Street works, and fuel a public conversation about what went wrong ethically, and how to fix it. The practices that caused the financial crisis, he says, were never really resolved; they're just lying dormant. Smith, 33, gave his first print interview to The Associated Press. Excerpts have been edited for clarity and length. Q: Tell us about March 14, the day you left Goldman. You were working in the London office, and you say you had already cleaned out your desk and had been told the editorial would go online at 7 a.m. your time. A: I get up at 6 a.m., and I type a very heartfelt email to nine people in Europe, including the CEO of Goldman Europe, and express in very personal terms why I'm leaving. I talk about exactly what I thought was wrong with the place, this obvious deceit of clients. Within five minutes I get an email back from someone on the management committee in Europe who says, \\"I'm really surprised to hear this. I'm in London today. I'd love to meet with you.\\" I get two voice mails from two other people. And then at 6:57 or 6:58, the piece comes online. Q: What did the bank do? A: My work BlackBerry stayed on for about three more hours, and I started getting emails from clients who were saying, \\"We completely agree with you, we don't trust Goldman Sachs, we do business with you guys with a \`buyer beware' attitude.\\" I started getting text messages from Goldman managing directors who were supportive as well. And Goldman reached out to me in formal fashion and said, \\"We're sorry to hear you resigned; we'd like to air these concerns out.\\" Q: The bank denies everything you've charged about them ripping off clients. A: The thing that disappoints me most is that management is denying there's a problem. Why not try to repair the trust instead? Clients are telling you they don't trust you. There's been an SEC fraud suit that was settled for half a billion dollars. (The Securities and Exchange Commission accused the bank of selling investments to clients when the bank believed the investments were going to fail. Goldman paid 550 million. It remains the largest SEC penalty paid by a Wall Street firm.) I'm not some lone voice who thought there was a problem, a change from a client fiduciary model (doing what's best for the client) to use-the-client-to-extract-wealth model. It's a problem that many, many of my colleagues felt and that the public feels as well, borne out in SEC suits and congressional testimonies and clients saying publicly that they don't trust us. Q: Were you just disgruntled? Maybe you didn't get the bonus or the promotion you wanted? A: I was actually doing well in my career at Goldman. My bonus, I was told I outperformed my peers by 10 percent. I'm a competitive person, and my goal was to get promoted, and I was told by multiple partners that I was two years away from getting promoted. So it certainly was a goal of mine. And on the compensation side, I was earning a lot of money and had a very good living, so I was grateful for what I was earning. It allowed me to have a good life and to support my family and to do things that I thought were valuable. Q: But you were at Goldman for almost 12 years, if you start with your summer internship in 2000. Weren't there times when you should have stood up, should have said something about what you thought was morally wrong? A: I actually made a conscious decision not to sell toxic deals to clients. I didn't think it was the right thing to do, but I also saw the idea that if clients' trust is being burned and they're getting blown up, you're not going to have a career for very long. Now that does not mean I was not part of a system that was doing things that were unethical. In the book, I try to show some of the conflicts I noticed that gave me pause. For many years, I gave the firm the benefit of the doubt. It absolutely could have happened quicker. But one can always see things earlier and sooner. Q: OK, but isn't the purpose of any capitalist company to make money? You certainly made a lot of money at Goldman. (Smith says he made in the \\"high hundreds of thousands of dollars\\" in his best years but declines to be more specific. His publisher declines to say what he was paid for the book.) A: Capitalism should be where everyone competes hard and makes money, in an environment where there is fair play and competitiveness. Right now the system is stacked against everyone else in favor of the banks. It's a little like a casino. A real casino is regulated and there are cameras everywhere and the casino cannot see your cards. With Wall Street today, the bank can see what every government, every pension fund, every hedge fund in the world is doing. They can effectively see everyone's cards. Then, instead of facilitating the client's will, they're trying to get the client to facilitate their will. Q: What do you hope to accomplish with your book? A: People know there's this huge conflict, and that things are being done that are unethical but are not necessarily illegal. But nobody can put their finger on exactly what the problem is. My goal with the book was to write it to a general reader who knows nothing about finance. By the time someone reaches the end of the book, they can say, \\"I can now speak more intelligently about where the conflicts of interest are, and I can lobby my congressman or I can speak about it more.\\" If people are not educated about what the issues are, they're powerless. That was the problem with Occupy Wall Street _ they didn't know what they were protesting. Q: The banks are going to say any bad practices were caused by just a few bad actors, and that those guys are gone. A: This is not some conspiracy of five people sitting in a room plotting to destroy the world. This is far more boring. This is where people have created a perverse incentive system. If someone can overcharge a client by a million dollars, their leaders are going to say, \\"Great job, we just made an extra million dollars off this pension fund.\\" Q: So the endemic part is that people don't speak up? A: People don't like being asked or compelled to make morally dubious decisions. But unfortunately a lot of people's livelihoods are tied up in this, and it's not an easy thing to unwind. Their lives are caught up in this system where they're sending their kids to private schools _ it's almost like the machine for them is working so well that there's no way to undo it unless you want to change your lifestyle. Q: Why should we care about what happens on Wall Street? A: You see a lot of commentary that Wall Street is just rich people gambling with other rich people's money. I want people to know that it ultimately affects everyone. In 2008, banks had to be bailed out and that hits taxpayers. If you're a teacher or a fireman or a charity, and you have an investment fund that is trading with Wall Street, and Wall Street is not being held accountable and behaving ethically, then that directly impacts everyone. Q: What about the reaction of your family and friends to all this? You didn't tell them about the editorial beforehand. A: No, my mother would have been really upset, and frankly my mother is still very upset. She's mostly worried about how I don't have a job right now. For my parents' generation, the idea of stability is very important, while my generation is a little more idealistic about wanting to actually change things, even if it involves some kind of personal risk. It took me a while to show my mother that I was actually very proud of this. ||||| Greg Smith, who blasted Goldman Sachs when he publicly resigned from the firm and is releasing a book about his experience there, is telling a story that increasingly doesn’t make any sense. In his first television interview since submitting his resignation letter to the opinion pages of The New York Times in March, Smith continued to say things that were inconsistent with some of his biggest allegations against Goldman Sachs. One example from his 60 Minutes interveiw: Smith said that a big shot at a key Goldman Sachs client, some huge fund in Asia, told him that he didn’t trust Goldman Sachs, but that he would continue to do business with the firm. The anonymous fund man, Smith says, made this statement after Goldman Sachs was accused by the Securities & Exchange Commission of profiting by misleading clients in a single deal in 2010 and Goldman Sachs execs were grilled in a congressional hearing. Smith said he was troubled by this story, but he shouldn’t have been. It’s precisely what should be happening in financial markets, especially among large and sophisticated financial institutions. No one charged with making large financial decisions on behalf of themselves or others should just trust any big Wall Street firm, not just Goldman Sachs, but also Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and on and on—and if they do blindly put faith in those institutions trying to sell them stuff then the bigger problem is that such individuals have been given the authority to buy products from Goldman Sachs in the first place. Smith was not selling sophisticated financial products to retail investors, he was selling them to large and sophisticated institutions. That doesn’t mean that it’s not sleazy, wrong and in some cases potentially illegal for Wall Street banks to mislead their clients, but it does undermine Smith’s argument about Goldman Sachs doing business with muppet clients. Smith wrote that at Goldman “callously people talk about ripping their clients off” and refer to those clients as muppets. But now Smith is saying that at least one muppet, after the financial crisis, wised up and openly declared entering into transactions with the care that is required. So what’s the problem now? Smith, by the way, remained happily employed at Goldman making as much as 500,000 in the years prior to the financial crisis—which I think we can all agree was a low point for ethical behavior on Wall Street and at Goldman—but not the low point in tell-all Wall Street book sell-outs. James Stewart, who has helped set the standard for writing books about Wall Street scandal, read Smith’s book and found it “fails to deliver concrete examples to back up his sweeping conclusions.” Stewart also alleges that Smith may have invented a billionaire intern he cites in a Goldman Sachs anecdote. Last week, Goldman Sachs released a summary of its investigation into Smith’s claims that said Smith was denied a big raise and promotion shortly before quitting. Anderson Cooper asked Smith about this charge on 60 Minutes. Smith did not deny it and said he would have quit anyway. |||||","output":"Greg Smith resigned from Goldman Sachs and accused the company of having a \\"toxic and destructive\\" culture, claiming that the firm promotes \\"morally bankrupt people\\" and that the bankers were ripping off their clients. In his book \\"Why I Left Goldman Sachs,\\" he states that he has not provided any concrete examples because he has changed \\"names or descriptors\\" for people and acknowledges that what he discloses is \\"from memory,\\" which makes it almost impossible to verify what he says. Critics argue that his book might actually strengthen Goldman's reputation as they say the claims made are not as bad as initially thought and the fact that Greg Smith stayed at Goldman Sachs for 12 years before sharing his concerns makes people question the credibility of his book."},{"instruction":"Read the below conversation.

Humphrey Metrodome for a Week 12 fight with the Minnesota Vikings. This game was noted for the return of head coach Green to Minnesota where he coached from 1992 to 2001. On the very first play of the first quarter, RB J.J. Arrington returned a kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown. The Vikings would respond with RB Chester Taylor's 1-yard TD run. In the second quarter, Cards kicker Neil Rackers gave Arizona a 21-yard and a 50-yard field goal for a decent lead. However, the Vikes took the lead with QB Brad Johnson's 17-yard TD pass to WR Marcus Robinson. In the third quarter, more of the Cardinals' year-long ineffectiveness showed as Johnson completed a 9-yard TD pass to WR Billy McMullen, while kicker Ryan Longwell nailed a 40-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Minnesota improved its lead on Johnson's 3-yard TD pass to FB Jeff Dugan. Afterwards, Arizona tried to fight back as Strong Safety Adrian Wilson returned a fumble 99 yards for a touchdown, yet it was followed up by a failed two-point conversion. Afterwards, QB Matt Leinart completed a 9-yard TD pass to WR Anquan Boldin. Afterwards, the Vikings wrapped up the game and won. With the loss, the Cardinals fell to 2-9.

He was the illegitimate son of infantry colonel Gonzalo Pizarro (1446-1522) and Francisca Gonzalez, a woman of poor means. His date of birth is uncertain, but it is believed to be sometime in the 1470s, probably 1474. Little attention was paid to his education and he grew up illiterate. On 10 November 1509, Pizarro sailed from Spain to the New World with Alonso de Ojeda on an expedition to Uraba. He sailed to Cartagena and joined the fleet of Martin Fernandez de Enciso and, in 1513, accompanied Balboa to the Pacific. In 1514, he found a supporter in Pedro Arias Davila, the Governor of Castilla de Oro and was rewarded for his role in the arrest of Balboa with the positions of mayor and magistrate in Panama City, serving from 1519 to 1523. Reports of Peru's riches and Cortes's success in Mexico tantalized Pizarro. He undertook two expeditions to conquer the Incan Empire in 1524 and in 1526. Both failed as a result of native hostilities, bad weather and lack of provisions. Pedro de los Rios, the Governor of Panama, made an effort to recall Pizarro, but the conquistador resisted and remained in the south. In April 1528, he reached northern Peru and found the natives rich with precious metals. This discovery gave Pizarro the motivation to plan a third expedition to conquer the area. He returned to Panama to make arrangements, but the Governor refused to grant permission for the project. Pizarro returned to Spain to appeal directly to King Charles I. His plea was successful and he received not only a license for the proposed expedition, but also authority over any lands conquered during the venture. He was joined by family and friends and the expedition left Panama in 1530. When hostile natives along the coast threatened the expedition, Pizarro moved inland and founded the first Spanish settlement in Peru, San Miguel de Piura. Atahualpa refused to tolerate a Spanish presence in his lands, but was captured by Pizarro during the Battle of Cajamarca on 16 November 1532. A ransom for the emperor's release was demanded and Atahualpa filled a room with gold, but Pizarro charged him with various crimes and executed him on 26 July 1533, overriding his associates who thought he was overstepping his authority. The same year, Pizarro entered the Inca capital of Cuzco and completed his conquest of Peru. In January 1535, Pizarro founded the city of Lima, a project he considered his greatest achievement. Quarrels between Pizarro and his longtime comrade-in-arms Diego Almagro culminated in the Battle of Las Salinas. Almagro was captured and executed and, on 26 June 1541, his embittered son, Diego de Almagro \\"el mozo\\", assassinated Pizarro in Lima. The conquistador of Peru was laid to rest in the Lima Cathedral. How long did he stay there?","output":"The article does not explicitly mention the specific duration of Pizarro's stay in particular locations. However, it can be inferred that he was present in the New World for several years as he embarked on multiple expeditions. Pizarro sailed from Spain to the New World on 10 November 1509 and was assassinated on 26 June 1541 in the city of Lima, which he had founded in January 1535. This suggests that he spent over three decades in the New World, with intermittent travels back to Spain for arrangements and appeals to the king."},{"instruction":"Two groups of friends went camping , but camped separately a few hundred yards away and started a fire each.

Celtic art is a difficult term to define, covering a huge expanse of time, geography and cultures. A case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the Bronze Age, and indeed the preceding Neolithic age; however archaeologists generally use \\"Celtic\\" to refer to the culture of the European Iron Age from around 1000 BC onwards, until the conquest by the Roman Empire of most of the territory concerned, and art historians typically begin to talk about \\"Celtic art\\" only from the La Tene period (broadly 5th to 1st centuries BC) onwards. Early Celtic art is another term used for this period, stretching in Britain to about 150 AD. The ancient peoples now called \\"Celts\\" spoke a group of languages that had a common origin in the Indo-European language known as Common Celtic or Proto-Celtic. This shared linguistic origin was once widely accepted by scholars to indicate peoples with a common genetic origin in southwest Europe, who had spread their culture by emigration and invasion. Archaeologists identified various cultural traits of these peoples, including styles of art, and traced the culture to the earlier Hallstatt culture and La Tene culture. More recent genetic studies have indicated that various Celtic groups do not all have shared ancestry, and have suggested a diffusion and spread of the culture without necessarily involving significant movement of peoples. The extent to which \\"Celtic\\" language, culture and genetics coincided and interacted during prehistoric periods remains very uncertain and controversial. Celtic art is associated with the peoples known as Celts; those who spoke the Celtic languages in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages. The term \\"Celt\\" was used in classical times as a synonym for the Gauls (Keltoi, Celtae). Its English form is modern, attested from 1607. In the late 17th century the work of scholars such as Edward Lhuyd brought academic attention to the historic links between Gaulish and the Brythonic--and Goidelic--speaking peoples, from which point the term was applied not just to continental Celts but those in Britain and Ireland. Then in the 18th century the interest in \\"primitivism\\", which led to the idea of the \\"noble savage\\", brought a wave of enthusiasm for all things Celtic and Druidic. The \\"Irish revival\\" came after the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829 as a conscious attempt to demonstrate an Irish national identity, and with its counterpart in other countries subsequently became the \\"Celtic Revival\\". Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in this article: 1. Artistic continuity: The fact that a case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the Bronze Age or even the Neolithic age shows that Celtic art has deep historical roots. 2. Celtic art in different periods: The distinction between early Celtic art (while the term \\"Celtic art\\" generally refers to the European Iron Age) and the La Tene period implies that the art form evolved over time. 3. Shared linguistic origin: The origin of Celts as a group of people who spoke a common language (Common Celtic or Proto-Celtic) highlights the importance of language in shaping cultural identity and artistic expression. 4. Debate over common genetic origin: The ongoing debate among scholars regarding the genetic origin of Celtic groups points at the complexity and diversity of Celtic cultures in Europe. 5. Connection between culture and genetics: The uncertainty surrounding the extent to which \\"Celtic\\" language, culture, and genetics coincided and interacted during prehistoric periods raises interesting questions about the formation of cultural identity in general. 6. The \\"Celtic Revival\\": The shift in attitude towards Celtic and Druidic art forms during the 18th and 19th century demonstrates the impact of historical and political events on the way we appreciate and rediscover cultural heritage. Overall, this article provides an insightful overview of Celtic art and raises thought-provoking questions about the links between language, culture, genetics, and artistic expression."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

In German-speaking countries the first so-called \\"Freikorps\\" \\"free regiments\\" were formed in the 18th century from native volunteers, enemy renegades and deserters, and criminals. These sometimes exotically equipped units served as infantry and cavalry or, more rarely, as artillery. Sometimes in just company strength, sometimes in formations up to several thousand strong, there were also various mixed formations or legions. The Prussian \\"von Kleist Freikorps\\" included infantry, jäger, dragoons and hussars. The French Volontaires de Saxe combined uhlans and dragoons. - Engelbert Dollfuss (; October 4, 1892 July 25, 1934) was an Austrian Christian Social and Patriotic Front statesman. Having served as Minister for Forests and Agriculture, he ascended to Federal Chancellor in 1932 in the midst of a crisis for the conservative government. In early 1933, he shut down parliament, banned the Austrian Nazi party and assumed dictatorial powers. Suppressing the Socialist movement in February 1934, he cemented the rule of austrofascism through the authoritarian \\"First of May Constitution\\". Dollfuss was assassinated as part of a failed coup attempt by Nazi agents in 1934. His successor Kurt Schuschnigg maintained the regime until Adolf Hitlers annexation of Austria in 1938. - Kurt Alois Josef Johann Schuschnigg (14 December 1897 18 November 1977) was Chancellor of the Federal State of Austria from the 1934 assassination of his predecessor Engelbert Dollfuss until the 1938 \\"Anschluss\\" with Nazi Germany. He was opposed to Hitler's ambitions to absorb Austria into the Third Reich. - Austrofascism was the authoritarian rule installed in Austria with the May Constitution of 1934, which ceased with the annexation of the newly founded Federal State of Austria into Nazi Germany in 1938. It was based on a ruling party, the Fatherland Front (\\"Vaterländische Front\\") and the Heimwehr (Home Guard) paramilitary militia. Leaders were Engelbert Dollfuss and, after Dollfuss's assassination, Kurt Schuschnigg, who were previously politicians of the Christian Social Party, which was quickly integrated into the new movement. - A paramilitary is a semi-militarized force whose organizational structure, tactics, training, subculture, and (often) function are similar to those of a professional military, but which is not included as part of a state's formal armed forces. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Hirtenberg is a town of approx. 2,500 inhabitants near Baden bei Wien in Lower Austria, Austria. The river Triesting is located at the south border of the town. Coming from the Vienna Woods, the valley of Triesting joins the Vienna Basin here. - The Heimwehr (\\"Home Guard\\") or sometimes Heimatschutz (\\"Homeland Protection\\") were a nationalist, initially paramilitary group operating within Austria during the 1920s and 1930s; they were similar in methods, organisation, and ideology to Germany's Freikorps. Although opposed to parliamentary democracy, the Heimwehr maintained a political wing known as the Heimatblock, which cooperated with Engelbert Dollfuss' conservative government. In 1936, the Heimwehr was absorbed into the Fatherland Front by decree of Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg and replaced by a militia supposedly less inclined towards uproar against the regime, the \\"Frontmiliz\\".

However, for Betty to have lost less weight than Angela, we would need a scenario where Angela had a more intensive approach to losing weight.

If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%. As Tim wrote in a previous blog post, this is reason why you should be eating your fruit, not drinking it What does the author probably think?

A:","output":"The author probably thinks that people should eat fruit in favor of drinking fruit.

Huawei, LG and Lenovo were at about 5% each, significantly better than 2012 figures, while others had about 40%, the same as the previous years figure. Only Apple lost market share, although their shipment volume still increased by 12.9 percent; the rest had significant increases in shipment volumes of 36 to 92 percent.

In Q1 2017, IDC reported that Samsung was first placed, with 80 million units, followed by Apple with 50.8 million, Huawei with 34.6 million, Oppo with 25.5 million and Vivo with 22.7 million. Ask a question about this article.","output":"Based on the provided information, the smartphone market has seen fluctuations in market share among major players from 2011 to 2017. Samsung and Apple are the dominant brands, capturing the largest portions of the worldwide footprint. But trends have waxed and waned, with differing success for these two industry giants, while other companies, such as Huawei, LG, Lenovo, Oppo, and Vivo, have individually captured smaller, yet not insignificant, slices of the market. Samsung commanded the highest shipment market share worldwide in 2011, a position it consistently held over the next few years. In 2012, its market share stood at 30.3%, rising slightly to 31.3% in 2013. There was a slight drop to a 31% share in Q1 2014, but by Q2 2016 it fell to 22.3%. Despite these fluctuations, Samsung remained a market leader, and in Q1 2017, it led the pack with 80 million units shipped. On the other hand, Apple saw both growth and decline during this period. Having a 15.3% market share in 2013, it lost ground from its 18.7% share in 2012. Despite this, its shipment volume still increased by 12.9%, demonstrating the iPhone's continuing popularity. In Q1 2014, Apple held a share of 16%, but by Q4 2014, its piece of the pie grew to 20.4%, outperforming Samsung's 19.9% share for that quarter. However, by Q2 2016, Apple saw another dip, now holding 12.9% of the market. By Q1 2017, though second to Samsung, Apple still managed to ship 50.8 million units. Huawei, LG, and Lenovo each maintained roughly 5% market share and showed noticeable improvement over their 2012 figures. In terms of shipment volumes, these companies experienced substantial growth between 36% to 92%. In Q1 2017, Huawei shipped 34.6 million units, making it the third largest player at that time. Newer entrants, Oppo and Vivo had also begun to make their mark by Q1 2017. Oppo shipped 25.5 million and Vivo 22.7 million units respectively, numbers that were significant and likely reflected their growing footprint in the global smartphone arena. Overall, the detailed information outlines the dynamic and competitive nature of the smartphone industry, with Samsung and Apple leading the pack, while other players such as Huawei, LG, Lenovo, Oppo, and Vivo increase their presence. This data suggests that while market shares can fluctuate, the shipment volumes, particularly those of Apple, can still demonstrate growth. This shows that even when market share decreases, it does not necessarily correlate to a decrease in consumer demand or overall success. The market is continually evolving with new players making significant strides in their shipment volumes, signaling a robust and competitive industry landscape."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Bacteria are a form of dangerous bugs that can contaminate food and cause illness in people. Reducing the presence of harmful bacteria in food is critical to ensuring the safety and well-being of individuals who consume it. Many foodborne illnesses are caused by the consumption of contaminated food, which may harbor pathogenic bacteria, viruses, parasites, or toxins produced by these microorganisms. There are several methods to reduce dangerous bugs in food, including proper food handling, storage, and preparation techniques. Here are some key strategies for minimizing the risk of foodborne illness: 1. Maintain proper hygiene: Washing hands before handling food, using clean utensils and cutting boards, and preventing cross-contamination between raw and cooked foods can significantly reduce the risk of bacterial contamination. 2. Cook food thoroughly: Cooking food at the appropriate temperatures can help eliminate harmful bacteria and other dangerous bugs. The recommended minimum internal temperature for various types of food include: - 165°F (74°C) for poultry and leftovers - 160°F (71°C) for ground meats and egg dishes - 145°F (63°C) for whole cuts of beef, pork, veal, and lamb - 145°F (63°C) for fish 3. Store food correctly: Proper food storage can also prevent the growth of dangerous bugs. Perishable food should be refrigerated or frozen within 2 hours of being cooked or purchased. Keep the refrigerator temperature at 40°F (4°C) or below and the freezer temperature at 0°F (-18°C) or below. 4. Handle raw ingredients carefully: Avoid cross-contamination by keeping raw meats, poultry, and seafood separate from ready-to-eat foods. Use separate cutting boards and utensils for raw and cooked foods. 5. Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly: Rinse fresh fruits and vegetables under running water before consuming, cutting, or cooking them to remove any surface bacteria or other contaminants. 6. Be cautious with high-risk foods: Foods such as raw eggs, unpasteurized milk, and raw shellfish can carry higher risks of bacterial contamination. Only consume these products if they have been properly handled and prepared. By following these food safety practices and reducing the presence of dangerous bugs in food, the risk of illness in people can be significantly minimized, promoting overall health and well-being."},{"instruction":"Does \\"In an otherwise positive, but overall less enthusiastic review, IGN's Chris Tilly considered Spectre \\"solid if unspectacular\\", and gave the film a 7.2 score (out of a possible 10), saying that \\"the film falls frustratingly short of greatness.\\"\\" contain the correct answer to \\"How many stars did Mark Kermode of the Guardian aware Spectre prior to its release?\\"","output":"No, this statement does not provide information about how many stars Mark Kermode of the Guardian gave to Spectre before its release.

Meanwhile, her brother Simon, a brilliant doctor with a deep connection to River, becomes increasingly desperate to find her. He cannot bear the thought of her being subject to brutal experimentation any longer. Suspecting government involvement in River's disappearance, Simon delves into the dark underbelly of the city to seek answers. During his dangerous journey, Simon allies with a group of rebels, known as the Serenity Crew. The Serenity Crew opposes the oppressive government and has been secretly working on a plan to dismantle its control. They decide to aid Simon in his quest to save River, as they believe her abilities could help them achieve their own goal. Simon and the Serenity Crew infiltrate the highly guarded facility, fighting off government agents and cybernetic enforcers. They finally manage to locate River's cell, where she is barely holding on to her sanity after enduring relentless experimentation.

The fossils in the lower levels show shorter bones than those in the upper-level fossils. Which conclusion is based on the geologist's observations?","output":"Based on the geologist's observations of horse bone fossils in different rock layers of a canyon, the conclusion that can be drawn is that there has been an evolutionary change in the size and structure of horse bones over time. The horse fossils in the lower rock layers, which indicate a more ancient timeframe, have shorter bones compared to the fossils found in the upper rock layers, which are from a more recent timeframe. This suggests that horses have experienced morphological changes and, most likely, have gradually increased in size through generations. There could be several reasons for this evolutionary change in horse size. One possible explanation is environmental adaptation. Over long periods of time, horses might have migrated or been subjected to different environments that favored larger body sizes. In changing environments, food sources and predators could have exerted selective pressures that favored attributes of larger horses. Bigger horses could have thrived in those conditions and had a better chance to survive, reproduce, and pass on their genetic traits to future generations, thus contributing to the evolutionary change observed in the fossils. Another possibility is genetic drift and sexual selection. Genetic drift refers to random variations and alterations in gene frequencies that could lead to evolutionary changes as only specific individuals' traits are passed on to the subsequent generations. Additionally, sexual selection, which is a component of natural selection, might have also played a part in the changes observed in horse size. In this scenario, larger horses with longer bones could have been more successful in finding mates and reproducing, thereby passing on their genes to future generations. Moreover, it is essential to consider the possibility of convergent evolution, where unrelated species independently develop similar traits as a response to similarities in their environments or survival needs. However, since the fossils in question all belong to horses, this is not likely to be the primary cause of the observed changes in bone size. To summarize, the conclusion that can be drawn from the geologist's observations is that the horse's evolutionary history has included changes in size and structure, with horses becoming larger over time. This enlargement was likely a response to adaptive pressures such as changing environments and could have been driven by various evolutionary mechanisms such as environmental adaptation, genetic drift, and sexual selection."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the following text. Jason hated watching football but Aaron loved it because","output":"he had grown up in a family where football was more than just a sport; it was a tradition, a shared passion that had been passed down through generations. Aaron's father had been a local football hero in his younger days, and his grandfather had been a passionate supporter of their hometown team. Jason, on the other hand, had been brought up in a family that showed no interest in the sport. Growing up, Aaron's weekends were centered around football games. He would sit with his father and grandfather, discussing players, tactics, and team history. Those were some of his favorite memories, filled with laughter, passion, and bonding over their shared love for the game. Aaron also enjoyed playing football with his friends at school, racing down the field with the ball at his feet, the wind in his face, and the crowd cheering him on. It made him feel alive and connected with his teammates. Jason, however, had always found football dull. He couldn't understand the excitement his friends felt when they watched the matches. The endless banter about the players, the teams, the leagues – it all sounded like noise to him. He couldn't see the fascination in watching a bunch of people running around, kicking a ball into a net. Instead, Jason had spent his time exploring other interests – books, music, and art had been his passions. At college, Jason and Aaron had become roommates. Through their years of living together, they had grown to be good friends, despite their differences. One of the things that brought them together was their shared love for pizza and weekend movie nights. But when football season came around, tensions would inevitably rise between them. Aaron would have his friends over to watch the games, transforming their living room into a sea of passionate, cheering fans. Jason would often retreat to his room, putting on his headphones and immersing himself in his favorite playlists to drown out the noise. Aaron couldn't help but feel a little hurt by his friend's disinterest in his favorite pastime. One day, Aaron decided to sit down with Jason and try to share his perspective on the game. He pointed out the camaraderie among the players and fans, the physical and mental discipline needed to perform at a high level, and the emotional thrill of victory. He also shared the personal stories of some of the players, highlighting their backgrounds and obstacle-ridden paths to success. To Aaron's surprise, Jason began to show a glimmer of interest in the sport. While he still couldn't fully appreciate the excitement that came with every goal or close match, he began to understand the human aspect of the game. He even found himself joining the group occasionally during the televised matches, sharing their snacks, and asking questions about the sport. Jason started appreciating Aaron's love for football and gave it a chance, albeit reluctantly. Over time, the two friends learned to embrace and respect each other's interests, and in the process, their friendship only deepened. They realized that even though their tastes and passions might be different, what truly mattered was the mutual respect, understanding, and support they offered each other. And so, while Jason only mildly enjoyed watching football, he loved the bond he shared with Aaron. And that was something he would never trade for anything else. Together, they learned that friendship was about acceptance, patience, and nurturing each other's strengths. And in their unique way, football had become an essential part of their bond, showing them the beauty in difference, and that everyone's passions deserved recognition and understanding."},{"instruction":"The jungle is dark and lonely with tall trees everywhere .

The papers, retrieved from bank vaults where they have sat untouched and unread for decades, could shed new light on one of literature's darkest figures. In the past week, the pages have been pulled from safety deposit boxes in Tel Aviv and Zurich, Switzerland, on the order of an Israeli court over the objections of two elderly women who claim to have inherited them from their mother. \\"Kafka could easily have written a story like this, where you try to do something and it all goes wrong and everything remains unresolved,\\" said Sara Loeb, a Tel Aviv-based author of two books about the writer. \\"It's really a case of life imitating art.\\" Literary experts in both cities are sifting through the boxes, and the contents are expected to be of priceless literary and monetary value. What exactly is there remains unknown, but the papers include handwritten manuscripts, letters and various literary works by the famed Jewish writer, said Meir Heller, an attorney for the Israeli National Library, which also claims ownership of the trove. Loeb says the cache could include endings to some of Kafka's major works, many of which remained unfinished in his lifetime. \\"We could find out about his methods, his style, how his art was created, how he built a text,\\" she said. Kafka, a Prague native who wrote in German, was one of the most influential writers of the 20th century, known for his surreal tales of everyman protagonists crushed by mysterious authorities or twisted by unknown shames. His works have become classics, like \\"The Metamorphosis,\\" in which a salesman wakes up transformed into a giant insect, and \\"The Trial,\\" where a bank clerk is put through an excruciating trial without ever being told the charges against him. But the newly emerged writings won't see the light of day until the Israeli court unravels the tangled question of the collection's rightful owner. The case boils down to the interpretation of the will of Max Brod, Kafka's longtime friend and publisher. Kafka bequeathed his writings to Brod shortly before his own death from tuberculosis in 1924, instructing his friend to burn everything unread. Brod ignored Kafka's wishes and published most of what was in his possession, including the novels \\"The Trial,\\" \\"The Castle\\" and \\"Amerika.\\" But Brod, who smuggled some of the manuscripts to pre-state Israel when he fled the Nazis in 1938, didn't publish everything. Upon his death in 1968, Brod left his personal secretary, Esther Hoffe, in charge of his literary estate and instructed her to transfer the Kafka papers to an academic institution. Instead, for the next four decades, Hoffe kept the papers in her Tel Aviv apartment and in safety deposit boxes in Tel Aviv and Zurich banks. She sold some of the items for hefty sums. In 1988, for instance, Hoffe auctioned off the original manuscript of \\"The Trial\\" at Sotheby's in London. It went for 1.8 million to the German Literature Archive in Marbach, north of Stuttgart. When Hoffe died three years ago at age 101, she left the collection to her two daughters, Eva Hoffe and Ruth Wiesler, both Holocaust survivors like herself. But the Israeli National Library has long claimed the papers, saying Brod intended for the collection to end up in its hands. It filed an injunction against the execution of Hoffe's will. \\"As long as Esther Hoffe was alive, she was responsible, she could still say, 'I am handling it,'\\" said Heller, the library's lawyer. \\"The late Mrs. Hoffe did not do what the late Mr. Brod asked her to do and deposit the documents in the national library. ... The will was not honored, it was desecrated.\\" Oded Hacohen, a lawyer for Eva Hoffe, said Brod's will gave the collection to her mother as a gift and gave her the right to bequeath it to the Israel National Museum or any institution of her choosing, in Israel or abroad, under whatever conditions she decides. He cited a 1974 Tel Aviv District Court ruling backing that interpretation and quoting Brod's will. That means, he said, Eva Hoffe inherited the documents legally and is free to do with them as she pleases, including selling them to the German Literature Archive, which has been negotiating with her to buy the remaining Kafka and Brod papers. \\"Esther Hoffe dedicated her life to publishing Brod's works. ... Brod wrote in his will that her family should enjoy the profits,\\" Hacohen said. Heller retorts that the will only refers to royalties, not ownership, and didn't give Esther Hoffe the right to hand the collection to her heirs. He argued in court that since she failed to pick an archive to receive the documents, the court should do so. Heller contended in court that the Israeli National Library was Brod's first preference, saying he had evidence Brod wrote a later will bequeathing his literary estate directly to it. The Tel Aviv Family Court ordered the collection opened a year ago, saying it wants to know what is there before deciding who owns it. That ruling won't come until experts are done inspecting the papers, which could take several weeks. \\"The library does not intend to give up the cultural assets that legally belong to it and thus to the Israeli and Jewish people,\\" said David Blumberg, chairman of the Israel National Library, which is a nonprofit and non-governmental body. Ulrich von Buelow, the director of manuscripts at the German Literary Archive, said Brod and Esther Hoffe had frequent discussions with the archive over placing the material there. \\"We are interested in having the manuscripts because we have so many others, also from Brod, and so many letters that would complement them,\\" von Buelow said. Whatever they contain, the piles of handwritten material will keep historians and researchers busy for years, Heller said. Aside from previously unknown versions of Kafka's work, the trove could give more insight on Kafka's personal life, including his relationship with his lover, Dora Diamant. It may include papers that Kafka gave to Diamant but were stolen by the German Gestapo from her Berlin apartment in 1933, later obtained by Brod after World War II. Loeb suspected that Brod kept many of the documents away from the public for fear their publication could compromise his friend's legacy. \\"Kafka was very critical. He was not an easy man,\\" she said. \\"Maybe Brod was worried that this could ruin his image.\\" Associated Press writers Melissa Eddy in Berlin and Bradley Klapper in Geneva contributed to this report.

All rights reserved. ||||| The Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which was involved in the legal challenge to lift the secrecy surrounding the privately-held archive, disclosed the existence of the short story on its website. The discovery emerged as an Israeli court rejected an application to keep secret the contents of a vast collection of Kafka's writings that has been buried in the vaults of three banks in Israel and Switzerland for over 40 years. The news will cause enormous excitement in the literary world. Although his longer novel The Trial gave the world the adjective Kafkaesque, it is his short stories that are perhaps best known to the reading public. His most memorable short story was probably The Metamorphosis, whose unfortunate hero, Gregor Samsa, wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into \\"a monstrous insect\\". The ruling came after a group of lawyers and scholars, acting on the instructions of Israel's supreme court, began opening some of the 10 safety deposit boxes containing the collection last week. There had been fears that the archive, which is also believed to contain letters, diaries and drawings, would remain hidden from wider view after two sisters who claim ownership of the collection filed an injunction to keep its contents secret. Eva Hoffe and Ruth Wiesler, both in their seventies, have been at the centre of a legal wrangle over the Kafka papers since they inherited the collection two years ago from their mother Ester, who was the secretary of Kafka's great friend, Max Brod. Ester Hoffe kept the contents of the papers secret since she came into possession of them in 1968. Talia Pardo, a judge in the Tel Aviv district court, rejected the secrecy application made by the two sisters and ordered them to pay costs. The court is now expected to rule on the legitimacy of their inheritance. Israel's state-owned national library has insisted that it should be granted custodianship of the papers on the grounds that they represent an important piece of Jewish heritage. Kafka died of tuberculosis in 1924. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article is as follows: Ten safety deposit boxes containing unpublished writings by Franz Kafka have resurfaced, having been untouched and unread for decades.

The Pyramid of Neferirkare (in ancient Egyptian the Ba of Neferirkare) was built for the Fifth Dynasty pharaoh Neferirkare Kakai – referred to as Neferirkare – in the 25th century BC. It was the tallest structure located on the highest site at the necropolis of Abusir – found between Giza and Saqqara – and still towers over the necropolis today. The pyramid is also significant because its evacuation led to the discovery of the Abusir papyri. The Fifth Dynasty marked the end of the great pyramid constructions during the Old Kingdom. Pyramids of the era were smaller and becoming more standardized, though intricate relief decoration also proliferated. Neferirkare's pyramid deviated from convention as it was originally built as a step pyramid: a design that had been antiquated after the Third Dynasty (26th or 27th century BC). This was then encased in a second step pyramid with alterations intended to convert it into a true pyramid; however, the pharaoh's death left the work to be completed by his successors. The remaining works were completed in haste, using cheaper building material. Because of the circumstances, Neferirkare's monument lacked several basic elements of a pyramid complex: a valley temple, a causeway, and a cult pyramid. Instead, these were replaced by a small settlement of mudbrick houses south of the monument from where cult priests could conduct their daily activities, rather than the usual pyramid town near the valley temple. The discovery of the Abusir papyri in the 1890s is owed to this. Normally, the papyrus archives would have been contained in the pyramid town where their destruction would have been assured. The pyramid became part of a greater family cemetery. The monuments to Neferirkare's consort, Khentkaus II; and his sons, Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini, are found in the surrounds. Though their construction began under different rulers, all four of these monuments were completed during the reign of Nyuserre.

A stream or river must occur: Less pressure on rocks in this step will not directly impact the formation of a stream or river, as this depends more on factors like precipitation, water runoff, and topography. Therefore, it is not impacting this step of the process. 2. Through erosion, the stream cuts into the soil and bedrock: Less pressure on rocks can indirectly impact this step. With less force exerted on rocks and bedrock, there may be a reduced rate of erosion. This may slow down the process of cutting into the soil and bedrock, but it does not completely halt the process. Therefore, less pressure on rocks is indirectly impacting this step of the process. 3. Through continuous erosion, a deep gash is cut through: Similar to the previous step, less pressure on rocks can indirectly impact the continuous erosion, as it may reduce the speed at which the deep gash is cut through. However, erosion will still occur over time and a deep gash will eventually be formed. Thus, less pressure on rocks is indirectly impacting this step of the process. 4. After many years, the river may dry up: This step is not directly impacted by less pressure on rocks. The river drying up depends more on factors such as climate change and water supply. Less pressure on rocks does not directly affect these factors, so it is not impacting this step of the process. 5. A dry ravine is left: Less pressure on rocks will not directly impact the formation of a dry ravine. A dry ravine is formed after a river has eroded a deep gash and subsequently dried up. Therefore, less pressure on rocks is not impacting this step of the process. In conclusion, less pressure on rocks in this scenario is indirectly impacting steps 2 and 3 of the process, which involve erosion and the formation of a deep gash.

When these particles are inhaled, they can deposit along the respiratory tract, including in the bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. This can cause inflammation and damage to the lung tissues, thereby reducing the effectiveness of oxygen exchange between the alveoli and the surrounding blood vessels. 2. Reduced oxygen concentration: Air pollution can also lower the overall concentration of oxygen in the air. If the amount of oxygen available for inhalation is reduced, then a smaller amount of oxygen will be absorbed by the small blood vessels, even if the lungs are functioning optimally. 3. Reactive gases and chemicals: Heavy air pollution may also include high levels of reactive gases, such as ozone and nitrogen dioxide. These gases can react with and damage lung tissues, making it harder for oxygen to pass through the alveolar walls and into the surrounding blood vessels. Indirect Effects: 1. Chronic respiratory conditions: Prolonged exposure to heavy air pollution can increase the risk of developing chronic respiratory conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer. These conditions can significantly impair lung function over time, leading to reduced oxygen delivery to the blood. 2. Overburdened immune system: The immune system is partly responsible for clearing pollutants from the lungs. However, heavy air pollution can overburden the immune system, leading to a decline in its ability to function effectively. As a result, lung tissues can become more susceptible to infection, which could further impair the ability of the lungs to deliver oxygen to the blood. 3. Cardiovascular effects: Air pollution has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which can lead to reduced blood flow and decreased oxygen delivery to cells throughout the body. This could exacerbate the effects of reduced oxygenation caused by lung damage from air pollution. In summary, heavy air pollution can directly and indirectly affect the process of oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. In addition to the physical barriers caused by particle deposition and reactive gases, chronic exposure can lead to the development of respiratory conditions, burden the immune system, and contribute to cardiovascular disease. These factors contribute to a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream when faced with heavy air pollution."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"MRSA is a bacteria known for its resistance to antibiotics, these kinds of bacteria are commonly categorized as?\\" Context: \\"Possible improvements include clarification of clinical trial regulations by FDA. Furthermore, appropriate economic incentives could persuade pharmaceutical companies to invest in this endeavor. Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment (ADAPT) Act aims to fast track the drug development to combat the growing threat of 'superbugs'. Under this Act, FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals treating life-threatening infections based on smaller clinical trials. The CDC will monitor the use of antibiotics and the emerging resistance, and publish the data. The FDA antibiotics labeling process, 'Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microbial Organisms' or 'breakpoints', will provide accurate data to healthcare professionals. According to Allan Coukell, senior director for health programs at The Pew Charitable Trusts, \\"By allowing drug developers to rely on smaller datasets, and clarifying FDA's authority to tolerate a higher level of uncertainty for these drugs when making a risk/benefit calculation, ADAPT would make the clinical trials more feasible.\\"\\" Answer: A:","output":"MRSA, or Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, is a type of bacteria known for its resistance to antibiotics. Such bacteria are commonly categorized as \\"superbugs\\" or \\"antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\\" The growing prevalence of these resistant bacteria has raised concerns among healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers due to the challenges they pose to public health. In the context provided, several improvements and initiatives could potentially address the increasing threat of superbugs like MRSA. The Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment (ADAPT) Act is one such initiative, which aims to expedite drug development in response to the growing presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Act supports the approval of antibiotics and antifungal medications used to treat life-threatening infections based on smaller clinical trials, effectively speeding up the drug approval process. This approach to drug development can provide crucial new treatment options for patients suffering from infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Furthermore, appropriate economic incentives could encourage pharmaceutical companies to invest in the research and development of new antibiotics to combat superbugs. By offering financial benefits to companies willing to engage in this vital work, the likelihood of discovering novel antibiotic treatments increases. Additionally, improving the current clinical trial regulations and labeling processes overseen by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) can play a crucial role in combating antibiotic resistance. The FDA's antibiotics labeling process, known as \\"Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microbial Organisms\\" or \\"breakpoints,\\" provides essential data for healthcare professionals. By allowing drug developers to rely on smaller datasets and clarifying the FDA's authority to tolerate a higher level of uncertainty for these drugs during risk/benefit assessments, as suggested by Allan Coukell of The Pew Charitable Trusts, clinical trials become more feasible and efficient. Moreover, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will monitor the usage of antibiotics and the emergence of antibiotic resistance. By collecting and publishing this information, the CDC can help healthcare professionals and policymakers better understand the extent of the problem and guide research efforts. In summary, MRSA is a type of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, commonly referred to as a \\"superbug.\\" Tackling this growing public health concern requires a multifaceted approach, including streamlined clinical trial regulations, economic incentives for pharmaceutical companies, improvements in the FDA's antibiotics labeling process, and consistent monitoring and reporting by the CDC. These efforts, as highlighted in the context of the ADAPT Act, can contribute significantly to the development of new antibiotic treatments and the fight against antibiotic-resistant bacteria."},{"instruction":"If \\"Young children playing homemade instruments.\\", does it logically follow that \\"The kids are playing instruments\\"?","output":"Yes, sweetie!

Officer Peter Liang was arraigned Wednesday in Brooklyn Supreme Court for \\"recklessly\\" causing the death of Akai Gurley, according to court documents. In addition to the manslaughter charge, Liang faces one count of criminally negligent homicide, one count of second-degree assault, one count of reckless endangerment and two counts of official misconduct. He was released without bail. If Liang were convicted on the charge of second-degree manslaughter, he could face up to 15 years in prison. \\"The defendant ignored his training\\" when he used his firearm, lead prosecutor Marc Fliedner told the court. The defendant also did not try to help Gurley, instead retreating to a hallway and telling a fellow officer \\"I'm going to get fired,\\" Fliedner said. The prosecution will prove Liang made a \\"deliberate motion\\" with his firearm, he added. CNN tried to get a comment after court from defense attorney Stephen Worth but was unsuccessful. Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson thanked Fliedner and others \\"who worked so hard on this case so that the judicial process could be conducted fairly.\\" Thompson also thanked NYPD officers for their assistance. It was important to \\"recognize the courage and valor\\" that many officers showed when they responded to the scene, he said. Several officers tried to stop Gurley's bleeding. Prosecutors don't believe Liang intentionally killed Gurley, the DA said, but he had his finger on the trigger and an innocent man was killed. Gurley, 28, was \\"a total innocent who just happened\\" to run into Liang in a \\"pitch black\\" stairwell at the Louis H. Pink Houses in Brooklyn, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton told reporters the day after the killing. At the time, the NYPD said the fatal shot was an \\"accidental discharge.\\" Liang, with less than 18 months on the job and on probationary status, had been placed on modified assignment and stripped of his gun and badge pending an investigation. \\"This officer deserves the same due process afforded to anyone involved in the accidental death of another,\\" Patrick Lynch, head of the police union, said in a Tuesday statement. \\"The fact that he was assigned to patrol one of the most dangerous housing projects in New York City must be considered among the circumstances of this tragic accident.\\" Liang and his partner were part of a \\"violence reduction overtime detail\\" at the Pink Houses, where a spate of serious crimes have been reported in recent months, including two robberies and four assaults, Bratton told reporters after the shooting. The officers had taken an elevator to the building's top floor to check on the roof and were taking the stairs down from the 8th floor, Bratton said, when the officer fired his weapon. There were no lights in the stairwell leading up to the roof. Liang drew a flashlight and his weapon \\"for safety reasons,\\" the police commissioner said. The other officer did not draw his gun. In the darkened stairwell, Liang's gun discharged about the same time that Gurley, the father of a 2-year-old child, and his girlfriend were entering the seventh-floor landing, Bratton said. Shot once in the chest, Gurley died at a hospital. The lights on the seventh and eighth floors were not working, Bratton said. The police commissioner said the decision on when to draw a weapon is the discretion of officers \\"based on what they are encountering or believe they may encounter. So there is not a specific prohibition against taking a firearm out. But again, as in all cases, an officer would have to justify the circumstances that required him to or resulted in unholstering his firearm.\\" The shooting also is being investigated by police internal affairs. Gurley's shooting occurred at a time of strained police-community relations after the July death of Eric Garner at the hands of police on Staten Island. The chokehold death of the unarmed 43-year-old man sparked street protests, a review of police procedures and calls for a federal civil rights investigation. A grand jury declined to prosecute the officer. A few weeks after Garner's death, the police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, of unarmed teenager Michael Brown thrust into the forefront the issue of law enforcement's use of deadly force. A grand jury declined to prosecute Officer Darren Wilson, a decision that led to national demonstrations.","output":"1.

When an apparent terrorist hijack attempt blows a hole in the (Boeing 747) airliner, Terry is sucked out to his death, and the terrorists parachute out of the same hole, taking Leedy with them. Ex-DEA agent and renegade skydiver Ty Moncrief (Gary Busey) is the mastermind behind the attack, which culminated in the first ever parachute jump from a commercial jet at 30,000 feet. Ty plans to use Leedy to hack into the DEA mainframe computer in Washington DC so Ty can auction off the names of undercover agents to drug cartels worldwide. Ty has scheduled this to be accomplished during an Independence Day parachute exhibition and fireworks display, which is the one day every year when security is loosened around the airspace above Washington DC. Pete believes that the assault may have been an elaborate prison break meant to free Leedy. However, the FBI declares that sneaking a parachute through airport security is impossible, and that parachuting at the jet's altitude and speed is not survivable. A devastated Pete is blamed for overreacting to the incident, and forced to turn in his badge. Undeterred, Pete consults a U.S. Navy High-altitude military parachuting instructor who confirms that he and his team have parachuted from that height and speed, but also states that the high-density metal rings in the parachutes would not pass airport metal detectors and that the operation required either rare skills or suicidal recklessness. The instructor believes the world class skydiver Dominic Jagger (Luca Bercovici) could perform the jump, but does not know his current whereabouts. Pete is instead referred to Jagger's reckless ex-wife, ex-con Jessie Crossman (Yancy Butler) - who is unaware that Jagger is part of Ty's crew.

At this point, Pete Nessip, the U.S. Marshal played by Wesley Snipes, and Jessie Crossman, the skilled skydiver played by Yancy Butler, are determined to stop Ty and his team from carrying out their plan. While in mid-air, Pete and Ty engage in a high-stakes skydiving battle. In the midst of their fight, Pete manages to snatch the disk containing the undercover agents' names from Ty. Then, in a desperate attempt to kill Pete, Ty tries to shoot him with a pistol, but Pete successfully kicks the weapon away. The two continue to fight while free-falling through the sky. As they near the ground, Pete manages to deploy his parachute, but Ty struggles with his own chute, which Pete had damaged during their struggle. Finally, Ty manages to deploy a reserve chute, but it is too late. The chute only partially opens, and Ty's descent is not slowed enough to prevent him from hitting the ground at a fatal speed. Ty Moncrief's death is a result of a combination of his intense mid-air battle with Pete, the damage to his primary parachute, his inability to properly deploy his reserve chute in time, and ultimately, the impact of his high-speed collision with the ground."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I was once distinctly unsettled by a utility man who called to read the gas meter. We were living in an old house at the time and I was home alone with the youngest child (who was around six months old), balanced on my hip as I opened the door. The visitor looked genuine, dressed in the expected uniform. He was around 6.3 and probably not the most tidily presented utility man I'd met, but I believed him to be genuine and willingly invited him in out of the foul weather. It was pouring down outside, a freezing cold winter's day.

Question: What does Muriel's mother write? Movie plot title: Muriel's Wedding Movie plot: Muriel Heslop (Toni Collette) is a high school dropout with no job, no prospects and no boyfriend. She uses fantasies of her wedding as a coping mechanism and also strongly matches the diagnostic criteria for a cluster-b personality disorder (possibly Borderline Personality Disorder or Histrionic Personality Disorder). In high School she was shy and socially awkward, but managed somehow to have the \\"in group\\" accept her hanging around them. Muriel attends the wedding of one her high school associates in an inappropriate leopard print dress. After witnessing the groom having sex with one of the bridesmaids, Muriel is arrested because by some strange coincidence the store detective from where she shop-lifted was also at the wedding.After this episode, her former friends (Tania, Nicole and Janine) shun Muriel because they see her as an overweight, directionless no-hoper, while continuing to plan a holiday to Hibiscus Island. Muriel's chain-smoking, unambitious, slovenly family is routinely abused and vilified by their father - the corrupt local politician Bill Heslop (Bill Hunter). Frustrated with his family's lack of ambition or drive he has turned into a tyrant.While at dinner with some property developers, Heslop runs into his mistress who has done well in a cosmetics pyramid marketing scheme who recruits Muriel into the scheme. The following day Muriel's mother writes a blank cheque to cash intending for the money to let Muriel buy into the scheme. Escalating from petty theft, Muriel uses the blank cheque to defraud her parents, draining their bank account of 12,000. Muriel uses this money to stalk her former friends on Hibiscus Island.While on the Island, Muriel's former friends confront her over her stalking, requesting that she leave them alone.

You aggressively talk to people, give out your cards, call endlessly to schedule an appointment but have no real success from your efforts. To help you gain a different future, here are ten habits you should avoid. Ineffective networkers: 1. Lack patience. They expect immediate results and want business now, not tomorrow. 2. Constantly \\"selling\\" something. They see dollar signs every time they shake hands with someone. 3. Too many choices. If they offer a variety of products, they might try too hard to tell about all of them. Offering too much information sends a confusing message making it difficult for people to send referral . Opportunities are all around us but when you're networking, only focus on one. 4. Change positions too often. If they move from company to company or do something totally different, it might be difficult for people to keep up with them. 5. Lack manners and respect. They interrupt others, talk with food in their mouth, aren't very polite and appear unprofessional. They call people during dinner or on the weekends without thinking whether the occasion is suitable. 6. Distribute too many cards and sales literature. They come while loading with brochures, flyers , catalogues and samples. 7. Focus on themselves. Too much self promotion can leave the other person to feel unappreciated. Every sentence begins with \\"I\\" and is all about their business. 8. \\"Talking\\" instead of \\"giving\\". They don't realize what other people sense when they are being very selfish. Others may think that they are being taken advantage of. 9. Lack authenticity and personal values. They may create unrealistic expectations and not deliver on their promises. Sometimes doing things without integrity possibly twists the truth. 10. Poor communication and interpersonal skills. They have trouble speaking effectively, building relationships and following up. Networking is a process that is an investment of time and money. If you find you're doing any of these habits, consider learning how to improve on these and maximize your results while networking. You'll start to get better at connecting with people and obtain more referrals. Question: This passage is meant for people who _ .

Possible A: work, industrial complex, city, new york, suburbia Why is \\"city\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"The answer \\"city\\" is aligned with human common sense because cities are known to be densely populated urban centers with significant business and economic activities. The development of office buildings is primarily driven by the need for businesses to have a centralized location to operate, collaborate, and provide services to their clients and customers. It is within cities that businesses can easily connect with their target market and take advantage of the numerous resources and opportunities available. Thus, office buildings are mainly found within cities due to their strategic value and high demand for services. Moreover, cities offer multiple benefits to businesses in terms of infrastructure, transportation, networking opportunities, and access to a skilled workforce. As these elements are essential for the growth of businesses and industries, companies often choose to set up their offices in cities to leverage these advantages. This subsequently encourages the construction of multiple office buildings to cater to the increasing demand. In addition, the presence of financial institutions, government agencies, and other key services makes cities an attractive location for office buildings. Furthermore, cities have historically been centers of commerce and innovation, as they provide an environment conducive to the exchange of ideas and collaboration. The availability of an educated labor force and access to resources help attract businesses to establish their offices in cities. As a result, it is common to see clusters of office buildings within cities where businesses have gathered to capitalize on the opportunities present. In conclusion, \\"city\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in the context of where one is likely to see more than one office building, as cities are characterized by dense urban environments with significant business and economic activities that drive the establishment of office buildings. The strategic value, availability of resources, networking opportunities, and historical significance of cities as centers of commerce and innovation support the presence of multiple office buildings in such locations."},{"instruction":"Math problem: Solve -4*g + 28 = 12 for g.

Hint: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth.

One of the burglars, a beautiful young woman named Morgana Truscott (Holly Fields), steals the gem and is forced to abandon her partner during the escape. The Djinn escapes and kills the remaining burglar when he accidentally wishes he'd never been born. As the police enter the museum, the demon finishes forming into full size, revealing the Djinn (Andrew Divoff). The Djinn surrenders to the police and is led away. That evening, Morgana is shown sleeping very restlessly, her left arm dangling over the edge of the bed. In the meantime, Demarest is in a holding cell waiting to be transferred to prison, where he kills a fellow prisoner. In her dreams, she sees glimpses of the Djinn in his true form.

When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states. and the situation: Jennifer is looking to move to a new city.

Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met.

Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program. North Korea denounced South Korea, as well, for the joint military drills, calling the Seoul government... Question: How does Kim Jong Un feel about being denuclearized the way Libya was?
