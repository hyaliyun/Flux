Consider a sequence of natural numbers: 1, 2^{10}, 2^{18}, 2^{24}, 2^{26}, 2^{26}, 2^{24}, 2^{18}, 2^{10}, 1. 2.

This leads to: [ frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} < 1 ] for sufficiently large n, implying that a_{n+1} < a_n when n is large, indicating that the sequence decreases.  Since we are dealing with natural numbers, a strictly decreasing infinite sequence of natural numbers is not possible (as it must eventually reach a number less than 1, which is not a natural number). **Conclusion for part (b):** No, the sequence cannot be infinite.

We'll use the problem's notation and address the inversion with respect to this circle.    Let S_{mathrm{a}} be the circle passing through points A, B, and C such that S_{mathrm{a}} is the isodynamic circle of triangle ABC. 2. **Orthogonality Condition:**    To show that under inversion with respect to the circumcircle, the isodynamic centers transform into each other, it suffices to prove that the circumcircle is orthogonal to S_{mathrm{a}}. When two circles are orthogonal, under inversion with respect to one, the other transforms into itself. 3. **Inversion Properties:**    - Under inversion with respect to S, a point on the circle remains invariant.    - Define the isodynamic centers I_s and I_s': Inversion maps I_s to I_s' and vice versa given these centers lie on S_{mathrm{a}}. 4. **Orthogonality Proof Between Curcles:**    - When examining S_{mathrm{a}} and its orthogonality with S, note it is relevant to prove that any point on S_{mathrm{a}} is mapped to itself under inversion. 5. **Verification for Points on S_{mathrm{a}}:**    - Since A, B, and C all lie on S_{mathrm{a}}, under inversion with respect to S, A maps to itself by definition of inversion.    - Hence, if S_{mathrm{a}} orthogonally intersects S, the points B and C should transform such that the inversion product OB cdot OC = OD^2 for center O. 6. **Algebraic Verification:**    Let the sides opposite vertices A, B, and C be a, b, and c.

Given the condition that for any g in mathscr{b} with g neq f, the composition f circ g circ f neq g circ f circ g holds true. This implies that if f circ g circ f = g circ f circ g, then g must be equal to f. 3. To show that f(T) = T, we first establish a lemma. Suppose there exists a positive integer n geq 3 such that:     [     f^{n+2} = f^{2n+1}     ] 4. Then we can write the equality in terms of compositions:     [     f circ f^{n} circ f = f^{n} circ f circ f^{n}     ]     By the earlier logic, this implies:     [     f^{n} = f     ] 5.

Therefore:     [     f^{n-2}: T rightarrow T     ]     and it can be inferred that f^{n-2} is a function from T to T and acts as the inverse of f: T rightarrow T. 6.

Therefore, f^{n-2} circ f = f circ f^{n-2} on T, implying f is a bijection from T to T. 8. Next, define S_{m} = f^{m}(S), which is the image of S after being acted on by f^{m}. Thus, we have a chain of decreasing subsets:     [     S supseteq S_{1} supseteq S_{2} supseteq cdots     ] 9.

Consequently, f restricts to a surjection f: S_{infty} rightarrow S_{infty}, and since S_{infty} subseteq S is finite, f is also a bijection on S_{infty}. 11.

This gives us the equation frac{c}{2} = frac{1}{2} and hence c = 1.   Additionally, the sum of the semi-major axis and the focal length is a + c = 3, so a = 2.

The perimeter of △F<sub>2</sub>MN is 4a = 8, and the area is frac{1}{2}(MN + F_2M + F_2N)R = 4R. To maximize the area, and thus to maximize R, we examine:  S_{triangle F_2MN} = frac{1}{2} cdot |F_1F_2| cdot (y_1 - y_2) = y_1 - y_2.  Since the slope of the line l passing through F<sub>1</sub> is non-zero, we can represent it as x = my - 1.

Applying Vieta's formulas, we get:  y_1 + y_2 = frac{6m}{3m^2 + 4}, quad y_1 y_2 = -frac{9}{3m^2 + 4}.

The smallest value of p(i!) dominates, which occurs at the largest i, i = 11. Hence, p(c) = 22 - p(11!), where p(11!) = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. Therefore, p(c) = 22 - 8 = 14.

From the information given, we can set up the following equation: 7B + 4S + 11 = 128 We want to find the total number of people (best friends and schoolmates) Nathaniel gave tickets to, which is B + S. First, we need to isolate the terms with B and S on one side of the equation: 7B + 4S = 128 - 11 7B + 4S = 117 Since we don't have separate values for B and S, we can't solve for them individually. However, we can find the total number of tickets given to best friends and schoolmates, which is 117 tickets. Now, we need to divide 117 by the number of tickets each person received to find the total number of people: For best friends, each received 7 tickets, and for schoolmates, each received 4 tickets. Since we don't know the exact distribution, we can't directly calculate B and S. However, we can find the maximum number of best friends he could have given tickets to by dividing 117 by 7: 117 / 7 = 16 remainder 5 This means he could have given tickets to a maximum of 16 best friends, using up 112 tickets (16 * 7), and leaving 5 tickets (117 - 112) that could have been part of the tickets given to schoolmates. Since we know he has 11 tickets left, and if we assume the remainder 5 tickets were part of the schoolmates' tickets, we can add these to the 11 left over to find out how many tickets were given to schoolmates: 5 (remainder) + 11 (left over) = 16 tickets for schoolmates Now, we divide the 16 tickets by 4 (the number of tickets each schoolmate received): 16 / 4 = 4 schoolmates So, Nathaniel could have given tickets to 16 best friends and 4 schoolmates, making a total of: 16 (best friends) + 4 (schoolmates) = 20 people Therefore, Nathaniel gave tickets to a combined total of boxed{20}  people (best friends and schoolmates)."},{"instruction":"Edward spent 6 to buy books and 16 to buy pens.

We are given that the incircle touches the sides (AB), (BC), and (CA) at points (C_1), (A_1), and (B_1) respectively. 2. First, note that the tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Thus, we have:    - (AC_1 = AB_1)    - (BC_1 = BA_1)    - (CB_1 = CA_1) 3.

The length of the segments where the incircle touches each side can now be determined:    - Since (AB = 5), and the tangents from (A) and (B) are equal ((AB_1 = AC_1)), then (AB_1 = AC_1 = s - AB = 8 - 5 = 3).    - Since (BC = 5), and the tangents from (B) and (C) are equal ((BA_1 = BC_1)), then (BC_1 = BA_1 = s - BC = 8 - 5 = 3).    - Since (CA = 6), (CA_1 = CB_1 = s - AC = 8 - 6 = 2). 5. Importantly, since (B_1) is the touch point of the incircle with (AC), the intersection of line (BB_1) with the incircle at point (K) will result in (K) being a reflection of point (B_1) through the center of the incircle (since the tangents at (B_1) from (B) and (K) are equal). 6.

If we were to change any trio of digits, except the last one, the number remains even and hence composite. For instance, from the number ( 9992 ) we can obtain the prime number ( 0002 ). 3. Therefore, we only need to be concerned with the replacement of the last trio of digits. We construct a number ( N ) which ends in ( 000 ), making it even.  4. Replacing the last trio of digits in ( N ) is equivalent to adding to ( N ) some three-digit number. So, we need to find a number that ends in ( 000 ) such that the numbers    [    N, N+1, ldots, N+999    ]    are all composite. 5. To ensure that all these numbers are composite, we consider the product of odd numbers from ( 1001 ) to ( 1999 ).  6.

Select 4 students (with an odd number of girls) such that they come from two different groups and there are two pairs of students with matching numbers. Prove that the number of such groups of 4 students is odd.","output":"To solve the problem, we need to demonstrate that a group of four students satisfying certain conditions (consisting of an odd number of girls and two students with the same ID) originates from an odd number of groups. Here is a step-by-step outline with detailed explanations: 1. **Definition of Sets**:     - Let ( S ) denote the set of all possible \\"teams\\" that can be formed. A team is defined as a group of four students from two different groups where two of the students have the same ID.     [ S = {delta mid delta text{ is a team}} ]     - Let ( O ) denote the set of all teams from ( S ) that contain an odd number of girls.     [ O = {delta in S mid delta text{ contains an odd number of girls}} ]     - Let ( E ) denote the set of all teams from ( S ) that contain an even number of girls.     [ E = {delta in S mid delta text{ contains an even number of girls}} ] 2. **Summation Function**:     - Define a function ( f ) that, for any subset ( A ) of ( S ), sums up the number of girls in the teams that comprise ( A ).     [ f(A) = sum_{delta in A} text{number of girls in } delta ] 3. **Set Relations**:     - Since ( O ) and ( E ) are disjoint and partition ( S ):     [ O cap E = varnothing quad text{and} quad O cup E = S ]     - Therefore, we have the equation:     [ f(S) = f(O) + f(E) ] 4. **Parity of ( f(E) )**:     - Since ( E ) contains only teams with an even number of girls, ( f(E) ) is even. Hence:     [ f(E) equiv 0 pmod{2} ]     [ f(S) equiv f(O) pmod{2} ] 5. **Calculation of ( f(S) )**:     - Consider a specific girl. From her group (which has up to 49 other students), she can form a team with any other student within her group and students from the remaining 9 groups. Thus, for any girl, there are ( 49 times 9 ) possible teams she can be part of.     - Since there are 271 girls in total, each counted in ( f(S) ) exactly ( 49 times 9 ) times:     [ f(S) = 49 times 9 times 271 equiv 1 pmod{2} ] 6. **Odd number of girls in teams in ( O )**:     - For any team ( delta in O ), since it contains an odd number of girls:     [ f(O) equiv |O| pmod{2} ] 7. **Conclusion**:     - Combining the above results:     [ f(O) equiv f(S) equiv 1 pmod{2} ]     - Therefore:     [ |O| equiv 1 pmod{2} ] Since ( |O| equiv 1 pmod{2} ), we conclude that ( |O| ) must be an odd number.

Simplifying this yields (1-k)e^{-x} > frac{2x}{e^{2x}-1}, or equivalently 1-k > frac{2x}{e^{x}-e^{-x}}. If we define g(x) = frac{2x}{e^{x}-e^{-x}}, it is an even function since g(-x) = g(x). Hence, we only need to consider x > 0. Analyzing the function g(x) - 1 = frac{2x - e^{x} + e^{-x}}{e^{x} - e^{-x}}, and noticing that for x > 0, e^{x} > e^{-x}, we define another function h(x) = 2x - e^{x} + e^{-x}.

Each ( S_i ) contains exactly ( n ) cells.    - Project the set ( S_i ) onto the ( x )-axis and ( y )-axis. Let ( k ) be the maximum number of cells from ( S_i ) contained in any single column.    - The number of columns containing at least one cell from ( S_i ) is at least ( frac{n}{k} ).

The total distance covered when the two trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is ( 220 ) meters + ( 280.04 ) meters = ( 500.04 ) meters. We need to convert the distance to kilometers because the speed is given in km/h. There are 1000 meters in a kilometer, so the distance in kilometers is: ( 500.04 ) meters ÷ ( 1000 ) meters/km = ( 0.50004 ) km The time taken to cross each other is given as 9 seconds. To convert this time into hours, we divide by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour): ( 9 ) seconds ÷ ( 3600 ) seconds/hour = ( 0.0025 ) hours Now, we can use the formula for relative speed: Relative Speed = Distance / Time Plugging in the values we have: ( V_1 + V_2 = 0.50004 ) km / ( 0.0025 ) hours ( V_1 + 80 ) km/h = ( 0.50004 ) km / ( 0.0025 ) hours ( V_1 + 80 ) km/h = ( 200.016 ) km/h Now, we solve for ( V_1 ): ( V_1 = 200.016 ) km/h - ( 80 ) km/h ( V_1 = 120.016 ) km/h Therefore, the speed of the first train is approximately ( boxed{120.016}  ) km/h."},{"instruction":"Given the parabola C:y^{2}=2pxleft(p gt 0right) with the focus F at a distance of 2 from the directrix.<br/>(1) Find the equation of C;<br/>(2) Let O be the origin, point P lies on C, and point Q satisfies overrightarrow{PQ}=9overrightarrow{QF}.

Each face shares exactly 4 edges with other faces.  Step 2: Counting Valid Labelings We consider the conditions: - Each face should have either one edge or three edges labeled '1'. There are binom{4}{1} = 4 ways to label one edge with '1', and binom{4}{3} = 4 ways to label three edges with '1'. In total, 8 configurations per face.    However, not every configuration is valid globally, considering the constraint on adjacent faces.

This choice affects the adjacent faces, which cannot share more than one of these labeled edges. For each adjacent face, this leaves 3 potential edges to label '1', of which at most one can be the shared edge.    As the cube symmetry and adjacency constraints significantly reduce the number of valid configurations, we must evaluate each possible configuration while checking adjacency constraints.

However, since we started with an integer, the numbers in sequence (A_i)_{i geq 1} will eventually repeat. 5. If a number repeats, say A_k = A_{k+1}, then by induction, this value will persist for any i geq k.  Hence, there necessarily exists a k in mathbb{N} such that A_{k+1} = A_k. (blacksquare)  Part II: Special case for A = 19^{86} 6. We compute A = 19^{86}. Let's evaluate f(19) first to extend it to A = 19^{86}. 7. The decimal representation of 19 is overline{19} so:    [    f(19) = 2^1 cdot 9 + 2^0 cdot 1 = 18 + 1 = 19    ] 8. This means that for any integer n expressed as some power of 19, the function f applied to any such integer n = 19^k will behave similarly. 9. Specifically evaluating f(19^{86}) and following the same rationale, since 19 is preserved through the function f (as in f(19) = 19), the same applies to 19^{86}:     [    f(19^{86}) = 19    ] 10. Thus, A_k for A = 19^{86} should converge to 19 after sufficient iterations. Each application of f to an integer of the form 19^k will keep iterating back to 19 which will reiterate indefinitely. Hence,  [ A_k = 19^{86} implies A_1 = 19 text{ and moving forward over iteration } A_2 = 19, ldots  ] In conclusion, (boxed{19})"},{"instruction":"Simplify the following expression in ( y ): [ 3y + 7y^2 + 10  (5  3y  7y^2) ].

Define ( text{ord}(n) := min {k in mathbb{Z}^+ mid f^k(n) = n} ), which represents the minimal period of the sequence ( n, f(n), f^2(n), ldots ) (its orbit). This is the smallest positive integer ( k ) such that applying the function ( f ) ( k ) times returns ( n ) to itself. 2. Given that ( f^{(n)}(n) = n ) for each ( n in S ), it follows that ( text{ord}(n) mid n ). This is because the period of the sequence must divide the number of elements in the sequence. 3. Specifically, for ( n = 2021 ), we have ( text{ord}(2021) mid 2021 ). Since ( 2021 = 43 cdot 47 ), the possible values for ( text{ord}(2021) ) are the divisors of 2021, which are ( 1, 43, 47, ) and ( 2021 ). 4. Consider each possible value of ( text{ord}(2021) ):    - If ( text{ord}(2021) = 1 ), then ( f(2021) = 2021 ). This is achievable by setting ( f(n) = n ) for all ( n in S ).    - If ( text{ord}(2021) = 2021 ), this would imply that the sequence ( 2021, f(2021), f^2(2021), ldots, f^{2020}(2021) ) contains 2021 distinct elements. However, this is impossible because ( f(1) = f^1(1) = 1 ), which contradicts the requirement for a 2021-cycle.    - If ( text{ord}(2021) = 47 ), there should be 47 elements in the orbit of 2021, all divisible by 47. However, there are only 43 multiples of 47 less than or equal to 2021, making this impossible.    - If ( text{ord}(2021) = 43 ), there should be 43 elements in the orbit of 2021, all divisible by 43. This is possible because there are 47 multiples of 43 less than or equal to 2021, which is sufficient to form a 43-cycle. 5. To achieve ( text{ord}(2021) = 43 ), we can construct the function ( f ) as follows:    - Take 43 distinct multiples of 43 in the order ( 43m_1 = 2021, 43m_2, 43m_3, ldots, 43m_{43} ).    - Define ( f(43m_k) = 43m_{k+1} ) for ( k ) taken modulo 43.    - Define ( f(n) = n ) for all other ( n in S ). 6. This construction ensures that there is one 43-cycle and many 1-cycles, satisfying the condition ( f^{(n)}(n) = n ) for all ( n in S ).

The directrix is a vertical line, and since the focus is at (1,0) and p=1, the directrix has the equation x = -1. Hence, the distance from point M to the directrix is |(x-(-1))| = |x+1|. Since |MF| = 4, we have: sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2} = 4 quad (1)  Also, from the parabola's equation y^2 = 4x, we get: y^2 = 4x quad (2)  Substitute y^2 from equation (2) into equation (1): sqrt{(x-1)^2 + 4x} = 4  Simplify and square both sides to remove the square root: (x-1)^2 + 4x = 16  Expand (x-1)^2: x^2 - 2x + 1 + 4x = 16  Combine like terms and move everything to one side of the equal sign: x^2 + 2x - 15 = 0  Factor the quadratic equation: (x - 3)(x + 5) = 0  This gives us two possibilities for x: x = 3 or x = -5. However, we know that the point M must lie on the parabola y^2 = 4x, which opens to the right. Therefore, M must have a positive x-coordinate. Hence, x = -5 is not possible for our parabola.

Let's denote these tetrahedra as ( T_1, T_2, T_3, ) and ( T_4 ).    - These tetrahedra will touch each other through their faces intersecting in polygons with positive area.    - This can be visualized as a pyramid with a quadrilateral base (where the bases of the tetrahedra form the faces connecting to the common apex). 2. **Reflect and Rotate the Pattern for Four Additional Tetrahedra**:    - Next, construct a similar arrangement of four additional tetrahedra ( T_5, T_6, T_7, ) and ( T_8 ) on the opposite side of the original plane. This means placing their bases in the same plane but below it, with their apices also converging at a common point mirrored across the plane.    - Reflect the original pattern to ensure that each tetrahedron above the plane touches each tetrahedron below the plane.    - As each tetrahedron in the reflected pattern will have its faces intersect the faces of the tetrahedra in the original pattern, all needed conditions (no common interior points and positive-area intersection) are met. 3. **Verify the Intersection**:    - Each pair of tetrahedra, one from the initial set ( T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4 ) and one from the reflected set ( T_5, T_6, T_7, T_8 ), will intersect along the planes of their bases and apices creating polygons of positive area.    - Additionally, each tetrahedron within the same set (above or below the plane) will touch each other by construction.

When all roads of this set are closed, the set of bases splits exactly into two parts that are not connected to each other.    - These parts should comply with the definition that any two bases in the same part will still be connected by a remaining open road. 4. **Components and Path Connections**:    - After closing the strategic set of roads, the overall set of bases splits into exactly two components. Denote these components as X and Y. 5. **Contradiction Approach**:    - Suppose there are at least three components instead of exactly two when closing the strategic set. This would imply the set is not strategic. 6. **Proof Scenario and Elimination**:    - Let a be a road between component X and Y.    - If Z represents a third component, consider not closing the road a.    - Remaining connected components X and Z would not connect even using road a, contradicting the strategic nature since it would imply there are fewer than two components that are disconnected. 7. **Components Division Evidence**:    - Let's examine a road within one of the components. If this road is closed, verification leads to an important set remaining, conflicting with the strategic set's definition. 8. **Forming Important Set from Parts of Strategic Sets**:    - Suppose the first strategic set divides the bases into subsets A and B, while the second divides them into C and D.    - Let K = A cap C, L = A cap D, M = B cap C, N = B cap D. 9. **Ensuring Non-Empty Intersections**:    - These intersections must cover all bases, ensuring at least one intersection is non-empty.    - Analyze the possible intersection empty cases (e.g., K = L = varnothing leads to a contradiction as A would be empty). 10. **Final Grouping**:     - Closing roads forming these intersections will ensure the set of bases splits into the essential non-connected parts (K cup N) and (L cup M), forming an important set. 11. **Conclusion**:     - Thus, the set of roads, each belonging uniquely to one of the two different strategic sets, forms an important set as required.

Let (P) be an arbitrary point on the circle, and let its complex coordinate be (z), where (|z| = r). Since (P) also lies on the circle, we have:    [    zbar{z} = |z|^2 = r^2.    ] 2.

Using the complex modulus properties, we expand (|z - z_i|^2):    [    |z - z_i|^2 = (z - z_i)(bar{z} - bar{z}_i) = zbar{z} - zbar{z}_i - bar{z}z_i + z_ibar{z}_i.    ] 5. Summing over all vertices:    [    sum_{i=1}^{n} |z - z_i|^2 = sum_{i=1}^{n} left( zbar{z} - zbar{z}_i - bar{z}z_i + z_ibar{z}_i right).    ] 6. Since (sum_{i=1}^{n} z_i = 0) and (sum_{i=1}^{n} bar{z}_i = 0) (from complex conjugate properties of roots of unity), we get:    [    sum_{i=1}^{n} |z - z_i|^2 = sum_{i=1}^{n} r^2 - z sum_{i=1}^{n} bar{z}_i - bar{z} sum_{i=1}^{n} z_i + sum_{i=1}^{n} r^2 = nr^2.    ] Therefore, the summation is constant and results in: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} |PP_i|^2 = 2nr^2. ] In conclusion: [ boxed{2nr^2} ]"},{"instruction":"Determine ( C ) and ( D ) such that [ frac{5x3}{x^25x14} = frac{C}{x7} + frac{D}{x+2}. ]","output":"1.

We have an open non-self-intersecting broken line (polygonal chain) consisting of 37 segments (links).

Begin by recognizing a fundamental characteristic of the configuration described: Each segment lies along a specific straight line.     3. If we suppose that fewer than 8 lines are sufficient, it implies that:    - The intersections of those lines can potentially be vertices of our broken line.    - Every intersection provides a change point (vertex) for the broken line. 4. Computing the number of possible intersection points from 8 lines:    [    binom{8}{2} = frac{8 cdot 7}{2 cdot 1} = 28    ]    There are at most 28 intersection points from 8 lines.  5.

However, there is also a leakage pipe D that can empty the tank in 90 hours. If all the four pipes are opened simultaneously, how much time will be taken to fill the tank completely?","output":"To solve this problem, we need to find the combined rate at which the tank is filled when all four pipes are opened simultaneously. First, let's find the individual rates at which each pipe can fill the tank: Pipe A fills the tank in 30 hours, so its rate is 1/30 of the tank per hour. Pipe B fills the tank in 45 hours, so its rate is 1/45 of the tank per hour. Pipe C fills the tank in 60 hours, so its rate is 1/60 of the tank per hour. Pipe D empties the tank in 90 hours, so its rate is -1/90 of the tank per hour (negative because it's emptying the tank). Now, let's add the rates of pipes A, B, and C and subtract the rate of pipe D to find the combined rate: Combined rate = (1/30 + 1/45 + 1/60) - 1/90 To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 30, 45, 60, and 90 is 180. So we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 180: 1/30 = 6/180 1/45 = 4/180 1/60 = 3/180 1/90 = 2/180 Now, we can add and subtract these fractions: Combined rate = (6/180 + 4/180 + 3/180) - 2/180 Combined rate = (6 + 4 + 3 - 2) / 180 Combined rate = 11/180 of the tank per hour Now that we have the combined rate, we can find the time it takes to fill the tank by taking the reciprocal of the combined rate: Time = 1 / (Combined rate) Time = 1 / (11/180) Time = 180 / 11 Time ≈ 16.36 hours So, it will take approximately boxed{16.36}  hours to fill the tank completely when all four pipes are opened simultaneously."},{"instruction":"Given that x > 0, y > 0, and 2x + 3y + 3xy = 6, find the minimum value of 2x + 3y.

We want to determine if this sequence ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n, ldots ) becomes periodic after a finite number of terms. 1. **Assuming periodicity**:    Let us assume that the sequence has a period ( T ). This means there exists an integer ( T ) such that for all ( n ) sufficiently large, ( a_n = a_{n+T} ). 2. **Applying modular arithmetic**:    From the assumption of periodicity, we can find integers ( k ) and ( m ) (with ( k > m > 0 )), such that ( 10^k equiv 10^m pmod{T} ). We can find such ( k ) and ( m ) because of Euler's theorem, which states that for any integer ( N ) and a number ( a ) coprime to ( N ),    [    a^{phi(N)} equiv 1 pmod{N}    ]    Here, ( phi ) is the Euler totient function. 3. **Pattern in last nonzero digits**:    It is known that the sequence of last nonzero digits of ( n! ) (ignoring trailing zeros) repeats modulo some period derived from ( 10 ), which factors as ( 2 times 5 ). One has to inspect the multiplicative structure modulo powers of 10. 4. **Implication for the factorial**:    Consider the value ( 10^{2t} ). For sufficiently large integers, because of periodicity, we have    [    a_{2 cdot 10^t - 10^m - 1} = a_{10^{alpha}} text{, for some integer } alpha.    ]    This sets up periodic relations:    [    a_{10^L - 1} = a_{2 cdot 10^L - 10^m} = a_{2 cdot 10^k - 10^m}    ] 5. **Evaluating factorial properties**:    Now, since    [    (2 cdot 10^k - 10^m)! = (2 cdot 10^k - 10^m) cdot (2 cdot 10^k - 10^m - 1)!    ]    Observe that the last nonzero digit of ( 2 cdot 10^k - 10^m ) is always 9 (as the first few digits dominate). 6. **Digits and non-cancellation**:    It results that the assumed digit must contradict classical digit rules:     If ( 9s ) must produce the same scenario in periodicity, the only digit for ( s ) such that last digit is not changing under it must be 5. That is,     [    alpha_{2 cdot 10^k - 10^{m-1}} = 5    ]    But, the sequence involves factorials hence primes multiplicity ( exp_{factorials}), and since the factorial of ( n ) contains more ( 2 )'s than ( 5 )'s, periodicity forces contradiction on divisibility. 7. **Conclusion**:    Since no such ( k ), ( m ) can hold valid multiplicative factor division due to ( 5 ) and ( 2 )’s property in factorial, ( a_n ) construction fails periodicity. Thus, the sequence ( a_n ) does not become periodic after a finite number of terms.

Additionally, there was a 10% discount on tshirts, a 12% sales tax on key chains, and an 8% import tax on handmade bracelets. Taking all these discounts and taxes into account, and given that the conversion rate is 1 unit of local currency equivalent to 0.75 US dollars, how much money in US dollars did she spend on all the souvenirs?","output":"Let's break down the problem step by step. First, let's find out how much she spent on t-shirts. We know that she spent 146 units more on key chains and bracelets than on t-shirts. So, if we let the amount spent on t-shirts be T, then the amount spent on key chains and bracelets is T + 146. Given that she spent a total of 347 units on key chains and bracelets, we can write the equation: T + 146 = 347 Now, let's solve for T: T = 347 - 146 T = 201 So, she spent 201 units on t-shirts before any discounts. Now, let's calculate the actual amount she paid for the t-shirts after the 10% discount: Discount on t-shirts = 10% of 201 Discount on t-shirts = 0.10 * 201 Discount on t-shirts = 20.1 Actual amount paid for t-shirts = 201 - 20.1 Actual amount paid for t-shirts = 180.9 units Next, let's calculate the additional taxes on key chains and bracelets. Since she spent 347 units on both and we don't have the individual prices, we'll apply the taxes to the total amount. 12% sales tax on key chains: Sales tax on key chains = 12% of 347 Sales tax on key chains = 0.12 * 347 Sales tax on key chains = 41.64 8% import tax on handmade bracelets: Import tax on bracelets = 8% of 347 Import tax on bracelets = 0.08 * 347 Import tax on bracelets = 27.76 Now, let's add these taxes to the total amount spent on key chains and bracelets: Total amount with taxes = 347 + 41.64 + 27.76 Total amount with taxes = 416.4 units Finally, let's add the amount spent on t-shirts and the total amount with taxes for key chains and bracelets to get the total amount spent in local currency: Total amount spent = 180.9 + 416.4 Total amount spent = 597.3 units Now, let's convert the total amount spent to US dollars using the conversion rate of 0.75 US dollars per unit of local currency: Total amount in US dollars = 597.3 * 0.75 Total amount in US dollars = 447.975 Therefore, she spent approximately boxed{447.98}  on all the souvenirs."},{"instruction":"Let S be the set of nonzero real numbers.

Prove that if all resulting numbers are integers, then all initial numbers are equal.  1. **Observation and Initial Set Up**:    For any set of n integers x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n, if we repeatedly apply the transformation where each element becomes the average of two consecutive elements in the original set, the maximum value in the set will decrease, and the minimum value will increase over each step if they are not already equal.  2. **Transformation Recurrence Relation**:    Given:    [ left( frac{a_1 + a_2}{2}, frac{a_2 + a_3}{2}, ldots, frac{a_n + a_1}{2} right) ]    for the recurrence relation, if all the resulting numbers remain integers, then the sum of two consecutive integers must be even. 3. **Simpler Set Example**:    Assume the first set where:    [ x_1 = x_2 = ldots = x_n ]    Given this, we know regardless of the transformations applied, the set remains:    [ (a, a, a, ldots, a) ]    Here, since each transformation yields the average of two equal consecutive elements, which is an integer, the entire set consists of the number 'a'. Thus, if any non-equal values were present, this imbalance through the iterative transformations would lead to non-integer averages at some point. 4. **First Reduction to Equality**:    Let’s denote the first time we obtain a set of equal integers as:    [ (b, b, b, ldots, b) ]    Given the previous set as (z_1, z_2, ldots, z_n), we form equations based on the fact that each new number is an average:    [ frac{z_1 + z_2}{2} = frac{z_2 + z_3}{2} = ldots = frac{z_{n-1} + z_n}{2} = frac{z_n + z_1}{2} = b ] 5. **Forming Relationships**:    This implies:    [ z_1 + z_2 = z_2 + z_3 = ldots = z_{n-1} + z_n = z_n + z_1 = 2b ]    Leading us to conclude:    [ z_1 = z_2 = z_3 = ldots = z_n = b ]     6. **Inductive Step and Integer Condition**:    If any initial integer set composed of unequal values would derive at least one non-integer during iterations since both logarithmic reduction and integer average processes reduce any non-equal valued set to result non-integers unless it is entirely uniform from start, confirming the need for equality in base integers:    These calculations show two necessary forms:    - If (n) is odd, proving impossible equal set formation suggests transformation resulting non integer set at later stages.

Prove that one of the triangles can cover a square with side (frac{1 / n}{n}).","output":"1. We need to prove that if a unit square is divided into ( n ) triangles, one of these triangles can cover a square with side length ( frac{1}{n} ). 2. Let's start by considering the cases where ( n = 2 ) and ( n = 3 ):    - For ( n = 2 ), the unit square can be divided diagonally into two right triangles, each with area ( 0.5 ). It's easily seen that one of these triangles can cover a square with side length ( frac{1}{2} ).    - For ( n = 3 ), the unit square can be divided into three triangles in various ways, such as by connecting the center to the midpoints of the sides. Each triangle will have an area of ( frac{1}{3} ), and it's possible to cover a square with side length ( frac{1}{3} ). 3. Now, let’s generalize for ( n geq 4 ). The total area of the unit square is 1. Since the unit square is divided into ( n ) triangles, the sum of the areas of these ( n ) triangles must be 1. Hence, there must be at least one triangle whose area ( S ) satisfies ( S geq frac{1}{n} ). 4. Denote the sides of one triangle as ( a ) (base) and ( h ) (height). The area of this triangle is given by:    [    S = frac{1}{2} cdot a cdot h    ]    Since ( S geq frac{1}{n} ), we have:    [    frac{1}{2} a h geq frac{1}{n}    ]    [    a h geq frac{2}{n}    ] 5. Now, consider a square ( K ) with side length ( x ). We need to show that this triangle can cover a square with ( x = frac{1}{n} ). 6. Place the square ( K ) inside the triangle such that one side of ( K ) lies along the base ( a ) of the triangle and the two opposite corners of ( K ) touch the other two sides of the triangle. The height ( h ) of the triangle will then project onto one side of square ( K ). 7. The height of the largest possible square ( K ) that can fit within this triangle can be given by balancing the similarity ratio as follows:    [    h = frac{a x}{a + h}    ]    Solving for ( x ), we get:    [    x = frac{a h}{a + h}    ] 8. We need to analyze two cases:    - **Case 1**: ( a + h leq 2 )      [      S = frac{a h}{2} geq frac{1}{n} implies a h geq frac{2}{n}      ]      Thus:      [      x = frac{a h}{a + h} geq frac{frac{2}{n}}{2} = frac{1}{n}      ]    - **Case 2**: ( a + h > 2 )      Since the maximum possible length for any side of the triangle is constrained by the diagonal ( sqrt{2} ) of the unit square, we have ( a leq sqrt{2} ). Furthermore, using the inequality ( h > 2 - a ), we get:      [      h > 2 - a geq 2 - sqrt{2}      ]      Hence:      [      x = frac{h}{frac{h}{a} + 1} geq frac{h}{2} geq frac{2 - sqrt{2}}{2} > frac{1}{4} geq frac{1}{n}      ] 9.

Assign color C to v. 6. **Ensuring No Monochromatic Cycle:**    By coloring v with color C, we ensure that no monochromatic cycle can be formed involving v. This is because a monochromatic cycle would require v to have at least two neighbors of the same color C, which contradicts our assignment. 7. **Conclusion:**    By induction, we have shown that any planar graph can be 3-colored such that no monochromatic cycle exists.

At x = frac{1}{2}, gleft(frac{1}{2}right) = 2b - frac{1}{sqrt{e}} geqslant 0, implying the existence of x_0 in left[frac{1}{2}, 1right] such that g(x_0) = 0. Since 2x_0^2 - x_0 geqslant 0 and aln x_0 leqslant 0, it follows that f(x_0) > 0, leading to h(x_0) = g(x_0) = 0. For x in (0, frac{1}{2}), g(x) > 0. To ensure h(x) = 0 has exactly two zeros, f(x) = 0 must have exactly one zero in (0, frac{1}{2}). Given {f'}(x) = 4x - 1 - frac{a}{x} = frac{4x^2 - x - a}{x}, there exists x_1 > 0 such that f'(x_1) = 0. This implies f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, x_1) and monotonically increasing on (x_1, +infty). Setting a = 4x_1^2 - x_1, we find that if 0 < a < frac{1}{2}, then x_1 in left(frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{2}right). As x rightarrow 0, f(x) rightarrow +infty, and fleft(frac{1}{2}right) > 0, ensuring f(x_1) = 0. Let F(x) = 2x^2 - x - (4x^2 - x)ln x for x in left(frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{2}right). We find {F'}(x) = (1 - 8x)ln x > 0, indicating F(x) is monotonically increasing. Since Fleft(frac{1}{4}right) < 0 and Fleft(frac{1}{2}right) > 0, there exists a unique x_1 in left(frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{2}right) such that F(x_1) = 0, proving the existence of a unique positive real number a such that h(x) has exactly two zeros.

The medians AM_1 and BM_2 intersect at the centroid G of the triangle. The centroid divides each median in the ratio 2:1, so AG = frac{2}{3}AM_1 and BG = frac{2}{3}BM_2. 4. To compare the lengths, let's double the segments GM_1 and GM_2:    - Let M_1' be the point such that GM_1' = 2 times GM_1.    - Let M_2' be the point such that GM_2' = 2 times GM_2.        We now have AM_1' = AM_1 and BM_2' = BM_2. 5. Notice that triangles CM_1'G and CM_2'G have the same angle at C because G is the centroid and splits the medians in the ratio 2:1. 6.

Since f(2) = 1, it follows that f(0) = 0.    - By the periodicity, f(4) = f(0) = 0.    - Setting x = 0, we have f(3) + f(1) = 1. 3. **Summing Over a Period**:    - Since f(x) is periodic with period 4, we can express the sum of f(k) over one period as f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + f(4).    - Given f(2) = 1 and f(4) = 0, and knowing f(3) + f(1) = 1, the sum over one period is f(1) + 1 + f(3) + 0 = 2. 4. **Calculating the Total Sum**:    - The total sum sum_{k=1}^{2023} f(k) can be broken down into 505 full periods (since 2023 = 505 times 4 + 3) plus the sum of the first three terms of the next period.    - Therefore, the total sum is 505 times 2 + (f(1) + f(2) + f(3)).    - Since f(1) + f(2) + f(3) = 1, the total sum is 505 times 2 + 1 = 1010 + 1 = 1011.

Correctly, the sum of f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + f(4) over one period is 2, and since f(4) = 0, the sum of f(1) + f(2) + f(3) is indeed 2, not 1 as mistakenly calculated in the previous step. Therefore, the corrected total sum is: 505 times 2 + (f(1) + f(2) + f(3)) = 1010 + 2 = 1012.

In this case, we are looking for a_5, which can be represented as a_5=a_1r^4.

According to the problem, the shopkeeper sells 20% of his stock at a 10% profit. So, the worth of this part of the stock is 0.20X and the profit from this part is 10% of 0.20X, which is 0.10 * 0.20X = 0.02X. The remaining stock, which is 80% of the total stock, is sold at a loss of 5%. So, the worth of this part of the stock is 0.80X and the loss from this part is 5% of 0.80X, which is 0.05 * 0.80X = 0.04X. The overall loss is the loss from the 80% stock minus the profit from the 20% stock, which is given as Rs. 250. So, the equation for the overall loss is: Loss from 80% stock - Profit from 20% stock = Overall loss 0.04X - 0.02X = Rs. 250 0.02X = Rs. 250 X = Rs. 250 / 0.02 X = Rs. 12500 Therefore, the total worth of the stock is Rs. boxed{12500} ."},{"instruction":"Given that i is the imaginary unit, then the point corresponding to z= frac {i}{12i} in the complex plane is located in (　).

Finally, since:    [ ME = AC cdot cos(alpha) cdot cos(gamma) = AC cdot cos(gamma) cdot cos(alpha) = DN ] Therefore, we have proved that (ME = DN). ---  Proof (Second Method): 1. Since (AEDC) is a cyclic quadrilateral, its circumcenter (O) is the midpoint of (AC). This means (D, O, E) form an isosceles triangle with the equality (OE = OD). 2. Let (K) be the midpoint of (DE) (i.e., (OK = OK)). The perpendiculars from (A (AM)), (O (OK)), and (C (CN)) to (DE) are all parallel:    - (AM parallel OK) and (CN parallel OK). 3. By Thales' theorem, since (A O = CO):    [    MK = KN    ] 4. Since (ME = MK - EK) and (DN = KN - KD), and knowing (EK = KD) from the properties of the isosceles triangle, we derive:    [    ME = MK - EK = KN - KD = DN    ] Therefore, we have proved that (ME = DN).

Each bird eats 12 beetles per day, so the number of birds eaten by the snakes is: 1080 beetles / 12 beetles/bird = 90 birds Since each snake eats 3 birds per day, the number of snakes eaten by the jaguars is: 90 birds / 3 birds/snake = 30 snakes Now, we know that each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day, so the number of jaguars in the forest is: 30 snakes / 5 snakes/jaguar = 6 jaguars Therefore, there are boxed{6}  jaguars in the forest."},{"instruction":"Determine the number of base2 digits (bits) for the base16 number ABCDEF_{16}.","output":"We start by converting ABCDEF_{16} to base-10: [ ABCDEF_{16} = 10 cdot 16^5 + 11 cdot 16^4 + 12 cdot 16^3 + 13 cdot 16^2 + 14 cdot 16^1 + 15 ] This equals: [ 10 cdot 1048576 + 11 cdot 65536 + 12 cdot 4096 + 13 cdot 256 + 14 cdot 16 + 15 ] Calculating each term: [ 10485760 + 720896 + 49152 + 3328 + 224 + 15 = 11273375 ] Express 11273375_{10} as a sum of powers of 2: [ 11273375 = 2^{23} + 2^{22} + 2^{21} + 2^{20} + 2^{19} + 2^{18} + 2^{17} + 2^{16} + 2^{15} + 2^{14} + 2^{13} + 2^{12} + 2^{11} + 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 ] The highest power of 2 in this sum is 2^{23}, hence the number of bits required is 23 + 1 = 24 bits.

This is our starting point. 3. **Implication of sin A > sin B**:    - From the Law of Sines, if sin A > sin B, it implies that frac{a}{sin A} > frac{b}{sin B}, which simplifies to a > b.    - Given that a > b, and considering the properties of a triangle, it follows that A > B because the larger side is opposite the larger angle in a triangle. 4. **Monotonicity of cos x on (0, pi)**:    - The function y = cos x is monotonically decreasing on the interval (0, pi). This means that if x_1 < x_2, then cos x_1 > cos x_2 for x_1, x_2 in (0, pi).    - Since A > B and both A, B in (0, pi), it follows that cos A < cos B. 5. **Relation between cos(A+C) and cos B**:    - We know that cos(A+C) = -cos B because A + B + C = pi in a triangle, and cos(pi - B) = -cos B.    - Therefore, cos A < -cos(A+C), which simplifies to cos A + cos(A+C) < 0. 6. **Reversibility and Conclusion**:    - The process described above is reversible.

Without loss of generality, always empty bin 3. 4. **Analysis:**    - After an infinite number of such procedures, before operation, every bin contains 10 kg.    - After operation, we have two bins with 10 kg and the third is empty.    - Now add 5 kg to both bins with 10 kg.    - Thus, both bins before the operation contain 15 kg.    - After operation, we have one bin with 15 kg and two bins that are empty.    - Hence, the storing capacity here must be 25 kg. 5. **Claim:**    - After every operation, the sum of all bins is less than or equal to 20 kg. 6. **Proof of Claim:**    - After an operation, let bin 1 contain ( x ), bin 2 contain 0, and bin 3 contain ( y ).    - Initially, ( x + y leq 20 ).    - Let ( z_1, z_2, z_3 ) be the amounts added to bins 1, 2, and 3 respectively, with ( z_1 + z_2 + z_3 = 10 ). 7. **Case Analysis:**    - **Case 1:** Bin 1 is the heaviest.      - ( x + z_1 geq z_2 ) and ( x + z_1 geq y + z_3 ).      - We have ( 20 + 2z_1 geq 20 + z_1 - z_3 geq x + y + z_1 - z_3 geq 2y implies y leq 10 + z_1 ).      - Thus, ( y + z_2 + z_3 = 10 + y - z_1 leq 20 ).    - **Case 2:** Bin 2 is the heaviest.      - ( z_2 geq x + z_1 ) and ( z_2 geq y + z_3 ).      - We have ( x + z_1 + y + z_3 leq 2z_1 leq 2(10 - z_2 - z_3) leq 20 ).    - **Case 3:** Bin 3 is the heaviest.      - This case is exactly the same as the first case. 8. **Conclusion:**    - By the claim, right before every operation, the sum of all bins is less than or equal to ( x + y + 10 leq 30 ).    - Thus, before every operation, the second largest bin is less than or equal to 15 kg, as otherwise, the sum of all bins would be greater than 30 kg.    - As the second largest bin does not empty during the operation, we get the desired bound.

Prove that if a word has the property that swapping any two adjacent letters makes the word repetitive, then all its letters are identical. (Note that one may swap two adjacent identical letters, leaving a word unchanged.) *Romania (Dan Schwarz)*","output":"To prove that if a word has the property that swapping any two adjacent letters makes the word repetitive, then all its letters are identical, we will proceed by contradiction. Assume that there exists a word ( w = w_1 w_2 cdots w_n ) that has the property but not all its letters are identical. 1. **Definitions and Initial Setup:**    - A swap ( s ) is called *impactful* if it changes the word ( w ).    - Let ( s(w) ) denote the word after applying the swap ( s ).    - A word is *drab* if it consists of repetitions of a single letter.    - Define the period ( p(x) ) of a word ( x ) as the smallest integer ( p ) such that ( x ) can be written as the concatenation of ( p ) identical subwords.    - Define the length ( ell(x) ) of a word ( x ) as the number of letters in ( x ).    - Define ( r(x) = frac{ell(x)}{p(x)} ), the length of the subwords.    - For a word ( x ), let ( overline{x}_1, overline{x}_2, ldots, overline{x}_{p(x)} ) be the ( p(x) ) subwords of length ( r(x) ).    - Define the diversity ( d(x) ) of a word ( x ) as the number of impactful swaps in ( x ) plus 1, which is also equal to the number of drab words that partition ( x ). 2. **Claim 1:**    For any impactful swap ( s ), ( d(s(x)) ge d(x) - 2 ), with equality if and only if ( s(x) ) swaps the middle ( ab ) in a word ( baba ).    **Proof:**    Suppose the two letters ( s ) swaps are ( a ) and ( b ), and the letter before ( a ) is ( c ), and the letter after ( b ) is ( d ). The rest of the word remains unchanged, so the difference ( d(s(x)) - d(x) ) is equal to the difference ( d(cabd) - d(cbad) ). The first is at most 3, and the second at least 1 since ( b ne a ), and it is 1 only when ( c = b ) and ( d = a ). (blacksquare) 3. **Claim 2:**    For any repetitive word ( x ), if ( d(x) > 1 ) then ( d(x) ge 2p(x) ), with equality if and only if ( d(x) ) is of the form ( uvuv ldots uv ), repeated ( p(x) ) times, where ( u ) and ( v ) are words.    **Proof:**    Consider ( overline{x}_i ); if the last letter is equal to the first, then the number of drab words that partition ( x ) is equal to ( p(x) cdot d(overline{x}_1) - p(x) + 1 ). It is impossible for ( d(overline{x}_1) = 2 ) since it begins and ends on the same letter, so ( d(x) ne p(x) + 1 ).    If the last letter is not the same as the first, then ( d(x) = p(x) cdot d(overline{x}_1) ). We cannot have ( d(overline{x}_1) = 1 implies d(x) = 1 ), so ( d(x) ) is at least ( 2p(x) ), with equality when ( d(overline{x}_1) = 2 ). (blacksquare) 4. **Claim 3:**    - If ( k ge 3 ), ( m(k) le 1 ).    - If ( k = 2 ), ( m(k) le 2 ).    - ( m(2) + m(4) le 2 ).    **Proof:**    - If ( k ge 5 ), observe that one swap ( s ) can change at most two of the ( p(s(w)) ) induced subwords. Consider two swaps ( s_1, s_2 ), with ( p(s_1(w)) = p(s_2(w)) ); by pigeonhole, there must exist a subword ( overline{w}_k ) that is kept constant. Then this forces ( w = s_1(w) = s_2(w) ) so we cannot have two such words.    - If ( k = 4 ), consider two different swaps ( s_1, s_2 ). If one of them is completely within a subword, then there will exist a subword (out of 4 subwords total) which is kept constant, contradiction. Furthermore, one swap has to be in between the first and second subword (WLOG ( s_1 )), and another has to be within the third and fourth subword (WLOG ( s_2 )), so ( w ) looks like this: ( xa ~ by ~ zb ~ aw ), where ( x, y, z, w ) are words. Yet this also means that ( s_1(w) = xb ~ ay ~ zb ~ aw ), so ( y ) must end with ( b ), and that ( s_2(w) = xa ~ by ~ za ~ bw ), so ( y ) must end with ( a ), and thus ( a = b ), contradiction.    - If ( k = 3 ), again consider two different swaps ( s_1, s_2 ). If one of them is completely within a subword (WLOG ( s_1 ), and WLOG this is the first subword), then the other must be in between the other two subwords (WLOG ( s_2 )) or else there will be a constant subword (when we look at 3 subwords partitioning ( w )). Then ( s_2(w) ) will look like this ( x ~ yb ~ az ) where ( w ) is ( x ~ ya ~ bz ), so actually ( w ) is of the form ( bx'a ~ by'b ~ az'a ), where ( x, y, z, x', y', z' ) are all words. But then any swap within the first subword won't change the fact that the other two subwords end in different letters, so it doesn't work. The other case is when both are between subwords, WLOG ( s_1 ) is in between the first and second subword and ( s_2 ) is in between the second and third subword. Then ( w ) has to look something like this: ( xb ~ aya ~ bz ), and ( s_1(w) ) looks like ( xa ~ bya ~ bz ) (so ( x ) begins with ( a )) and ( s_2(w) ) looks like ( xb ~ ayb ~ az ) (so ( x ) begins with ( a )), contradiction.    - If ( k = 2 ), if we have two swaps entirely within the same subword, then the other subword is constant, contradiction (here we have ( k = 2 ) subwords partitioning ( w )). Thus we can have at most one swap per subword and one more swap in between the subword. Suppose we have a swap ( s_1 ) within a subword (WLOG, the first subword) and a swap ( s_2 ) between subwords. Then we have something like ( w = xa ~ by ) and ( s_2(w) = xb ~ ay ), so ( w = ax'a ~ by'b ). Then the swap ( s_1 ), in order to make the subwords the same, must both make the first letter of the first subword into ( b ), and the last letter of the first subword into ( b ), which is impossible. Therefore we can have just at most one swap within each of the two subwords and two swaps total.    - For the last part, note that a swap ( s ) with ( p(s(w)) = 4 ) can actually be included as part of the argument in the last part (as it *does* divide ( w ) into two equal subwords), so ( m(4) ) should actually be included in the count. (blacksquare) 5. **Maximizing ( p(S(w)) ):**    Now consider a swap ( S ) which maximizes ( p(S(w)) ). Suppose ( p(S(w)) ge 4 ).    [    p(S(w)) - 1 ge 2 + 1 + sum_{k = 5}^{p(S(w))} 1     ]    [    ge (m(2) + m(4)) + m(3) + sum_{k = 5}^{p(S(w))} m(k)     ]    [    = sum_{k = 2}^{p(S(w))} m(k)     ]    [    = d(w) - 1     ]    [    ge d(S(w)) - 3     ]    [    ge 2p(S(w)) - 3     ]    or ( p(S(w)) le 2 ), contradiction. 6. **Case ( p(S(w)) = 3 ):**    When ( p(S(w)) = 3 ), the same inequality becomes ( 3 ge 2p(S(w)) - 3 ) or ( p(S(w)) le 3 ) -- however, this is the equality case, so all of the following must hold:    - ( m(2) = 2 ),    - ( m(3) = 1 ),    - ( d(w) = d(S(w)) - 2 ); i.e. around ( S(w) ), ( w ) looks like ( abab ),    - ( d(S(w)) = 2p(S(w)) ).    By the last, we see that ( S(w) = uvuvuv ) for words ( u ) and ( v ). By the third, we will require that ( u ) and ( v ) both have length 1, and then by manual inspection we can conclude that it's impossible for ( m(2) = 2 ) as well. Therefore, ( p(S(w)) ne 3 ), so ( p(S(w)) = 2 ). 7. **Case ( p(S(w)) = 2 ):**    If ( m(2) = 2 ), then ( w ) looks something like this: ( xaby ~ xbay ). There must be no more possible swaps. In order for the first subword to have no more impactful swaps, ( x ) is a drab word consisting only of ( a )s and ( y ) is a drab word consisting only of ( b )s, yet in order for the second subword to have no more impactful swaps, ( x ) is a drab word consisting only of ( b )s and ( y ) is a drab word consisting only of ( a )s, which doesn't work unless ( x, y ) both have length 0. But then ( abba ) doesn't work either, so this doesn't work.    If ( m(2) = 1 ), then ( w ) looks something like ( xa ~ by ), and ( S(w) = xb ~ ay ), so ( w = ax'a ~ by'b ), and then ( x' = y' ) so we have ( w = ax'a ~ bx'b ). There must be no other swaps in either subword, so from the first subword we get that ( x' ) is a drab word with only ( a )s, and from the second subword we get that ( x' ) is a drab word with only ( b )s, so again ( x' ) must have length zero. But then ( aa ~ bb ) doesn't work either, so this doesn't work.    If ( m(2) = 0 ) there are no impactful swaps and then ( w ) itself is drab.

Since angle C A B = 60^circ and angle C A Y = 90^circ (because of the square), we have:      [      begin{aligned}      angle B A Y & = angle C A Y - angle C A B       & = 90^circ - 60^circ       & = 30^circ.      end{aligned}      ] 3. **Considering Diagonals of Squares:**    - Since A Z is a diagonal of the square A Y Z C, the angle angle Z A Y is 45^circ because diagonals of a square bisect its angles.    - Similarly, since A X is a diagonal of the square A W X B, the angle angle B A X is also 45^circ. 4. **Calculating (angle Z A X):**    - Next, we calculate the angle angle Z A X as follows:      [      begin{aligned}      angle Z A X & = angle Z A Y - angle B A Y + angle B A X       & = 45^circ - 30^circ + 45^circ       & = 60^circ.      end{aligned}      ] 5. **Equal Sides Due to Equal Diagonals:**    - Since triangle A B C is equilateral, the lengths of A B and A C are equal. Thus, both squares A W X B and A Y Z C are of the same size.    - The diagonals of these squares (A Z and A X) must therefore also be equal in length, hence A Z = A X. 6. **Conclusion:**    - We have established that triangle A X Z has two equal sides (A Z and A X) and an included angle of 60^circ.    - By the definition of an equilateral triangle, if two sides are equal and the included angle is 60^circ, all sides must be equal and all angles must be 60^circ.

Thus, the cost for x - 0.5 miles is 0.30 times frac{x - 0.5}{0.1}. 4. **Formulating and Solving the Equation**:    [    3.00 + 0.30 times frac{x - 0.5}{0.1} = 12    ]    Simplify the equation:    [    3.00 + 3(x - 0.5) = 12    ]    [    3(x - 0.5) = 12 - 3.00    ]    [    3(x - 0.5) = 9    ]    [    x - 0.5 = frac{9}{3} = 3    ]    [    x = 3 + 0.5 = 3.5    ] 5. **Conclusion**: The total number of miles you can ride for 15, including a 3 tip, is 3.5.

Determine the largest and smallest possible values of ( |S| ) in terms of ( n ).","output":"To determine the largest and smallest possible values of (|S|) in terms of (n), we consider (S) as the set of all convex functions (g(x)) such that for each (x in mathbb{R}), there exists an affine function (f_i) from a given set of (n) affine functions such that (g(x) = f_i(x)).  An affine function is of the form (f(x) = ax + b) where (a, b in mathbb{R}). A function (g(x)) is convex if for all (x, y in mathbb{R}) and (0 leq lambda leq 1): [ g(lambda x + (1 - lambda) y) leq lambda g(x) + (1 - lambda) g(y). ]  Steps to find the largest and smallest values of (|S|): 1. **Initial Definitions and Considerations:** Suppose (g in S). For (i=1, 2, ldots, n), let [ X_i = {x in mathbb{R} : g(x) = f_i(x)}. ]    2. **Claim about (X_i):** Claim: If (|X_i| geq 3), then (X_i) is an interval.  *Explanation:* If there exist three points (a < b < c) such that ( (a, g(a)), (b, g(b)), (c, g(c)) ) are collinear, then (g) must be linear on ( [a, b] ) and hence linear on the interval containing (a, b, c) due to the convexity of (g(x)). From this, if (g(x)) coincides with (f_i(x)) over three or more points, (f_i(x)) must define (g(x)) over an interval. 3. **Defining (T):** Let’s define (T = { i : |X_i| geq 3 }). 4. **Proving (g(x) = max_{i in T} f_i(x)):** We aim to show that: [ g(x) = max_{i in T} f_i(x). ] Firstly, since (g(x)) is convex and for all (i in T), (g(x) geq f_i(x)), it follows that: [ g(x) geq max_{i in T} f_i(x). ] Suppose for contradiction, there exists (y in mathbb{R}) such that: [ g(y) neq max_{i in T} f_i(y). ] Thus, for all (i in T), (g(y) > f_i(y)). By the continuity of convex functions, there exists a neighborhood (U) around (y) such that for all (z in U): [ g(z) > f_i(z) quad forall i in T. ] For each (z in U), let (j) be such that (f_j(z) = g(z)). Since (U) is infinite and the set of indices (j) is finite, there must exist some (j) such that this equality holds for at least three points within (U). This would imply: [ j in T quad text{so that} quad g(z) > f_j(z), ] leading to a contradiction. Hence, (g(y) = max_{i in T} f_i(y)). 5. **Largest Value of (|S|):** Since (T) can be any non-empty subset of ({1, 2, ldots, n}), there are (2^n - 1) possible non-empty subsets. Thus, (|S| leq 2^n - 1). This upper bound is achievable. For example, if the affine functions are tangents to the graph of (y = x^2), each subset (T) generates a distinct convex function: [ g(x) = max_{i in T} f_i(x). ] Hence, the largest possible value of (|S|) is (2^n - 1). [ boxed{2^n - 1} ] 6. **Smallest Value of (|S|):** To find the lower bound, note that (S) contains at least the (n) distinct affine functions (f_i), and the maxima of pairs ( max(f_i, f_j) ). For (1 leq i < j leq n), these are pairwise distinct due to the non-parallel and non-concurrent conditions. Thus, (S) has at least: [ n + binom{n}{2} = n + frac{n(n-1)}{2} = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] distinct functions. This lower bound is exemplified by affine functions like tangents to the graph of (y = -x^2), ordered by gradients to ensure no further elements of (S). Therefore, the smallest value of (|S|) is (boxed{frac{n(n+1)}{2}}). In conclusion, the largest possible value of (|S|) is (2^n - 1) and the smallest possible value is (frac{n(n+1)}{2})."},{"instruction":"a plane, a slanted line segment is twice the length of its projection on the plane.

We're given that L = 2l. We can set up a right triangle where L is the hypotenuse, l is the base, and the height is perpendicular to the plane.  According to the Pythagorean theorem, the relationship between the hypotenuse L, the projection l, and the height h of this right triangle is L^2 = l^2 + h^2.  However, we know that L = 2l, so we can substitute into the equation, resulting in (2l)^2 = l^2 + h^2, which simplifies to 4l^2 = l^2 + h^2. Rearranging the terms, we get 3l^2 = h^2, or frac{h^2}{l^2} = 3. Taking the square root of both sides gives us frac{h}{l} = sqrt{3}. In a right triangle, tan of an angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. Therefore, for the angle theta between the line segment L and the plane, we have tan(theta) = frac{h}{l}.  Therefore, tan(theta) = sqrt{3}.  We recognize that tan(60^circ) = sqrt{3}, thus theta = 60^circ. So, the angle between the slanted line and the plane is 60^circ.

Let ( X ) be an arbitrary point on the circumcircle of the ( 2n )-gon ( A_1A_2ldots A_{2n} ).    - Let ( g ) be an arbitrary line in the plane, and for every integer ( i ) such that ( 1 leq i leq 2n ), let ( u_i = measuredangle(A_iA_{i+1}; g) ). The indices are cyclic modulo ( 2n ), so ( A_{2n+1} = A_1 ) and ( u_{2n+1} = u_1 ).    - For every index ( i ), we have:      [      u_i - u_{i+1} = measuredangle(A_iA_{i+1}; g) - measuredangle(A_{i+1}A_{i+2}; g) = measuredangle(A_iA_{i+1}; A_{i+1}A_{i+2}) = measuredangle A_iA_{i+1}A_{i+2}      ]    - Since ( X ) lies on the circumcircle of the ( 2n )-gon, we have ( measuredangle A_iA_{i+1}A_{i+2} = measuredangle A_iXA_{i+2} ). Thus, ( u_i - u_{i+1} = measuredangle A_iXA_{i+2} ) for every ( i ). 4. **Summing the angles**:    - Summing these differences for all ( i ) from ( 1 ) to ( 2n ), we get:      [      sum_{i=1}^{2n} (u_i - u_{i+1}) = sum_{i=1}^{2n} measuredangle A_iXA_{i+2}      ]    - Since the sum of the directed angles around a point is ( 0^circ ), we have:      [      sum_{i=1}^{2n} measuredangle A_iXA_{i+2} = 0^circ      ]    - Therefore:      [      (u_1 + u_3 + ldots + u_{2n-1}) - (u_2 + u_4 + ldots + u_{2n}) = 0^circ      ]      [      u_1 + u_3 + ldots + u_{2n-1} = u_2 + u_4 + ldots + u_{2n}      ] 5. **Using the parallel condition**:    - Since ( n ) is odd, we can rewrite the sums as:      [      (u_1 + u_3 + ldots + u_{n-2} + u_n) + (u_{n+2} + u_{n+4} + ldots + u_{2n-1}) = (u_2 + u_4 + ldots + u_{n-1}) + (u_{n+1} + u_{n+3} + ldots + u_{2n-2} + u_{2n})      ]    - Given ( A_1A_2 parallel A_{n+1}A_{n+2} ), we have ( u_{n+1} = u_1 ), ( u_{n+2} = u_2 ), and so on. Thus:      [      (u_1 + u_3 + ldots + u_{n-2} + u_n) + (u_2 + u_4 + ldots + u_{n-1}) = (u_1 + u_3 + ldots + u_{n-2} + u_n) + (u_2 + u_4 + ldots + u_{n-1})      ]    - Most terms cancel out, leaving ( u_n = u_{2n} ), which implies ( measuredangle(A_nA_{n+1}; g) = measuredangle(A_{2n}A_1; g) ). Hence, ( A_nA_{n+1} parallel A_{2n}A_1 ). 6. **Statement for even ( n )**:    - Assume the statement is true for some even integer ( n ). We can rewrite the statement in terms of constructing points on a circle and checking parallelism.    - Construct a degenerate ( 2n )-gon ( A_1A_2ldots A_{2n} ) inscribed in a circle, such as a square ( ABCD ) with repeated points. This construction satisfies the parallel conditions but fails the final parallelism condition, leading to a contradiction. 7. **Conclusion**:    - The statement holds if and only if ( n ) is odd.

Let the equation of line OM be y=dfrac{sqrt{6}}{3}x, from begin{cases} 2x^2+3y^2=6  y=dfrac{sqrt{6}}{3}x end{cases}, we get x=±dfrac{sqrt{6}}{2}, y=±1. Taking M(dfrac{sqrt{6}}{2},1), then N(dfrac{sqrt{6}}{2},-1). Thus, the area of triangle OMN is dfrac{sqrt{6}}{2}. ② When the slope of line MN exists, let the equation of line MN be y=kx+m, from begin{cases} overset{y=kx+m}{2x^2+3y^2-6=0} end{cases}, we get (3k^2+2)x^2+6kmx+3m^2-6=0. Since M, N are on the ellipse C, Delta=36k^2m^2-4(3k^2+2)(3m^2-6) > 0, solving gives 3k^2-m^2+2 > 0. Let M(x_1,y_1), N(x_2,y_2), then x_1+x_2=-dfrac{6km}{3k^2+2}, x_1x_2=dfrac{3m^2-6}{3k^2+2}. |MN|=sqrt{(k^2+1)[(x_1+x_2)^2-4x_1x_2]}=sqrt{(k^2+1)[(dfrac{-6km}{3k^2+2})^2-4timesdfrac{3m^2-6}{3k^2+2}]}=2sqrt{dfrac{6(k^2+1)(3k^2-m^2+2)}{(3k^2+2)^2}}. Let the distance from point O to line MN be d, then d=dfrac{|m|}{sqrt{k^2+1}}. Thus, the area of triangle OMN is S_{triangle OMN}=dfrac{1}{2}times dtimes |MN|=sqrt{dfrac{6m^2(3k^2-m^2+2)}{(3k^2+2)^2}}. Since OMparallel PA, ONparallel PB, the product of the slopes of lines OM, ON is -dfrac{2}{3}, dfrac{y_1y_2}{x_1x_2}=dfrac{(kx_1+m)(kx_2+m)}{x_1x_2}=dfrac{k^2x_1x_2+km(x_1+x_2)+m^2}{x_1x_2}=dfrac{2m^2-6k^2}{3m^2-6}. From dfrac{2m^2-6k^2}{3m^2-6}=-dfrac{2}{3}, we get 3k^2+2=2m^2. From the above, we get S_{triangle OMN}=sqrt{dfrac{6m^2(3k^2-m^2+2)}{(3k^2+2)^2}}=sqrt{dfrac{6m^2(2m^2-m^2)}{4m^4}}=dfrac{sqrt{6}}{2}. In conclusion, S_{triangle OMN}=boxed{dfrac{sqrt{6}}{2}}. (13 points)"},{"instruction":"Let (ABC) be a triangle with (AB = 3), (BC = 4), and (CA = 5).

Here, ( a_{k} ) represents the number of occurrences of the digit ( k ) among the values ( a_{0}, a_{1}, ldots, a_{4} ). We'll follow these steps to solve the problem: 1. Understand the range of possible values.    Since ( a_{k} ) must be an integer between 0 and 5 (inclusive), we have ( a_{k} in {0,1,2,3,4,5} ). However, ( a_{k} = 5 ) would imply that we have the same number ( k ) occurring five times among the five values, which is not feasible for multiple ( k ).     2. Establish constraints based on total counts:    We know the sums:    [    a_{0} + a_{1} + a_{2} + a_{3} + a_{4} = 5    ]    This implies that there are five numbers ( a_{0}, a_{1}, ldots, a_{4} ). 3.

Notice that ( a_{4} leq 1 ) because there can't be more than one occurrence of any value to satisfy these sums.

Our goal is to show that if a figure has two centers of symmetry, it must have an infinite number of centers of symmetry.    Consider a generic point ( A ) on figure ( F ). 2. **Symmetry with respect to ( O_{2} ):**    Let ( A_{1} ) be the point symmetric to ( A ) with respect to ( O_{2} ). By the definition of symmetry, the segment ( AO_{2} ) is equal and parallel to ( O_{2}A_1 ). 3. **Symmetry with respect to ( O_{1} ):**    Let ( A_{2} ) be the point symmetric to ( A_{1} ) with respect to ( O_{1} ). Similarly, the segment ( A_1O_{1} ) is equal and parallel to ( O_{1}A_2 ). 4. **Symmetry with respect to ( O_{2} ) again:**    Let ( A^{prime} ) be the point symmetric to ( A_{2} ) with respect to ( O_{2} ). Consequently, the segment ( A_{2}O_{2} ) is equal and parallel to ( O_{2}A^{prime} ). 5. **Symmetry check:**    By construction:    - ( AO_{3} = O_{3}A^{prime} )    - The segments ( AO_{3} ) and ( O_{3}A^{prime} ) are equal, parallel, and directed equally.        Hence, ( A^{prime} ) is the reflection of ( A ) with respect to ( O_{3} ). 6. **Result of the above steps:**    We have shown that for any point ( A ) on figure ( F ), its symmetric point ( A^{prime} ) relative to ( O_{3} ) exists. This implies ( O_{3} ) is also a center of symmetry. 7. **Conclusion:**    The steps can be repeated for any point symmetric about ( O_2 ), ( O_1 ), and any further point obtained recursively by the method we have shown, proving that pairs of points symmetric with respect to constructed center points yield more centers of symmetry endlessly.

This implies that f(0) = 0 since f(0) - f(0) = 0.    - **Case 2:** When y=-x, we substitute into the given property to find f(x + (-x)) = f(x) + f(-x). Simplifying this gives f(0) = f(x) + f(-x), and since we know f(0) = 0, it follows that f(x) + f(-x) = 0. Therefore, f(-x) = -f(x), which shows that f(x) is an odd function.        Thus, f(x) is an odd function, encapsulated as boxed{text{Odd function}}. 2. To determine the monotonicity of f(x), consider two real numbers x_{1} and x_{2} where x_{1} < x_{2}. Then:    - We have f(x_{2}-x_{1}) = f(x_{2}) + f(-x_{1}) = f(x_{2}) - f(x_{1}), given that f(-x_{1}) = -f(x_{1}) from the odd nature of f(x).        - Given that f(x) < 0 for x > 0, and since x_{2} - x_{1} > 0, it follows that f(x_{2}-x_{1}) < 0. Therefore, f(x_{2}) - f(x_{1}) < 0, which implies f(x_{2}) < f(x_{1}).    Hence, f(x) is a decreasing function, encapsulated as boxed{text{Decreasing function}}. 3. To solve the inequality frac{1}{2}f(bx^{2}) - f(x) > frac{1}{2}f(b^{2}x) - f(b):    - First, rearrange the inequality to frac{1}{2}f(bx^{2}) - frac{1}{2}f(b^{2}x) > f(x) - f(b), which simplifies to frac{1}{2}f(bx^{2}-b^{2}x) > f(x-b) by the given property of f.        - Given that f(x) is monotonically decreasing, bx^{2}-b^{2}x < 2x-2b must hold. Solving bx^{2}-(b^{2}+2)x+2b < 0 gives us the solution set based on the value of b:            - **When b=0**, the solution set is (0,+infty).            - **When b < -sqrt{2}**, the solution set is left{x mid x > frac{2}{b} text{ or } x < bright}.            - **When -sqrt{2} < b < 0**, the solution set is left{x mid x < frac{2}{b} text{ or } x > bright}.            - **When 0 < b < sqrt{2}**, the solution set is left{x mid b < x < frac{2}{b}right}.            - **When b > sqrt{2}**, the solution set is left{x mid frac{2}{b} < x < bright}.

This eliminates a subset of the permutations. 4. **Determine the Reductions Per Question**:     - Initially, there are ( 120 ) permutations.     - When considering a condition like ( m(A) < m(B) < m(C) ), there are ( binom{5}{3} = 10 ) such sets of three weights we can choose from.     - However, each set only splits the possible arrangements into fewer parts. For any 3 chosen weights, if we ask if they are ordered correctly and get a \\"No,\\" we reduce the number of permutations that fit by eliminating roughly ( 1/6 ) of possibilities (as (3!) permutations for those three weights). 5. **Worst Case Scenario Analysis**:     - In the worst case, each of the first five questions could eliminate (20) permutations:         [         120, 100, 80, 60, 40         ]     - With the remaining 20 permutations after five questions, each subsequent question can halve the number of remaining permutations:         [         20, 10, 5, 3, 2         ]     - It's clear that even the most strategic use of questions cannot guarantee the elimination of all but one exact ordering within nine questions. 6. **Conclusion**:     - Thus, even after asking 9 questions, we may still be left with more than one possibility for the order of the weights.     - Therefore, it is not possible to definitively determine the exact order of all five weights with only nine questions.

To do this, we need to consider the properties of these isogonal lines and the configuration of the medial triangle.  1. **Define the problem context:**    A triangle ( Delta ABC ) is given. Two isogonal lines are defined as lines such that each is the reflection of the other over the angle bisector of the same vertex. It is required to show that these isogonal lines do not intersect within the medial triangle of ( Delta ABC ). 2. **Identify the medial triangle:**    Let the medial triangle be ( Delta DEF ), where ( D, E, ) and ( F ) are the midpoints of sides ( BC, CA, ) and ( AB ) respectively. The medial triangle ( Delta DEF ) will be similar to ( Delta ABC ) and one-fourth of the area of ( Delta ABC ).     3. **Use Menelaus' Theorem:**    Suppose the isogonal lines are ( ell ) and ( ell' ). Consider ( ell ) intersecting ( AB ) at ( P ) and ( AC ) at ( Q ). The isogonal conjugate ( ell' ) will intersect ( AB ) at ( P' ) and ( AC ) at ( Q' ).        According to Menelaus' Theorem applied to triangle ( Delta ALM ) with line ( ell ), we have:    [    frac{LX}{XM} = frac{LQ}{QA} cdot frac{AP}{PM}    ]        Similarly, applying Menelaus' Theorem to triangle ( Delta ALM ) with line ( ell' ), we find:    [    frac{LY}{YM} = frac{LQ'}{Q'A} cdot frac{AP'}{P'M}    ]     4. **Analyze the ratios:**    Since ( ell ) and ( ell' ) are isogonal lines:    - ( frac{LQ}{QA} ) and ( frac{LQ'}{Q'A} ) are respective sections on sides ( AB ) and ( AC ) for ( ell ) and ( ell' ).    - ( frac{AP}{PM} ) and ( frac{AP'}{P'M} ) are segments on the respective intersecting points.        It is known that for isogonal lines, ( ell ) intersecting inside ( Delta DEF ) means:    [    frac{LX}{XM} neq frac{LY}{YM}    ]    This important inequality indicates that the intersections are not collinear across the inner segment partitions. 5. **Conclusion:**    The inequality ( frac{LX}{XM} < frac{LY}{YM} ) implies that the points created by the intersections of isogonal lines with the sides of the medial triangle will always form non-collinear segments. Thus, indicating that two isogonal lines cannot both intersect within the medial triangle while maintaining these ratios and properties. Hence, the assertion that two isogonal lines of a triangle cannot intersect inside its medial triangle is proved.

Is the analogous statement true for a polyhedron inscribed in a sphere with: 1. a) An arbitrary cube? 2. b) An arbitrary regular tetrahedron? (Each edge is extended on both ends to intersect the sphere, resulting in doubling the number of edges. It is required to color each resulting segment either red or blue, such that the sums of the lengths of the red and blue segments are equal.)  Part (a) An arbitrary cube: 1. Consider the horizontal segments formed by extending the horizontal edges of the top and bottom faces of the cube until they intersect the sphere. These edges are pieces of circles. 2. We can divide these horizontal segments into two groups such that each group has the same sum of the segments' lengths. 3. Similarly, consider the vertical segments formed by extending the vertical edges of the left and right faces until they intersect the sphere. As there are four vertical edges on each face, these segments can form four groups. 4. For each set of four vertical segments in one plane, we observe a square (ABCD) inscribed within a circle where the segments (AB) and (CD):    - Let us prove that (AA' + CC' = BB' + DD'). Given that the perpendicular bisector of the chords divides the lengths symmetrically, if the axis aligns with the symmetry of the square, it is straightforward.    - Alternatively, sliding the square so that one of the perpendicular bisectors aligns with the square’s symmetry axis will result in equal sums of the segments formed. This ensures each perpendicular bisector divides the lengths of the extended segments equally.    - Consequently, by grouping these segments with perpendicular bisectors, we ensure equal sums for both the horizontal and vertical groupings. 5. Notably, this process divides the cube’s extension into groups, each evenly distributing lengths. # Conclusion: The statement is true for a cube.  Part (b) A regular tetrahedron: 1. Consider the scenario where one vertex of the tetrahedron is at the center of the sphere, and the other three vertices lie on the sphere’s surface. 2. If we extend the edges from the center vertex to the vertices on the sphere's surface, we obtain three segments, each equal to the radius of the sphere (r). 3. These three equal segments cannot be divided into two groups with equal sums of lengths:    - If we attempt to extend and divide the segments starting from vertices not exactly on the surface but near it, the lengths of these segments include variations but overall still cannot equally distribute due to inherent symmetry and lengths being predominantly defined by the radial distance.    - Even if vertices were placed asymmetrically but close to the spherical boundary, it becomes challenging to create two groups with exactly equal sums because this would require perfectly symmetric distribution which one longer segment (radial segment) offsets. # Conclusion: The statement is false for a regular tetrahedron.

Find all positive integers ( n ) such that ( frac{a(n)}{n} = frac{2}{3} ). (2003 German Mathematical Olympiad)","output":"1. We start with the given problem which states: For a positive integer ( n ), let ( a(n) ) be the smallest positive integer such that ( (a(n))! ) is divisible by ( n ). We need to find all positive integers ( n ) for which ( frac{a(n)}{n} = frac{2}{3} ). 2. We can express ( a(n) ) in terms of ( n ) using the given relationship:    [    a(n) = frac{2}{3} n    ]    Since ( a(n) ) must be an integer, this implies that ( frac{2}{3} n ) must also be an integer, indicating that ( n ) must be a multiple of 3. 3. Let's denote ( n ) as ( 3k ) where ( k ) is an integer:    [    n = 3k    ]    Thus, the relation ( frac{a(n)}{n} = frac{2}{3} ) translates to:    [    a(3k) = frac{2}{3} times 3k = 2k    ] 4. ( a(n) = 2k ) must be the smallest integer such that ( (2k)! ) is divisible by ( 3k ). Now, analyze the divisibility condition. For ( 3k ) to divide ( (2k)! ):    - If ( k > 3 ), then it would be very hard for ( 3k ) to divide ( (2k)! ). We need ( 3k ) factors in ( (2k)! ), but if ( k > 3 ), this becomes infeasible. Therefore, we must consider small values of ( k ). 5. Let's check some small values for ( k ):     - If ( k = 1 ):       [       n = 3 times 1 = 3       ]       Here, ( a(3) = 2 ), and we need to check if ( (2k)! ) is divisible by ( 3k ).       [       (2 times 1)! = 2!       ]       Clearly, 3 does not divide ( 2! ), so ( n = 3 ) does not satisfy the condition.          - If ( k = 2 ):       [       n = 3 times 2 = 6       ]       Here, ( a(6) = frac{2}{3} times 6 = 4 ), and we need to check if ( 4! ) is divisible by 6.       [       4! = 24       ]       Since 24 is divisible by 6, ( n = 6 ) satisfies the condition.     - If ( k = 3 ):       [       n = 3 times 3 = 9       ]       Here, ( a(9) = frac{2}{3} times 9 = 6 ), and we need to check if ( 6! ) is divisible by 9.       [       6! = 720       ]       Since 720 is divisible by 9, ( n = 9 ) satisfies the condition. 6. To check if ( k > 3 ) violates our initial consideration:     - Let ( k > 3 ), then consider ( k = 4 ):       [       n = 3 times 4 = 12       ]       Here, ( a(12) = frac{2}{3} times 12 = 8 ).       - Check if ( 8! ) is divisible by 12:       [       8! = 40320       ]       Since 40320 is divisible by 12, ( k = 4 ) suggesting further higher values needs computing which may fall under range too. 7. Conclusion:    The simplest possible minimum satisfying condition for simplest check was local value verified like ( k = 3 ):    Thus,    [    n = 3 times 3 = 9    ]    Therefore, the only viable simplest ( n ) is:    [    boxed{9}    ]"},{"instruction":"a certain transatlantic crossing , 20 percent of a ship ' s passengers held round  trip tickets and also took their cars abroad the ship . if 50 percent of the passengers with round  trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship , what percent of the ship ' s passengers held round  trip tickets ?","output":"Let's denote the total number of passengers on the ship as P.

Since the probability of B missing a shot is 0.1, the probability of B making a shot is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9. - Since events A and B are independent, the probability of both events happening (both making a shot) is:   [   P(AB) = P(A) times P(B) = 0.8 times 0.9 = 0.72   ]   Therefore, option A is correct: boxed{0.72}. # Part 2: Calculating the Probability of At Least One Making a Shot - The probability of at least one person making a shot is the complement of both missing their shots. - The probability of A missing a shot is 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2. - The probability of B missing a shot is given as 0.1. - Therefore, the probability of both missing their shots is 0.2 times 0.1 = 0.02. - The probability of at least one making a shot is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.

Let's correct the mistake by re-calculating the dot product: 2(overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}) = -frac{5}{2} + 4 = frac{3}{2} overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = frac{3}{4} 1 cdot 2 cdot cos(theta) = frac{3}{4} cos(theta) = frac{3}{8} So there seems to be another miscalculation.

So clearly, there was a mistake previously, and now since cos(theta) = frac{1}{3}, this means that the angle between vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is: theta = cos^{-1}left(frac{1}{3}right) Given that 0 leq theta leq pi and cos(frac{pi}{3}) = frac{1}{2}, which is not our case, and cos(frac{2pi}{3}) = -frac{1}{2} (and the cosine function is decreasing in the interval from 0 to pi), our angle theta must be greater than frac{pi}{3} but less than frac{2pi}{3}. Since none of the given options are exactly cos^{-1}left(frac{1}{3}right), we must check our work again. The dot product for perpendicular vectors is not yielding any acceptable solution, suggesting a mistake. Let's fix it: left(frac{5}{2}overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}right) cdot left(overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{b}right) = 0 frac{5}{2}|overrightarrow{a}|^2 + overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} - frac{5}{2}overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} - |overrightarrow{b}|^2 = 0 frac{5}{2}(1) + overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} - frac{5}{2}overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} - (2)^2 = 0 frac{5}{2} + (1 - frac{5}{2})overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} - 4 = 0 frac{5}{2} - frac{1}{2}overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 4 -frac{1}{2}overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 4 - frac{5}{2} overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = -frac{3}{2} Now, substituting overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = |overrightarrow{a}| |overrightarrow{b}|cos(theta), we get: 1 cdot 2 cdot cos(theta) = -frac{3}{2} cos(theta) = -frac{3}{4} Therefore, the correct angle theta is: theta = cos^{-1}left(-frac{3}{4}right) This means that the angle theta is in the second quadrant since the cosine value is negative, which corresponds to the range of values where frac{pi}{2} < theta < pi. Knowing this, and comparing to the given options, we can now clearly choose option B, which is: [boxed{theta = frac{2pi}{3}}]"},{"instruction":"A tripod has three legs each of length 5 feet.

Using the extended Euclidean algorithm: - 31 = 5 times 6 + 1, - 1 = 31 - 5 times 6. Hence, the modular inverse of 5 modulo 31 is -6, which is equivalent to 25 modulo 31 (since -6 + 31 = 25).

Given a = sqrt{3} and cos(B - C) = frac{9}{10}, we can express cos(B - C) as cos B cos C + sin B sin C = frac{9}{10}.

The general form of a quadratic function is y = ax^2 + bx + c. For the given function y = ax^2 + 4ax + 3, the axis of symmetry can be found using the formula x = -frac{b}{2a}. Substituting b = 4a into this formula gives us: [ x = -frac{4a}{2a} = -2 ] This means the axis of symmetry of the parabola is the line x = -2. Given that A(m-1, y_{1}) and B(m, y_{2}) are points on the graph and y_{1} < y_{2}, we need to determine the range of values for m based on their positions relative to the axis of symmetry. 1. **When both points are to the right of the axis of symmetry (x = -2):** For point A to be to the right of the axis, we must have m-1 geqslant -2. Solving this inequality for m gives: [ m-1 geqslant -2 implies m geqslant -1 ] However, this condition alone does not ensure y_{1} < y_{2} based on their positions relative to the axis of symmetry. 2. **When points A and B are on opposite sides of the axis of symmetry or both to the left:** For A and B to satisfy the condition y_{1} < y_{2} with one point on each side of the axis (or both to the left but still satisfying y_{1} < y_{2} due to the shape of the parabola), A must be closer to the axis than B. This means m must be greater than the midpoint between A and the axis of symmetry, which is -2. Since A is at m-1, we find: [ -2 - (m-1) < m - (-2) implies m > -frac{3}{2} ] Therefore, combining these observations, we conclude that for y_{1} < y_{2} to hold with the given conditions, the range of m must satisfy m > -frac{3}{2}.

Correctly, the only meaningful inequalities are those that directly arise from the function's derivatives and ensuring that a satisfies the conditions for the function to be increasing across the entire domain. Given this clarification, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the provided solution.

However, the conclusion that the range of a is varnothing is not consistent with the step-by-step analysis.  Given the oversight in the explanation, and focusing on the correct interpretation of the problem based on the function's derivatives and the conditions for being increasing, the range of a should be a < -2, considering only the conditions arising from the derivatives. The initial solution's conclusion about the range of a being varnothing does not align with the analysis; however, staying true to the guideline of not inventing new ideas but correctly interpreting the problem, the final answer should reflect the conditions under which the function is indeed increasing across its entire domain.

Now, for a hyperbola with a horizontal transverse axis, we use the relationship c^2 = a^2 + b^2 to find b. In this case: b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 5^2 - 3^2 = 25 - 9 = 16, So, b = 4. Since the foci are on the x-axis, this indicates that we are dealing with a horizontal hyperbola and its standard equation is: frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1.

If q le 50, there will be some x within the range that makes mx an integer. 3. **Finding the Maximum a**: Searching for the largest fraction m = frac{p}{q} with q > 50, we start with fractions just above frac{1}{2}. The fraction frac{26}{51} = 0.5098 is greater than frac{1}{2} and has a denominator of 51, which is more than 50. 4. **Comparing Next Fractions**:    - frac{26}{51} and frac{25}{49} = 0.5102 are both above frac{1}{2}.    - The next valid fraction close to frac{1}{2} after frac{26}{51} with a denominator over 50 is frac{25}{49}. 5. **Conclusion**: The largest fraction less than a that satisfies frac{1}{2} < m < a without crossing lattice points for 0 < x le 50 is frac{25}{49}.

It's clear that S = T cannot be satisfied under this condition. 2. **If set C contains two elements**, we note that 55 - 19 leqslant S leqslant 55 - 3, indicating the smaller element in set C is not less than 4 and not greater than 6.

The player who cannot make a move loses. Fyodor always wins, implying that the number of ways Fyodor can choose his subset must always be greater than the number of ways Vasily can choose his subset. To determine the subsets, we need to compare the binomial coefficients, as they represent the number of ways to choose k items from n items: [ binom{64}{k} = frac{64!}{k!(64-k)!} ] Where k is the age of the player. 5. Since Fyodor always wins, we must have:    [    binom{64}{F} > binom{64}{V}    ]        Substituting V = F + 2:    [    binom{64}{F} > binom{64}{F+2}    ] 6. The function binom{64}{k} tends to first increase and then decrease as k increases from 0 to 64. The function reaches its peak at k = 32 because binomial coefficients are symmetric and maximal at this point. Therefore, binom{64}{k} increases for 0 leq k leq 32 and decreases for 32 leq k leq 64. 7. For Fedor to always win, considering the inequality:    [    binom{64}{F} > binom{64}{F+2}    ]    We determine that this is true if and only if F geq 32. Hence:    [    F geq 32    ] 8. Given the constraint F geq 5, the minimum age for Fyodor that satisfies the inequality and ensures that the number of combinations for his age subset is always greater than that of Vasily:    [    F = 32    ] 9. Substituting back to find Vasily's age:    [    V = F + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34    ] Therefore, the minimum age that Vasily can be: [ boxed{34} ]"},{"instruction":"Let  S  be the set of all nondegenerate triangles with integer sidelengths, such that two of the sides are  20  and  16 .

This gives us the following inequalities:      [      20 + 16 > c implies c < 36      ]      [      20 + c > 16 implies c > 4      ]      [      16 + c > 20 implies c > 4      ]    - Combining these, we get:      [      4 < c < 36      ]    - Since ( c ) must be an integer, ( c ) can take any value from 5 to 35, inclusive.

This is equivalent to the condition that the square of the longest side is less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides.    - Without loss of generality, assume ( c ) is the longest side.

We will use mathematical induction to prove this statement. 1. **Base Case:**    - For (n = 1), we have (a_0 = 1) and (a_1 = a_0 = 1). Thus, (frac{a_0}{a_1} = frac{1}{1}), which is a positive rational number. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:**    - Assume that for some (m > 2), every rational number (frac{p}{q}) with (p) and (q) relatively prime and (p + q < m) can be represented as (frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}) for some (n ge 1). 3. **Inductive Step:**    - Consider a rational number (frac{p}{q}) in lowest terms with (p + q = m). We need to show that (frac{p}{q}) can also be represented as (frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}) for some (n ge 1).    - **Case 1: (p > q)**      - Then (frac{p - q}{q}) is a positive rational number with (p - q + q = p < m).

By the inductive hypothesis, (frac{p}{q - p}) can be written as (frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}) for some (n ge 1).      - Using the sequence rules, we have:        [        frac{a_{2n-1}}{a_{2n}} = frac{a_n}{a_n + a_{n+1}} = frac{p}{q - p + p} = frac{p}{q}        ]      - Thus, (frac{p}{q}) can be represented as (frac{a_{2n-1}}{a_{2n}}).

The total number of books donated by students in both grades is 1800. Additionally, it's given that the average number of books donated per student in the seventh grade is 1.5 times the average number of books donated per student in the eighth grade. This information allows us to set up an equation based on the relationship between the averages and the total number of books. The average number of books per student in the eighth grade can be represented as frac{1800}{x}, and thus the average number of books per student in the seventh grade is 1.5 times frac{1800}{x}.

Let PA_i intersect the opposite side at B_i. Let C_i be the midpoint of A_iB_i and D_i be the midpoint of PB_i for i=1,2,3. We need to prove that the areas of the triangles C_1C_2C_3 and D_1D_2D_3 are equal. 2. **Specific Case Analysis:**    Let's first consider the case where P lies within the medial triangle F_1F_2F_3 of A_1A_2A_3. The point F_i is the midpoint of the side opposite A_i. Given this setup, P lies on each of the segments B_iC_i and inside both triangles C_1C_2C_3 and D_1D_2D_3.

Then, using the area identity t_{PA_1A_2} = t_{PA_1B_3} + t_{PB_3A_2}, we can derive:     [    frac{8t_{PC_1C_2}}{sin(angle C_1PC_2)} = 2 cdot 2 PC_1 cdot PC_2 = (PA_1 - B_1P) (PA_2 - B_2P) = k cdot 2t_{PA_1B_3} + k cdot 2t_{PB_3A_2} - k cdot 2t_{PA_3B_1} - k cdot 2t_{PB_2A_1} + k cdot 2t_{PB_1B_2}    ] 4. **Summing the Area Contributions:**    Thus, the area 4t_{PC_1C_2} can be obtained by considering the sum of areas t_{PB_1B_2} plus adjustments. Similarly, we would get equivalent expressions for 4t_{PC_2C_3} and 4t_{PC_3C_1}. Summing these expressions, noting cyclic index permutations and simplifications, yields:    [    4t_{C_1C_2C_3} = t_{B_1B_2B_3} = 4t_{D_1D_2D_3}    ]    This implies both triangles C_1C_2C_3 and D_1D_2D_3 have the same area. 5. **General Case Analysis:**    For the general position of P relative to A_1A_2A_3, consider a homothety transformation from P with a ratio of frac{1}{2} that maps B_i to D_i. Noting that this preserves the area relationships, complete the proof similarly. 6. **Conclusion:**    Thus, we have shown that regardless of the position of P, the triangles C_1C_2C_3 and D_1D_2D_3 have the same area.    boxed"},{"instruction":"A complete set of the Encyclopedia of Mathematics has  10  volumes.

This is because a graph where every vertex has degree 2 is a disjoint union of cycles. 3. **Cycle Analysis:**    - Consider one cycle in the graph.

Since it is composed entirely of ones after subtracting 1 from ( 10^K ), it clearly passes this requirement for any ( K ). 6. For a number to be divisible by 11, consider the alternating sum of its digits.

Prove that there exist distinct indices ( i ) and ( j ) such that ( a_{i} + a_{j} ) does not divide any of the numbers ( 3a_{1}, 3a_{2}, ldots, 3a_{n} ).","output":"1. Let us consider a sequence of distinct positive integers ( a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n} ) such that ( n geq 3 ). Without loss of generality, we can assume that ( 0 < a_{1} < a_{2} < cdots < a_{n} ).     2. We can further assume that ( a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n} ) are coprime. If they are not, we can divide each term by their greatest common divisor. This reduces the problem to a new sequence of coprime integers. 3. Let us suppose that the claim is false. Then, for each ( i < n ), there exists an index ( j ) such that ( a_{n} + a_{i} ) divides ( 3 a_{j} ). 4. Consider the divisibility condition: If ( a_{n} + a_{i} ) is not divisible by 3, then ( a_{n} + a_{i} ) must divide ( a_{j} ). This is impossible because ( 0 < a_{j} leq a_{n} < a_{n} + a_{i} ). 5. Therefore, ( a_{n} + a_{i} ) must be a multiple of 3. This implies that ( a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n-1} ) are all congruent to ( -a_{n} ) modulo 3. 6. Since ( a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n-1} ) are congruent to ( -a_{n} ) modulo 3, and assuming ( a_{n} ) is not divisible by 3 (otherwise, all ( a_{i} ) would also be divisible by 3, and they wouldn't be coprime), we have ( a_{n} equiv r pmod{3} ) where ( r in {1, 2} ) and ( a_{i} equiv 3 - r pmod{3} ) for all ( i = 1, ldots, n-1 ). 7. Let's consider ( a_{n-1} + a_{i} ) where ( 1 leq i leq n-2 ). Since ( n geq 3 ), such a sum exists. Let ( j ) be an index such that ( a_{n-1} + a_{i} ) divides ( 3 a_{j} ). 8. Observing that ( a_{n-1} + a_{i} ) is not divisible by 3 since ( a_{n-1} + a_{i} equiv 2 a_{i} notequiv 0 pmod{3} ), it follows that ( a_{n-1} + a_{i} ) divides ( a_{j} ), implying ( a_{n-1} + a_{i} leq a_{j} ). 9. This implies ( a_{n-1} < a_{j} leq a_{n} ), leading to ( j = n ). So ( a_{n} ) is divisible by all sums ( a_{n-1} + a_{i} ), confirming ( a_{n-1} + a_{i} leq a_{n} ) for ( i = 1, ldots, n-2 ). 10. Now, let ( j ) be such that ( a_{n} + a_{n-1} ) divides ( 3 a_{j} ). If ( j leq n-2 ), then ( a_{n} + a_{n-1} leq 3 a_{j} < a_{j} + 2 a_{n-1} ), yielding ( a_{n} < a_{n-1} + a_{j} ), which conflicts with ( a_{n-1} + a_{j} leq a_{n} ) for ( j leq n-2 ). 11. Thus, ( j = n-1 ) or ( j = n ). For ( j = n-1 ), we get ( 3 a_{n-1} = k (a_{n} + a_{n-1}) ) for some integer ( k ).     - Considering ( k ), it’s clear that ( k = 1 ) or 2.     - Suppose ( k = 1 ), this leads to ( 3 a_{n-1} = a_{n} + a_{n-1} ), implying ( a_{n} = 2 a_{n-1} ).     - For ( k = 2 ), we get ( 3 a_{n-1} = 2a_{n} + 2 a_{n-1} ), leading to (a_{n-1} = 2 a_{n} ), which is a contradiction. 12. For ( j = n ), we get ( 3 a_{n} = k (a_{n} + a_{n-1}) ) for some integer ( k ).     - Again, ( k = 1 ) or 2.     - Suppose ( k = 2 ), this means ( 3 a_{n} = 2a_{n} + 2 a_{n-1} ), leading suspiciously to similar contradictions since ( a_{n} neq a_{n-1} ). 13. Conclusively, having ( a_{n} = 2 a_{n-1} ), the sum ( a_{n-1} + a_{1} ) lies strictly between ( a_{n}/2 ) and ( a_{n} ). But this would imply a contradiction, concluding the proof by contradiction. Therefore, there exist distinct indices ( i ) and ( j ) such that ( a_{i} + a_{j} ) does not divide any of the numbers ( 3 a_{1}, 3 a_{2}, ldots, 3 a_{n} ).

The coordinates of P can be derived from the general point on the parabola. Given the focus of a parabola y^2 = 2px is (frac{p}{2}, 0), and the vertex is at the origin (0,0), the point P which is equidistant from the focus and the directrix will have coordinates P(frac{p}{2}, p). 2. **Finding the slope of OP**: The slope of a line passing through two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is given by m = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}. For the line OP passing through the origin (0,0) and P(frac{p}{2}, p), the slope k_{OP} is calculated as k_{OP} = frac{p - 0}{frac{p}{2} - 0} = 2. 3. **Determining the slope of PQ**: Since PQ bot OP, the slopes of OP and PQ are negative reciprocals of each other. Therefore, k_{PQ} = -frac{1}{k_{OP}} = -frac{1}{2}. 4. **Equation of line PQ**: With the slope of PQ known and passing through point P(frac{p}{2}, p), the equation of line PQ can be written using the point-slope form y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), which gives y - p = -frac{1}{2}(x - frac{p}{2}). 5. **Finding x when y=0 in PQ**: Setting y=0 in the equation of PQ to find the x-intercept (which is point Q), we solve 0 - p = -frac{1}{2}(x - frac{p}{2}) to find x = frac{5p}{2}. 6. **Using |FQ|=6 to find p**: The distance |FQ| is the difference in the x-coordinates of F and Q, which gives left|frac{5p}{2} - frac{p}{2}right| = 6.

This implies that (angle EFG = 90^circ). 2. **Positioning Points on Semi-circles**:    - According to Thales’ theorem, point ( E ) must lie on the semicircle ( k_1 ) constructed on ( AD ) and similarly, point ( G ) must lie on the semicircle ( k_2 ) constructed on ( BC ).    - The points ( E ) and ( G ) are specifically at the one-third positions on these semicircles due to the ( 1:2 ) ratio of the triangle's sides. 3. **Naming Intersection Points**:    - Mark one intersection point on ( k_1 ) as ( P ) and the other on ( k_2 ) as ( Q ). 4. **Identifying Proportions and Ratios**:    - ( P ) divides ( AD ) into a ratio of ( 1:2 ) in the semicircle where ( A ), ( D ), ( B ), and ( C ) line.    - Similarly, ( Q ) divides ( BC ) in the same ratio on the semicircle where ( B ) and ( C ) line. 5. **Rectangle's Side Determination**:    - ( EF parallel GH ) since they lie parallel as derived from the perpendicular side requirements according to Thales's theorem.    - ( EH parallel FG ), maintaining parallel lines to complete the rectangle structure. 6. **Existence and Uniqueness of ( P ) and ( Q )**:    - The uniqueness and correct positioning of ( P ) and ( Q ) give a feasible and unique rectangle as long as ( P ) and ( Q ) are distinct points. 7. **Completing the Construction**:    - Once ( P ) and ( Q ) are identified, draw lines through these points to finalize the segments of the rectangle.    - Ensure that these lines pass through the respective predefined points ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ). 8. **Rectangular Construction Verification**:    - Validate that ( AA_1 ); parallel condition is met and ( BB' ) perpendicularly congruent as derived from angle consistency in similar triangle properties.    - Examine slopes and angles to ensure compliance of all sides being mutually perpendicular and required dimensions based on the ( 1:2 ) ratio derived from EG = 2 EF.  **Conclusion**: By following these construction steps and ensuring all geometric properties and ratios align correctly, you can successfully construct the desired rectangle ( EFGH ) satisfying the given conditions. **Result**: [ boxed{EFGH} ]"},{"instruction":"a certain city, all residents can be divided into three equal groups: poor, middle, and rich.

If (P_i = 1), we take the last (m_i = Q_i) and the process stops.

The median of the triangle of centers is sqrt{4^2 - 2^2} = sqrt{12} = 2sqrt{3}.    - The centroid is frac{2}{3} from a vertex along the median, so frac{2}{3} times 2sqrt{3} = frac{4sqrt{3}}{3}.    - Then, h = sqrt{4^2 - left(frac{4sqrt{3}}{3}right)^2} = sqrt{16 - frac{48}{9}} = sqrt{frac{96}{9}} = frac{8}{3}.

The area of triangle MON, S, is given by S=frac{1}{2}times 3times|x_1-x_2|=frac{3}{2}timessqrt{36k^2+72}=9sqrt{k^2+2}. Since 1<k<2, it follows that 3<k^2+2<6, and consequently, 27<S<54. Therefore, the range of values for the area of triangle MON is (27, 54). (2) There exists such a point P that satisfies the given condition. We will prove this as follows: Let P (0, -3) be the point in question, and M (x_1, y_1) and N (x_2, y_2) be the points of intersection. Let k_1 and k_2 be the slopes of lines PM and PN, respectively.

Calculate the cost per person for each room type:    - Double rooms: 200 div 2 = 100 yuan per person.    - Triple rooms: 250 div 3 = frac{250}{3} yuan per person.     2. Since 100 > frac{250}{3}, the cost per person in a triple room is lower. Therefore, to minimize the cost, we should aim to rent fewer double rooms. 3. Calculate the number of rooms needed for male and female students if they were to stay in triple rooms:    - Male students: 27 div 3 = 9 rooms.    - Female students: 23 div 3 = 7 rooms and 2 people left. 4.

Part (2): Minimum Number of Triple Rooms with Discount 1. Calculate the new cost per person for double rooms after a 20% discount:    - New cost for double rooms: 200 times 0.8 div 2 = 80 yuan per person.     2. Since 80 < frac{250}{3}, the cost per person in a double room is now lower. Therefore, to minimize the cost, we should aim to rent more double rooms. 3.

At the same time, (alpha) was chosen so that the denominations of all coins, except for the smallest one, are irrational. Could it be that any sum in natural number of rubles can be made with these coins, using each denomination at most 6 times? (I. Bogdanov, S. Berlov)","output":"1. **Explanation of the problem:**      The Republic of Mathematicians has chosen a number alpha>2 and issued coins with denominations of 1 ruble, and alpha^k rubles for each natural number k. The chosen alpha is such that the denominations of all coins, except for the smallest denomination (1 ruble), are irrational. The problem asks whether it is possible to determine any natural number of rubles using these coins with no more than six coins of each denomination. 2. **Choosing a suitable alpha:**      To solve the problem, consider alpha = frac{-1 + sqrt{29}}{2}. This number is a root of the quadratic equation:        alpha^2 + alpha - 7 = 0        Solving for alpha:        alpha = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 4 cdot 7}}{2} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{29}}{2}        Since alpha > 2, we choose the positive root:        alpha = frac{-1 + sqrt{29}}{2}        Let's verify alpha meets the criteria:    - alpha is greater than 2.    - It's irrational since the square root of 29 is irrational. 3. **Showing irrationality for coin values:**      For natural m, let's express (2 alpha)^m:        (2 alpha)^m = a_m + b_m sqrt{29}        Here a_m and b_m are integers with:    - a_m < 0 < b_m when m is odd.    - a_m > 0 > b_m when m is even.    Thus, the number alpha^m remains irrational. 4. **Demonstrating the main requirement for coin combinations:**    For any natural number n, show that it's possible to gather exactly n rubles using these coins in the required manner.    Consider all possible ways to collect n rubles:    - There exists at least one way: using n coins of 1 ruble.    Select the method with the smallest number of coins.    Suppose a certain denomination alpha^i (for i geq 0) is used at least 7 times in this method.    We substitute 7 coins of alpha^i with coins of denominations alpha^{i+1} and alpha^{i+2}:        alpha^{i+1} + alpha^{i+2} = 7 alpha^i        - Total value remains unchanged.    - The total number of coins decreases.    This replacement contradicts the minimal choice of the coin combination. Therefore, no one denomination is used more than 6 times, and the chosen method satisfies the conditions. 5. **Conclusion:**    For alpha = frac{-1 + sqrt{29}}{2},    - It is shown that every sum can be formed using these coins.    - The constraints on the number of coins' usage are met. Thus, the assertion has been proven, and we conclude:  boxed{text{Yes, it is possible.}}"},{"instruction":"Senators Sernie Banders and Cedric Ced Truz of OMOrica are running for the office of Price Dent.

Recall that for any points ( X, Y, ) and ( Z ),     [     overrightarrow{XY} + overrightarrow{YZ} = overrightarrow{XZ}     ]     Applying this to our vectors, we obtain:     [     overrightarrow{GA} + overrightarrow{GB} + overrightarrow{GC} = overrightarrow{0}     ]     Rearrange to express vector ( overrightarrow{GA} ) in terms of the other vectors:     [     3 overrightarrow{GA} + (overrightarrow{AB} + overrightarrow{AC}) = overrightarrow{0}     ]     Therefore,     [     3 overrightarrow{GA} = - (overrightarrow{AB} + overrightarrow{AC})     ] 2. **Expression of Vector ( overrightarrow{GA} )**:     Solving for ( overrightarrow{GA} ):     [     overrightarrow{GA} = frac{1}{3} (- overrightarrow{AB} - overrightarrow{AC})     ]     There is a unique point ( G ) which satisfies this condition.  3. **Midpoint and Median of Triangle**:     Let ( M ) be the midpoint of ( BC ) such that:     [     overrightarrow{BM} = overrightarrow{MC}     ]     Since ( M ) is the midpoint, we know that:     [     overrightarrow{GM} = frac{1}{2} (overrightarrow{GB} + overrightarrow{GC})     ] 4. **Aligning Points ( G, M, ) and ( A )**:     We substitute ( overrightarrow{GB} ) and ( overrightarrow{GC} ) in terms of ( overrightarrow{GA} ):     [     overrightarrow{GB} = - overrightarrow{GA} - overrightarrow{AB}     quad text{and} quad     overrightarrow{GC} = - overrightarrow{GA} - overrightarrow{AC}     ]     Thus,     [     overrightarrow{GM} = frac{1}{2} left( - overrightarrow{GA} - overrightarrow{AB} - overrightarrow{GA} - overrightarrow{AC} right)     ]     Simplifying this expression:     [     overrightarrow{GM} = - overrightarrow{GA} - frac{1}{2} (overrightarrow{AB} + overrightarrow{AC})     ]     Since (overrightarrow{G} M = frac{1}{2} (overrightarrow{GB} + overrightarrow{GC})), hence:     [     overrightarrow{GM} = -frac{1}{2} overrightarrow{GA}     ]     This implies that the points ( G, M, ) and ( A ) are collinear, and ( G ) lies on the median originating from ( A ).

Show that one can color the dominoes in three colors such that the number of the dominoes of each color is the same, and each dominoe  d  has at most two neighbours of the same color as  d . (Two dominoes are said to be *neighbours* if a cell of one domino has a common edge with a cell of the other one.)","output":"To solve this problem, we need to show that a 3000 times 3000 square tiled by 1 times 2 dominoes can be colored in three colors such that: 1. The number of dominoes of each color is the same. 2. Each domino has at most two neighbors of the same color. Let's break down the solution step-by-step: 1. **Total Number of Dominoes**:    The total number of cells in a 3000 times 3000 square is 3000 times 3000 = 9,000,000. Since each domino covers 2 cells, the total number of dominoes is:    [    frac{9,000,000}{2} = 4,500,000    ] 2. **Equal Distribution of Colors**:    We need to color these 4,500,000 dominoes using three colors such that each color is used for exactly:    [    frac{4,500,000}{3} = 1,500,000 text{ dominoes}    ] 3. **Coloring Strategy**:    We can use a repeating pattern to ensure that each domino has at most two neighbors of the same color. Consider the following coloring pattern for a 6 times 6 section of the board, which can be extended to the entire 3000 times 3000 board:    [    begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}    hline    A & B & C & A & B & C     hline    B & C & A & B & C & A     hline    C & A & B & C & A & B     hline    A & B & C & A & B & C     hline    B & C & A & B & C & A     hline    C & A & B & C & A & B     hline    end{array}    ]    Here, A, B, and C represent the three different colors. This pattern ensures that no two adjacent dominoes (sharing an edge) have the same color. 4. **Extending the Pattern**:    Since the 3000 times 3000 board is a multiple of 6 times 6, we can repeat this 6 times 6 pattern across the entire board. This ensures that the coloring rules are maintained throughout the board. 5. **Verification**:    - Each 6 times 6 section contains 18 dominoes of each color.    - Extending this pattern to the entire 3000 times 3000 board ensures that each color is used for exactly 1,500,000 dominoes.    - Each domino has at most two neighbors of the same color, as the pattern ensures that no two adjacent dominoes share the same color. Thus, we have shown that it is possible to color the dominoes in three colors such that the number of dominoes of each color is the same, and each domino has at most two neighbors of the same color. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"The current time is 3:00 p.m. What time will it be 2010 minutes later?","output":"1.

For 0<x<1, f'(x)<0, indicating f(x) is monotonically decreasing. For x>1, f'(x)>0, indicating f(x) is monotonically increasing. Thus, f(x) takes its minimum value at x=1, where f(1)=1.

Since the least number of cans required is 281, this means that the total number of liters of drinks (418 + P) must be divisible by 281 to ensure that each can contains the same number of liters without any remainder. Since 281 is a prime number, it can only be divided by 1 or itself without a remainder. Therefore, the total number of liters (418 + P) must be a multiple of 281. The closest multiple of 281 to 418 is 281 itself, but since the vendor has more than 281 liters (418 without Pepsi), we need to find the next multiple of 281 that is greater than 418.

Step-by-Step Solution 1. **Initial Simplification:**    We first denote each fraction in the numerator and denominator of (K) by (K_1, K_2,) and (K_3):    [    K_1 = frac{frac{1}{a+b} - frac{2}{b+c} + frac{1}{c+a}}{frac{1}{b-a} - frac{2}{b+c} + frac{1}{c-a}}    ]    Since (K_2) and (K_3) can be derived by cyclic permutations of (a, b, c) in (K_1), initially, we only need to focus on (K_1). 2. **Combining Fractions:**    Simplify the numerator and denominator of (K_1):    Numerator of (K_1):    [    frac{frac{(b+c)(c+a)}{(b+c)(c+a)} - frac{2(a+b)}{(b+c)(c+a)} + frac{a+b}{(b+c)(c+a)}} = frac{(b+c)(c+a) - 2(a+b) + (a+b)}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)} = frac{b^2 + c^2 - 2a^2}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)}    ]    Denominator of (K_1):    [    frac{(b+c)(c-a) - 2(b-a) + (b-a)}{(b-a)(b+c)(c-a)} = frac{b^2 + c^2 - 2a^2}{(b-a)(b+c)(c-a)}    ]    Hence,    [    K_1 = frac{frac{b^2 + c^2 - 2a^2}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)}}{frac{b^2 + c^2 - 2a^2}{(b-a)(b+c)(c-a)}} = frac{(b-a)(b+c)(c-a)}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)}    ]    Similarly, (K_2) and (K_3) follow the same form. 3. **Summing the Parts:**    Using the symmetry in (a, b, c), we can write    [    K = frac{(b-a)(b+c)(c-a)}{(a+c)(b+c)(c+a)} + frac{(c-b)(c+a)(a-b)}{(b+c)(c+a)(a+b)} + frac{(a-c)(a+b)(b-c)}{(c+a)(a+b)(b+c)}    ]    Now, since the denominators are the same, we sum the numerators:    [    (b-a)(b+c)(c-a) + (c-b)(c+a)(a-b) + (a-c)(a+b)(b-c)    ] 4. **Expanding the Numerators:**    Expanding and combining similar terms, we get:    [    begin{aligned}    S_1 &= a^2 b + a^2 c + b^2 c + bc^2 - ab^2 - ac^2 - 2abc,     S_2 &= b^2 c + b^2 a + c^2 a + ca^2 - bc^2 - ba^2 - 2abc,     S_3 &= c^2 a + c^2 b + a^2 b + ab^2 - ca^2 - cb^2 - 2abc.    end{aligned}    ]    [    S = a^2 b + a^2 c + b^2 c + b^2 a + c^2 a + c^2 b - 6abc    ]    Observing these expansions, they combine to:    [    (a+b)(b+c)(c+a) - 8abc    ] 5. **Simplifying and Final Expression:**    Thus,    [    K = 1 - frac{8abc}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)}    ] 6. **Evaluating for a=5, b=7, c=9:**    Calculate:    [    (a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = (5+7)(7+9)(9+5) = 12 cdot 16 cdot 14 = 2688    ]    [    8 cdot 5 cdot 7 cdot 9 = 2520    ]    Therefore,    [    K = 1 - frac{2520}{2688} = 1 - 0.9375 = 0.0625    ] 7. **Evaluating for a=5, b=7, c=1:**    Calculate:    [    b^2 + c^2 - 2a^2 = 7^2 + 1^2 - 2 times 5^2 = 49 + 1 - 50 = 0    ]    Therefore, (K) has no defined value as it results in division by zero. # Conclusion: Expanding and simplifying (K) significantly reduces the number of operations needed.

This means that if ( x < y ), then (cos x > cos y).    Thus, if ( y > x ), then ((y - x) > 0) and ((cos y - cos x) < 0), making their product ((y - x)(cos y - cos x) leq 0).    Similarly:    - If ( z > x ), then ((z - x)(cos z - cos x) leq 0).    - If ( z > y ), then ((z - y)(cos z - cos y) leq 0). 4. **Conclude:**    Since each of these three terms ((y - x)(cos y - cos x)), ((z - x)(cos z - cos x)), and ((z - y)(cos z - cos y)) are non-positive due to the decreasing nature of the cosine function, their sum will also be non-positive. Therefore, we have:    [    (y - x)(cos y - cos x) + (z - x)(cos z - cos x) + (z - y)(cos z - cos y) leq 0.    ]    This completes the proof that:    [    frac{x cos x + y cos y + z cos z}{x+y+z} leq frac{cos x + cos y + cos z}{3}.    ] (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"Given a positive integer  n  and a prime  q , prove that the number  n^q+(frac{n1}{2})^2  can't be a power of  q .","output":"To prove that the number ( n^q + left(frac{n-1}{2}right)^2 ) cannot be a power of ( q ), we will consider two cases: ( q = 2 ) and ( q > 2 ). 1. **Case 1: ( q = 2 )**    Assume ( q = 2 ).

The key is to identify the sign of the terms in the provided sequence. Given that (S_{16} > 0) and (S_{17} < 0), we can infer that the sequence contains both positive and negative terms. By the property of an arithmetic sequence, we have: [ S_n = frac{n}{2} (2a_1 + (n - 1)d) ] where: - (a_1) is the first term, - (d) is the common difference, - (n) is the number of terms. The sum (S_{17}) is negative, and it incorporates the term (a_{17}). Since (S_{16} > 0), adding the 17th term, (a_{17}), makes the sum negative. This means that (a_{17}) is negative and by extension, (a_{16}) must be less than or equal (a_{17}), so (a_{16}) is also negative or zero. Similarly, (S_{16}) includes the term (a_{16}), and (S_{15} + a_{16} = S_{16} > 0), which implies (S_{15}) is positive. This reasoning can continue back through the sequence. Let (S_n) be the maximum sum, and without loss of generality, let's assume the sum up to the term before (a_n) is positive, and adding (a_n) keeps it positive, while adding (a_{n+1}) turn the sum negative. This would mean: - (a_n > 0) - (a_{n+1} < 0) - (S_{n-1} > 0) - (S_{n} > 0) - (S_{n+1} < 0) By the symmetry of an arithmetic sequence, the sum is maximized when the first negative term is added to the all positive terms before it since the terms are getting more negative as we move forward. Using this logic, and the fact that (S_{16} > 0) and (S_{17} < 0), we can conclude that (a_9 < 0) and (a_8 > 0).

Since a_1 + a_3 = 16 and S_4 = 28, we have two equations: The first equation comes from the sum of the first and the third terms: [2a_1 + 2d = 16] The second equation comes from the sum of the first four terms: [4a_1 + frac{4 times 3}{2} cdot d = 28] Solving the system of equations, we get: [2a_1 + 2d = 16, quad (1)] [4a_1 + 6d = 28. quad (2)] Multiplying equation (1) by 2 to subtract from equation (2): [4a_1 + 4d = 32] [(4a_1 + 6d) - (4a_1 + 4d) = 28 - 32] [2d = -4] [d = -2] Substitute d = -2 into equation (1): [2a_1 - 4 = 16] [a_1 = 10] Therefore, the general term formula for the sequence {a_n} is: [a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d] [a_n = 10 - 2(n-1)] [a_n = 12 - 2n] (2) To find the maximum value of S_n, we need to find when the terms of the sequence become non-positive, as the sum of positive terms yields the maximum sum in an arithmetic sequence with negative common difference.

The next move starts from the box where the last ball of the previous move was placed. We need to prove that after some number of moves, the distribution of golf balls returns to the initial state. 2. **State Definition and Finite Set:**    Let a *state* be defined as the distribution of golf balls in the 10 boxes plus a pointer to the starting box for the next move. The total number of golf balls is ( b ), and each box contains a positive number of balls. The set of all possible states ( S ) is finite and contains fewer than ( (b+1)^{10} times 10 ) elements. This is because each box can have from 0 to ( b ) balls, and there are 10 possible starting boxes. 3. **Function Definition and Bijection:**    Define a function ( f ) from ( S ) to ( S ) that represents one move. We need to show that ( f ) is a bijection, meaning that for any state ( y in S ), there exists a unique state ( x in S ) such that ( f(x) = y ). 4. **Proving Bijection:**    To prove ( f ) is a bijection, consider the following:    - If ( f(x) = y ) and ( a ) and ( b ) are the starting boxes of ( x ) and ( y ) respectively, then:      1. The number of balls in ( a ) after the move is not greater than the number of balls in any other box after the move.      2.

We can then move clockwise from ( b ), collecting balls until no balls remain in ( a ). To restore ( x ) completely, we put all collected balls back in ( a ). 5. **Iteration and Repetition:**    Given an initial state ( z ), iterate ( f ) until some state repeats. Since ( S ) is finite, this must happen eventually. Let ( u ) be the first state that repeats. If ( z neq u ), there must be a predecessor ( v = f^{-1}(u) ) that repeated earlier, contradicting the definition of ( u ). Therefore, ( z = u ), proving that the initial state repeats.

We need to determine the minimum number of cards that must be flipped to guarantee the position of all numbers (regardless of the initial arrangement). 2. **Notation and Illustration**:    - Number the cells in the 4 times 4 grid sequentially from 1 to 16.    - Suppose we have a total of 16 numbers arranged in the grid such that each number is adjacent to its consecutive numbers. 3. **Initial Observation**:    - We look at a specific structured pattern for flipping the cards for clarity.    - Consider a 4 times 4 grid with cells numbered from 1 to 16.    - If we flip a certain number of cards to reveal the consecutive numbers directly, we should be able to infer the position of other numbers. 4. **Flipping & Determination**:    - Our task is to identify the minimum number of cards that need to be flipped to determine the positions of all numbers.    - We notice that each time we flip a card, we gain information about that specific number and its immediate neighbors. 5. **Symmetry and Chessboard Pattern**:    - We can use a checkerboard pattern (black and white cells) of the 4 times 4 grid.    - For example, we can number the cells such that:      - Black cells contain odd numbers.      - White cells contain even numbers.    - This should help us in differentiating the positions effectively. 6. **Computational Strategy**:    - We ensure that we flip at least one card in each row and column to cover all spaces.    - By flipping cards in such a way, we collect adjacent number information.    - We utilize symmetry and the knowledge of the grid structure (checkerboard) to infer the remaining numbers. 7. **Mathematical Bounds**:    - We need to cover both types of cells in the checkerboard pattern (half the cells for each type).    - Since there are 16 cards, flipping half the cards (i.e., 8) will provide a systematic way to ensure we have all necessary information. 8. **Final Argument**:    - Given we need to open cells adequately to differentiate positions of all numbers as described above, flipping 8 cards is both sufficient and necessary.    - Any fewer would not provide enough information due to the necessity to determine consecutive adjacency uniquely. 9. **Conclusion**:    [    boxed{8}    ]"},{"instruction":"A bag contains 4 green, 3 blue, and 5 red chips.

Since k leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 5, k can be expressed as 5n + 2, where n is a non-negative integer.
