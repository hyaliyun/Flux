Bill, Fred and Mark would each like 3 pieces. How many slices of pizza will be left over? Let's answer step by step:","output":"Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices from the purchased pizzas. George purchased 3 small pizzas and 2 large pizzas. A small pizza has 4 slices, and a large pizza has 8 slices. To find the total number of slices, we can use the following calculation: (3 small pizzas * 4 slices per small pizza) + (2 large pizzas * 8 slices per large pizza) = (3 * 4) + (2 * 8) = 12 + 16 = 28 total slices Step 2: Calculate the total number of slices that will be eaten by George, Bob, Susie, Bill, Fred, and Mark. George wants to eat 3 pieces, Bob wants to eat one more piece than George (3+1=4 pieces), Susie wants to eat half as many pieces as Bob (4/2=2 pieces), and Bill, Fred, and Mark each would like 3 pieces. We can calculate the total number of slices eaten like this: George (3) + Bob (4) + Susie (2) + Bill (3) + Fred (3) + Mark (3) = 3 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 18 slices Step 3: Calculate the number of slices left over. Now, to determine the number of slices left over, we simply subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices available: 28 total slices - 18 slices eaten = 10 slices left over So, there will be 10 slices of pizza left over after they have all eaten."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Dialogue: M: I don't like our new teacher.

I watched in wonder as she ran circles around the other kids. She managed to shoot jump shots just over their heads and into the net. The boys always tried to stop her but no one could. I began to notice her at other times, basketball in hand, playing alone. One day I asked her why she practiced so much. Without a moment of hesitation she said, \\"I want to go to college.

Chelsea were pushed all the way by a resurgent United, hunting a seventh successive Premier League victory. Wayne Rooney and the recalled Radamel Falcao came closest for United but once again they fell victim to the resilience and defensive strength that is Chelsea's trademark under Mourinho, assisted by the brilliance of Hazard, and ended frustrated. The reaction of Chelsea's players as referee Mike Dean sounded the final whistle, celebrating wildly in front of their supporters, suggested they believed this was the victory that has pushed them to the brink of glory, as they moved 10 points ahead of second-placed Arsenal. And now, even if they do not wrap it up in these next two games, surely nothing can stop Mourinho winning the title in his second season after coming back to Stamford Bridge. As for United, this defeat may have ended their recent winning streak but they once again produced compelling evidence that they are now a very different proposition from the side that struggled, even though they were grinding out results, earlier this season. Manager Louis van Gaal, as expected, had to reshuffle his side after ruling out Michael Carrick, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind through injury. Ander Herrera was utilised in the anchor role vacated by Carrick and Rooney was pushed into midfield - but United were still able to make the more impressive start and should have taken an early lead. Media playback is not supported on this device Rooney looked a certain scorer when he raced on to Luke Shaw's cross but placed his finish inches wide, so close that goalkeeper David de Gea joined United's fans in celebrating a goal until they realised after several seconds that the effort was off target. Herrera was prominent as United looked the better side but, as ever, Chelsea were rock solid and resilient and took the first chance that came their way seven minutes before the break. Falcao, given a rare start, was easily bundled off the ball by John Terry and when Oscar played in Hazard with a clever backheel he applied a cool finish between De Gea's legs. Van Gaal protested furiously to fourth official Craig Pawson that Falcao had been fouled but to no avail. Chelsea almost doubled their lead early in the second half when Didier Drogba's shot was deflected over De Gea but Hazard could only turn the loose ball against the upright from an angle as he tried to complete the job at the far post. United's recent improvement was underlined as they continued to take the game to Chelsea, keeper Thibaut Courtois blocking Paddy McNair's 20-yard shot and Oscar deflecting Rooney's precise effort inches wide. Van Gaal introduced Angel Di Maria and Adnan Januzaj for Juan Mata and Ashley Young as they continued to carry the fight to Chelsea, who seemed content to protect their lead and hit on the break. Falcao had worked hard but it had been another fruitless game and his frustration continued with 12 minutes left when he escaped from Kurt Zouma to collect Shaw's pass only to strike the outside of the post from a tight angle. There was one last alarm for Chelsea when Herrera was cautioned for tumbling under Gary Cahill's challenge in the penalty area - and the scenes at the conclusion of an enthralling contest reflected the importance of this win.

Let's analyze each sentence to understand the reasoning behind this conclusion: Sentence 1: At low tide you can walk or wade out to the little island of Grand B??, with its simple, unadorned tomb of the locally born Romantic writer Ceteaubriand. This sentence tells us that it is possible to walk or wade out to the little island of Grand B?? during low tide. The presence of the tomb of Ceteaubriand is indicated, but it is not relevant to the main point of the sentence, which is that one can access the island during low tide by walking or wading through the water. Sentence 2: Even at low tide, the water is too crazy to get into. This sentence directly contradicts the first one. It suggests that the water is too dangerous or turbulent to cross even during low tide. If we assume that the first sentence is true, meaning people can walk or wade out to the island of Grand B?? during low tide, then it is unlikely that the second sentence is also true. The second sentence states that the water is too dangerous or turbulent to enter, even at low tide, which would make it impossible to walk or wade through.

Originating in French cuisine, sauce bigarade has been a classic accompaniment to duck dishes for centuries. The main ingredient of this sauce is the juice of Seville oranges or \\"bigarade\\" oranges. Seville oranges are famed for their high acidity and slight bitter taste, which makes them perfect for creating this signature sauce. The process of preparing sauce bigarade involves the following steps: 1. Zesting and juicing the oranges: To start, gather one or two Seville oranges or a combination of sweet oranges and a small amount of grapefruit, which is an acceptable substitute if Seville oranges are not available. Finely zest the oranges and set aside, then juice them to extract the required amount of juice for your recipe. 2. Preparing the caramel: In a saucepan, combine sugar and water, and bring to a boil. Allow the mixture to cook while keeping an eye on it, as the sugar will start to caramelize. The caramel should reach a golden brown color. 3. Deglazing: Once the desired caramel color has been achieved, carefully pour the orange juice into the saucepan to deglaze the caramel. Since the caramel is very hot, you might experience a vigorous reaction when adding the juice. Be cautious to avoid any splattering or burns. 4. Adding zest and reducing the sauce: Next, incorporate the reserved orange zest into the sauce. Simmer the mixture over low heat and allow it to reduce until it reaches the desired thickness. During this process, the bitter, sweet, and tangy flavors of the sauce will blend together, creating a harmonious balance. 5. Adding stock and vinegar: You may also want to add some duck or chicken stock to the sauce, which gives it depth and richness. A splash of wine vinegar or sherry vinegar could also be included to enhance the tanginess of the sauce. 6. Finishing touches: Once the sauce has reached the desired consistency, you may choose to season it with salt and pepper to taste. You can also strain the sauce to remove the orange zest if you prefer a smoother texture. Finally, adding a knob of unsalted butter and stirring it in gently can give the sauce a velvety, glossy finish. Serving sauce bigarade with roast duck is a combination that has stood the test of time in French cuisine. The sauce, with its intricate balance of flavors, enhances the taste of the tender and deliciously fatty duck meat. Apart from duck, this sauce can also work well with chicken, pork, or game meats. Serving it alongside roasted or steamed vegetables and classic French side dishes like gratin dauphinois is an excellent way to create a complete and memorable meal."},{"instruction":"So haben die Leistungsschwächen der heutigen Suchmaschinen beispielsweise eine neue Branche hervorgebracht – so genannte Suchmaschinenoptimierer, die sich auf Strategien konzentrieren, Webseiten einen hohen Beliebtheitsrang in googleartigen Suchmaschinen zu verschaffen.

Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands. I am facing a new situation today: Two rivers spring from the same mountain. Olt was a fast moving river, while Mures river was slow moving and deep.

Translate to English English:","output":"They are used for nerve irritation, skin itching, hives, swollen legs, and rheumatic swelling. English: These remedies or treatments are employed in cases where individuals experience various symptoms or conditions, including nerve irritation, skin itching, hives, swollen legs, and rheumatic swelling. The purpose of using such remedies is to alleviate discomfort, reduce inflammation, and provide relief to those who are affected by these issues. Nerve irritation, also commonly referred to as neuralgia, is a condition where the nerves become inflamed and cause sharp, stabbing pain or a burning sensation. This can occur due to factors such as injury, infection, pressure on the nerves, or other underlying medical conditions. Utilizing appropriate treatments can aid in calming the nerves and minimizing the pain associated with this condition. Skin itching, also known as pruritus, can result from various causes, including dry skin, allergic reactions, bug bites, or certain skin conditions, such as eczema. Relief from itching can be achieved through topical creams, antihistamine medications, or other specialized treatments depending on the underlying cause. Hives, medically known as urticaria, are red, itchy, and raised welts on the skin that can develop as a result of an allergic reaction, exposure to sunlight, heat, cold, or other triggers. They can typically be treated with antihistamines or anti-inflammatory medications to reduce itching and inflammation. Swollen legs can be caused by numerous factors, such as prolonged standing, injury, infection, or underlying medical conditions like deep vein thrombosis, lymphedema, or heart failure. It is essential to determine the underlying cause to provide the appropriate treatment, which may range from compression stockings and elevating the legs to specific medications for managing fluid retention or addressing the root issue. Lastly, rheumatic swelling is associated with rheumatic diseases or conditions, such as arthritis, which is characterized by inflammation, pain, and stiffness in the joints. Various treatment options are available depending on the type and severity of the rheumatic condition, including anti-inflammatory medications, pain relievers, and disease-modifying drugs to slow the progression of the disease. In conclusion, these treatments and remedies play an essential role in managing and alleviating symptoms in individuals experiencing nerve irritation, skin itching, hives, swollen legs, and rheumatic swelling. Proper implementation of these treatments tailored to the specific condition can provide relief and improved quality of life for those affected."},{"instruction":"In this task you will be given a text passage from a trivia quiz.

Mr Abbas said Israeli \\"war crimes\\" in Gaza should be punished, but stopped short of saying he would take the issue to the International Criminal Court. His speech brought strong condemnation from Israel and from the US, which described it as \\"offensive\\". The 50-day conflict left about 2,100 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead. Correspondents say the conflict has weakened Mr Abbas politically, with his rivals in the radical group Hamas, which dominates Gaza, seeing a surge of popularity among Palestinians for fighting Israel. The UN says that most of the Palestinian dead were civilians. Israel says the high civilian death toll was because of Hamas fighters launching attacks from residential areas, including schools and mosques, drawing return fire. Earlier this month Israel ordered a criminal investigation into five incidents in which civilians are believed to have died, and is investigating over 100 incidents in total. Mr Abbas said the scale of damage in Gaza was unprecedented and surpassed that of earlier wars. \\"This last war against Gaza was a series of absolute war crimes carried out before the eyes and ears of the entire world, moment by moment,\\" he told the UN General Assembly in New York. He added that it was \\"impossible\\" to return to negotiations with Israel that did not address what he called \\"fundamental questions\\". \\"There is no meaning or value in negotiations for which the agreed objective is not ending the Israeli occupation and achieving the independence of the State of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital on the entire Palestinian Territory occupied in the 1967 war,\\" he said. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said it was a \\"speech of incitement filled with lies\\". He said Mr Abbas's remarks \\"highlight once again how he does not want and cannot be a partner for a reasonable diplomatic agreement\\". He went on to accuse the Palestinian leader of \\"diplomatic terrorism\\". US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said President Abbas's speech \\"included offensive characterisations that were deeply disappointing\\". \\"Such provocative statements are counterproductive and undermine efforts to create a positive atmosphere and restore trust between the parties,\\" she said. Mr Abbas has previously threatened to take Israel to the International Criminal Court, but did not mention the body in his speech. The Palestinian leader also said the \\"hour of independence of the state of Palestine\\" had arrived. He added that he would be seeking a UN Security Council resolution on a two-state solution, but gave no time frame. The Israeli delegation was not present in the hall during Mr Abbas's speech. Israel launched a major military operation in Gaza on 8 July, with the stated aim of stopping militants firing rockets and mortars at its territory. Following several short-lived ceasefires, both sides agreed to an open-ended truce on 26 August which has so far held.","output":"Mr. Abbas talks about Israeli \\"war crimes\\" in Gaza and wants them to be punished, but hasn't said if he will go to the International Criminal Court about it, which has caused strong reactions from Israel and the US."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"4.487 – Mensaje de Nuestra Señora Reina de la Paz, en Barroso / MG, transmitido en 19/06/2017\\" from Spanish to English.","output":"\\"4.487 - Message from Our Lady Queen of Peace, in Barroso / MG, transmitted on 06/19/2017\\" This sentence presents a message from Our Lady Queen of Peace in Barroso, a city located in the state of Minas Gerais (MG) in Brazil.

I want to lay out the solution in details.","output":"Sentence B: \\"The chef is sharpening the knife with glass\\" does not make sense. Here's a detailed explanation: - Sentence A: \\"The chef is sharpening the knife with a sharpening stone\\" makes sense because a sharpening stone, also known as a whetstone, is a common tool used for grinding and honing the edges of knives and other cutting tools. Sharpening stones can be made of various materials, and they are specifically designed for this purpose. When used correctly, these stones can provide a smooth and sharp edge on the blade of a knife. - Sentence B: \\"The chef is sharpening the knife with glass\\" does not make sense because glass is not a suitable material for sharpening knives. Glass is a brittle and fragile material, which makes it prone to breaking and chipping, especially under the pressure required to sharpen a knife. Furthermore, using glass to sharpen a knife can be dangerous since it could break during the process, leading to injury or damage to the knife.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: When thinking about fish, one of the first things that comes to mind is their aquatic environment. Fish are known to live and thrive in various bodies of water such as oceans, rivers, and lakes, which is their natural element for survival. The water provides fish with oxygen, food, and a suitable habitat to grow and reproduce. Now, the concept of fish being able to survive without water might seem rather intriguing, but it raises several questions regarding their anatomy, respiratory system, and overall biology. Fish are ectothermic animals, meaning they rely on their environment to maintain their body temperature. Water plays an essential role in regulating the temperature in which they live. Along with this, fish's gills are specially designed to extract oxygen from water, which is crucial for their survival. In an environment without water, their gills would be unable to extract the necessary oxygen, causing them to suffocate and perish. In addition to oxygen, water provides buoyancy support and mobility for the fish. Their bodies are specifically adapted to that environment, with characteristics like a streamlined shape and fins for swimming. Without water, their mobility would be significantly reduced, if not altogether impossible. Considering the vital role water plays in the biology, physiology, and overall survival of fish, it is clear that a fish cannot comfortably survive without water. Deprived of their natural environment, fish would be unable to breathe or maintain their bodily functions, inevitably leading to their demise.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598. In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons. The answer to this question is:","output":"The old house, which was situated near the church in the garden of the present house, belonged to the manor of Belton and was sold to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619."},{"instruction":"Here is some data: Acharya Institute of Technology, president, \\"B.M.

The band's album debut, Tin Machine (1989), was initially popular, though its politicised lyrics did not find universal approval: Bowie described one song as \\"a simplistic, naive, radical, laying-it-down about the emergence of Neo-Nazis\\"; in the view of biographer Christopher Sandford, \\"It took nerve to denounce drugs, fascism and TV ... in terms that reached the literary level of a comic book.\\" EMI complained of \\"lyrics that preach\\" as well as \\"repetitive tunes\\" and \\"minimalist or no production\\". The album nevertheless reached No. 3 and went gold in the UK.Tin Machine's first world tour was a commercial success, but there was growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member. A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label. Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band. Tin Machine began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work. Performing his early hits during the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, he found commercial success and acclaim once again.In October 1990, a decade after his divorce from Angie, Bowie and Somali-born supermodel Iman were introduced by a mutual friend. Bowie recalled, \\"I was naming the children the night we met ... it was absolutely immediate.\\" They married in 1992. Tin Machine resumed work the...

Among these groups are the White and African American populations, both playing important roles in shaping the country's history and society. This article aims to present a comparative analysis of these two racial groups and address the question: How many more Whites are there than African Americans, in percentage? Current Demographics According to data from the United States Census Bureau, as of July 2019, the country's total population was approximately 328 million people. Of this, Whites (including those of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origins) accounted for around 76.3%, while African Americans made up to 13.4% of the population. To determine the percentage difference between these two groups, the total population can be utilized as a basis for comparison. Calculating the Difference To compute the percentage difference of Whites and African Americans in the United States, we will consider the non-Hispanic White population in comparison with African Americans, as that is a more accurate representation of the distinct groups. As of July 2019, the non-Hispanic Whites accounted for approximately 60.1% of the total U.S. population. To determine the percentage difference, we can use the following formula: Percentage Difference = ((60.1 - 13.4) / 60.1) × 100% By plugging in the values, we obtain: Percentage Difference = (46.7 / 60.1) × 100% Percentage Difference ≈ 77.7% This calculation reveals that there are approximately 77.7% more non-Hispanic Whites than African Americans in the United States based on the 2019 demographic data. Changes in Demographics It's essential to note that racial demographics in the United States are continuously evolving due to factors such as immigration, birth rates, and social intermingling. This trend is expected to continue in the coming decades. Projections by the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that by 2045, the non-Hispanic White population will shrink to an estimated 49.7%, while the African American population is projected to grow slightly to 13.8%. As a result, the percentage difference between the two racial groups will continue to change as well, narrowing down over time. Conclusion The racial composition of the United States is an ever-changing landscape, which nevertheless remains an important aspect for understanding cultural dynamics and social issues. Currently, the non-Hispanic White population in the United States is about 77.7% larger than the African American population, but this difference will likely decline in the coming decades. As the country continues to evolve and embrace its diversity, it is essential for policymakers, educational institutions, and the general public to be aware of these demographic changes and their implications."},{"instruction":"NewsFactor - Next week IBM (NYSE: IBM) will make its latest autonomic-computing creation -- DB2 Universal Database, aka \\"Stinger\\" -- generally available.

Three Days Grace is a Canadian rock band formed in Norwood, Ontario in 1997. Based in Toronto, the band's original line-up consisted of guitarist and lead vocalist Adam Gontier, drummer and backing vocalist Neil Sanderson, and bassist Brad Walst. In 2003, Barry Stock was recruited as the band's lead guitarist, making Three Days Grace a four-member band. In 2013, Gontier left the band and was replaced by My Darkest Days' vocalist Matt Walst, who is also bassist Brad Walst's brother. From March to August 2008, and from January to April 2009, Three Days Grace recorded their third album at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia, and in Los Angeles, again with producer Howard Benson who had worked with them on their previous releases. The album, entitled Life Starts Now, was released on September 22, 2009. Critics as well as band members have noted the album's departure from the angry tone of the band's previous releases into a lyrical style that is perceived as more optimistic. This album reflects the maturity of the band members as they overcome problems such as sickness and death within their families in which they stated, \\"We had to be inspired by it, but the outcome is this: It's a new beginning. It's life starting over.\\" According to guitarist Barry Stock, the album's theme centres around \\"a new sense of freshness\\" and the idea that \\"you don't have to be stuck in whatever it is you're dealing with. Whether it's good or bad, it's your choice to make a change\\". Life Starts Now debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, Three Days Grace's highest chart position to date, and sold 79,000 copies in its first week. The album was met with mostly positive reviews. Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star gave the album a negative review, saying it possesses \\"no sound of its own, just a shallow range between Linkin Park and Nickelback\\". According to Allmusic reviewer James Christopher Monger, who gave the album three out of five stars, Life Starts Now \\"...continues the theme of One-X, Gontier's personal demons, but with a 'hint of sunlight'.\\" He complimented the album, saying it \\"...treats the well-worn metal themes of anger, isolation, heartache, and redemption with the kind of begrudging respect they deserve, pumping out a competent flurry of fist-bump anthems and world-weary, mid-tempo rockers\\". The first single release from the album, \\"Break\\", was released on September 1, 2009. In support of the album, Three Days Grace embarked on a 20 date Canadian tour lasting through November and December 2009. They co-headlined a January-February 2010 tour of the U.S. with Breaking Benjamin and Flyleaf. Life Starts Now was nominated for \\"Best Rock Album\\" at the 2010 Juno Awards, but lost to Billy Talent III.

The first premise, \\"A woman is bandaging another woman's injured arm,\\" provides a specific situation where one woman is performing the action of bandaging the arm of another woman who has sustained an injury. To confirm the truth of this premise, one would need to verify that there are two women involved in a particular event and that one of them is indeed bandaging the injured arm of the other. On the other hand, the statement \\"A woman is dressed up\\" focuses on the appearance of a woman who has taken time and effort to wear clothing or accessories considered more sophisticated or formal than her usual attire. This statement tells us nothing about the presence of another person or any injury-related situation. Moreover, it does not even hint at the possibility of the woman being engaged in providing first aid or partaking in medical assistance. To demonstrate the potential lack of connection between the two statements, let's consider the following scenarios: 1. A woman is attending a wedding dressed in her finest clothes. She happens upon a fellow guest who requires medical assistance due to an injury and proceeds to bandage the injured arm of a fellow attendee. In this situation, both statements could be true: a woman is dressed up, and she is also bandaging another woman's injured arm. 2. A woman is dressed up to attend a formal event, but there is no mention of any injuries or medical assistance being provided. In this case, the statement \\"A woman is dressed up\\" is true, but the premise \\"A woman is bandaging another woman's injured arm\\" is not true since it has not been established that any injury occurred or that first aid was provided. 3. A woman is not dressed up and is instead wearing casual clothing when she comes across another woman who has injured her arm. The casually dressed woman proceeds to help bandage the injured arm of the other woman. In this scenario, the statement \\"A woman is dressed up\\" is false, but the premise \\"A woman is bandaging another woman's injured arm\\" is true. It is important to note that the two statements might not even be related and could potentially describe entirely separate situations involving different women. In conclusion, the truth of the premise \\"A woman is bandaging another woman's injured arm\\" cannot be determined based solely on the information provided by the statement \\"A woman is dressed up.\\" The relationship between the appearance of a woman and any action she might take to provide medical assistance is tenuous at best, and more information on the context or details of the specific situation would be required to accurately assess the genuineness of the initial premise."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: Warlords of the 21st Century Movie plot: All remaining reserves of petroleum have finally run out; forcing people to ration the few remaining containers of gasoline left on the earth against mercenaries and warlords. Straker and his men (accompanied by his daughter Corlie - played by Annie McEnroe) find a vast supply of diesel fuel in a compound once thought to be radioactive. When Corlie refuses to execute the previous owners, she runs away from base camp. Hunter (Michael Beck), on his amazing (possibly ex-future-military) motorcycle, rescues the girl and takes her to his farm. After keeping her on the farm on a temporary basis, Hunter sends her off to live in a walled city (known in-film as Clearwater Farm) governed by a strict old-fashioned democracy (similar to the Quakers) where she is quickly accepted by the community. However, she is soon discovered by the mercenaries commanded by her father, Colonel Straker (James Wainwright), who moves to attack the Clearwater community. In the chaos that ensues, Corlie manages to escape back to Hunter's remote hideout. Straker terrorises the residents of Clearwater, taking their weapons, medicines, and other supplies and handing the women over to his men. Within a short time, one of the residents of Clearwater betrays the Clearwater mechanic/fabricator, Rusty, who knows the secret location of Hunter's hideout. Straker &amp; Co. use torture to get the information out of Rusty, then move in to attack Hunter's base and recapture Corlie. Hunter and Corlie escape on his bike, Straker, in a minor rage, plows through Hunter's place with the truck. Hunter takes Corlie back to the Clearwater people and asks Rusty to build him an armored car to attack Straker's \\"battle truck\\". While Rusty and Hunter and a few others are thus occupied, the traitor who betrayed Corlie before knocks her out, puts her in a wagon and heads out to deliver her back to Straker.

Throughout the story, Hunter rescues Corlie using this high-speed vehicle and they manage to stay one step ahead of Colonel Straker and his mercenaries. The first escape occurs when Hunter rescues Corlie after she refuses to execute the previous owners of the diesel fuel supply and runs away from Straker's base camp. Hunter takes her to his farm before sending her to live in the Clearwater walled city, where the Clearwater community accepts her. Their second escape happens when Corlie is discovered by the mercenaries and Colonel Straker, who launches an attack on Clearwater. Amidst the chaos, Corlie manages to escape back to Hunter's remote hideout. The final escape occurs when Straker's men locate Hunter's hideout and attempt to recapture Corlie. Once more, Hunter and Corlie flee on his motorcycle, outrunning Straker and his mercenaries. Hunter then enlists the help of his ally Rusty to build an armored car for a counterattack against Straker's battle truck. In summary, Hunter and Corlie's main means of escape throughout the film is Hunter's advanced motorcycle, which provides them with the speed and agility necessary to evade their pursuers."},{"instruction":"Q: Fact 1: Plants are the major producers in terrestrial biomes.

Article: After we finished thirteen miles of hiking, we were tired and our muscles ached as we made our way back to New England. The car ride to the airport followed by a two-hour flight left our legs more worse condition than they were when we first came off the mountain we just climbed. When we heard that two seats in first class on our next flight were available for a bit higher price, we jumped at the opportunity. Our spirits lifted immediately. After all, flying first class was a new experience for us, and we would end our adventure in comfort and style. As we boarded the plane, we noticed that the stewardess was working non-stop to ensure the comfort of the first class passengers. She could not walk by a seat without receiving an order. How much she must love her job! She smiled kindly at each one while attending to their needs. As the stewardess walked by our seats near the end of the flight, I looked at her and said, \\"Thank you and I hope you have a great night.\\" She stopped, bent down, looked at me and said, \\"Excuse me.\\" I repeated my words and she smiled in a rather funny way, almost as if I had asked her a question that she did not know how to answer. After a few moments she returned to our seats. \\"I can tell you work with the public,\\" she said. \\"Why do you think so?\\" I asked. She answered very quietly, \\"Because you are the only passenger here to say something nice to me tonight and I really appreciate your kindness.\\" The sense of belonging to the elite group of people in first class disappeared as we heard her words.

Several hours later these strange hairy giants went back into the woods. After the men returned to the town and told the people about their adventure, _ . These were the people who remembered hearing tales about footprints of an animal that walked like a human being. The five men, however, were not the first to have seen these creatures called Bigfoot. Long before their experience, the local Native Americans were certain that a group of apelike animals had been living in the _ mountain for centuries. In 1958, some workers, who were building a road through the jungles of Northern California, often found huge footprints in the earth around their camp. Then in 1967, Roger Patterson, a man who was interested in finding Bigfoot, went into the same jungles with a friend. While riding, they were suddenly thrown off from their horses. Patterson saw a tall apelike animal standing not far away. He managed to take photos of the hairy creature before it disappeared in the jungles. When Patterson's photos were shown to the public, not many people believed his story. Richard Brown, an experienced hunter, discovered a similar creature.

Active since 1948, in seventy years of his artistic career Jodorowsky has experienced it in almost all creative forms: writer (in his five facets: novelist, storyteller, poet, playwright and essayist), film director and producer, actor of cinema and theatre, playwright, theatre director, screenwriter, film editor, comics writer, musician, soundtrack composer, philosopher, puppeteer, mime, psychologist and psychoanalyst, draughtsman, painter, eventually sculptor and spiritual guru. Best known for his avant-garde films, he has been \\"venerated by cult cinema enthusiasts\\" for his work which \\"is filled with violently surreal images and a hybrid blend of mysticism and religious provocation\\". Born to Jewish-Ukrainian parents in Chile, Jodorowsky experienced an unhappy and alienated childhood, and so immersed himself in reading and writing poetry. Context: Jodorowsky spent almost a decade reconstructing the original form of the Tarot de Marseille. From this work he moved into more therapeutic work in three areas: psychomagic, psychogenealogy and initiatic massage. Psychomagic aims to heal psychological wounds suffered in life. This therapy is based on the belief that the performance of certain acts can directly act upon the unconscious mind, releasing it from a series of traumas, some of which practitioners of the therapy believe are passed down from generation to generation. Psychogenealogy includes the studying of the patient's personality and family tree in order to best address their specific sources. It is similar, in its phenomenological approach to genealogy, to the Constellations pioneered by Bert Hellinger. Jodorowsky has several books on his therapeutic methods, including Psicomagia: La trampa sagrada (Psychomagic: The Sacred Trap) and his autobiography, La danza de la realidad (The Dance of Reality), which he was filming as a feature-length film in March 2012. To date he has published more than 23 novels and philosophical treatises, along with dozens of articles and interviews. His books are widely read in Spanish and French, but are for the most part unknown to English-speaking audiences. Throughout his career, Jodorowsky has gained a reputation as a philosopher and scholar who presents the teachings of religion, psychology, and spiritual masters, by molding them into imaginative endeavors. All of his enterprises integrate an artistic approach. Currently, Jodorowsky dedicates much of his time to lecturing about his work. For a quarter of a century, Jodorowsky held classes and lectures for free, in cafes and universities all over the city of Paris. Typically, such courses or talks would begin on Wednesday evenings as tarot divination lessons, and would culminate in an hour long conference, also free, where at times hundreds of attendees would be treated to live demonstrations of a psychological \\"arbre genealogique\\" (\\"tree of genealogy\\") involving volunteers from the audience. In these conferences, Jodorowsky would pave the way to building a strong base of students of his philosophy, which deals with understanding the unconscious as the \\"over-self\\", composed of many generations of family relatives, living or deceased, acting on the psyche, well into adult lives, and causing compulsions. Of all his work, Jodorowsky considers these activities to be the most important of his life. Though such activities only take place in the insular world of Parisian cafes, he has devoted thousands of hours of his life to teaching and helping people \\"become more conscious,\\" as he puts it. Since 2011 these talks have dwindled to once a month and take place at the \\"Librairie Les Cent Ciels\\" in Paris. Question: Was there any statement he made about psychomagic? Answer:","output":"Yes, Alejandro Jodorowsky has made statements about psychomagic. He believes that psychomagic is a type of therapy that can heal psychological wounds people have experienced in their lives. He thinks that performing specific acts can have a direct effect on the unconscious mind, which can help free it from various traumas. Some of these traumas may even have been passed down through generations. Jodorowsky has written books about his therapeutic methods, like \\"Psychomagic: The Sacred Trap,\\" where he further explains his ideas on psychomagic."},{"instruction":"Question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Top Superb\\" Answer:","output":"The review \\"Top Superb\\" would most likely indicate a ★★★★★ rating, as it implies the highest level of satisfaction and quality."},{"instruction":"Please answer a question about the following article about Renewable energy commercialization: Geothermal power capacity grew from around 1 GW in 1975 to almost 10 GW in 2008.

The case has raised concerns about the importance of vaccination against the life-threatening infection and awareness of symptoms among local communities. Background on Meningococcal Meningitis: Meningococcal meningitis is a severe bacterial infection that affects the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, commonly known as the meninges. The disease is caused by the Neisseria meningitidis bacterium and can progress rapidly, often leading to death or severe complications within hours. The infection is spread through close contact, including coughing, sneezing, and kissing. Details of the Case: The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) officials have confirmed the case of a teenager, whose identity has been withheld, who succumbed to the complications of meningococcal meningitis. The teen experienced a sudden onset of symptoms and died within a short period, highlighting the aggressive nature of the infection. Reactions and Preventative Measures: Following the confirmation of the meningococcal meningitis diagnosis, the VDH has encouraged individuals who had close contact with the victim to contact their healthcare providers for possible prophylactic antibiotic treatment. Additionally, the officials have advised the community to review their vaccination statuses. Vaccines are available to protect against most strains of meningococcal bacteria, including those that cause meningitis. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), routine meningococcal vaccination is recommended for adolescents between 11 and 12 years of age, with a booster dose at 16 years of age. Children with certain health conditions should begin vaccinations as early as 2 months old. Individuals attending colleges, particularly those living in dormitories, and military personnel should also be vaccinated. In light of this recent incident, education authorities and healthcare professionals are urged to spread awareness and ensure immunization coverage in the community. Signs and Symptoms: Identifying meningitis symptoms early is critical for timely treatment and survival. Symptoms may include sudden high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness, vomiting, confusion, sensitivity to light, seizures, and a rash. In some cases, these symptoms might be mistaken for less severe illnesses, such as influenza. However, due to the potential severity of meningococcal meningitis, anyone experiencing these symptoms should seek immediate medical care. Conclusion: The sudden and tragic death of a young Virginia teen due to meningococcal meningitis serves as a stark reminder of the importance of vaccination and awareness of this life-threatening infection. It is crucial for individuals, especially those in high-risk groups, to receive the recommended vaccinations and stay vigilant to the early warning signs of this severe bacterial infection. By doing so, we can prevent further fatalities and protect the health of our communities."},{"instruction":"The Living End are an Australian punk rock band, which formed in 1994.

They have released six studio albums and two reached the No. 1 spot on the ARIA Albums Chart: self-titled album (12 October 1998) and State of Emergency (4 February 2006). In February 2002, The Living End's line up changed as Demsey left and was replaced on drums in April by Andy Strachan (ex-Pollyanna). Dempsey wanted to spend more time with his family, and had a dislike of heavy touring; in August that year he joined Fez Perez, and later joined a punk, folk rock group, The Currency. The Living End developed a side project, The Longnecks, to test out Strachan and new material for their third album, Modern ARTillery, without attracting wide public attention. The name is a reference to longneck beer bottles. The Longnecks name was re-used by the band to try out potential material for later albums. They have also played under other names: Glen Waverley & The Mentones, The Dovetones, Roller Toasters, Doncaster & The Dandenongs and Redwings; at various venues in regional Victoria. In mid-2002 The Living End recorded four tracks, including \\"One Said to the Other\\", which were released as an EP in January the following year and reached the top 20 on the ARIA Singles Chart. Two of its tracks were re-recorded in Los Angeles with Mark Trombino (Blink-182, Jebediah) producing, together with new material for Modern ARTillery, which appeared on 28 October 2003. It peaked at No. 3 on the ARIA Albums Chart, top 50 in New Zealand, and top 40 on Billboard's Heatseekers Albums Chart. \\"Who's Gonna Save Us?\\" was issued a month earlier, as the lead single, which reached top 40 in Australia, top 30 in New Zealand and on Billboard's Alternative Songs Chart. They followed with heavy touring (including Big Day Out) promoting their releases. On 27 September 2004 the band released a compilation album, From Here on In: The Singles 1997-2004, early versions included a bonus disc, Under the Covers, which had six cover versions of other artist's tracks. The CD featured two new tracks: \\"I Can't Give You What I Haven't Got\\" and \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\". They also issued a compilation DVD, From Here on In: The DVD 1997-2004, which collated their music video clips and live performances of the groups at festivals: Splendour in the Grass and Big Day Out in Sydney, and from Summer Sonic in Japan. The DVD also documented the band's history by interviews and home footage. What else did the band do during this time?","output":"During this time, The Living End was also heavily involved in touring both within Australia and internationally. They maintained a steady pattern of conducting tours, often alongside other major artists and at popular music festivals, thereby increasing their fan base. Their consistent touring schedule allowed them to develop a strong reputation for their energetic and dynamic live performances. One of the significant moments during this period was when The Living End were invited to join the Australian leg of the Warped Tour in 1998. The Warped Tour was known for bringing together leading punk rock bands and the Australian leg of the tour served as an excellent platform for The Living End to expand their audience and form connections within the punk rock community. During this period, The Living End also actively worked on many philanthropic pursuits. The band often participated in charity concerts and benefit shows. For instance, they performed at the WaveAid concert in 2005, a fundraising event for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. This event highlighted their commitment not just to creating music, but also to using their platform to contribute to meaningful causes. The band also frequently collaborated with other prominent artists and bands. Notably, they joined forces with Jet, a fellow Australian rock band, for a national tour in 2006. This tour helped strengthen the alliance of Australian rock bands and further anchored The Living End's status within the local music scene. Furthermore, while continuing their musical career, members of the band used their success to delve into individual projects. Chris Cheney, for instance, made several guest appearances with other bands and continued to improve his songwriting and music production skills. Scott Owen and Andy Strachan also engaged in side projects, thus exploring their musical versatility. In terms of album production, The Living End was not just busy recording their music but also constantly trying to experiment and evolve their sound. During the production of their albums, they worked with various producers and experimented with various recording techniques, leading to the distinct sound featured in their two number one albums 'The Living End' and 'State of Emergency'. The band, true to their punk rock roots, were not afraid to take risks and push the boundaries of their genre. Finally, while keeping up with their heavy touring schedule and music production, the band also focused on connecting with their fans. They continually communicated with their followers through their official website and social media platforms. They made sure that they were accessible to their fans, often staying after shows for meet and greets and hosting Q&A sessions on their social media platforms. Remaining true to their roots while also embracing progress, The Living End became an important fixture in the Australian punk rock scene during this period."},{"instruction":"To ship means to send goods to places far away.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump has...

I love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm. This supposedly takes place in the woods of Texas but was probably filmed in the director's backyard. The production was probably the worst I ever seen. The actors were absolutely the WORST. The story didn't have anything to do with what the back cover said. I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and some other \\"mom and pop\\" store that buys used DVDs and neither would take it. Thats how awful this poor miserable excuse for a movie was.

Step 2: Recognizing Emotional Words and Phrases The next step is identifying words or phrases that demonstrate emotion, such as \\"worst,\\" \\"awful,\\" \\"poor miserable excuse,\\" \\"takes the cake,\\" and \\"worse movie.\\" To classify the sentiment as positive or negative, we need to consider not only the number of negative words but also the intensity of the prefix used with these words, like \\"worst\\" and \\"awful.\\" Step 3: Determine the Overall Sentiment Given the weight and repetition of negative words and phrases, as well as the context and relative intensity of the language, this text clearly conveys a very negative sentiment.

Article: Americans have used colours to create many expressions they use every day. We say we're \\"in the pink\\" when we are in good health. It is easy to understand how this expression was born. When my face has a nice fresh, pink colour, it is a sign which shows my health is good. The colour green is natural for trees, it is an unnatural colour for humans. When someone doesn't feel well, for example, we say he looks green. When someone is angry because he doesn't have what someone else has, we say he is \\"green with envy\\". Some people are \\"green with envy\\" because someone else has more dollars, or \\"greenbacks\\". Dollars are called \\"greenback\\" because that's the colour of the backside of the money. Blue is a cool colour. The traditional blue music of American blacks is the opposite of red hot music. It is slow, sad and soulful . To be blue, of course, is to be sad. The colour black is often used in expressions. People describe a day in which everything goes wrong as a \\"black day\\". A \\"black sheep\\" is the member of a family or group who always seems to be in trouble. If someone meets a \\"black cat\\", something unlucky might happen to him.

Although a controversial personality, Shooter cured many of the procedural ills at Marvel, including repeatedly missed deadlines. During Shooter's nine-year tenure as editor-in-chief, Chris Claremont and John Byrne's run on the Uncanny X-Men and Frank Miller's run on Daredevil became critical and commercial successes. Shooter brought Marvel into the rapidly evolving direct market, institutionalized creator royalties, starting with the Epic Comics imprint for creator-owned material in 1982; introduced company-wide crossover story arcs with Contest of Champions and Secret Wars; and in 1986 launched the ultimately unsuccessful New Universe line to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Marvel Comics imprint. Star Comics, a children-oriented line differing from the regular Marvel titles, was briefly successful during this period.

You'll be given the following question. Please do chain-of-thought reasoning. Which of these sentences doesn't make sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"You are likely to find a ferret in a burrow.\\" - Sentence B: \\"You are likely to find a ferret in a candy house\\"","output":"To determine which of these sentences doesn't make sense, we need to analyze each sentence and evaluate the likelihood of the scenario described. Sentence A: \\"You are likely to find a ferret in a burrow.\\" Ferrets are small, carnivorous mammals that belong to the Mustelidae family, which includes animals like weasels, badgers, and otters. In the wild, ferrets typically inhabit underground burrows. These burrows provide shelter, protection from predators, and a place for them to raise their offspring. Given this information, finding a ferret in a burrow is a plausible and natural scenario, making sense in the context of the natural behavior of ferrets. Sentence B: \\"You are likely to find a ferret in a candy house.\\" A candy house refers to a structure made entirely or primarily out of candy, sweets, and confectionery, which is not a natural environment for any animal. Candy houses are typically found in fairy tales or created as decorations during particular festivities, like gingerbread houses during the Christmas season. A ferret would not naturally be found in a candy house, as it offers neither appropriate shelter nor food sources. Considering the information provided about each sentence's scenario, Sentence B, \\"You are likely to find a ferret in a candy house,\\" doesn't make sense. This is because a candy house is not a natural or suitable habitat for a ferret, unlike the burrow mentioned in Sentence A."},{"instruction":"Quinn had too much to drink with his friends and ultimately was kicked out of the bar. Given the context: How would you describe Quinn? Possible answers: intoxicated, foolish, very cavalier with their partying A:","output":"Quinn can be described as intoxicated, foolish, and very cavalier with their partying, given the context provided. Intoxicated: Quinn was clearly under the influence of alcohol, as he had too much to drink. Consuming excessive amounts of alcohol impairs one's judgment, coordination, and reaction time, making it challenging for individuals like Quinn to make responsible decisions. In this situation, intoxication had a significant effect on Quinn's actions, ultimately resulting in his removal from the bar. Foolish: Quinn's actions indicate a lack of wise or sound judgment. Instead of moderating his alcohol intake to ensure that he remained safe and in control of his surroundings, Quinn chose to overindulge, which led to him being kicked out of the bar. This demonstrates that he failed to recognize the potential consequences of his behavior, and as a result, his actions are rightly considered foolish. Very Cavalier with Their Partying: Quinn's behavior suggests that he takes a carefree and nonchalant approach to partying. His willingness to drink excessively without considering the repercussions demonstrates a lack of concern for his safety or the safety of others. Moreover, being kicked out of a bar often implies some form of disruptive or inappropriate behavior. This further supports the description of Quinn as being cavalier with his partying, as it indicates that he acts without caution or regard for potential negative outcomes. In conclusion, based on the provided context, Quinn is best described as intoxicated, foolish, and very cavalier with their partying. His excessive alcohol consumption led to impaired judgment, subsequently resulting in his removal from the bar. His actions seem to portray a person who is reckless and unconcerned with potential consequences, ultimately leading to unfortunate and avoidable repercussions."},{"instruction":"Here is one sentence: We have a big barrel to catch the rainwater.

Different meanings. In the two sentences given, the word \\"be\\" is used in different forms and conveys different meanings. Breaking down each sentence will help clarify the distinctions in meaning and usage. 1. \\"I shall be writing to you soon.\\" In this sentence, \\"be\\" is used as an auxiliary verb in the continuous, or progressive, tense. It is followed by the gerund form of \\"write\\" to create the future continuous verb phrase \\"shall be writing.\\" This tense indicates an action that will take place over a certain period of time in the future. The meaning of \\"be\\" in this sentence is used to express a future action—the act of writing to someone—that will occur at some point soon. It carries an element of certainty about a future event and demonstrates the speaker's intention to perform this action. 2. \\"The dog was drowned by the boy.\\" In this sentence, \\"be\\" is in the form of \\"was,\\" which is the past simple tense of \\"be.\\" \\"Was\\" is used as a passive voice auxiliary verb in combination with the past participle \\"drowned\\" to create the passive voice construction \\"was drowned.\\" The passive voice is used to emphasize the receiver of the action, the dog, rather than the one who performed the action, the boy. The meaning of \\"be\\" in the second sentence is quite different from the first. It focuses on a completed action in the past and places importance on the object of the action instead of the subject performing the action. This use of \\"be\\" reflects the fact that the action was done to the dog, rather than the dog doing the action itself.

Mono Basin was the first National Scenic Area in the United States. It offers more protection than other United States Forest Service lands, surrounds Mono Lake and its two volcanic islands, Black Point, Panum Crater and much of the northern half of the Mono Craters. Litigation and outreach by the Mono Lake Committee, the National Audubon Society and other conservation groups has helped to slow water diversions from tributaries feeding Mono Lake.A series of earthquakes inside Long Valley Caldera, coincidentally starting two weeks after the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington, alerted geologists to the possibility of renewed volcanic activity in the region. Four magnitude 6 earthquakes struck the southern margin of Long Valley Caldera in an area that was close to the Mono–Inyo fissure system. The caldera floor had also uplifted by 10 inches (30 cm) in five years. Upward movement of magma under the caldera was thought to be the cause of the earthquakes and uplift.Persistent earthquake swarms in 1982 prompted the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to issue a \\"potential volcanic hazard\\" notice for Long Valley. That same year, permanent monitoring of the area by the Long Valley Observatory started. The hazard notice was lifted in 1984 after USGS scientists concluded that magma had been injected into fissures below Mammoth Mountain but had congealed underground. From 1990 to 1996, 150 acres (60 ha) of trees were killed on Mammoth Mountain by 20% to 95% concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the soil (less than 1% is normal). Chemical analysis of the CO2 indicated it was derived from magma. answer the following question: What was the name of the area that had upward movement of magma under it? Answer:","output":"The name of the area that had upward movement of magma under it is Long Valley Caldera."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Context: Kendall was a waitress and made most money in tips. Question: What will Kendall want to do next? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: was a waitress B: save her tips C: give it away A:","output":"According to the context provided, Kendall was a waitress who made most of her money from tips. While there is limited information about her personal goals, we can make assumptions based on the context and select the answer that best fits. A: \\"was a waitress\\" - This answer simply restates the information already provided in the context and does not answer the question about what Kendall would want to do next. B: \\"save her tips\\" - Given that Kendall made most of her money from tips, it can be assumed that she would be mindful of her financial situation, especially since the service industry is often unpredictable when it comes to earnings. It is reasonable to assume that she might be interested in saving her tips to secure her finances and potentially reach her future financial goals. C: \\"give it away\\" - There is no information in the context to suggest that Kendall would want to give away her tips, especially since it is stated that she made most of her money from them. This answer seems unlikely and unsupported by the context. Therefore, based on the context given, the best answer to the question \\"What will Kendall want to do next?\\" would be B: \\"save her tips.\\" This answer takes into account Kendall's main source of income and suggests a logical plan for managing her finances."},{"instruction":"Article: Any science courses you are able to take can help prepare you for work as an environmentalist. Ecology classes are the most useful ones to take since they cover how living creatures interact with their environment. Other science courses, such as biology and chemistry, also come in handy. Remember that most environmentalists have a well-rounded education covering many different subjects. Even if the classes available to you aren’t what you want to do, they may come in handy later. A good university environmental science program teaches you even more about how the world works. It combines different fields an environmentalist needs to know, from natural sciences like biology to Earth sciences like geography. Earning your degree prepares you for entry-level jobs in environmentalist-related fields. Because environmentalists serve in a variety of roles, an environmental science degree isn’t your only option. Economics, political science, and even engineering can help you become an environmentalist. You can also earn a master’s degree to gain more credentials. Try studying public policy, environmental planning, or other fields related to the kind of work you want to do. Many environmentalists benefit from having a solid foundation of writing skills. You should learn how to write cohesive, grammatically-correct reports. Environmentalists often write reports on their work, draft laws for new environmental policies, or create funding proposals. In addition, an environmentalist needs to know how to tailor these writing assignments to their intended audience. Language classes are a good way to get a basis in writing. Business classes may also help you learn how to draft professional proposals. Science classes may cover the need to write reports. Take these seriously, since a lot of people depend on work reports from professional environmentalists. Taking a few computer classes can also round out your education. You will most likely need to use a computer to write reports and perform research. This means getting comfortable with word processor documents, spreadsheets, emails, and search engines. Classes covering information systems tend to be very useful in this line of work. Some environmentalists may use data software to for science and for compiling reports. Others may work out in the field using scientific equipment. Joining these programs will get you some experience. The best time to start volunteering is now! High school students can find opportunities with the local chapters of environmentalist groups, animal welfare groups, and other organizations. University students should contact their school’s environmental science department for internship opportunities. For example, you can join the Sierra Club, National Resource Defense Council, or work with animal sanctuaries. Think about what you can do in your community. Even helping out with local cleanup committees or animal protective programs makes a difference. Environmentalist is a large field, so there are many different jobs you can apply for. Take some time to consider your field or study and interests, then start looking for employers. Many government labs hire environmentalists for research purposes. Private labs also do this, while consulting firms need environmentalists to instruct others on greener living. Avoid overlooking related fields. For instance, food scientists can provide research for sustainable agriculture. Lobbyists speak with politicians about environmental laws. Many jobs, from meteorologists to marine biologists, can double as environmentalists. What is a summary?","output":"Summary: Taking various science courses such as ecology, biology, and chemistry can help prepare you for a career as an environmentalist. A well-rounded education, including classes in writing, languages, business, and computer skills, is crucial for success in this field. An environmental science degree is beneficial, but other fields like economics, political science, and engineering can also help you become an environmentalist. Gaining hands-on experience through volunteer work and internships with environmental organizations is important in building your career.

Answer: Insectivorous insects, or insects which feed on other insects, are beneficial to humans because they eat insects that could cause damage to agriculture and human structures. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Answer: The most visible predators of insects are known to be a diverse group of creatures that play a significant role in controlling insect populations. Among them are various insectivorous insects, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals that all contribute to the delicate balance within various ecosystems. Here, we will discuss some of the most prominent predators of insects: 1. Insectivorous insects: Many insects feed on other insects, providing a balance within their population and aiding in pest control. Familiar insect predators include: a. Ladybugs (Coccinellidae): These beetles feed primarily on aphids, scale insects, whiteflies, and spider mites. They are an essential ally for farmers and gardeners seeking to protect their plants from these pests. b. Mantises (Mantodea): Known for their impressive hunting skills, mantises primarily prey on flies, butterflies, moths, and small bees. They use their forelegs to capture and secure their prey before consuming it. c. Lacewings (Chrysopidae): With their voracious appetite for aphids, lacewing larvae contribute significantly to the control of these pests in agricultural fields and gardens. d. Dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata): These agile flying insects are top predators in their ecosystem, catching smaller flying insects like mosquitoes, flies, and moths mid-flight. 2. Birds: A broad range of bird species act as predators of insects, including small songbirds, swallows, swifts, and even larger birds of prey. Some examples are: a. Robins, warblers, and chickadees: These birds mostly feed on caterpillars, beetles, and other insects found on trees and shrubs. b. Woodpeckers: They are adept at excavating insects from tree bark, such as ants, beetles, and various larvae. c. Swallows and swifts: These birds capture insects in mid-air, often focusing on flies and mosquitoes. d. Owls: Although primarily nocturnal predators of small mammals, owls also prey on flying insects like moths and beetles. 3. Reptiles and amphibians: Various species of lizards, snakes, frogs, and salamanders consume insects as part of their diet. Examples include: a. Chameleons: Their exceptional ability to change color helps them blend into their surroundings, enabling them to sneak up on insect prey. b. Garter snakes: Although they mostly consume slugs and earthworms, these snakes also eat insects like grasshoppers and crickets. c. Frogs and toads: With their sticky tongues, these amphibians consume large quantities of insects, particularly flies, moths, and mosquitoes. 4. Mammals: Some mammals are also insect predators, with bats being the most widely known. a. Bats: These nocturnal mammals feed on a massive number of insects each night. Their diet consists primarily of moths, mosquitoes, beetles, and other flying insects. In conclusion, the most visible predators of insects include a variety of insects, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals that all play a role in controlling insect populations. These predators are essential for maintaining a balanced ecosystem and provide natural pest control services to agriculture and human environments."},{"instruction":"Mermithida - Mermithida is an order of nematode worms.

Options: - municipal park - office - state park - cemetary - public gardens reasoning:","output":"A public monument is likely to be erected by a city in a municipal park. Reasoning: A municipal park is a public area within a city that is designed for community gatherings, leisure activities, and enjoyment of green spaces. Erecting a monument in a municipal park ensures that it is easily accessible to the city's residents and visitors. It also offers an appropriate setting, considering that public parks often serve as communal spaces where people can come together and engage with the history, culture, and accomplishments symbolized by the monument. While monuments can also be found in other public spaces like state parks, cemeteries, and public gardens, a city is more likely to choose a municipal park for the following reasons: 1. Municipal parks are owned and managed by the city, making it easier for the city to control the process of erecting a monument within its boundaries. 2. State parks are typically larger and focus on preserving natural beauty, thus making them less suitable for placing a monument dedicated to a specific person or event. 3. Cemeteries primarily serve as burial grounds and memorial spaces for the deceased, making them less appropriate locations for a monument not directly related to those buried there. 4. Public gardens primarily focus on horticulture and plant conservation, making them less suitable locations for erecting monuments, unless the monument is specifically related to the garden's theme or purpose. An office is a less likely choice for erecting a public monument, as it is typically a private space used for conducting business and is not accessible by the general public."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: Misleading advertising by showing 2 sprays in the picture, you only get one.

He was given what must have seemed to the uninitiated a nice reception when his place in Benfica’s starting line-up was announced. No-one else in his side came close to drawing such a reaction, and neither did any player in the Valencia squad. His £7million move to Manchester United in 2010, sight unseen, remains one of English football’s great curiosities. But here he is, recruited by a side who completed a domestic treble last season and who came within a penalty shootout of winning the Europa League. VIDEO Scroll down to watch United flop","output":"Bebe training with Benfica and Sir Alex Ferguson talking about his signing As the game commenced, the weight of expectations and past disappointments seemed to hang heavy on Bebe's shoulders. Every touch, every pass, every movement was closely scrutinized by both fans and critics alike. He knew that he had to prove himself worthy of being in this extraordinary team and of his past association with one of the greatest football clubs in the world. The pressure, amplified by the constant murmurs and anticipation that filled the stadium, was both a challenge and a motivation for him to rise above his tainted reputation. Throughout the match, Bebe exhibited a level of determination and resilience that was commendable, if not exceptional. He actively participated in the team's movements, made intelligent runs, and occasionally displayed flashes of brilliance that hinted at the dormant potential lying within him. However, his inconsistent performance and the occasional misplaced pass served as a stark reminder of the reason behind the derisive jeers that seemed to follow him in every footballing environment. The knowledge that he was the subject of mockery and ridicule did not seem to dampen Bebe's spirit, but rather strengthened his resolve to prove himself. As the minutes ticked away and the game progressed, he worked tirelessly to make a tangible impact on the field - in the hope of every once in a while hearing genuine cheers from the audience and allowing himself to steal a brief, precious moment in the limelight. But alas, despite his best efforts, Bebe could not tip the scales in his or his team's favor. The final whistle blew, and with it came the sobering realization that his journey to redemption was far from complete. As he walked off the pitch, the same ironic, mocking cheers and laughter that greeted him before the start of the game seemed to follow him like a remorseless specter. Time will tell whether or not Bebe finds his way back into the hearts of football fans, or whether he will forever be remembered for that ill-fated £7million transfer. Yet, amidst the cruelty and hardship that define the world of professional football, perhaps the most valuable lesson that Bebe's story can teach us is the importance of grit, determination, and the relentless pursuit of one's dreams - even when the odds are stacked against us, and the world seems to turn its back."},{"instruction":"As a Poznań bishop , he participated in the synod in Łęczyca in 1180 .

Both sentences state the role of the person - a bishop hailing from Poznań - and the event they participated in - the Synod in Łęczyca in 1180. The first sentence states \\"As a Poznań bishop, he participated in the synod in Łęczyca in 1180\\" where the order is 1) Person's role, 2) Action, and 3) Event. On the other hand, the second sentence \\"As a bishop of Poznań, he participated in the Synod in Łęczyca in 1180\\" communicates the same information in a slightly different order: 1) Person's role, 2) Action, and 3) Event. The slight rephrasing between 'Poznań bishop' and 'bishop of Poznań' doesn't alter the substance of the sentence, merely the style. The word arrangement between the two sentences is an example of syntactic variation, which plays a large role in producing differences in sentence flow and emphasis. While the overall meanings remain the same, one might opt to use one sentence structure over the other for rhetorical purposes, stylistic reasons, or due to the specific syntactic rules or norms of the language in which one is writing. While both sentences denote the same person, role, event and time, the slight changes in language structure can serve to provide emphasis or deemphasis on certain elements depending on the broader context within which these sentences are used, even though their basic information remains the same."},{"instruction":"This task is about translating a given Yoruba language sentence to English.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

The two most important men in Lewis Hamilton’s life left Singapore, one with a permanent smile, the other with a frown and a suitcase full of trouble. The first was Anthony Hamilton, Lewis’s father and backbone through his karting life. The second was Paddy Lowe, the Mercedes boffin trying to stop millions of pounds’ worth of technology from breaking. Whether a car that can last a race or a mind in top working order is more crucial to Hamilton is unclear. Lewis Hamilton of Great Britain and Mercedes celebrates with his team including Nico Rosberg of Germany, his father Anthony Hamilton and his step-mother Linda Hamilton In","output":"In Lewis Hamilton's journey towards greatness, both his father Anthony Hamilton and Paddy Lowe of Mercedes played indispensable roles. Anthony Hamilton had been Lewis's pillar of strength right from his early karting days, providing him constant support and guidance throughout his racing career. As a father, he instilled in Lewis the values of hard work, determination, and humility that, in due course, contributed to his astounding achievements in the world of motorsports. On the other hand, Paddy Lowe, the renowned Mercedes engineer, was instrumental in ensuring the cutting-edge technology of Lewis's race cars stayed on par with the fierce competition. With millions of pounds dedicated to every aspect of the car, Lowe was committed to making innovative breakthroughs while preventing crucial technology from failing during races. As the brains behind the team's advanced mechanical engineering, Lowe made sure that Hamilton was always equipped with the best machinery to help him ascend the podium. However, the question of whether a perfectly functioning car or a mind in top working order is more significant for Hamilton's success remains open to debate. While it is without a doubt that both these factors are vital, they might be construed as two sides of the same coin, inextricably bound together in the pursuit of victory. In the world of Formula 1, where every second counts, any mechanical failure, even a minor one, can have far-reaching consequences on a driver's position in race standings. Paddy Lowe's expertise and the reliability of his engineering played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Mercedes cars performed optimally, empowering Hamilton to maintain his upward trajectory in the intensely competitive world of motorsports. Simultaneously, having a supportive and grounding figure like his father, Anthony Hamilton, also helped Lewis maintain his mental fortitude and weather the various challenges he faced on and off the track. The toil, the camaraderie, and the comprehensive backing of his father contributed to Hamilton's mental strength, enabling him to remain focused and determined to win race after race and eventually cement his status as one of the all-time greats of Formula 1. In the end, it might be reasonable to say that both a car that can last a race and a mind in top working order were essential elements in Lewis Hamilton's success story. In the unforgiving world of Formula 1, where the stakes are high and the cars are speeding at breakneck velocities, these two factors worked in harmony to bolster Hamilton's impeccable performance on the racecourse. Through the unwavering support of his father, Anthony Hamilton, and the technical wizardry of Paddy Lowe, Lewis Hamilton was poised to etch his name among the legends of the racing world, celebrating victories with his team, including his fellow driver Nico Rosberg. And the indelible bond between Hamilton and his father, as well as his stepmother, Linda Hamilton, was forged even further as they shared the moments of triumph with him."},{"instruction":"Where do you find wild cats?

Answer the above question based on the context below: With Morton, the New York Dolls recorded Too Much Too Soon in 1974 at A&R Studios in New York City. The album was later mastered at Sterling Sound and Masterdisk. During the sessions, Morton had Johansen record his vocals several times and incorporated sound effects such as gongs, gunshots, and feminine choruses. In a report on the album's progress for Melody Maker, journalist Lenny Kaye wrote that they were taking more time than they had on their first record, \\"bringing in occasional strings and horns, following Shadow's advice not 'to settle'.\\" Morton and the band shared an affinity for each other, as he found the group's energy in the studio refreshing, while Johansen was fond of Morton and the \\"looser\\" feel he provided for their music. \\"That man is completely unpretentious\\", Johansen said of the producer. \\"He doesn't think he ever did a marvellous thing in his life.\\" The New York Dolls and Morton produced little original material together.

Options: - write code - executable file - compile - think logically - get frustrated Let's think step by step:","output":"1. Write code: Before a program can exist, someone, usually a programmer, must write the code. This code is a set of instructions or commands that dictate how the program will function. This is the starting point for creating a program. 2. Compile: Once the code is written, it must be compiled. Compiling is the process of converting the human-readable code into machine-readable code. This is necessary because computers can only understand binary language (0s and 1s), and the code must be translated into a format that the computer can execute. 3. Executable file: The compiled code results in an executable file. This file can be run or executed by the computer's operating system, allowing the program to perform its intended function.

When he's forced to throw a critical fight to pay his gambling debts, Tyler must confront his demons and fight for his integrity, his career, and ultimately, his redemption. Plot: Tyler Mitchell grew up in a rough neighborhood where poverty and crime were the norms. Boxing was his only way out; it gave him a sense of purpose and a shot for a better future. Unfortunately, his impulsive nature led him down a dark path of addiction, resulting in him accumulating a substantial amount of gambling debt. To pay off his debts, Tyler is coerced by the ruthless crime boss, Eddie \\"The Shark\\" Kowalski, into throwing the most important fight of his career. Eddie threatens Tyler's life, as well as the well-being of his younger brother, Chris, who Tyler has been striving to protect and keep on a straight path. With no other choice, Tyler reluctantly agrees. During the build-up to the fight, Tyler is confronted with feelings of guilt and despair. He spends his remaining nights at the gym, trying to forget his predicament. One night, he meets Olivia, an aspiring journalist who sees in Tyler a story worth telling. They develop a deep connection and find solace in each other, and Olivia soon begins to uncover the truth about Eddie, her investigative nature digging into Tyler's life. As the night of the fight arrives, Tyler takes a few early rounds to make it look convincing, but in the final round, he can't bring himself to lose deliberately. It's at this moment that he decides to fight back and win. Tyler ultimately defeats his opponent in a stunning comeback, but the consequences of his actions are far reaching. Once news about Tyler's betrayal reaches Eddie, he sets his sights on the only person he thinks can make Tyler pay: Chris. In a desperate attempt to save his brother, Tyler and Olivia team up to find evidence that can put Eddie behind bars once and for all. Through Olivia's journalism contacts, they discover a hidden connection linking Eddie to an illegal gambling and fight-fixing operation. With the help of the unscrupulous Eddie's former henchman, Terry, who has a change of heart after seeing Tyler take a stand, the three expose Eddie's operation to the police and get him arrested. However, their actions put Chris in even greater danger, as Eddie decides to take matters into his own brutal hands, kidnapping him just before being apprehended. In a nail-biting climax, Tyler confronts Eddie in an abandoned warehouse where Chris is being held. In the ensuing fight, Tyler ultimately defeats Eddie before the police arrive to arrest him. Chris is freed and everything seems back to normal for Tyler, but the damage done to his boxing career will take time to get back on track. Months later, Chris has managed to win a scholarship to college, and Tyler, with Olivia by his side, starts to rebuild his career and rebuild his trust with fans. As the movie ends, Tyler faces off against an opponent in a sold-out arena, symbolizing that he's on his way to a second chance in life and his career. Ultimately, Second Chance Showdown is a redemption story that shows the power of belief, self-discovery, and perseverance when faced with life's toughest challenges and how one's actions can impact not only their own life but also those around them."},{"instruction":"Sentence: name = Aromi, eatType = coffee shop, food = Japanese, customer rating = 5 out of 5, area = city centre, familyFriendly = no Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","output":"To represent the content of the sentence in data form, we can create a structured data format, such as JSON.

In this sentence, \\"assume\\" is used to describe a transformation or a change in shape or form. The gods are taking on, or adopting, human or animal forms in the context of the fables. Here, the term \\"assume\\" implies a more physical change, which may involve appearance, characteristics, and abilities of the form they take on. 2. She assumed indifference, even though she was seething with anger. In this sentence, \\"assume\\" refers to the act of adopting or pretending to have a certain attitude, feeling, or behavior. In this context, the woman is pretending to be indifferent or unconcerned, even though she is actually very angry. This usage deals more with the emotional or behavioral aspect rather than a physical change. Here, \\"assume\\" describes a feigned or projected manner or state of mind, rather than an actual transformation. In both sentences, \\"assume\\" conveys the idea of adopting or taking on a certain form, manner, or state, but in slightly different ways. In the first sentence, it pertains to physical transformation or change, whereas in the second sentence, it is more about adopting a facade, attitude, or emotion.

Smiling can help you to feel more confidence and make people think of you as a more friendly person. If you want to keep healthy, you should not only smile but also laugh.

Choices: - overabundance - comprehensive - plentitude - superabundance - presence The rationale to choose \\"presence\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"The correct answer is \\"presence\\" because, in this context, it refers to the child wanting his parents to be with him, providing their time, attention, and emotional support. When a child feels lonely, it typically means they are missing human interaction, especially with those they are emotionally attached to, such as their parents. Here's the rationale for not choosing the other options: 1. Overabundance - This term refers to an excess or surplus of something. In the context of the child's emotions, it doesn't make sense to choose this option, as it doesn't directly address the emotional need of the child. 2. Comprehensive - This term means complete or thorough, covering all aspects of something. Although it can imply a sense of thoroughness, it is not specific to the emotional need of the child. 3. Plentitude - This term signifies abundance or a large quantity of something. Just like 'overabundance,' the term 'plentitude' is not directly related to the emotional need of the child and does not address loneliness. 4. Superabundance - Similar to the terms mentioned above, 'superabundance' also means an excessively abundant supply of something. It does not address the emotional aspect of the child's loneliness. In conclusion, \\"presence\\" is the most appropriate answer among the choices, as it best represents the child's desire to have his parents around to alleviate his feelings of loneliness."},{"instruction":"The robbers struck at about 11:20 BST on High Street in Thame, Oxfordshire.

A:","output":"Trampoline Lombardi jumped higher with her pogo stick on a trampoline versus mud puddles because the mud puddles have more resistance. Let us explore the reasons behind this in detail. Trampolines are specifically designed to maximize jumping height by providing an elastic and flexible surface. They work by converting the jumper's kinetic energy into potential energy, which propels them upwards. This is possible because the trampoline's surface deforms under pressure and then returns to its original shape, imparting upward force on the jumper. This process minimizes energy loss and maximizes the height of each jump. On the other hand, mud puddles have a higher viscosity and resistance as compared to the more solid surface of a trampoline or even regular ground. When something applies force to mud, such as a person jumping, the mud experiences internal friction, which results in higher energy losses. Additionally, mud has adhesive properties that tend to stick to objects that it contacts, further reducing the potential energy conversion and downward force. In summary, trampolines provide an elastic surface that optimizes energy conversion, allowing Lombardi to jump higher on her pogo stick. Mud puddles, conversely, have more resistance and higher internal friction, which leads to greater energy loss and diminished jumping height. Hence, the correct answer is \\"trampoline.\\""},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: Jan 4, 1966 saw a military coup take place in the African country Upper Volta.

Let me provide you with a more detailed explanation of the translation: 1. \\"Bachelor's degree\\" - In French, a Bachelor's degree is simply referred to as a \\"Bachelor.\\" So, this part translates to \\"Bachelor.\\" 2. \\"Economics\\" - The word for Economics in French is \\"économie.\\" Therefore, the translation for this part remains \\"en économie.\\" 3. \\"Columbia University\\" - The name of the institution, Columbia University, does not change in French. It is kept as \\"Université Columbia.\\" 4. \\"New York\\" - The name of the city, New York, remains unchanged in French, so it is still \\"New York.\\" So, putting it all together, \\"Bachelor's degree, Economics, Columbia University, New York.\\" translates to \\"Bachelor en économie, Université Columbia, New York.\\" in French."},{"instruction":"myanmar 's military junta charged pro-democracy icon aung san suu kyi thursday with breaching the terms of her house arrest after a us man swam across a lake and hid inside her home , her lawyer said .

Here is another sentence: Iced tea is a cooling drink. Q: Does the term tea mean the same thing in both these sentences? Possible answers: A). different meanings B). the same meaning","output":"A). Different meanings In the two sentences provided, the term \\"tea\\" has different meanings. In the first sentence: \\"Tea has fragrant white flowers.\\" The term \\"tea\\" here refers to the tea plant, also known as Camellia sinensis. It is an evergreen shrub native to East Asia and the Indian subcontinent. This plant is widely cultivated for its leaves, which are used to produce tea, a popular beverage consumed worldwide. The tea plant has fragrant white flowers, which indicates that it is the plant being described in the sentence and not the actual beverage. In the second sentence: \\"Iced tea is a cooling drink.\\" The term \\"tea\\" in this sentence refers to the beverage made from the leaves of the tea plant. In this context, it specifically refers to iced tea – a chilled variation of the traditional hot tea. Iced tea is made by steeping tea leaves in hot water, allowing it to cool down, and then serving it over ice or chilled. This type of tea can be served sweetened or unsweetened. The term \\"tea\\" in this sentence is used to describe a drink and not the plant. So, in summary, the term \\"tea\\" has different meanings in both sentences: 1. In the first sentence, it refers to the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) - the source of tea leaves used to make the beverage. 2. In the second sentence, it refers to the actual beverage, specifically, iced tea. This difference in meanings highlights the versatility and various contexts in which the term \\"tea\\" can be used in the English language."},{"instruction":"Addison ran the marathon after training for months with her sister. Given the context: What does Addison need to do before the marathon? Possible answers: ignore her sister, take her sister to dinner, train with her sister Answer:","output":"Before the marathon, Addison needs to train with her sister. The context provided states that Addison ran the marathon after training for months with her sister, indicating that their joint training sessions played a significant role in preparing for the marathon. This collaboration with her sister not only offers a support system but also makes their training sessions more enjoyable and effective. Training with her sister would involve several activities to prepare themselves for the marathon. These activities include: 1. Developing a training plan: Together, Addison and her sister should outline a detailed training plan, specifying the frequency, duration, and intensity of their training sessions. They could also establish milestones to measure their progress and make adjustments as needed. 2. Building cardiovascular endurance: Addison and her sister should participate in regular cardiovascular activities such as running, cycling, or swimming. This will help them improve their stamina and cardiovascular fitness levels, both of which are essential for successfully completing a marathon. 3. Strengthening exercises: Along with aerobic exercises, the sisters should incorporate strength training exercises into their schedule. This includes targeting core muscles, hip muscles, and leg muscles to ensure a strong foundation for long-distance running and to prevent injuries. 4. Flexibility and recovery: Stretching and foam rolling after their training sessions will help Addison and her sister maintain flexibility, reduce the risk of injury, and promote muscle recovery. Additionally, they should schedule rest days as a part of their training plan to prevent overtraining and allow for adequate recovery. 5. Nutrition and hydration: Preparing healthy meals and snacks will ensure Addison and her sister receive the necessary nutrients and energy to support their training efforts. They should also prioritize hydration throughout their training and leading up to the marathon, as proper fluid replenishment is crucial for endurance events. 6. Running gear and clothing: Addison and her sister should invest in appropriate running shoes, moisture-wicking clothing, and other gear specific to their needs. This will help avoid discomfort and injuries during training and the marathon. 7. Practice runs: The sisters should make time for longer practice runs, gradually increasing the distance as their fitness levels improve. This will help them gauge their progress, adapt to longer distances, and gain an understanding of race day pacing. In summary, Addison should train with her sister to ensure the best possible outcome on marathon day. By engaging in these activities together, they can support each other, enhance motivation, and ultimately enhance their chances of success in the marathon. Ignoring her sister or taking her to dinner, as the alternative answers suggest, would not contribute to their marathon preparations or foster a supportive training environment."},{"instruction":"Sam Goodman 's biography of the Spartan general Xenophanes conveys a vivid sense of the difficulties *he* faced in his childhood.

Shift Supervisor Jack Godell (Lemmon) notices an unusual vibration while grabbing his cup of coffee which he had set down. He then finds that a gauge is misreading and that the coolant is dangerously low (he thought it was overflowing). The crew manages to bring the reactor under control and can be seen celebrating and expressing relief. Richard surreptitiously films the incident, despite being requested to not film the control room for security purposes. Kimberly's superior at work (Donat) refuses to permit her to report what happened or show the film, disgusting Richard, who steals the footage. He shows it to experts, who conclude that the plant came perilously close to the China Syndrome in which the core would have melted down into the earth, hitting groundwater and contaminating the surrounding area with radioactive steam. During an inspection of the plant before it is brought back online, Godell discovers a puddle of radioactive water that has apparently leaked from a pump. Godell pushes to delay restarting the plant, but the plant superintendent denies his request and appears willing to let nothing stand in the way of the scheduled restart of the plant. Godell investigates further and finds that a series of radiographs supposedly taken to verify the integrity of welds on the leaking pump are identical - the contractor simply kept submitting the same picture. He believes that the plant is unsafe and could be severely damaged if another full-power SCRAM occurs. He tries to bring the evidence to plant manager Herman DeYoung (Brady), who brushes off Godell as paranoid and states that new radiographs would cost at least 20 million. Godell confronts D.B.

To strengthen the state machine,the British bourgeosie have let it come into being and exist in one form or another since the 17th century. P.S.Tregidgo once said,\\"The more parties there are,the less likely it is that any one of them will be strong enough in Parliament to control all the others; but when there are only two,one of them is sure to have a majority of seats. This helps to ensure a strong and stable government.\\" This explains why the British have the twoparty system. The division into two parties grew out the establishment of a Protestant Church of England in the 16th century. Because of a purely religious difference of opinion,the Puritans were separated from the broad body of the Anglican Church. The non Puritan Anglicans were on the side of the King and Church,whose supporters were called by their opponents \\"Tories\\".The Puritans were for Parliament and trade,whose supporters are called by the \\"Tories\\" \\"Whigs\\".The Tories and the Whigs were in power by turns for a long time. In 1833,the Tory Party split into two and its name was changed to Conservative. In the 1860s the Whigs became Liberals. Since then,the Liberals and the Conservatives were in office by turns until 1922.They have some different opinions,but were both controlled by the rich.

By Daniel Miller Nigel Farage's former flatmate has branded the UKIP leader a 'salesman' claiming he is not not up to the job of leading the party and should step down to make way for someone younger. Godfrey Bloom, a former UKIP MEP now sitting as an independent after losing the whip for hitting a journalist and calling women sluts, shared a flat with Mr Farage in Brussels for several years. But on the eve of Mr Farage's second televised debate over Europe with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, he took a swipe at his former colleague saying UKIP needed to 'sharpen its game'. In 2012 Mr","output":"Bloom had warned that UKIP was becoming too focused on one personality, Mr Farage, and that this presented a potential problem for the party's growth going forward. His claims have since gained traction amongst party members. These concerns have only escalated with Mr Farage's multiple failed bids for parliamentary seats, not least in South Thanet in 2015. Veteran UKIP members have started to voice their opinions that it is time for a change in leadership as they believe the party needs a new direction and a fresh face to appeal to younger voters. They argue that a younger leader would bring about much-needed diversity and could help UKIP become a more inclusive party, breaking away from its traditional image. During an interview on a Radio 4 program, Mr Bloom also criticized Mr Farage's performance in the previous debate with Mr Clegg, asserting that Farage was unable to present a coherent argument on some key points, most notably immigration policy. Despite the criticism, it is acknowledged that Farage's charisma and salesmanship have greatly contributed to the party's initial rise. However, support for UKIP has been waning since the Brexit referendum in 2016, with many perceiving that the party has lost its primary cause after achieving its goal of leaving the European Union. Thus, it seems that many party members now see a change in leadership as the logical next step in order to reinvigorate the party and adapt to the needs of the post-Brexit era. Several potential contenders for the UKIP leadership have been mentioned, including prominent members like Douglas Carswell and Paul Nuttall. However, none of them have the same level of recognition as Mr Farage, and it remains to be seen if any of them possess the qualities that would make them strong leaders for the party. As for Nigel Farage, he has been dismissive of the criticism, arguing that the negativity comes from a disgruntled minority within the party. He has stated that he remains committed to seeing UKIP through the changing political landscape and continuing the fight for a fairer, prosperous Britain. Nevertheless, Farage has also acknowledged in recent months that he is considering the possibility of stepping down, stating that UKIP would benefit from a more diverse and revitalized leadership. As the tension within the party continues to grow, several high-profile UKIP members have stated their intentions to remain loyal to Mr Farage. They argue his charisma and ability to attract support are vital keys to the party's success. However, with increasing pressure for a fresh face at the helm, Farage's future leadership may be increasingly uncertain. In conclusion, the logical completion of the news story involves UKIP's internal struggles over its future leadership and the direction the party should take post-Brexit. Brexit has brought uncertainty on how the party can continue to define itself and push its agenda. Mr Farage will therefore have to either adapt to the shifting political landscape or risk being ousted by party members who believe a new leader is necessary to propel the party forward."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"However, the way in which national jurisdictions implement these laws means that European law falls outside their scope, all the more so as this European law, in my country, France, for example, takes precedence, under Article 55 of our constitution, over French domestic law.\\" to Romanian?","output":"Cu toate acestea, modul în care jurisdicțiile naționale aplică aceste legi înseamnă că legea europeană nu este inclusă în domeniul lor, cu atât mai mult întrucât această lege europeană, în țara mea Franța, spre exemplu, are prioritate, conform Articolului 55 din constituția noastră, asupra legii interne franceze.

Step 2: Identify possible negative aspects of the place In order to generate a negative review, I need to consider some potential negative aspects of the café. Here are some possibilities: 1. Long waiting times 2. Poor customer service 3. Unhygienic environment 4. Subpar food and drink quality 5. Overpricing Step 3: Describe the negative aspects in detail To create a credible negative review, it's important to provide a detailed description of the negative aspects experienced. I will choose three of the negative aspects listed and elaborate on them: 1. Long waiting times: \\"I waited for 30 minutes just to be seated, and another 25 minutes to receive my order.\\" 2. Poor customer service: \\"The staff members were inattentive and unhelpful when I had questions about the menu.\\" 3. Subpar food and drink quality: \\"My cappuccino was lukewarm, and the croissant tasted stale as if it had been sitting out all day.\\" Step 4: Write the negative review, combining all the information from the previous steps Title: \\"Disappointing Experience at The Cozy Corner Café\\" I had heard great things about The Cozy Corner Café and was excited to give it a try, but unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory.

(The flight was aborted at the last second after a faulty valve was discovered; SpaceX officials said the launch was postponed till Tuesday or Wednesday.) Some NASA supporters are mourning what they see as the decline of U.S. leadership in space. But they should really be celebrating the dawn of a new era. After all, we've been stuck in low Earth orbit for several decades now, at considerable cost. Visionary plans for genuine space exploration have gathered dust at NASA, the National Research Council and other space-savvy places. They advocate relearning how to land on the moon or figuring out how to travel to Mars, an asteroid or the special orbital location where the James Webb Space Telescope will eventually operate. But after more than two decades of talking that talk, the U.S. has yet to walk that walk. Private space companies describe a vision that sounds like the original OPTIONS: - CNN: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - Earth orbit: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - International Space Station: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - James Webb Space Telescope: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - Mars: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - Meg Urry: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - NASA: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - National Research Council: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - SpaceX: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - U.S: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - U.S.: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. - Urry: big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation.","output":"Private space companies, such as SpaceX, describe a vision that consists of big goals, with small but steady steps toward those goals, and much support but little interference from the nation. This vision aligns with the main objective of advancing space exploration by leveraging the innovation and cost-effectiveness offered by private enterprises. By doing so, they aim to assist government space agencies like NASA in achieving their goals and maintaining the leadership of countries such as the U.S. in space. One of the advantages of private space companies is their greater flexibility in terms of decision making and execution, as they do not depend on government bureaucracy and budget allocations. This enables them to develop and test new technologies at a faster rate, which in turn allows for the rapid progress of space exploration. For instance, SpaceX has developed reusable rockets that significantly reduce the cost of launching spacecraft, making space exploration more affordable and accessible to a wider range of organizations and countries. Moreover, private companies can attract funding from different sources, including private investors and venture capitalists, which can help to bolster financial resources for audacious space ventures. This diversification of financial sources can alleviate the burden on taxpayers and the federal budget, allowing governments to allocate funds to other crucial areas such as education, healthcare, or national defense while still making significant strides in space exploration. Collaboration between public agencies like NASA and private players like SpaceX has the potential to synergize the strengths of both entities, ultimately leading to greater efficiency and more significant achievements in space exploration. In particular, the access to advanced technology provided by private companies can support government agencies to focus on research that involves deeper exploration of space and finding ways to improve life back on Earth. Furthermore, private companies can help stimulate public interest in space exploration and inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs by offering out-of-the-box solutions and exciting new projects in the space industry. This includes plans by SpaceX for crewed missions to Mars, as well as asteroid mining initiatives and space tourism opportunities. By bringing novel ideas to the table and pushing the boundaries of space exploration, private companies can keep the public engaged and hopeful about the future of space travel. In conclusion, private space companies like SpaceX offer a new frontier for space exploration, with a progressive vision that includes big goals, achieved through small but steady steps. By collaborating with government bodies such as NASA and receiving support without undue interference from the nation, they can propel the space industry forward, maintain the leadership of countries like the U.S. in this arena, and ultimately bring humanity to the next phase in our journey through the cosmos."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: \\"One of the children in the 19th century family at the centre of the famous murder trial dramatised in the UK TV show \\"\\"The Suspicions of Mr Whicher\\"\\", William Saville-Kent, became a naturalist whose seminal work shaped Australian practice in what area ?\\"","output":"To answer this question, I will follow these steps: 1.

Call your landlord and ask them what you're allowed to do in your rental. You may be able to change fixtures or knobs, paint the walls, or apply wallpaper. If your landlord doesn’t want you to make changes, you can try to convince them by explaining that you’re trying to raise the property value. You can also tell them that you’ll repaint the walls before you move out. if you’re allowed to. Get swatches from the paint store and hold them up against your walls to help you determine if the color is right for the decor that you want to achieve. Then, purchase the paint from a hardware or paint store. To paint your walls, lay drop cloths and apply a coat of primer with a brush to the wall. Then, use a roller or a brush and apply paint in long broad strokes down the wall until it's covered in paint. You may want to apply more than one coat depending on how dark you want the wall to be. You can also paint a single accent wall instead of painting them all. Once you decide on a color, make sure to send your landlord a swatch to get their approval before you start painting. Think of what kind of palette you want and go for a color that compliments the furniture and items that you already have in your apartment. Rooms that have a lot of natural light look better with lighter colors while darker rooms, like basements, look better with darker colored walls.

Founded in 1892, the Carabane school was one of the first in the region. It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns belonging to the indigenous congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary began teaching classes for girls. Soon, there were 60 students. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona. Carabane has a new primary school, École François Mendy, inaugurated on January 21, 2006, hosting six classes. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students may continue their studies at the middle school in Elinkine, the Aline Sitoe Diatta High School in Oussouye, and then a university in either Dakar or Ziguinchor. Carabane's kindergarten is located in a community house, called \\"House of Women and Children,\\" founded in 1988 under the auspices of Caritas Ziguinchor. In 1895, the government established a medical post in Carabane, but it closed the following year.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose general climate change happens, how will it affect it will be harder for fires to start. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation, which is general climate change, does have an effect on the process. The process described - \\"forest fires leading to changes in animal habitats and ecosystem dynamics\\" - is affected by climate change both directly and indirectly. First and foremost, climate change directly influences forest fires. Warmer temperatures and frequent drought conditions create a conducive environment for wildfires to ignite and spread. When a region experiences these conditions due to a changing climate, there can be an increase in vulnerability to forest fires, which ultimately exacerbate the problems being faced by animals living in these forests. As a result of the increased frequency and intensity of fires, habitat loss becomes more prevalent. The animals that depend on the forest for shelter, food, and mating grounds are placed under increased pressure to find alternative habitats, and may face a decline in available resources, making it more challenging for them to thrive. Moreover, the entire food chain can be disrupted by the changes brought about due to forest fires. Since predators and prey both face the consequences of climate change-driven forest fires, there can be a direct effect on their populations and relationships in the ecosystem. For instance, if a predator species becomes more abundant due to easier access to prey as a result of the canopy loss caused by fires, it may lead to the decline or extinction of the prey species. Additionally, as you mentioned, migrating birds may need to fly away from the area to find a more suitable habitat as a result of the forest fires. This can cause the bird populations in those areas to decrease, which can consequently impact the ecosystem because birds contribute significantly to seed dispersal and pollination. The warming waters you mentioned due to forest fires can also have a direct effect on fish populations and the overall aquatic ecosystem. Higher water temperatures can change the metabolic rates of fish, alter their food availability, and shift their suitable habitat ranges. This exposes fish to new predators, decreases their ability to survive, and can ultimately lead to a reduction in species diversity in these ecosystems. Furthermore, climate change-driven wildfires can indirectly affect other processes in the environment, such as local weather patterns and water cycles. In fact, the smoke and particulates emitted from forest fires can contribute to climate change itself by releasing greenhouse gases and darkening the atmosphere, absorbing heat, and further exacerbating the warming effect. To conclude, the perturbation hypothesis you proposed highlights the interconnectedness and complexity of ecosystems. Climate change undoubtedly affects numerous processes, including forest fires, their impact on animal populations, and other environmental aspects. It is crucial to understand these intricate relationships and work toward mitigating the effects of climate change to preserve the health and diversity of our ecosystems."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: length of new guardians of the galaxy movie?","output":"The new Guardians of the Galaxy movie is like watching three cartoons of about half an hour each back to back.

Despite a number of ethical concerns, Christine Piff, who founded the charity Let's Face It after suffering a rare facial cancer 25 years ago, welcomed the possibility of face transplants. She rejected the idea that the procedure would mean people would end up living with a dead person's face. \\"There are so many people without faces, I have half a face... but we are all so much more than just a face... you don't take on their personality. You are still you,\\" she told reporters. \\"If we can donate other organs of the body, then why not the face? I can't see anything wrong with it.\\" Question: When Christine Piff says \\"There are so many people without faces...\\", she refers to the people who _ . Options: A: are dishonorable and shameless B: disagree with the full face transplant C: are seriously injured by an accident D: are disfigured by accidents, burns and cancer","output":"To answer this question, I will analyze the context in which Christine Piff's quote is mentioned in the article. Her quote comes after discussing the potential benefits of full face transplants for people disfigured by accidents, burns, or cancer. It seems she is referring to those individuals who have suffered facial disfigurements and would benefit from such a procedure.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: Ferguson is concerned about who's liberal direction? Title: Executive Action Movie plot: A narrator states that when President Lyndon Johnson was asked about the Kennedy Assassination and the Warren Commission report, he said he doubted the findings of the Commission. The narration ends with the mention that the segment did not run on television and was cut from a program about Johnson, at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy. He remains unconvinced, saying, \\"I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work.\\" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group: He shows Ferguson and others that a careful assassination of a U.S. President can be done under certain conditions, and refers to the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and William McKinley as examples, and includes assassination attempts of others including Roosevelt in 1933. He calls this \\"executive action\\". The film cuts to a desert, where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15Â miles per hour. The lead conspirators, Farrington and Foster, discuss preparations for the assassination. Obtaining Ferguson's approval is crucial to the conspirators, although Farrington proceeds to organize two shooting teams in anticipation that Ferguson will change his mind. Ferguson, meanwhile, watches news reports and becomes highly concerned at Kennedy's increasingly \\"liberal\\" direction: action on civil rights, Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, nuclear disarmament. The deciding moment comes when he is watching an anti-Kennedy news report on the deteriorating situation in South...

After two years in Yonkers, New York, the family moved to Longmeadow, Massachusetts, where Santiago attended Longmeadow High School and graduated from Wilbraham & Monson Academy in 1983. His first experience with a musical instrument was playing a Hammond organ at the age of eight, but he never took on the instrument seriously because he had to share it with five brothers. Santiago first played a guitar at the age of nine after he noticed a classical guitar hanging on his oldest brother's wall for decoration. The first song he learned to play was The Velvet Underground's \\"Rock and Roll\\".As a teenager, Santiago became interested in computer programming, naming his first program \\"Iggy\\" and his second \\"Pop\\" after punk rocker Iggy Pop. He participated in a cycle ride across the United States in aid of charity, but on completing it did not bother to collect the sponsor's money.After graduating from high school in 1983, Santiago studied at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He remained without a major as long as the university would permit him to, but eventually chose economics. He met Charles Thompson, an anthropology student and the future Pixies frontman, after he heard Thompson and his roommate playing their guitars. Santiago rushed home to collect his guitar, and was soon playing \\"non-blues-scale, non-cover-song rock\\" with Thompson.Santiago and Thompson shared a room at the start of the second semester. Santiago soon introduced his new roommate to 1970s punk and the music of David Bowie. He later recalled their time together in college: \\"Charles and I had a suite at the college dorm.

Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes. The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.

Identify Galligan: It's unclear who \\"Galligan\\" refers to, as there could be multiple individuals with the last name Galligan. We need more context or information to specify which Galligan this statement is referring to. It could be a famous person, fictional character, or someone else entirely. 2. Search for relevant records or sources: Once Galligan is identified, we would need to search for records or sources providing information about this individual being stranded on the Galápagos Islands. This may involve searching through news articles, biographies, documentaries, or other reliable sources. 3. Verify the reliability of the sources: After finding sources, we must validate their reliability and credibility to ensure that they are not based on rumors, falsehoods, or fictional accounts. This could involve cross-referencing multiple sources, checking the reputation of the author or organization providing the information, and verifying that the information is consistent across different sources. 4. Analyze the information: If the sources are deemed reliable, we should analyze the information and verify the details of Galligan's situation. It needs to be determined if the individual was actually stranded on the Galápagos Islands, how it happened, and under what circumstances. 5. Determine the veracity of the statement: Based on our research, we must decide if the statement is a verifiable fact or not. If we find concrete, reliable evidence that supports the statement, then we can consider it a verifiable fact. However, if we are unable to find relevant information, or the sources we find are not reliable, then we cannot conclusively determine if the statement is a verifiable fact. Without more information on who Galligan is, it is impossible to determine whether or not the statement is a verifiable fact.

Lonnie works in a lab. He is studying atoms and discovers that the electrons that are farther away from the nucleus are moving less. or more? The answer is:","output":"The answer is \\"more\\". Step 1: Understand the question The question asks about the relationship between the distance of an electron from the nucleus of an atom and its energy levels and movement. Step 2: Recall information about electron energy levels and movement From the given information, we know that the electron levels have more and more energy as we go farther from the nucleus of an atom. The electron energy levels are called electron shells, and they correspond to increasing average distances from the nucleus. Electrons in higher energy levels or shells have higher potential energy and are likely to be found farther from the nucleus. Step 3: Analyze the situation Lonnie works in a lab and studies atoms. He discovers that the electrons farther away from the nucleus have more energy than those closer to the nucleus. Step 4: Apply the principles of physics to determine electron movement Based on the principles of physics and quantum mechanics, electrons with more energy (higher energy levels) typically move faster than electrons with less energy (lower energy levels). In part, this is because their higher energy allows them to occupy larger orbits around the nucleus. Step 5: Provide the answer to the question Given the information provided and our understanding of electron energy levels, the answer is that electrons that are farther away from the nucleus of an atom are moving more."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Title: Worst printer ever Review: For about a decade I always have bought HP printers.

The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and Royal Northern College of Music. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824. It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School. Established in 1515, as a free grammar school next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body.

They share many morphological features with the scorpionfish of the family Scorpaenidae. - Cirrhitichthys is a genus of hawkfishes found on tropical reefs in the Indian and western Pacific oceans . - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Using an unofficial nickname of \\"The River City\\", Jacksonville has a culture centered on the St. Johns. An annual footrace named the Gate River Run accepts 18,000 participants who travel a course along and over the river twice. The largest kingfishing tournament in the U.S. is held on a St. Johns tributary, where sport fishers concentrate on king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), cobia (Rachycentron canadum), dolphin (Coryphaena hippurus) and Wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri). The home stadium for the Jacksonville Jaguars faces the river, as does most of the commercial center of downtown. Seven bridges span the St. Johns at Jacksonville; all of them allow tall ships to pass, although some restrict passing times when train or automobile traffic is heavy.Tides cause seawater to enter the mouth of the St. Johns River and can affect the river's level into the middle basin. As a result, much of the river in Jacksonville is part seawater, making it an estuarine ecosystem. The animals and plants in these systems can tolerate both fresh and salt water, and the fluctuations in saline content and temperatures associated with tidal surges and heavy rainfall discharge. Marine animals such as dolphins and sharks can be spotted at times in the St. Johns at Jacksonville as can manatees. Fish such as mullet (Mullidae), flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma), shad (Alosa sapidissima), and blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) migrate from the ocean to freshwater springs upriver to spawn.Although freshwater invertebrates inhabiting and comprising algae and periphyton make the foundation of food webs in the middle and lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat. Mollusks gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding on the bottom of the river and ocean floors.

This introductory scene establishes that Monika is not simply the local gravedigger. The body snatcher is depicted with a particularly feminine appearance: red nail polish in her fingernails, pencil skirt and polka dot blouse.[5] Monika apparently evades notice while carrying Rob's corpse into her apartment, where she unwraps him from his body bag. Images of tabloid headlines inform viewers of the source of Monika's knowledge of Rob and his activities.[5] Meanwhile, Mark (Mark Reeder) heads to his as-yet-unspecified job, and the film then cuts back to a scene of Monika undressing Rob. Mark's job is thereupon revealed to be dubbing porn films, and this scene foreshadows the next, in which Monika has sex with Rob's corpse. Betty (Beatrice Manowski), Rob's ex-girlfriend from the previous film, is then briefly introduced as she discovers, to her disappointment, that Rob's grave has already been robbed. Monika fails to have an orgasm and the sex scene ends with her running to the bathroom. She is disgusted, and about to vomit.

Before the buildings were erected, the college operated from rented houses elsewhere in Oxford, on Banbury Road and Woodstock Road. There were further changes to Harrison's second design, as not only had inflation between 1937 and 1949 reduced the value of Nuffield's original donation, but additional savings had to be made in the difficult post-war economic situation. A scale model, created in 1949 as work started, showed the alterations: a shortened tower, a plainer main entrance, and no arcades within the quadrangles. Further changes were made once work was under way, including the indefinite postponement of construction of the institute opposite the college. The plans of the tower were altered so that it would hold a library, instead of being purely ornamental, windows were added at regular intervals, and it was topped by a copper flèche, or small spire.A further delay in construction was announced in 1951, when labour and materials were restricted because of a government rearmament drive. Work to complete the quadrangle, including a hall, kitchen and the library tower, began in 1955 at a cost of £200,000. This money was donated to the college by the Nuffield Foundation upon Lord Nuffield's recommendation. Until it was required for books, the fellows of the college used the upper floor as a Senior Common Room. The tower was completed in 1956, and the college as a whole (without the institute on the site opposite, which is now used as a car park) was finished in 1960. Work was still under way when the college was incorporated by royal charter in 1958, thereby becoming a self-governing entity. The charter was presented to the college by the Duke of Edinburgh on 6 June 1958, at the first lunch to be served in the hall.Colvin commented that, apart from the flèche which was similar to the initial plan,... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the foundation that donated to complete construction work at the college?, what is it ?

It is the most populous governorate in Syria with a population of more than 4,868,000 (2011 Est.), almost 23% of the total population of Syria. The governorate is the fifth in area with an area of 18,482 km², about 10% of the total area of Syria. The capital is the city of Aleppo. The governorate is represented by 52 deputies in the parliament (out of 250), of whom 20 come from the city of Aleppo. - Arpad ( probably modern Tell Rifaat , Syria ) was an ancient Aramaean Syro - Hittite city located in north - western Syria , north of Aleppo . It became the capital of the Aramaean state of Bit Agusi established by Gusi of Yakhan in the 9th century BC. Bit Agusi stretched from the A'zaz area in the north to Hamath in the south . Arpad later became a major vassal city of the Kingdom of Urartu . In 743 BC , during the Urartu - Assyria War , the Neo-Assyrian king Tiglath - Pileser III laid siege to Arpad following the defeat of the Urartuan army of Sarduri II at Samsat . But the city of Arpad did not surrender easily . It took Tiglath - Pileser three years of siege to conquer Arpad , whereupon he massacred its inhabitants and destroyed the city . Afterward Arpad served as a provincial capital.Tell Rifaat , which is probably the remains of Arpad , has walls still preserved to a height of eight meters . The city is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible several times : 2 Kings 18:34 ; 19:13 Isaiah 10:9 ; 36:19 ; 37:13 Jeremiah 49:23 ; - Lebanon , officially known as the Lebanese Republic, is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south, while Cyprus is west across the Mediterranean Sea.

(Photo: Dallas County Jail) DALLAS — A Dallas County magistrate judge increased the bond for a woman accused of forcing her 4-year old son to ingest poison to 500,000, according to court records. Paw Eh, 31, was arrested in Northeast Dallas Saturday after she tried but failed to make her other two children, ages 7 and 12, ingest the poison. Eh has been charged with attempted capital murder. Her original 150,000 bond was increased after her arraignment from the Dallas County jail on Sunday. When detectives interviewed Eh's 7-year-old son, he told them, \\"my mom wants to kill us with poison powder that kills ants and stuff,\\" according to an arrest warrant. He said Eh put ant poison on a spoon, added water, then forced his brother to drink it. She had to slap the 4-year-old to get him to drink the poison. Bail increased for mom who fed son ant killer Eh's daughter told police that her mother said she planned to kill her children and herself, the warrant states. Officers responded to the call in the 10000 block of Walnut Hill Lane Saturday night. Child Protective Services seized custody of Eh's children. The 7 and 12-year-old are in foster care.

CARDONA and KRISTEN TAKETA Staff Writers A Dallas mother forced her 4-year-old son to ingest ant poison after telling her three children that she planned to kill them and herself, according to police documents released Sunday. Paw Eh, 31, was arrested Saturday and charged with attempted capital murder. Her youngest child had improved from critical to stable condition by Sunday afternoon, police said. Eh’s 12-year-old daughter told investigators that Eh called the 4-year-old downstairs to the kitchen of a Lake Highlands apartment. The girl said she watched her mother open the poison and put a tablespoon into the container, according to the arrest warrant affidavit. Eh put the poison on a spoon, added water, then tried to force her 4-year-old son to drink it, the affidavit states. When the boy held his mouth shut, Eh slapped him on the cheek. The boy started to cry and Eh forced the spoon into his mouth, the affidavit states. Police say Eh also tried to poison her daughter and 7-year-old son but was unsuccessful. The girl said her mother told them earlier in the day that she was going to kill them and herself, according to the affidavit. The 7-year-old boy told authorities, “my mom wants to kill us with poison powder that kills ants and stuff,” the affidavit states. KTVT-TV (Channel 11) reported that the older children ran to their grandmother’s apartment — which is in the same complex — to tell her what happened. A witness called police to the apartment complex in the 10800 block of Walnut Hill Lane at 1:37 p.m. Saturday to report the incident. The 4-year-old was transported to Medical City Dallas Hospital, according to the affidavit. Police said the two older children were released to family members Saturday night, but Child Protective Services spokeswoman Marleigh Meisner said the children were in CPS custody Sunday. Meisner said Eh does not appear to have a CPS history, and public records show no criminal record in Dallas County. A friend of Eh’s, Sharl Nie, told WFAA-TV (Channel 8) that Eh couldn’t sleep at night and frequently thought about suicide. Eh is from Myanmar, WFAA reported. Other neighbors said they had little interaction with Eh because of a language barrier. The affidavit indicates officials used a Burmese translator to communicate with her. One neighbor, who identified himself as Moogay, said Eh had medical problems and said she would sometimes get red in the face, pass out and fail to remember what happened when she woke up. The neighbor said a man who he thought was her husband often had to supervise her. But he said he was surprised to hear of Eh’s arrest. Eh is being held in the Dallas County jail. Her bail has been set at 500,000. She did not have a lawyer late Sunday. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A Dallas County magistrate judge increased the bond for Paw Eh, a woman accused of forcing her 4-year-old son to ingest poison, to 500,000.

Justification: The idea that \\"ignorance is bliss\\" comes from the concept that not knowing certain information can sometimes lead to a more content and happy state of mind. This is because the knowledge one lacks may be associated with negative feelings or experiences. For example, someone may be happier not knowing about the negative aspects of a situation they have no control over, as gaining such information may only cause them to worry or feel anxious. However, it is also important to consider that ignorance can also be detrimental, particularly if it prevents someone from making informed decisions or taking appropriate action. In many situations, possessing knowledge and understanding can enable people to make better choices, leading to greater happiness.

The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head.

Set in the small town of Evans City, Pennsylvania, the central characters are firefighter David (Will McMillan), his girlfriend, nurse Judy (Lane Carroll), and firefighter Clank (Harold Wayne Jones). David was a Green Beret and Clank an infantryman, both having served in Vietnam. The town has seen a number of violent events, including arson at a local farm by a demented farmer. Judy and David are very concerned, since Judy is pregnant. Meanwhile, heavily armed U.S. troops in NBC suits and gas masks, arrive in town, led by Major Ryder (Harry Spillman), who takes over the doctor's office where Judy works.

Bosons make up one of the two classes of particles, the other being fermions. The name boson was coined by Paul Dirac to commemorate the contribution of the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose in developing, with Einstein, BoseEinstein statisticswhich theorizes the characteristics of elementary particles. Examples of bosons include fundamental particles such as photons, gluons, and W and Z bosons (the four force-carrying gauge bosons of the Standard Model), the recently discovered Higgs boson, and the hypothetical graviton of quantum gravity; composite particles (e.g. mesons and stable nuclei of even mass number such as deuterium (with one proton and one neutron, mass number = 2), helium-4, or lead-208); and some quasiparticles (e.g. Cooper pairs, plasmons, and phonons). - A quark (or ) is an elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei. Due to a phenomenon known as \\"color confinement\\", quarks are never directly observed or found in isolation; they can be found only within hadrons, such as baryons (of which protons and neutrons are examples) and mesons. For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of the hadrons themselves. - Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward (or \\"gravitate\\" toward) one another, including planets, stars and galaxies. Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy, including light, also cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars and the stars to group together into galaxies so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects. - Particle physics (also high energy physics) is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute \\"matter\\" (particles with mass) and \\"radiation\\" (massless particles). Although the word \\"particle\\" can refer to various types of very small objects (e.g. protons, gas particles, or even household dust), \\"particle physics\\" usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the irreducibly fundamental force fields necessary to explain them. By our current understanding, these elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions. The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard Model. Thus, modern particle physics generally investigates the Standard Model and its various possible extensions, e.g. to the newest \\"known\\" particle, the Higgs boson, or even to the oldest known force field, gravity. - In particle physics , a hadron i / hædrn / ( Greek : , hadrós , \`\` stout , thick '' ) is a composite particle made of quarks held together by the strong force ( in a similar way as molecules are held together by the electromagnetic force ) . Hadrons are categorized into two families : baryons , made of three quarks , and mesons , made of one quark and one antiquark . Protons and neutrons are examples of baryons ; pions are an example of a meson . Hadrons containing more than three valence quarks ( exotic hadrons ) have been discovered in recent years . A tetraquark state ( an exotic meson ) , named the Z ( 4430 ) , was discovered in 2007 by the Belle Collaboration and confirmed as a resonance in 2014 by the LHCb collaboration . Two pentaquark states ( exotic baryons ) , named P + - In particle physics, mesons (or ) are hadronic subatomic particles composed of one quark and one antiquark, bound together by the strong interaction. Because mesons are composed of quark sub-particles, they have a physical size, with a diameter of roughly one fermi, which is about the size of a proton or neutron. All mesons are unstable, with the longest-lived lasting for only a few hundredths of a microsecond. Charged mesons decay (sometimes through mediating particles) to form electrons and neutrinos. Uncharged mesons may decay to photons. Both of these decays imply that color is no longer a property of the byproducts. After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'hadron' exhibits the relationship of 'interaction'. Find the answer from the choices below. Choices: - electromagnetic force - gravity - strong interaction A:","output":"Hadrons exhibit the relationship of interaction with the strong interaction. In particle physics, hadrons are composite particles made of quarks held together by the strong force, which is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. This strong interaction, also known as the strong nuclear force, is responsible for binding quarks together within hadrons, such as baryons (including protons and neutrons) and mesons. The strong interaction is characterized by a very short-range but incredibly powerful influence on the particles that fall under its domain. As a result, hadrons are maintained in a stable state by the strong interaction, with the force effectively overcoming the effects of the other fundamental forces like electromagnetism and gravity in this specific context."},{"instruction":"Question: While getting drunk the body can only process so much at a time, go too fast and your belly might just make you what? Options: - getting arrested - throw up - staggering - fall down - explode Explain why a human would choose \\"throw up\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"throw up\\" to answer the question above because it is the most accurate and biologically plausible response among the given options when considering the effects of alcohol on the human body. Drinking alcohol introduces it into the bloodstream, which then travels to the liver to be broken down and metabolized. The liver can only process a certain amount of alcohol per hour, and if a person consumes more than the liver can handle, the excess alcohol builds up in the bloodstream, leading to intoxication or even alcohol poisoning. Among the given options, here's a detailed explanation for each: 1. Getting arrested: Consuming alcohol quickly might lead to increased intoxication, which could result in poor decision-making and risky behavior. This increases the likelihood of getting arrested, but getting arrested is not a direct physiological effect of excessive alcohol consumption on the body. 2. Throw up: When alcohol is consumed too quickly, the body may respond by inducing vomiting as a protective mechanism to protect itself from potential harm by expelling the excess content. Throwing up helps to remove some of the unabsorbed alcohol from the stomach and it also serves as a signal to the person to stop drinking. This is the most accurate answer for this question. 3. Staggering: Staggering refers to the loss of balance and coordination that may occur due to alcohol intoxication. While this outcome is a common effect of excessive alcohol consumption, the question implies a more immediate reaction to consuming alcohol too quickly. Staggering is not a direct response to alcohol overwhelming the stomach and liver. 4. Fall down: Falling down is another common effect of excessive alcohol consumption influenced by the central nervous system. However, this is not the most accurate response in this context, as it does not directly refer to the body's inability to process alcohol at a fast rate. 5. Explode: This option is a hyperbolic and unrealistic response. The human body does not explode from consuming too much alcohol too quickly. It is not a valid answer in this context. In conclusion, \\"throw up\\" is the most accurate and biologically plausible answer to this question because it addresses the body's need to protect itself from the harmful effects of excessive alcohol intake. It explains the immediate physiological response to the overconsumption of alcohol that cannot be processed quickly enough by the liver, whereas the other options do not focus on the body's limitations directly or are exaggerated and unrealistic."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you're given a context, a question, and three options.

The numbering system stays the same in French as it is in English. 4. \\"in Québec\\" translates to \\"au Québec\\". The preposition \\"in\\" changes to \\"au\\" when attached to a masculine singular place name. Québec being a masculine noun in French, the preposition used here is \\"au\\". 5. \\"containing over\\" is translated to \\"comprenant plus de\\". \\"Comprenant\\" is the present participle of \\"comprendre\\" which also means \\"including\\" or \\"containing\\". \\"Plus de\\" equates to \\"over\\" or \\"more than\\". 6. \\"1.6 million children\\" would be \\"1.6 million d'enfants\\".

Please note that commas and periods in high figures (like 960,000 or 1.6) serve opposite roles in French as compared to English.

In this situation, John is using two tuning forks, fork A and fork B, to produce different frequencies while tuning his musical instruments. He generates a higher frequency with fork A and a lower frequency with fork B. Despite having the same amplitude, the differences in frequency between the two forks are evident. As mentioned in the background information, the frequency of a wave directly corresponds to the frequency of the vibrations that created the wave. Higher-frequency waves require more energy input and a quicker vibration pattern. Conversely, lower-frequency waves need less energy and exhibit slower vibration patterns. Amplitude, on the other hand, represents the particle displacement within the medium when the wave energy passes through it. In this case, both tuning forks, A and B, have the same amplitude, signifying that the displacements of the particles in the medium are the same for both. However, the key distinction lies in their frequencies. Since fork A creates a higher-frequency wave, it generates more rapid vibrations, whereas fork B produces slower, lower-frequency vibrations. To summarize, fork B has a lower frequency of vibrations due to its lower-frequency wave production compared to fork A. Both forks may have the same amplitude, but their differing frequencies ultimately determine their vibration speeds."},{"instruction":"Teacher:This task is to identify the language of a sentence correctly by classifying if it is English or Telugu Teacher: Now, understand the problem?

Options: - sing - play games - start fighting - fiddle - spread The answer is \\"sing\\" because Answer:","output":"The answer is \\"sing\\" because singing is a direct and natural way for children to express their happiness and emotions. When children are happy, they tend to sing spontaneously, often incorporating their own lyrics or tunes, as a means of sharing and celebrating their joy. Step-by-step justification: 1. Analyze the given options: sing, play games, start fighting, fiddle, spread. 2. Eliminate the options that are not directly related to expressing happiness: start fighting, fiddle, spread. 3. Among the remaining options (sing, play games), singing is the most direct and natural way for children to express happiness as it is an immediate, vocal response that can be done anywhere and anytime. 4. Playing games, while enjoyable, does not inherently imply happiness, as it could also be done to alleviate boredom or to socialize with others. 5. Thus, the answer is \\"sing\\" as it directly relates to expression of happiness and is a spontaneous, vocal form of expressing joy."},{"instruction":"Ask a question about Atlantic City, New Jersey.","output":"Can you explain what Atlantic City in New Jersey is known for and what fun activities are there for families?"},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Think slowly and carefully, before giving your answer.","output":"It's possible that veterans of the Civil War could have read Little Women, but it would depend on the specific veteran's personal interests and the particular time frame after the war. \\"Little Women,\\" written by Louisa May Alcott, was published in two separate volumes: part one in 1868, and part two in 1869. The American Civil War took place between 1861 and 1865. Therefore, the book came out just a few years after the war ended. Considering the time frames, it is possible for veterans to have read Little Women, but whether they did or not would be a personal choice. The book is primarily focused on themes relating to domestic life, family, and the experiences of four sisters growing up together. While it isn't specifically about war experiences or military life, it does touch on themes of resilience and overcoming adversity, which might resonate with some veterans of the war. In conclusion, it is plausible that Little Women could have been read by some Civil War veterans. As individuals, each veteran would have their own preferences, and those who were interested in novels about family life, character development, and overcoming adversity might have found Little Women appealing."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the opera that ultimately brought the Théâtre Lyrique little financial success, though Bizet had won admiration from his peers? The premiere, originally planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th because of the illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as \\"a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes...\\" The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that \\"this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be\\". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a \\"claque\\" of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.Of the opera itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: \\"There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music\\". He considered that on every page the score displayed \\"the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner\\".

Context: QUEBEC CITY, CANADA — On the eve of the G-7 summit in Canada, the U.S. president lashed out at host Justin Trudeau and the White House announced Donald Trump would skip some of the sessions. In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers. The cost of raw materials will rise and industry will become less competitive.” After the contentious salvos on social media and the Trudeau-Macron news conference, the White House announced Trump would depart the summit at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, following the session on women’s empowerment. \\"The president will travel directly to Singapore from Canada in anticipation of his upcoming meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday.

Options: - relaxation - revelations - action - understanding - broke Let's give stream of consciousness first:","output":"When you spend time contemplating ideas, you are engaging in reflective thinking, which has a range of potential outcomes depending on the specific subject, your goals, and your mindset. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the options provided: 1. Relaxation: Contemplating ideas can be relaxing if you enjoy the process and if the topic you're thinking about doesn't cause stress. However, relaxation isn't guaranteed because some topics can provoke more anxiety than calm. 2. Revelations: Developing new insights, or revelations, can result from contemplating ideas, particularly if you explore different perspectives and challenge your assumptions. The depth and quality of revelations depend on the level of your intellectual engagement and open-mindedness. 3. Action: Contemplation can lead to action if the ideas you're thinking about inspire you to take a specific course of action, or if your reflections help you determine the next steps needed to achieve a goal. However, action may not be an immediate outcome, especially if your contemplation is focused on theoretical or abstract topics. 4. Understanding: Developing a deeper understanding of a topic, concept, or situation is one of the primary objectives of contemplation. By examining ideas from multiple angles and breaking them down into their constituents, you can enhance your comprehension and gain a clearer view of the subject. 5. Broke: The term \\"broke\\" isn't directly relevant to contemplation, as it typically refers to a financial situation. Contemplating ideas on its own won't necessarily lead to financial distress. However, if your contemplation consumes an excessive amount of time and distracts you from practical tasks, like maintaining employment or managing finances, it might indirectly result in financial difficulties. In summary, when you spend time contemplating ideas, you may experience relaxation, revelations, action, and understanding, depending on the nature of your thought process and the topic at hand. While it's unlikely to result in becoming broke, maintaining a balance between contemplation and practical responsibilities is essential to promote overall well-being."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the bio below and try to give details on tracy l. cross 's: - influences - field - workplaces - birth date - name - nationality - birth place - alma mater Bio: tracy l. cross -lrb- born june 25 , 1958 , in tennessee , united states -rrb- is an educational psychologist , the jody and layton smith professor of psychology and gifted education at the college of william and mary . he has previously been the george and frances ball distinguished professor of psychology and gifted studies ball state university -lrb- 2000-2009 -rrb- , the founder and executive director of both the center for gifted studies and talent development -lrb- 2003-2009 -rrb- , and the institute for research on the psychology of gifted students -lrb- 2007-2009 -rrb- . over thirty years , he made important contributions to the field of gifted education , including the development of the school-based conception of giftedness , the information management model , and the continuum of visibility , and was also influential in applying social-cognitive theory and stigma theory to gifted children .

However, it does not provide the precise number of years each individual held this position, particularly focusing on Gurian's tenure. Waldemar Gurian, a German political theorist and Catholic intellectual, was the founding editor of the Review of Politics, which was established in 1939. He played an integral role in shaping the journal, with its focus on political, social, and religious issues, especially those related to Catholic social teachings and contemporary politics. Gurian served as editor from the inception of the journal in 1939 until 1956, when he passed away. Thus, he edited the journal for 17 years. Following Gurian's death, the editorial role was taken over by Matthew Fitzsimons, who led the Review from 1956 until his death in 1963, making his tenure 7 years long. After Fitzsimons, Frederick Crosson took over the editorship, serving from 1963 until 1971, an 8-year period. Finally, Thomas Stritch assumed the position from 1971 until 1983, marking 12 years of his leadership.

In addition, external factors such as social influences and the environment also play an influential role. Given the complexity and unpredictable nature of these variables, it becomes nearly impossible to create an infallible model that could determine the outcome of every human decision and action. Furthermore, the concept of free will, if it does indeed exist, implies a fundamental level of unpredictability in our choices. Finally, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle suggests that certain aspects of future events cannot be accurately predicted due to their inherently random nature.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose humans were unable to get oxygen from plants to produce carbon dioxide happens, how will it affect More carbon dioxide is released into the air. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The described process is known as photosynthesis, a crucial mechanism for plants to produce their own food and release oxygen into the atmosphere. The perturbation hypothesis in question suggests the possibility of humans not being able to exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen with plants. In this hypothetical scenario, we will analyze the consequences of more carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere and its direct and indirect effects on the photosynthesis process. First, let's briefly recap the key steps of photosynthesis: 1. Carbon dioxide (CO2) enters the leaves through tiny openings called stomata by the process of diffusion. 2. Water (H2O) is transported to the leaves through xylem, specialized vascular tissues. 3. In the presence of sunlight, the light-dependent reactions generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). 4. In the light-independent reactions, CO2 and the energy carriers ATP and NADPH are used to create glucose (C6H12O6) and other products. This step is known as the Calvin cycle. 5. Oxygen (O2), a byproduct of the process, exits the leaves through the stomata by diffusion. 6. The plant either reuses the water or it exits through the stomata as water vapor in a process called transpiration. In the proposed perturbation scenario, an increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere may affect photosynthesis in both direct and indirect ways: Direct effects: 1. Enhanced Photosynthesis: An initial increase in atmospheric CO2 could potentially enhance the rate of photosynthesis. The increased availability of carbon dioxide might stimulate the Calvin cycle activity and promote an increase in plant growth. However, this increase in growth rates might only be sustained up to a certain point. Once the optimal limit of CO2 is reached, any further increase will cease to have any significant impact on the process. 2. Stomatal Closure: High concentrations of CO2 can cause stomata to partially close, reducing the rate of gas exchange in order to conserve water. While this might be beneficial for the plant in terms of conserving water, the downregulation of gas exchange could lead to a reduction in photosynthetic rates. Indirect effects: 1. Climatic Impacts: An increased concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere can lead to global warming, which could bring about a shift in climate patterns. Drastic changes in temperature, levels of precipitation, and the frequency of extreme weather events can create a hostile environment for plant growth, affecting their capacity to perform photosynthesis efficiently. 2. Altered Ecosystems: High levels of CO2 could also impact both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Increased CO2 can intensify ocean acidification, which can harm marine plant species and disrupt the marine food chain. On land, imbalances in the natural carbon cycle can affect the health and distribution of a range of flora and fauna, which could lead to the alteration of nutrient and water availability within ecosystems, thus impacting photosynthesis. To summarize, the perturbation hypothesis of humans not being able to exchange oxygen with plants for carbon dioxide and the resulting increase in atmospheric CO2 levels would have several direct and indirect effects on the process of photosynthesis. While an initial increase in CO2 might promote enhanced photosynthetic rates, extreme concentrations would lead to detrimental consequences on a broader scale. Climate change, alterations in ecosystems, and negative impacts on plant physiology can all restrict the plants' ability to perform photosynthesis effectively."},{"instruction":"Premise: Key components of the state's planning and coordinating structure include the Hypothesis: The coordinating structure of the state includes a central office to handle audits..

Thank goodness, then, for today, World Milk Day — one of those weird food holidays which are sometimes invented by interest groups to push a certain product. Regardless of the so-called holiday's origins, let’s take this opportunity to delve into some of the ways people appreciate milk in their daily lives. The Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy conducted a survey of more than 1,000 adults 18 and over in April of this year. They uncovered some shocking facts about how people think about – and drink – milk. First off, 48% of respondents said that they aren’t sure where chocolate milk comes from. Um, guys, it comes from cows – and not just the brown kind. Still, 7% of people – and remember, this survey talked to actual, grown-up adults – still think that chocolate milk only comes from brown cows. Actually, chocolate milk gets its flavor and color from cocoa beans. Now that you know what milk-myths are still floating around out there, what about the ways people drink their milk? A fair chunk of people are still hanging on to their taboo kitchen habits: 37% secretly drink milk straight out of the container, while another 29% use their kids as an excuse to buy chocolate milk for themselves. And despite the fact that healthy lifestyle diets are all the rage right now, only 5% of people abstain from drinking milk altogether, making it a continued staple in most people’s homes. In fact, it seems to still be one of America’s favorite beverages: One quarter of participants reported taking a trip to the grocery store before 6 in the morning just to buy milk. We just can’t seem to escape dairy in any of its forms: An additional 95% of people surveyed currently have some type of cheese in their refrigerator. So there you have it. Even though an unfortunate number of people can't seem to figure out where it comes from, milk is still beloved by Americans. ||||| Seven percent of American adults believe chocolate milk comes from brown cows, according to a recent online survey commissioned by the Innovation Center of U.S. Dairy. Here are a few other things Americans get wrong. (Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post) Seven percent of all American adults believe that chocolate milk comes from brown cows, according to a nationally representative online survey commissioned by the Innovation Center of U.S. Dairy. If you do the math, that works out to 16.4 million misinformed, milk-drinking people. The equivalent of the population of Pennsylvania (and then some!) does not know that chocolate milk is milk, cocoa and sugar. But while the survey has attracted snorts and jeers from some corners — “um, guys, [milk] comes from cows — and not just the brown kind,” snarked Food & Wine — the most surprising thing about this figure may actually be that it isn’t higher. For decades, observers in agriculture, nutrition and education have griped that many Americans are basically agriculturally illiterate. They don’t know where food is grown, how it gets to stores — or even, in the case of chocolate milk, what’s in it. One Department of Agriculture study, commissioned in the early ’90s, found that nearly 1 in 5 adults did not know that hamburgers are made from beef. Many more lacked familiarity with basic farming facts, like how big U.S. farms typically are and what food animals eat. Experts in ag education aren’t convinced that much has changed in the intervening decades. “At the end of the day, it’s an exposure issue,” said Cecily Upton, co-founder of the nonprofit FoodCorps, which brings agricultural and nutrition education into elementary schools. “Right now, we’re conditioned to think that if you need food, you go to the store. Nothing in our educational framework teaches kids where food comes from before that point.” Upton and other educators are quick to caution that these conclusions don’t apply across the board. Studies have shown that people who live in agricultural communities tend to know a bit more about where their food comes from, as do people with higher education levels and household incomes. But in some populations, confusion about basic food facts can skew pretty high. When one team of researchers interviewed fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders at an urban California school, they found that more than half of them didn’t know pickles were cucumbers, or that onions and lettuce were plants. Four in 10 didn’t know that hamburgers came from cows. And 3 in 10 didn’t know that cheese is made from milk. “All informants recalled the names of common foods in raw form and most knew foods were grown on farms or in gardens,” the researchers concluded. “They did not, however, possess schema necessary to articulate an understanding of post-production activities nor the agricultural crop origin of common foods.” In some ways, this ignorance is perfectly logical. The writer and historian Ann Vileisis has argued that it developed in lockstep with the industrial food system. As more Americans moved into cities in the mid-1800s, she writes in the book “Kitchen Literacy,” fewer were involved in food production or processing. That trend was exacerbated by innovations in transportation and manufacturing that made it possible to ship foods in different forms, and over great distances. By the time uniformity, hygiene and brand loyalty became modern ideals — the latter frequently encouraged by emerging food companies in well-funded ad campaigns — many Americans couldn’t imagine the origins of the boxed cereals or shrink-wrapped hot dogs in their kitchens. Today, many Americans only experience food as an industrial product that doesn’t look much like the original animal or plant: The USDA says orange juice is the most popular “fruit” in America, and processed potatoes — in the form of french fries and chips — rank among the top vegetables. “Indifference about the origins and production of foods became a norm of urban culture, laying the groundwork for a modern food sensibility that would spread all across America in the decades that followed,” Vileisis wrote, of the 20th century. “Within a relatively brief period, the average distance from farm to kitchen had grown from a short walk down the garden path to a convoluted, 1,500-mile energy-guzzling journey by rail and truck.” The past 20 years have seen the birth of a movement to reverse this gap, with agriculture and nutrition groups working to get ag education back into classrooms. Aside from FoodCorps, which worked with slightly more than 100,000 students this year, groups like the National Agriculture in the Classroom Organization and the American Farm Bureau Foundation are actively working with K-12 teachers across the country to add nutrition, farm technology and agricultural economics to lessons in social studies, science and health. The USDA Farm to School program, which awarded 5 million in grants for the 2017-2018 school year on Monday, also funds projects on agriculture education. For National Dairy Month, which is June, NACO has been featuring a kindergarten-level lesson on dairy. Among its main takeaways: milk — plain, unflavored, boring white milk — comes from cows, not the grocery case. Nutritionists and food-system reformers say these basic lessons are critical to raising kids who know how to eat healthfully — an important aid to tackling heart disease and obesity. Meanwhile, farm groups argue the lack of basic food knowledge can lead to poor policy decisions. A 2012 white paper from the National Institute for Animal Agriculture blamed consumers for what it considers bad farm regulations: “One factor driving today’s regulatory environment ... is pressure applied by consumers, the authors wrote. “Unfortunately, a majority of today’s consumers are at least three generations removed from agriculture, are not literate about where food comes from and how it is produced.” Upton, of FoodCorps, said everyone could benefit from a better understanding of agriculture. “We still get kids who are surprised that a french fry comes from a potato, or that a pickle is a cucumber,” she said. “... Knowledge is power. Without it, we can’t make informed decisions.” Editor's note: A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that the survey in question was commissioned by the National Dairy Council. It was actually commissioned by the Innovation Center of U.S. Dairy, its sister organization. Read more: What is “natural food”? Even the people who make it aren't sure.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself.

They can even change our emotions and even influence how healthy we are. \\"Have you ever noticed how people always use the same colours for the same things?\\" says Verity. \\"Our toothpaste is always white or blue or maybe red. It's never green. Why not? For some reason we think that blue and white is clean, while we think of green products as being a bit unpleasant. It's the same for businesses. We respect a company which writes its name in blue or black, but we don't respect one that uses pink or orange. People who design new products can use these ideas to influence what we buy.\\" During the programme, Verity studies eight different colours, two colours in each part. She meets people who work in the colour industry, from people who design food packages, to people who name the colours of lipsticks. Some of the people she meets clearly have very little scientific knowledge to prove their ideas, such as the American \\"Colour Doctor\\" who believes that serious diseases can be treated successfully by the use of coloured lights. However, she also interviews real scientists who are studying the effects of green and red lights on mice, with some surprising results.

If you are worried that your parent may be considering suicide, look for these outward signs and risk factors so that you can catch the problem before it's too late: Past suicidal attempts. This is one of the biggest risk factors for actual suicide. Outbursts of rage. Although this can signal other things as well, it's a common indication of suicidal intent. Increased risk-taking behavior, such as drinking and driving. A parent who feels suicidal may start to care less about personal safety. Behavior isn't the only indication of being suicidal; you can read the signs in what he talks about as well. Talk of suicidal intent. Your parent may explicitly state how he feels. Self-hatred. This is a strong ingredient of suicidal thinking. Being a burden. As many suicidal parents feel guilty, it's likely they will feel like they are burdening those in close proximity, including you. Despite what some people may think, suicide is not as much of a choice as it is a combination of natural forces and factors. Some of these forces are: Mental illness. 90% or more of people who commit suicide had a mental illness at the time of their death. The most common illnesses are depression and other mood disorders, substance abuse disorder, schizophrenia, and personality disorders such as bi-polar and borderline. Serious medical issues. Cancer, HIV, and other illnesses can cause people to experience hopelessness and other desperate emotions which sometimes result in suicide. Biological factors. Research shows that people who commit suicide often have differences in brain structure, especially the areas of the brain related to mood, thinking, and stress response. Environmental stress. Things like prolonged bullying have been linked to an increased risk for suicide. Suicide is often thought of as a solution to a problem.

He was born near Busseto to a provincial family of moderate means, and developed a musical education with the help of a local patron. Verdi came to dominate the Italian opera scene after the era of Vincenzo Bellini, Gaetano Donizetti, and Gioachino Rossini, whose works significantly influenced him. By his 30s, he had become one of the pre-eminent opera composers in history. Context: The writer Friedrich Schiller (four of whose plays were adapted as operas by Verdi) distinguished two types of artist in his 1795 essay On Naive and Sentimental Poetry. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin ranked Verdi in the 'naive' category--\\"They are not...self-conscious. They do not...stand aside to contemplate their creations and express their own feelings....They are able...if they have genius, to embody their vision fully.\\" (The 'sentimentals' seek to recreate nature and natural feelings on their own terms--Berlin instances Wagner--\\"offering not peace, but a sword.\\") Verdi's operas are not written according to an aesthetic theory, or with a purpose to change the tastes of their audiences. In conversation with a German visitor in 1887 he is recorded as saying that, whilst \\"there was much to be admired in [Wagner's operas] Tannhauser and Lohengrin...in his recent operas [Wagner] seemed to be overstepping the bounds of what can be expressed in music. For him \\"philosophical\\" music was incomprehensible.\\" Although Verdi's works belong, as Rosselli admits \\"to the most artificial of genres...[they] ring emotionally true: truth and directness make them exciting, often hugely so.\\" That is not to say his operas did not come as great innovations. What sounds to a modern listener as derivative of the bel canto, his first major success, Nabucco, came as a something entirely new. Never before had opera been so harmonically complex and direct. No longer was there the empty vocal display of the bel canto period composers. Granted, there is a significant amount of vocal fireworks, but they exist for the purpose of drama, not to show off singers. Aside from this, his use of the chorus was entirely new. Before Nabucco, an opera's chorus was limited to be only a background voice, another instrument. In Nabucco, this is abolished; he uses the chorus as character, to show the suffering and consensus of the people. The famous \\"Va, pensiero\\" is an example of this. The first of his \\"big three\\" operas, Rigoletto, followed by La Traviata, and ending with Il Trovatore, also was revolutionary. In a letter to Rigoletto's librettist, Francesco Maria Piave, he says, \\"I conceived Rigoletto almost without arias, without finales but only an unending string of duets.\\" And that it is. Rigoletto is one of, if not the earliest operas to abandon the traditional distinction between the sung aria, and the more speech-like recitative. After these three operas, his works took an increasing amount of time to finish, were significantly longer, and more masterfully orchestrated. Question: How did he write his operas?. Whats the answer?","output":"Giuseppe Verdi was a famous Italian composer who wrote operas. An opera is like a play, but the actors sing instead of speaking. Verdi was very good at writing operas, and many people loved to listen to them. When Verdi wrote his operas, he had a few special ways of doing it that made his music different from other composers. One thing he did was focus on the story and the emotions that the characters were feeling. Instead of just having the singers show off their voices with fancy singing, he had them sing in a way that helped tell the story. Another special thing Verdi did was use the chorus in a new way. A chorus is a group of singers that is usually in the background and sings together. In Verdi's operas, the chorus became more important. They were like characters in the story, and they showed how people were feeling. One example of this is in his opera Nabucco, where the chorus sings a famous part called \\"Va, pensiero.\\" In his other famous operas like Rigoletto, La Traviata, and Il Trovatore, Verdi tried to make the music flow nicely by having lots of duets (when two singers sing together) instead of just separate songs. As Verdi kept writing operas, he took more time to finish them, and they became longer and more detailed. This made his music even more exciting and special, and people still love to listen to Verdi's operas today."},{"instruction":"Please check if these have the same meaning.

Naive physics, also known as folk physics, refers to the informal and intuitive understanding of the world's physical properties, which people develop without any formal education in the field of physics. Naive physics reasoning, therefore, refers to the act of making predictions and judgments about the world's physical properties by relying on common sense and intuition rather than scientific principles or formal education. Given that the objective is \\"shoes,\\" we need to evaluate two or more solutions in terms of such reasoning. As no specific solutions are provided in the question, let's consider the following two common scenarios related to shoes and evaluate them based on naive physics reasoning: Solution 1: Choosing the right shoe size and design for comfort Solution 2: Waterproofing shoes to protect them from water damage Solution 1: Choosing the right shoe size and design for comfort Using naive physics reasoning, it becomes apparent that selecting the appropriate shoe size and design is crucial for comfort. Intuitively, a person would recognize that a shoe that is too small or too big would cause discomfort, as it would either be too tight and restrictive or too loose and unstable. Furthermore, the design of the shoe should be able to accommodate the natural shape and movement of the foot. A shoe that forces the foot into a shape that goes against its natural structure will likely result in discomfort and potential health issues. The choice of material is also essential as it determines the breathability, flexibility, and overall comfort of the shoe. Solution 2: Waterproofing shoes to protect them from water damage Naive physics reasoning also supports the idea of waterproofing shoes as a sound solution. Intuitively, one understands that exposing shoes and the material to water could cause damage in the form of warping, discoloration, and mold growth. This would lead to the shoes having a shortened life span and reduce their functionality. Moreover, the reasoning suggests that waterproofing shoes would prevent water from penetrating the shoe, keeping one's feet dry and comfortable, and preserving the shoe's structural integrity for a more extended period. Comparing the two solutions, we can see that both of them hold merit when it comes to naive physics reasoning. Both solutions address essential aspects related to shoes, with Solution 1 focusing on comfort and fit, while Solution 2 tackles the issue of water damage and preservation. In conclusion, using naive physics reasoning, both Solution 1 (choosing the right shoe size and design for comfort) and Solution 2 (waterproofing shoes to protect them from water damage) can be considered sound solutions. They both address practical concerns regarding shoes, such as comfort, fit, and preservation, using common sense and intuition. While neither solution is superior to the other, as both are important when it comes to wearing and maintaining shoes, they both pass naive physics reasoning's logic test in their own regard."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find? The ashes and gases combined have the same mass as the wood you started with. This example illustrates the law of conservation of mass.

Now club officials have written to the French club, and made them aware in the strongest terms that they must either put up, or shut up. \\"In response to the wholly unfounded comments widely reported in the media of Le Havre President, Jean-Pierre Louvel, Manchester United wish to categorically confirm that as a matter of club policy and in accordance with the applicable football regulations, we do not offer inducements to the parents of players who sign for the club such as monetary payments or the purchase of houses,\\" said United in a statement on their official Web site. \\"Manchester United have today written to Le Havre to put it on notice that action will be taken if such allegations are repeated in relation to the transfer of Paul Pogba.\\" Le Havre had claimed the matter was being referred to FIFA for their investigation although, as yet, the world governing body have not acknowledged receipt. When the Pogba issue was first raised last week, United officials suggested that there was no contract for the 16-year-old to break, therefore the Red Devils could not be offering inducements to do so. However, they have been annoyed by Le Havre's allegations of impropriety, which has prompted the stinging outburst. \\"Manchester United are entirely satisfied that the transfer of Paul Pogba has been conducted in accordance with the regulations set down by the world governing body, FIFA,\\" the statement added. \\"Manchester United are ready to defend any claim brought against them by Le Havre to FIFA. \\"It is to be noted that all contractual documentation relating to the player's registration with the club have already been fully ratified by the Football Association and the Premier League.\\" Highlights:","output":"- Manchester United have warned French club Le Havre against repeating claims that they offered financial inducements to Paul Pogba's family to secure the teenage player's transfer to Old Trafford. - The English Premier League champions have strongly denied any wrongdoing in Pogba's signing, and are frustrated by Le Havre's sustained accusations. - Manchester United have written to Le Havre, requesting them to either provide evidence or stop making allegations. - Le Havre claimed the case had been referred to FIFA for investigation, but the world governing body has not yet acknowledged receipt. - Manchester United is confident that Pogba's transfer complied with FIFA regulations and is prepared to defend any claim brought against them by Le Havre."},{"instruction":"David Byrne was shot at the Regency Hotel in Dublin on 5 February.

Councillor Rob Stewart believed they \\"could not be in a better position\\" to agree the deal which could be worth millions over the next 15 years. But a transatlantic cable, described as a \\"game changer\\" in bringing ultrafast broadband to the Swansea Bay region, is not part of the deal. It would be separate but complementary, said Mr Stewart. Swansea Bay City Region's chairman Sir Terry Matthews, interviewed a year ago, had described the importance of the communication channel from New York to London via the south west Wales region. He added at the time that the cable would make the Swansea Bay City Deal, unlike those put forward by other areas, deliver for the whole of the UK rather than the region alone. But Mr Stewart said the Project Jupiter cable was a separate project - and like Tidal Lagoon's relationship with the city deal's energy projects - would be \\"aligned\\" and \\"complementary\\" rather than directly part of the city deal. BBC Wales has seen a copy of the latest plan put to the UK government. What is on the table involves 11 different projects ranging from investments of £50m in the Swansea City and Waterfront Digital District and £5m for the Yr Egin creative hub project. Mr Stewart denied that the focus on buildings could lead to a return of the failed Technium project. He added that the Swansea Techniums had been a success story. The city deal aims to support \\"next generation industries\\" and to apply internet technologies for the region's energy sector. It also aims for the four council areas stretching from Neath Port Talbot to Pembrokeshire to become a magnet for hi-tech and cloud data firms. Life science firms would work alongside local hospitals, including an eye-catching £225m \\"wellness village\\" planned for near Llanelli. But Mr Stewart strongly denied the focus had shifted away from the \\"internet coast\\" vision to a more traditional focus of bricks and mortar developments. \\"In order to deliver the sorts of economic change we want in this region we have to take forward the fifth generation technologies - the establishment of the test bed,\\" he said. \\"We've been very clear about that and Sir Terry Matthews and his business partner from Wesley Clover, Simon Gibson, have been integral in bringing that together. \\"They can demonstrate though the model they've successfully rolled out in Canada, they've created 22,000 jobs there and we believe we can make that sort of economic impact here. \\"Whilst there are several projects which will have construction as part of it, the real golden thread through the deal are still those new technologies and new industries.\\" City deals exist to give financial support for councils to work more regionally on big projects - which will stimulate private investment and have a real transformational impact. There are hopes the Swansea Bay deal could be mentioned in Wednesday's Budget from Chancellor Philip Hammond. Mr Stewart said very positive meetings had been held with the Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns and Swansea-born Lord Heseltine, adviser to the communities and local government secretary. \\"As far as we're concerned we've answered all the questions posed to us by Treasury officials and others and feel we're at the point when we're ready to sign,\\" Mr Stewart told BBC Wales. He said £673m of private investment was ready to come into the region and the bid had \\"substantial support\\" from a wide range from within the private sector. \\"It's still a unique deal and still a very class-leading deal in terms of what it tries to do,\\" said Mr Stewart. \\"Some of the comments back from the secretary of state and others is that it's a very innovative deal, it does lots of things individually that others are doing but nobody is doing those in the way we are putting this together. \\"The biggest vote of confidence is if you look at the UK's industrial strategy, recently released by Theresa May, you map that against what our city deal is doing and the two are indivisible.

(AP... (Associated Press) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chairs the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem on Sunday, March 29, 2015. Netanyahu said he has \\"deep concern\\" over a pending nuclear deal the West appears close... (Associated Press) Iran's potential movement on enrichment reflected the intense pressure to close a deal. But substantial differences between the sides may prove too difficult to bridge before Tuesday's deadline for a preliminary agreement, which is meant to set the stage for a further round of negotiations toward a comprehensive deal in June. The goal is a long-term curb on Iran's nuclear activities. In return, Tehran would gain relief from the burden of global economic penalties. Foreign ministers and other representatives of Iran and the six powers in the talks have said there is a chance of succeeding by the deadline despite significant obstacles. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it was up to Iran to make that happen. By accepting the restrictions, the Iranians would \\"live up to their rhetoric that they are not trying to acquire a nuclear weapon,\\" he said in Washington on ABC's \\"This Week.\\" From Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu renewed strong criticism of what he brands a bad deal. He is at the forefront of accusations that Iran helped the recent Shiite rebel advance in Yemen, and Netanyahu linked Iran's alleged proxy grab for influence in the Middle East with what he sees as victory by Tehran at the negotiations in the Swiss city of Lausanne. \\"The Iran-Lausanne-Yemen axis is very dangerous for humanity and must be stopped,\\" he said. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, heading a delegation of American senators visiting Israel, said the lawmakers supported legislation to require Congress to approve any agreement on Iran's nuclear program, or to increase penalties against Iran if no deal is reached. The officials in Lausanne said the sides were advancing on limits to aspects of Iran's uranium enrichment program, which can be used to make the core of a nuclear warhead. Over the past weeks, Iran has moved from demanding that it be allowed to keep nearly 10,000 centrifuges enriching uranium, to agreeing to 6,000. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the talks, said Tehran now may be ready to accept even fewer. Tehran is ready to ship to Russia all the enriched uranium it produces, the officials said, describing a change from previous demands that Iran be permitted to keep a small amount in stock. One official cautioned that Iran previously had agreed to this, only to change its mind. Also, Iran's official IRNA news agency on Sunday cited an unidentified Iranian negotiator as denying such an agreement had been reached. Uranium enrichment has been the chief concern in over more than a decade of international attempts to cap Iran's nuclear programs. Tehran says it wants to enrich only for energy, science, industry and medicine. But many countries fear Iran could use the technology to make weapons-grade uranium. The United States and its allies want a deal that extends the time Iran would need to make a nuclear weapon from the present two months to three months to at least a year. The officials said a main dispute involves the length of an agreement. Iran, they said, wants a total lifting of all caps on its activities after 10 years, while the U.S. and others at the talks — Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany — insist on progressive removal after a decade. A senior U.S. official characterized the issue as lack of agreement on what happens in years 11 to 15. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with State Department rules on briefing about the closed-door talks. Limits on Iran's research and development of centrifuges also were unresolved, the Western officials said. Tehran has created a prototype centrifuge that it says enriches uranium 16 times faster than its present mainstay model. The U.S. and its partners want to constrain research that would increase greatly the speed of making enough weapons-grade uranium for a bomb, once limits on Iran's programs are lifted. One official said Russia opposed the U.S. position that any U.N. penalties lifted in the course of a deal should be reimposed quickly if Tehran reneged on any commitments. Both Western officials Iran was resisting attempts to make inspections and other ways of verification as intrusive as possible. There was tentative agreement on turning a nearly-finished reactor into a model that gives off less plutonium waste than originally envisaged. Plutonium, like enriched uranium, is a path to nuclear weapons. Iran and the U.S. were discussing letting Iran run centrifuges at an underground bunker that has been used to enrich uranium. The machines would produce isotopes for peaceful applications, the officials said. With the Tuesday deadline approaching and problems remaining, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry canceled plans Sunday to return to the United States for an event honoring the late U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and Frank-Walter Steinmeier, his German counterpart, scratched planned trips to Kazakhstan. Kerry has been in discussions with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif since Thursday. ____ Associated Press writer Aron Heller in Jerusalem contributed to this report. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

The Asian arowana, considered in some Asian cultures to bring good luck, was seized by federal environment department officers from a Mount Gravatt pet shop in November 2011. An Asian arowana fish. It was then euthanised after a veterinary officer using a scanner failed to detect a microchip, which is usually present in Asian arowanas farmed overseas. It was only after the fish was dead that the microchip was found. Authorities suspected that the native South-East Asian specimen was brought in from overseas because they were not aware of Asian arowanas being bred in captivity in Australia. Asian arowanas are considered threatened and are listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Trading the animal is banned unless there are exceptional circumstances. Advertisement In Australia, it is illegal to own an Asian arowana unless it is legally imported. When officers grilled then Pet City Mount Gravatt aquarium manager Kelly Hsu, she said the fish was purchased for 5000 from a local supplier named \\"Justin Smith\\" who bred the animals in Australia. However it later emerged that Mr Smith did not exist. Ms Hsu, a US citizen in her mid-30s who holds science and arts degrees, was charged with breaches of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. She pleaded guilty to possessing an endangered animal in the Brisbane Magistrates Court in May this year. But the federal environment department, not wanting to let her off the hook, appealed Representatives argued the 500 fine and the lack of conviction was \\"manifestly inadequate\\". In his findings handed down on September 29, District Court Judge William Everson agreed, fining Ms Hsu 800 and recording a conviction. \\"The offence, whilst not overly serious, is far from trivial,\\" he said.

The two were part of a scheme to smuggle the endangered Asian arowana fish, according to prosecutors. The plan was discovered when Loo put an ad on Craigslist offering to sell one of the fish for 2,800. An undercover federal agent answered the ad, prosecutors said. U.S. Fish and Wildlife agents seized 13 of the fish, which are found in the rivers of Southeast Asia and have long been on an international list of restricted species.

The entire scene was gray—the potholed roads, the sooty snow, the late-winter sky—except the officers themselves, who provided the only glimmer of green. Rather than standard NYPD issue, they wore olive uniforms and trooper hats, à la Ranger Smith from The Yogi Bear Show. As they crunched across the unshoveled walkway, a passing teenage girl wisecracked, “Ain’t you supposed to be in the forest?”Fitzpatrick, who had been patrolling the same beat since 1996, ignored her, keeping his eyes trained on one of the brick high-rises lined up like dominoes. As a cop (of sorts) from Brooklyn, descended from a clan of cops from Brooklyn, he looked the part, a towering man of forty-one with a crew cut and dimpled chin. Tucked under his arm was a file containing a photograph of the suspect he was after—someone he believed could be armed and dangerous. Inside, the building’s lobby was dimly lit and gloomy. The elevator clattered open, and we crowded in, squeaking up to the eighth floor, where the officers’ boots echoed down the long hall before halting outside one apartment. Fitzpatrick pounded on the door. After half a minute passed and nothing happened, he raised his fist again, pounding harder and longer. A baby cried down the hall. At last, a male voice, gravelly with sleep, croaked, “Who is it?”“State Environmental Police,” Fitzpatrick announced.“Who?” said the voice, sounding genuinely confused.The door cracked open to reveal a stocky young man with full-sleeve tattoos wearing flannel pajama bottoms, his eyes squinting against the light. His name was Jason Cruz. Asked if he knew what brought the officers to his door, he shook his head no and said, “I don’t at all.”“We’re here,” Fitzpatrick enlightened him, “because of the alligator that you were offering to sell on Craigslist.”• • •I WAS REPORTING a story about exotic pets for a science program on NPR, and it had taken me six months to get permission to join Fitzpatrick, a detective with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, on one of his busts. When I’d first called him the previous summer, I’d found him brimming with bizarre tales from an urban bestiary. During his time policing the city’s illegal wildlife trade, he had encountered everything from gorilla-hand ashtrays to twelve hundred turtles crammed into a swank Tribeca loft, their owner left with no room for a bed. There was the Harlem man who kept Ming the tiger and Al the alligator in the apartment where his mother was raising eight small children; the wealthy Brooklyn family who treated their African Diana monkey, one of the rarest primate species on earth, like a second daughter—even threatening to barricade their home if marshals tried to take her away; and the proprietor of a popular curio store in SoHo who landed in prison for selling not only a chimpanzee skeleton and walrus tusks but also human body parts. From time to time, a notorious dealer called Mr. Anything Man surfaced in his jalopy advertising exotic live animals, dead or alive.Anything. It’s the theme of the city’s wildlife trade. Sure enough, when Fitzpatrick asked the pajama-clad Cruz how he came by the alligator he’d been trying to sell, Cruz shrugged and said, “This is the Bronx. You can get anything.”Inside his apartment, which was small and tidy with a black leather couch, flatscreen TV, and mirrored photograph of the Manhattan skyline, a dog barked from the bathroom. Birds tweeted in the kitchen. Fitzpatrick walked over to a trio of tanks and inspected a leopard gecko in one and, in the other, a teaspoon-size baby Nile monitor—a yellow-striped lizard with a blue, forked tongue fond of devouring cats when full grown. The third tank was empty, except for a few inches of stagnant water, which Fitzpatrick leaned in to sniff suspiciously. “So where is the alligator now?” he asked.“I gave it back,” Cruz said, claiming he’d bought the reptile from a stranger outside PetSmart on Pelham Parkway. Though it was only a foot long, his girlfriend had pointed out its likelihood of enlarging and insisted that it had to go for the sake of their two-year-old daughter. After this ultimatum, Cruz said he tried to unload the gator online, but Craigslist flagged the ad; so he returned it to the dealer who sold it to him in the first place. “He was a Puerto Rican dude,” he offered.Fitzpatrick jotted this on a notepad. “Now it’s down to just a few million people in the Bronx,” he said drily.I was as disappointed as Fitzpatrick to have narrowly missed the alligator. I’d been hoping for a scene like the time he taped up the snout of a three-foot-long caiman and drove it thrashing in his front passenger seat to the Bronx Zoo. What’s more, Cruz didn’t live up to Fitzpatrick’s billing of the typical alligator aficionado as an exemplar of machismo and aggression. Pet alligators were supposed to be particularly hot among gang members and drug dealers, but Cruz didn’t seem like either. Before his daughter was born, he used to keep pit bulls, as evidenced by black leather harnesses with metal studs hanging from the wall; but the dog barking in the bathroom turned out to be a poodle.“You can really get in trouble over, like, an alligator?” Cruz asked Fitzpatrick, still bewildered by what was happening.His pregnant girlfriend, who had emerged from the bedroom, yawning and looking unamused, added, “There’s a lot of people that sell alligators.”“It’s a criminal offense,” Fitzpatrick told them, explaining that New York State prohibits the commercial sale of live crocodilians, while the city goes further, banning just about every exotic pet from scorpions to ferrets to polar bears. The Nile monitor was illegal too and would have to be seized. Cruz looked crestfallen as his girlfriend found an empty shoebox, into which he gingerly lifted the tiny lizard, wrapping it in a T-shirt to protect it from the cold.“There’s not many animals you can keep here,” Fitzpatrick advised him, “except a dog, cat, goldfish, canary—”“I got like twenty lovebirds!” Cruz exclaimed.In the kitchen, Fitzpatrick inspected the stacked cages of small, green parrots with yellow chests and red beaks, deeming them permissible.“If I didn’t have kids or nothing, I would’ve had cobras here, vipers, all types of stuff,” Cruz said wistfully, explaining that he had loved animals since he was a child, particularly after escaping the Bronx to visit his aunt in Florida where alligators sunned themselves in the backyard and took dips in the swimming pool. While waiting for the officers to write up a court summons, he called his mother and told her that he was going to be on Animal Planet. “NPR,” I mouthed, then frowned, recalling how my producer had requested high drama—something along the lines of a wildebeest in Queens.After hanging up, Cruz turned to me and grew philosophical: “You know what it is? You like animals, and you get tired of seeing the same animals over and over. You go to the pet store, and they have this and that—and you know everybody’s got it. So you try to get something different.”“Honestly, that’s part of the problem,” Fitzpatrick said as he handed over the summons. “Then you get into endangered species.”But Cruz, marveling at how easily he could acquire a fifteen-foot anaconda rumored to be for sale, didn’t seem to hear.• • •MORE EXOTIC ANIMALS are believed to live in American homes than in American zoos. Yet the desire of someone like Cruz to keep an alligator in his living room defies classic theories of pet-keeping, which hold that humans keep pets for unconditional love, for example, or because a misdirected cute response (the scientific term) compels us to care for other species the way we do our own offspring. Alligators are neither affectionate nor cute, at least not in the sense of being cuddly and having large eyes, a round face, and an oversize head like a human infant or a pug dog. Rather, the appeal seems to lie in the opposite direction—the alligator’s ferocity, its wild and untamable nature.In a way, what Cruz had assembled in his Bronx apartment could be seen as having a long historical precedent. It was a menagerie, a collection of exotic creatures kept in captivity for exhibition. Menageries first appeared with the advent of urbanization, when contact with wild animals became rare, and the keeping of exotics was almost exclusively the privilege of royalty and nobility. Mesopotamian kings, who received foreign beasts as tribute, created elaborate gardens to house them called paradeisoi, later to serve as the model for the biblical Garden of Eden. Egyptian pharaohs collected baboons, hippos, and elephants from sub-Saharan Africa and had them mummified to take into the afterlife. In the classical world, the Greeks brought back wild animals from military expeditions, a tradition their Roman conquerors continued, slaughtering the beasts in public arenas, a popular entertainment for nearly five hundred years. The Tower of London gained its famed royal menagerie in 1204. Across the Atlantic, Lord Moctezuma dazzled the first conquistadores with his magnificent pleasure gardens, replete with rare aquatic birds and wildcats tended by their own physicians. With the European discovery of the New World, the desire to own exotic animals intensified, and the Renaissance saw the invention of the private “cabinet of curiosities.” By the eighteenth century, the aristocracy was clamoring for monkeys and parrots as novel playthings.The human species is unique in its compulsion to tame and nurture nearly all other vertebrate animals. In his 1984 classic, Dominance & Affection: The Making of Pets, the cultural geographer Yi-Fu Tuan characterizes this proclivity as an exercise in power—a kind of playful domination stemming from our desire to control the unpredictable forces of nature. According to Tuan, the keeping of pets reflects our hunger for status symbols, for what the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre called the “carnal, clinging, humble, organic, milky taste of the creature,” which underlies all luxury goods.The modern pet shop first appeared in American cities in the 1890s; and with it began the mass importation of exotic animals from Asia and South America. Pet-keeping in the United States exploded in the economic boom following World War II and, since the 1970s, has more than tripled. For the first time in history, more American households have pets than don’t, including some 86 million cats and 78 million dogs. But no one knows how many “exotics” there are, not least because no one agrees how to define an exotic pet. Does a native but wild animal like a skunk count? What about a potbellied pig? Further complicating matters, much of the trade operates underground, flouting state and federal laws.In the 1980s, wild birds comprised the hottest segment of the black market. Next to take off was the “herp trade,” short for herpetoculture, which is the keeping of reptiles and amphibians such as turtles, lizards, and salamanders. “That’s where you have the big-buck items,” Fitzpatrick told me. He described how he once went undercover posing as a reptile collector to buy a critically endangered 18,000 radiated tortoise from Madagascar with a brilliant star pattern on its shell. As he was making the purchase, the dealer showed him a picture of a one-of-a-kind turtle—an albino river cooter, its entire body a pale jade white—and said he’d been offered 101,000 for the animal but was holding out for more.On that occasion, wary of being searched, Fitzpatrick had slipped his gun into a drawer in another room, and when his backup team was delayed, he began to sweat. Though the dealer didn’t resist arrest, high-stakes turtle trafficking can be tied up with all sorts of unsavory behavior. Interpol warns that organized-crime networks use the same routes to smuggle animals as they do weapons, drugs, and people—that environmental crime goes hand in hand with corruption, money laundering, even murder.• • •IT WAS FITZPATRICK who first told me about the Asian arowana. At the time, I still thought of pet fish as one step up from potted plants. Had someone informed me that fish comprise the vast majority of exotic pets—that they are the most common pet, period, with more than 100 million swimming in aquariums across the United States—I would not have cared one bit. If there was anything appealing about them, it was their comic irrelevancy and their association with childhood.When I was little, my parents got a tank of goldfish as a sorry substitute for a dog or cat. One day when I was about six, I noticed bubbles escaping from the fish’s puckering mouths and wondered if they were talking to each other. Retrieving my Fisher-Price stethoscope, I pushed a chair next to the aquarium and climbed up to listen for tiny voices rising from the water’s surface. All I heard was silence. After that, I ignored them, and they continued to ignore me.Not everyone, however, shared my dispassion. “One thing we deal with here in the city is a fish,” Fitzpatrick told me. “Arowana.” I misheard this as “marijuana,” and the association proved surprisingly apt. Protected by the Endangered Species Act, the Asian arowana cannot legally be brought into the United States as a pet. Yet trafficking is rampant across the country. Fitzpatrick recounted a bust at a dingy Brooklyn sweatshop, where women sat hunched over sewing machines, scraps of fabric strewn about the floor—a front for running fish. Another time, acting on a tip, he caught a Malaysian-born Queens man smuggling arowana through JFK Airport in water-filled baggies packed in a suitcase. Fitzpatrick noted that even the cheapest specimens sold for thousands of dollars, and prices went up from there, depending on coloration, the most desirable being red. “In certain Asian populations the arowana is considered good luck or a sign of prosperity or a status symbol,” he explained. “And it’s something that’s been overharvested for the pet trade for those reasons.”The obsession with the fish, however, wasn’t limited to Asian cultures. There was, for example, the Wall Street banker who broke down crying after he was arrested for possession of the species, confessing he couldn’t resist its dark-alley appeal. “In recent years, we’ve seen more cases involving non-Asians—white people,” Fitzpatrick said. The previous summer, two Long Island men had been caught at the Canadian border, driving back from Montreal with four specimens swimming in the spare-tire well of their SUV. Then a young man was busted running arowana from his family’s home in the suburbs. Fitzpatrick theorized that selling black-market fish was considered safer than dealing in other high-value contraband such as drugs and guns—especially in New York, where just twenty environmental conservation officers cover the same territory as some thirty-four thousand NYPD.The way he saw it, wildlife traffickers were motivated by pure greed, participating in what may well be the world’s most profitable form of illegal trade. But the collectors were driven by a passion he found easier to relate to. “I think that a lot of the people who have these animals are interested in nature, and that, in and of itself, is not a bad thing,” he said. “It’s just they’re going about it the wrong way.”As a young graduate student in biology, Fitzpatrick had spent two months studying birds in the jungles of Venezuela, where he lost thirty pounds, grew “a full Grizzly Adams beard,” and got all sorts of weird skin infections before realizing he was really a city person. He still loved tropical animals—from afar. His only pet was a pint-size Maltese with a name he refused to disclose. “Like Snowball?” I asked.“Something along those lines,” he said.“Flufferbutter?”“You get the picture.”• • •THAT EVENING AFTER I got home, I looked up the Asian arowana to see what more I could find. Fitzpatrick had mentioned that the species was officially called the Asian bonytongue—“very unsexy name”—for a long bone of a tongue, bristling with prickly, pinlike teeth, which the fish uses to seize and crush prey against teeth on the roof of its mouth. The bonytongues, I learned, are among the most ancient living fish on earth. The oldest fossils date to the Late Jurassic or Early Cretaceous and reveal giant creatures with ferocious fangs that roamed the prehistoric seas, preying on ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs. Today the family Osteoglossidae (from the Greek osteo meaning “bone,” and gloss meaning “tongue”) no longer inhabits the oceans but rather the rivers and lakes of the earth’s tropical midsection, where it traditionally includes one of the largest of all freshwater fish: the Amazonian arapaima, which can grow nearly fifteen feet long and weigh some 450 pounds. With the exception of this giant, the rest of the family—all long, thin creatures armored in a mosaic of large, heavy scales—are commonly known as arowanas.The most formidable among them (or at least the most acrobatic) is the South American silver arowana, also known as the water monkey for its ability to leap six feet into the air to snatch bugs, birds, snakes, and bats from overhanging branches. (Do not google arowana eats duckling.) In 2008, when a New Jersey man reached into a tank at Camden’s Adventure Aquarium to touch a silver arowana, the fish tried to make a meal of his hand. In his subsequent lawsuit, the victim alleged “painful bodily injuries” and that his three-year-old son suffered “severe emotional distress, headaches, nausea, long continued mental disturbance and repeated hysterical attacks” after witnessing the incident.Despite or perhaps because of its ferocity, the silver arowana is a popular pet in the United States—and a perfectly legal one—with young fry selling for as little as 30 to 50 apiece. In all, there are seven recognized arowana species (with three more disputed among scientists) in South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and Australia. Only the Asian variety is banned in the United States.Overseas, however, the Asian arowana is an openly coveted commodity in a legitimate luxury market. “Forget oil and diamonds, the next big thing in Southeast Asia is fish,” I read in the hobbyist magazine Practical Fishkeeping, which described how fifty specimens collectively valued at a million dollars had been placed under twenty-four-hour guard in Jakarta, Indonesia. “While these fish may be disappearing in the wild, their popularity amongst Asia’s richest is ever increasing.”In some instances, the species was reared on farms that could pass as prisons—facilities protected by nested walls, watchtowers, and rottweilers that prowled the perimeters at night. The reason for the heavy security became clear as I dug deeper into an international news archive that chronicled a spate of fish thefts across Southeast Asia. In Malaysia, five arowana stolen from a woman’s house were worth more than all her other possessions combined. Singapore, which boasts one of the lowest crime rates in the world, once reported four such heists in a single week. One thief punched out an elderly woman who chased him as he made off with her prized fish in a sloshing bucket. He was sentenced to three years in prison and twelve strokes of a wet cane.As for who was taking the fish, some surmised that the thieves were fish lovers who could not afford the astronomical prices. Others suspected that a crime syndicate was behind the thefts—a sort of shadowy “fish mafia.” Bolstering this theory was a harrowing case in Indonesia, where an arowana dealer and his heavily armed cronies allegedly kidnapped and held for ransom a Japanese buyer.Despite all this criminality, however, the trade in the farmed fish was legal not only in Asia but throughout most of the world, including Canada and Europe—the one major exception (other than the United States) being Australia, which bans the species to protect its own tropical fauna. A few years back, a forty-five-year-old housewife was arrested at the Melbourne Airport trying to enter the country with fifty-one fish, including an Asian arowana, hidden beneath her poufy skirt. “We became suspicious after hearing these flipping and flapping noises,” a customs official later told the press.Such absurd tales of smuggling kept me up late as I poured through the hundred-some articles I’d printed out and spread across my living room floor. The picture that gradually emerged, however, looked less like the illegal drug trade and more like a parody of Manhattan’s overheated art scene, complete with record-breaking prices, anonymous buyers, stolen specimens, unsavory dealers, and even clever fakes. Whatever the best metaphor, it seemed the Asian arowana had a long history of driving human beings to dangerous extremes.One summer in college, I’d read Jane Goodall’s In the Shadow of Man, and ever since, I’d dreamed of venturing into the jungle to write a great story about wildlife. Around the time my curiosity in the arowana began, I’d been awarded a fellowship intended to fund a reporting project abroad. Now I knew how I’d use it: I would go see for myself where all these smuggled arowana were coming from and what made the species so irresistible. Goodall had her noble, tool-wielding primates—I would have a bad-tempered, bony-tongued fish.It was obvious where to start. At the center of the glamorous world of Southeast Asian aquaculture reigned a flamboyant Singaporean tastemaker known as Kenny the Fish, a chain-smoking millionaire fond of posing nude behind strategically placed aquatic pets. The Fish’s real name was Kenny Yap, and he was the executive chairman of an ornamental-fish farm so lucrative that it was listed on Singapore’s main stock exchange. Recently, the Singaporean press had dubbed him one of the city’s most eligible bachelors and called for him to host a national spin-off of Donald Trump’s reality show, The Apprentice. To enter his website, I had to click on his belly button.I’ve since come to think of this navel as the rabbit hole into which I fell, not to emerge for some three and a half years. ||||| One January evening as the tepid winter heat was beginning to subside across Singapore, a stranger walked into the Lam Hong Aquarium Shop. The owner, a bespectacled woman named Tay Chai Eng, knew most of her patrons, but she had never seen this man before. He was in his early thirties—young enough to be her son—and carrying a bucket of water. He was also concealing a six-inch knife. The moment Tay turned her back, the man plunged his hand into a tank, then raced out the door and into the parking lot. The older woman took off in frantic pursuit, catching the thief and latching onto his free arm like a barnacle. He dropped the bucket to punch her. It was just what she wanted—not the broken glasses or sliced cheek, but the five tiny young fish that spilled onto the asphalt, glinting like gold in the low rays of the sun. These were Asian arowana, the world’s most expensive aquarium fish. In Chinese, they’re known as lóng yú, the dragon fish. Four of them died that day. The one that survived is now two feet long, its sinuous body plated with large scales as shiny and round as coins. A pair of whiskers juts from its lower lip, and two gauzy pectoral fins extend from its sides, suggesting a dragon in flight. This resemblance has led to the belief that the species brings prosperity and good fortune, that it will even commit suicide by jumping out of its tank to prevent the death of its owner. Across Asia, tycoons boast of dropping six figures on the finest specimens. In the United States, the fish is protected by the Endangered Species Act—though a thriving black market persists. One Wall Street banker wept when authorities confiscated his illegal fish. How did a primitive predator from the swamps of Southeast Asia become such a coveted commodity? When I first began researching the fish, I expected to hear much about feng shui. I did. Ultimately, however, my reporting pointed me toward a more surprising story—the history of the species as a test case in conservation. In the mid-’70s, when the Asian arowana was still eaten more often than kept as a pet, its population was found to be declining due to overfishing and habitat loss. Consequently, the fish landed on the first Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Today CITES is one of the largest conservation agreements in the world, regulating the movement of some 35,000 species across the borders of 186 member states. The animals and plants on Appendix I are considered the rarest of the rare and generally banned from international trade. In the case of the Asian arowana, however, the listing seemed to backfire, propelling the species into the spotlight as a limited edition. Paradoxically, “declaring a species endangered may make it more desirable and thereby increase the likelihood of exploitation,” according to a study led by French conservation biologist Franck Courchamp, who elsewhere has pointed to the example of rhinos: After rhinos were moved to Appendix I, the value of their horn quadrupled in Korea, which led to a sharp spike in poaching. A similar phenomenon afflicts reptiles and amphibians in the exotic pet trade, where animals listed on CITES fetch a premium price. Economic theory has long held that trade alone is unlikely to drive a species to extinction, because of the rising cost of finding the last individuals of a dwindling population. Courchamp, however, proposes a new model that integrates a basic facet of human behavior well-known to economists since Adam Smith—the “paradox of value,” otherwise known as the “water and diamonds paradox.” While water has tremendous practical value, it’s worth nothing in exchange. Rare animals are the opposite, like diamonds. Their inflated value drives their exploitation, causing them to become ever rarer and hence more desirable until they’re sucked into an “extinction vortex.” One solution is to scrub species of the sheen of rarity, scrapping bans in favor of sustainable trade. This approach produced one of the greatest conservation success stories of the 20th century: the resurrection of crocodilians, which were rescued from the brink through ranching programs in which eggs are collected from the wild and reared in captivity for skins. Some biologists such as Courchamp argue that this model is the best way to save rhinos whose horns could be harvested like wool. Others warn that for ranching to work as a conservation tool it must place a value on the preservation of wild populations. Without that link, we’re likely to be left with an oxymoron like the Asian arowana: a mass-produced endangered species. Bred by the hundreds of thousands on high-security farms protected by nested walls, barbed wire, and rottweilers that prowl the perimeters at night, the fish has all but disappeared from nature.

They are considered threatened and are listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. It is illegal to own an Asian arowana in Australia unless it has been legally imported. Despite their endangered status, the commercial trade of these fish is still thriving, with some examples costing thousands of dollars. The fish cannot legally be brought into the United States as a pet due to it being protected by the Endangered Species Act, but the demand for the fish is rampant and the black market trade continues to bolster. Conservation efforts have been working to prevent the illegal trade of the Asian arowana, but the animal's status as an endangered species may make it more desirable, ironically increasing the likelihood of its exploitation. Some suggest that the solution may be to eliminate the idea of rarity by engaging in sustainable trade; this has been successful in the conservation of crocodilians."},{"instruction":"Q:The answer to the question: What is the full name of the man with the pet mouse? is inside the article: In Victorian London, an unseen criminal begins masterminding his \\"perfect plot on paper\\" which starts with a robbery taking place and three cats stealing a pink diamond. Three constables spot them and give chase, but the cats escape to the rooftops and glide off into the night, giving the stolen diamond to a mysterious horseman.

Jerry heads out to buy it while encountering Tom on the way, who also has something for Holmes. Jerry returns to Holmes' flat and hands him the paper or what was left of it after the chase. Reading a letter Tom had given to them for the night, Holmes and Watson decide to go to the Bruce Nigel Theatre where a performer named Red is seen. Holmes is told that she is being blackmailed and Holmes suggests who the perpetrator might be – Professor Moriarty. Holmes deduces that the Star of Punjab, a diamond that is light sensitive to the light of a solar eclipse which was to happen the following day, is to be stolen by the mastermind of the blackmail. At the Punjab Embassy, Spike and Tyke are assigned to guard the Star of Punjab. Spike begins to teach Tyke how to be a good dog guard, but the three cats from the previous night steal the diamond while an unfocused Spike is not looking. The three cats then leave a small button and retreat. They climb out through a hole in Red's home that leads to the tunnel and escape before Holmes, Tom and Jerry arrive.

Which language is this?","output":"The given text \\"S díky přijímám\\" is in Czech, a West Slavic language spoken by approximately 10 million people, primarily in the Czech Republic. This language is closely related to other Slavic languages such as Slovak, Polish, and Serbian. The phrase \\"S díky přijímám\\" translates to \\"I accept with thanks\\" in English. Czech uses the Latin alphabet with several additional characters, such as č, ř, and ž, to represent unique sounds in the language. Along with accented characters (e.g., á, é, and í), these special characters play an essential role in proper Czech pronunciation and orthography. Czech grammar is relatively complex and features a rich morphology, with seven grammatical cases for nouns, pronouns, and adjectives. The language also exhibits a high degree of inflection, and verbs have a comprehensive system of conjugation to indicate tense, aspect, and voice. Czech sentence structure is relatively flexible compared to English, allowing for freer word order. The Czech language has a rich literary tradition, with notable authors such as Franz Kafka, Karel Čapek, and Bohumil Hrabal. Additionally, the Czech Republic is known for its contributions to linguistics and language teaching, including the development of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR)."},{"instruction":"Given the background: While the Grants were on the Galápagos, a drought occurred.

Paragraph : If blood volume in the body decreases, blood pressure decreases. A:","output":"If Jim experiences a significant amount of blood loss from a cut he sustains, his blood pressure will become lower. According to the information provided in the paragraph, a decrease in blood volume within the body will lead to a decrease in blood pressure. Blood volume and blood pressure are directly proportional to each other; when one decreases, so does the other. Blood pressure is the force exerted by the blood against the walls of blood vessels. It is necessary to maintain a certain level of blood pressure to ensure that blood can circulate effectively throughout the body, delivering essential oxygen and nutrients to the cells. When blood volume decreases due to blood loss, there is less force exerted against the blood vessels, resulting in lower blood pressure. The body has various mechanisms to try to compensate for this drop in blood pressure, such as increasing the heart rate or constricting blood vessels, to get the blood pressure back to a normal range and maintain proper blood flow to vital organs. However, if the blood loss is too severe, the body may not be able to adequately compensate, which can lead to shock and potentially life-threatening complications. In Jim's case, if the blood loss is substantial and his body cannot effectively respond, his blood pressure would indeed become lower, and he may require medical attention to prevent further complications."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and answer the question.

Los Angeles County coroner's officials released their final cause of death in the 68-year-old's suicide, finding that he died of multiple blunt-force injuries after leaping from the Vincent Thomas Bridge. The director also had therapeutic levels of the sleep aid Lunestra and the anti-depressant Mirtazipine, also known as Remeron, in his system, according to results of toxicology tests. Harvey told The Times that investigators found no pre-existing conditions in Scott, based on both the autopsy and medical records. FULL COVERAGE: Director Tony Scott | 1944-2012 \\"There was no evidence of neoplasia -- cancer -- identified,\\" Harvey said. After Scott's death, some media reports quoted an anonymous source suggesting that Scott had a brain tumor. His family vehemently denied those reports. Scott jumped off the Vincent Thomas bridge on Aug. 19. His family has not offered any public explanation as to why he took his own life. The coroner's findings also do not help untangle the mystery. Harvey said investigators interviewed Scott's family, but the discussion shed no light on the suicide. Several of Scott's associates told The Times that the director had mentioned back or hip problems in the months prior to his death, but many said they had no indication it was anything other than business as normal for the director-producer. \\"He was completely on a high -- laughing and energetic,\\" said Elizabeth Gabler, whose Fox 2000 studio division made \\"Man on Fire\\" and was developing Scott's next film, \\"Lucky Strike.\\" They were scheduled to discuss script notes on the morning after he died, she said. \\"In a million years, this isn't something I'd have thought he'd do,\\" Mark Bomback, a writer on \\"Unstoppable\\" said at the time. \\"I never had an inkling he had any health problems....

Credit: Todd Williamson / Getty Images ||||| Director’s Death Director Tony Scott had an antidepressant and sleep medication in his system when he plunged off an L.A. bridge in August, say coroner’s officials, who ruled Monday he died of multiple blunt-force injuries. Christine Pelisek reports. British director Tony Scott had therapeutic levels of Mirtazapine, an antidepressant, and Lunesta, a sleep aid, in his system when he leaped off a Los Angeles bridge in August, coroner officials said Monday. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled the 68-year-old Top Gun director’s death a suicide and said he died of multiple blunt-force injuries. But the preliminary findings don’t make the motive for Scott’s suicide any clearer. After his death, friends found a detailed suicide note at his office and police discovered a letter with contact numbers in his black Toyota Prius, but the contents of the notes were never made public. ABC News reported that the director was suffering from inoperable brain cancer, though there were no public reports of health problems. On Monday, chief coroner spokesman Craig Harvey said Scott had no underlying health problems and there was “no anatomic evidence of neoplasia [cancer] identified.” The results of the coroner’s autopsy will not be available for two more weeks. Scott, who was known for his trademark red baseball cap, and his 74-year-old brother, Prometheus director Ridley Scott, had been producing the hit CBS drama The Good Wife at the time of his death. The two men were also working together on Killing Lincoln, based on the bestseller by Bill O’Reilly. Just two days before he plummeted to his death, Scott had met with Tom Cruise to discuss a sequel to their 1986 hit Top Gun. The men toured the Fallon U.S. Naval Air Station in Nevada, where the real Top-Gun pilots train. Cruise, who was reportedly devastated by Scott’s death, said at the time in a statement: “Tony was my dear friend and I will really miss him. He was a creative visionary whose mark on film is immeasurable. My deepest sorrow and thoughts are with his family at this time.” Around 12:35 p.m. on Aug. 19, Scott drove onto the Vincent Thomas Bridge, which spans the port city of San Pedro and Terminal Island, and parked at the bridge’s highest point, officials said. Witnesses reported that the director got out of his car and climbed the 10-foot fence on the south side of the bridge before plunging 185 feet into the cold murky water below. Los Angeles harbor patrol, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Los Angeles port police were able to pinpoint Scott’s location by using underwater sonar equipment regularly used to find explosives, and after they discovered his sneakers floating in the water. Scott was no stranger to the Vincent Thomas Bridge, the fourth largest suspension bridge in California. In a 2009 interview with Rotten Tomatoes about his plans to do a remake of Warriors, Scott spoke about why he planned to switch the movie location from New York to Los Angeles. “It’s a city which is horizontal,” he said. “New York is vertical, all skyscrapers, and Los Angeles is horizontal. I’m hoping to get 100,000 real gang members standing on the Vincent Thomas Bridge for one shot.” Scott had recently finished shooting the drama Out of the Furnace, starring Christian Bale.

Toxicology tests revealed that Scott had therapeutic levels of the sleep aid Lunestra and the anti-depressant Mirtazapine, also known as Remeron, in his system at the time of his death. Despite these findings, the motive for Scott's suicide remains unclear. Neither the investigators' interviews with Scott's family nor the autopsy results shed any light on the reason for his actions. Friends and colleagues reported that they were unaware of any health issues or problems that Scott was facing.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: What does Sarah use to pull the cloak off Mater Lachrymarum? Title: Mother of Tears Movie plot: The film begins with members of the Catholic Church digging up the body of a 19th-century church official, whose casket has a box-shaped urn chained to it. Inside the box they discover artifacts belonging to Mater Lachrymarum (Moran Atias), the last surviving member of the Three Mothers; an ancient trio of powerful black witches. In particular, the box contains a magic cloak that, when worn by Mater Lachrymarum, increases her powers significantly. The urn is shipped to the Museum of Ancient Art in Rome where Sarah Mandy (Asia Argento), an American studying art restoration, works. Sarah is dating the curator Michael Pierce, a single father who is away from the museum that night. With help from the assistant curator, Sarah opens the box and finds the cloak, a dagger, and three statues representing the three witches. Sending Sarah to her office to retrieve tools to help her translate the text on the artifacts, the curator is promptly attacked by the demonic agents of Mater Lachrymarum. Sarah arrives too late to save her boss (who is being disembowelled by the monsters) and starts to flee the museum. Unfortunately, she is pursued by Mater Lachrymarum's familiar (a baboon) and is only able to escape when a disembodied voice magically throws open a series of locked doors keeping her trapped inside the museum. Sarah tells the police what happened as she spends the night with Michael and his son. Michael visits the Cardinal who sent him the urn only to find out that, shortly after mailing the urn to him, he had a severe stroke and is now in a coma. An assistant of the priest gives Michael a piece of paper, which the Cardinal was writing on before collapsing. On it is scrawled the name \\"Mater Lachrymarum\\". As he leaves the hospital, a pair of witches observe Michael leaving the building. Back in Rome, chaos descends as a wave of mass suicides, murder, and violence engulfs the city.

His team of four gradually ingratiate themselves into the lives of The Dogs, the nickname that Shadwell's fans give themselves. The main site for this is The Rock, a public house around which The Dogs' lives revolve. Gradually, the hard drinking and hard fighting macho culture - where Saturday's match and Saturday's fight are all that matters - prove strangely irresistible to John and he slowly finds himself becoming one of the thugs he has been sent to entrap. His relationships with his wife, his superiors and even his team become strained. Eventually his wife returns to her parents' house and rebuffs his attempted reconciliation. The police operation is abruptly wound up for budgeting reasons, just as it seems John is making progress in identifying those who pull the strings. The closing sequence shows a shaven-headed John taking part in a racist march, having become nothing more than a neo-nazi fascist. One of his team approaches him to try to help him, but is rebuffed. John says that he is, again, working undercover. There is a degree of ambiguity, and it might be that he is working undercover, though it may also be that he has become deluded and has merely mired himself in an even less pleasant world.

The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution has disclosed for the first time that its REMUS 6000 autonomous underwater vehicle found the wreck of the San Jose in more than 2,000 feet of water in late 2015, the AP reports. \\"We've been holding this under wraps out of respect for the Colombian government,\\" says WHOI official Rob Munier. The institution says it was initially unclear whether the wreck detected at the bottom of the Caribbean Sea was the San Jose or another vessel, Live Science reports. The REMUS 6000 descended to within 30 feet of the largely sediment-covered wreck, allowing researchers to spot identifying details including the distinctive dolphins carved on the galleon's cannons. The 62-gun galleon, laden with gold, silver, and emeralds, was sunk with 600 people on board by British ships during the War of Spanish Succession. Colombia says it plans to display the cannons and other items from the wreck in a museum. The treasure has yet to be recovered, and United Nations cultural agency UNESCO has urged Colombia not to commercially exploit the wreck. (The search for MH370 may have solved some maritime mysteries.) Expand this summary.","output":"A long time ago, there was a very big Spanish ship called the San Jose. This ship had a lot of treasure on it - up to 17 billion worth of gold, silver, and beautiful green stones called emeralds! But one day, in the year 1708, the ship had a terrible fight with some British ships and it sank to the bottom of the sea. For many years, experts have been trying to find out where the San Jose is hiding. In 2015, they sent a special underwater robot called REMUS 6000 to look for it, and it found the shipwreck deep in the Caribbean Sea! They made sure it was the San Jose by looking at the special dolphin carvings on the ship's big guns, called cannons. Now, the country of Colombia is planning to show the cannons and other items from the ship in a museum for everyone to see. But, they have not brought up the treasure yet, and the United Nations, a group of important people from around the world, asked Colombia to be very careful and not to use the shipwreck just to make money.

Answer:","output":"The stone you are referring to is called the pumice stone. Pumice is a fascinating volcanic rock formed during a volcanic eruption. It is unique due to its light weight and porous nature, which allows it to float on water. Pumice is created when super-heated, highly pressurized lava is ejected from a volcano and cools rapidly as it comes into contact with the atmosphere or water. The rapid cooling and depressurization process lead to the formation of a solidified frothy structure, which, in turn, creates numerous tiny gas bubbles or cavities within the stone. These gas bubbles reduce the overall density of the pumice stone, and often its density is lower than that of water. As a result, pumice stones can float on the water surface. Pumice stones come in various colors, ranging from white, gray, yellow, to brown, depending on the mineral composition of the originating magma. Pumice stones can be found in regions with volcanic activity, such as Italy, Greece, Iceland, Indonesia, Japan, and the western parts of North and South America. Apart from its curious floating property, pumice has several practical applications. It has been used for centuries for cleaning and exfoliating the skin, especially removing dead skin cells and calluses from the feet. In addition, pumice stones are used in construction, agriculture, and other industries for their abrasive and lightweight properties. They are also utilized for filtration and water treatment processes, as they help to trap impurities. In summary, pumice stones are remarkable volcanic rocks with the unusual ability to float on water. Their formation and unique properties make them stand out among other rock types, contributing to their various uses in skincare, construction, and agriculture, among others."},{"instruction":"What key details about mace brown can be extracted from the following bio?

Just as physical muscles grow stronger with exercise and targeted training, the brain too can become more efficient and capable when you consistently engage in activities that stimulate and challenge it. Puzzles and games, such as crosswords, Sudoku, chess, or even strategy-based video games, provide a mental workout for the brain that can lead to improved problem-solving and critical thinking abilities. These activities often require creative thinking and the ability to adapt to changing situations quickly, skills that are also useful in real-life scenarios. In addition, by practicing these skills regularly, individuals can form stronger neural connections, which ultimately allow the brain to process information faster and more efficiently.

Q: Article: A punctual person is in the habit of doing a thing at the proper time and is never late in keeping an appointment. The unpunctual man, on one hand, never does what he has to do at the proper time. He is always in a hurry and in the end loses both time and his good name. A lost thing may be found again, but lost time can never be regained. Time is more valuable than material things. In fact, time is life itself. The unpunctual man is for ever wasting and mismanaging his most valuable asset as well as other's. The unpunctual person is always complaining that he finds no time to answer letters, or return calls or keep appointments promptly. But the man who really has a great deal to do is very careful of his time and seldom complains of want of it. He knows that he can not get through his huge amount of work unless he faithfully keeps every piece of work when it has to be attended to. Failure to be punctual in keeping one's appointments is the sign of disrespect towards others. If a person is invited to dinner and arrives later than the appointed time, he keeps all the other guests waiting for him. Usually this will be regarded as a great disrespect to the host and all other guests present. Unpunctuality, moreover, is very harmful when it comes to do one's duty, whether public or private. Imagine how it would be if those who are put in charge of important tasks failed to be at their proper place at the appointed time. A man who is known to be habitually unpunctual is never trusted by his friends or fellow men.

Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. But I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. What is an answer for this question: Who will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their farm? The answer is:","output":"Kenny will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near his farm. The explanation for this answer is based on the background provided and understanding the chain of events related to the usage of fertilizer and its impact on nearby water bodies. It all starts with the amount of fertilizer used by the farmers. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes and, as a result, has increased the amount of fertilizer he uses on his farm. On the other hand, Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. When it rains, the rainwater dissolves the fertilizer in the soil, and the runoff water carries it away, eventually depositing the fertilizer in bodies of water, such as ponds, rivers, and oceans. In this case, Bobby and Kenny's farms have ponds located downstream, which are directly impacted by the fertilizer runoff. The nitrogen content in the fertilizer stimulates the growth of algae in water bodies, causing an algal bloom. The overgrowth of algae is harmful to water ecosystems because it uses up the dissolved oxygen that other aquatic life depends on. As the algae population increases, they use up more and more carbon dioxide in the water, and after they die, decomposers break down the dead algal tissue. These decomposers consume oxygen during decomposition, creating a dead zone within the water body where nothing can grow due to low levels of oxygen. Given the background provided, it is clear that Bobby is using more fertilizer on his farm due to the increased demand for potatoes. Consequently, there will be more nitrogen-containing runoff entering the nearby ponds and causing the overgrowth of algae. The higher volume of algae, in turn, will contribute to a greater depletion of oxygen in the water, resulting in larger dead zones in the ponds. On the other hand, Kenny is using less fertilizer since tomatoes are not in season. This means that there would be less runoff carrying nitrogen into the ponds, leading to a smaller growth of algae and therefore smaller impacts on the oxygen levels in the surrounding ponds. In conclusion, based on the quantities of fertilizer used by the farmers and the resulting impact on the algae population and oxygen levels in the nearby ponds, Kenny will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near his farm."},{"instruction":"Mısır yetiştiricileri tohum ekme işini zamanında tamamlayamadığından, mahsul ciddi ölçüde azalacak.

B). no.","output":"B). No. The sentence \\"Predation can be heightened during migration: Eleonora's falcon Falco eleonorae, which breeds on Mediterranean islands, has a very late breeding season, coordinated with the autumn passage of southbound passerine migrants, which it feeds to its young.\\" does not answer the question, \\"What makes birds prone to parasites and pathogens?\\". Rather, the sentence highlights a specific example of increased predation during bird migration. In this case, Eleonora's falcon is using the migration of southbound passerine migrants as a food source for its young during their late breeding season. To answer the question about what makes birds prone to parasites and pathogens, we need to consider several factors that can contribute to their susceptibility: 1. Environmental factors: Birds' susceptibility to parasites and pathogens can be affected by various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and contaminants in water and food sources. For example, higher temperatures and humidity can create favorable conditions for parasite growth and transmission. 2. Migration: During migration, birds face numerous challenges, including long-distance travel, limited food sources, and exposure to new environments with different parasite and pathogen strains. These factors can increase their susceptibility to infection. Additionally, birds often congregate in larger numbers at specific stopover sites during migration, which may facilitate the transmission of parasites and pathogens among individuals. 3. Stress: Birds experience various stressors throughout their lives, including from predation, competition for resources, social interactions, and environmental changes. Stress can weaken a bird's immune system, making it more susceptible to parasites and pathogens. 4. Breeding: Breeding activities, such as nest-building and territorial defense, can increase stress levels and reduce the availability of resources for self-maintenance, leaving birds vulnerable to parasites and pathogens. Breeding colonies may also create suitable environments for parasite and pathogen transmission, with many birds in close proximity to each other. 5. Host factors: Birds have evolved various defenses against parasites and pathogens, including immune and physiological responses, as well as behavioral strategies for avoiding infected habitats and conspecifics. However, previous exposure, age, and genetics can influence a bird's susceptibility to infection. For example, young birds with immature immune systems are generally more susceptible to parasites and pathogens than older, more experienced individuals. In conclusion, while the given sentence does not address birds' vulnerability to parasites and pathogens, multiple factors can contribute to their susceptibility, including environmental conditions, migration stressors, and host characteristics."},{"instruction":"Article:Canaries keeper John Ruddy kept out two Sergio Aguero efforts as the home side resolutely kept the visitors at bay. However, it was Norwich who came closest to a goal when a 25-yard Patrick Bamford shot hit the crossbar. The home side might even have snatched a late winner but Graham Dorrans put a shot wide when well placed. Relive Norwich's goalless draw with Man City Manchester City have now won only two of their past 11 away games in the league, and Manuel Pellegrini's side failed to respond to his warning they had no \\"margin for error\\" in the title race. Pellegrini opted for a 4-4-2 formation, with Wilfried Bony partnering Aguero in attack, but despite their dominance the visitors rarely looked dangerous and failed to muster a shot on target in the second half. Bony was a peripheral figure and it was little surprise when he was replaced just before the hour mark by Raheem Sterling, though the winger's introduction failed to lift the away side. The worry for Pellegrini, who will be replaced in the summer by Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola, will be the lack of creativity, intensity and urgency from his side. \\"Me and [Norwich goalkeeper] John Ruddy could have had the afternoon off to be honest,\\" said visiting keeper Joe Hart. \\"We weren't good enough to win the game.\\" Hart and his team-mates will be looking over their shoulders in the race for Champions League football, with only a two-point gap between them and fifth-placed West Ham. Norwich remain in the bottom three after winning only their second point from their past 10 league games. But, if they can continue to defend in the same way and add goals to this sort of performance, they will believe they can avoid relegation. \\"It is a big point and sends a message out to the teams around us and maybe dents them again,\\" said Norwich defender Russell Martin. Canaries boss Alex Neil has rarely had cause to question his side's desire, and his players again put in a performance full of effort and commitment - running 5km more than their opponents. The plan might have been to frustrate their visitors and hope to catch them on the break, but scoring goals remains an issue with just three in their past seven games. Neil hoped giving Bamford his first Premier League start might solve the problem but though the on-loan Chelsea forward went closest to scoring, Norwich did not manage a shot on target. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: \\"We are disappointed. We tried to be aggressive with and without the ball. We had a good attitude but we could not create space. \\"Of course we should create more in the last third. We were static up front. Every time that you drop points it is harder but you must continue thinking in a positive way.

This proved successful and Herb Cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year. As a result, Zappa and his wife, along with the Mothers of Invention, moved to New York. Their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of Zappa's music. Everything was directed by Zappa using hand signals. Guest performers and audience participation became a regular part of the Garrick Theater shows. One evening, Zappa managed to entice some U.S. Marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by Zappa to pretend that it was a \\"gook baby\\".Zappa uniquely contributed to the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, sampling radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as AMM and Faust also contributed to the radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only in It for the Money (released 1968). It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only in It for the Money featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. He sampled plundered surf music in We're only in It for the Money, as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song Tomorrow Never Knows. The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt.

And the answer is?","output":"Ommetaphobia is the irrational fear of eyes. The word \\"ommetaphobia\\" is derived from two Greek words: \\"omma\\" meaning \\"eye\\" and \\"phobia\\" meaning \\"fear.\\" In some cases, people may suffer from ommetaphobia in the form of an extreme aversion to direct eye contact or discomfort in environments where eyes might often be encountered, such as an optometrist's office. As a phobia, ommetaphobia comes under the umbrella of anxiety disorders. Phobias are characterized by excessive, irrational fear and avoidance of the feared object or situation, which has a significant impact on a person's daily life and functioning. Ommetaphobia, just like other specific phobias, can stem from factors like genetic predisposition, negative or traumatic experiences, faulty cognitive processing, or a combination of these factors. It is important to note that though there are many reasons behind ommetaphobia, it is not something that sufferers choose or have control over. The symptoms of ommetaphobia can vary from person to person but may include feelings of dread, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, dizziness, trembling, sweating, and a strong desire to escape when encountering or anticipating situations involving eyes. These symptoms can be triggered by seeing the eyes of another person, one's own eyes, certain artistic depictions of eyes, or watching the eyes in media such as television or movies. Treatment for ommetaphobia typically involves psychotherapy, with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) being the most commonly recommended approach. CBT focuses on identifying and challenging irrational thoughts and beliefs related to the phobia and replacing them with more accurate and adaptive ways of thinking. Exposure therapy, a component of CBT, is also frequently used in the treatment of specific phobias. In exposure therapy, individuals gradually and systematically confront their fears in a controlled environment with the guidance of a professional therapist. Through this process of repeated exposure, the individual learns to manage their anxiety and build the tolerance towards the feared situation, thereby helping to reduce the intensity of the phobia. Additionally, relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation, can help reduce anxiety levels and improve the individual's ability to manage their fears effectively. In some cases, medication may be prescribed alongside therapy to help manage anxiety symptoms and facilitate progress in therapy. In summary, ommetaphobia is the irrational fear of eyes and may significantly impact an individual's daily life and functioning. Treatment options, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, exposure therapy, and relaxation techniques, can be effective in managing and reducing the intensity of the phobia."},{"instruction":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: The story opens in the 1950s, after the Korean War; it has been more than a decade since James Whale, director of Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein, has retired. He lives with his long-time housemaid, Hanna, who loyally cares for him but disapproves of his homosexuality. Whale has suffered a series of strokes that have left him fragile and tormented by memories: growing up as a poor outcast, his tragic World War I service, and the filming of The Bride of Frankenstein. Whale slips into his past, and indulges in his fantasies, reminiscing about gay pool parties and also sexually teasing an embarrassed, starstruck fan who comes to interview him. Whale battles depression, at times contemplating suicide, as he realizes his life, his attractiveness, and his health are slipping away. Whale befriends his young, handsome gardener and former Marine, Clayton Boone and the two begin a sometimes uneasy friendship as Boone poses for Whale's sketches. The two men bond while discussing their lives and dealing with Whale's spells of disorientation and weakness from the strokes. Boone, impressed with Whale's fame, watches The Bride of Frankenstein on TV as his friends mock the movie, his friendship with Whale, and Whale's intentions. Boone assures Whale that he is straight and receives assurance from Whale that there is no sexual interest, but Boone storms out when Whale graphically discusses his sexual history. Boone later returns with the agreement that no such \\"locker room\\" discussions occur again. Boone is invited to escort Whale to a party hosted by George Cukor for Princess Margaret.

For example, through transpiration, plants move enormous amounts of water from the soil to the atmosphere. Plants such as peas host bacteria that fix nitrogen. This makes nitrogen available to all plants, which pass it on to consumers. Q: Through what do plants move enormous amounts of water from the soil to the atmosphere? A: A:","output":"Through transpiration, plants move enormous amounts of water from the soil to the atmosphere. Transpiration is a vital process for plants, as it enables them to regulate their water content, maintain important nutrient balance, and facilitate the exchange of gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. Transpiration takes place primarily in plant leaves, which contain numerous tiny pores called stomata. These stomata can open and close, allowing for the exchange of gases and the release of water vapor. During the day, when sunlight is available, the stomata open to allow for gas exchange required for photosynthesis. As plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, water molecules are also released in the form of water vapor. This water vapor then diffuses out of the stomata into the surrounding atmosphere, contributing to the overall moisture levels in the air. The process of transpiration is essential not only to individual plants but also to entire ecosystems and the global water cycle. As water evaporates from the soil and transpires from plants, it rises into the atmosphere where it forms clouds. These clouds eventually release the water back to the earth's surface through precipitation, replenishing the soil and bodies of water to sustain life on the planet. Moreover, transpiration also serves as a cooling mechanism for plants. When water evaporates from the surfaces of leaves, it removes excess heat, helping to moderate the temperature within the plant tissues. This is particularly important in maintaining optimal conditions for photosynthesis and overall plant health. In summary, through the process of transpiration, plants move enormous amounts of water from the soil to the atmosphere. This not only benefits the plants themselves but also plays a crucial role in maintaining the water cycle and supporting life in ecosystems across the globe."},{"instruction":"What is the answer to this question? where is the integration center located for most autonomic reflexes?","output":"The integration center for most autonomic reflexes is primarily located within the central nervous system, specifically in the brainstem and spinal cord. These structures are responsible for receiving, processing, and coordinating automatic or involuntary responses to stimuli. Within the brainstem, key components such as the medulla oblongata, pons, and midbrain play crucial roles in the regulation of autonomic reflexes. The medulla oblongata, in particular, is responsible for controlling various vital functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration. It also houses several important nuclei that regulate autonomic reflexes related to the cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems. The pons and midbrain contribute to the coordination and control of autonomic reflexes as well. The pons is involved in the regulation of respiratory rhythm, while the midbrain contains regions responsible for controlling eye movement and pupil size, which are also part of the autonomic nervous system. In the spinal cord, a series of sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic neurons are organized into segments called the lateral horn. These neurons receive input from various regions of the brain, such as the hypothalamus, and other sensory receptors throughout the body. They subsequently transmit this information to peripheral ganglia by releasing neurotransmitters, ultimately resulting in a coordinated autonomic response. In addition to the brainstem and spinal cord, other structures within the central nervous system are also involved in the regulation of autonomic reflexes. For instance, the hypothalamus is a critical component of the autonomic regulatory system. It maintains homeostasis by integrating sensory information and hormonal signaling to modulate autonomic activities. The hypothalamus regulates various physiological processes, such as body temperature, water balance, and food intake, by influencing both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Furthermore, regions of the limbic system, like the amygdala and hippocampus, play a role in regulating autonomic reflexes related to emotional processing and memory. For example, the amygdala is directly involved in the \\"fight or flight\\" response, which coordinates a range of autonomic and endocrine responses to perceived threats or stressors. In summary, the integration center for most autonomic reflexes is primarily located within the central nervous system, particularly in the brainstem and spinal cord. Other regions, such as the hypothalamus and limbic system, also contribute to the regulation of autonomic responses. Together, these structures work in concert to maintain the body's homeostasis and enable appropriate responses to various stimuli."},{"instruction":"Allan crouched over his desk once more, pen in hand and mind blank.

Can passengers rate Uber drivers if the driver cancels? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Pick from: [A]. no; [B]. yes;","output":"In order to answer the questions, I will first research the topics and provide well-reasoned responses to each question. 1. What is a good Uber driver rating? - To find this information, I will look into Uber's rating system and guidelines. 2. Can passengers rate Uber drivers if the driver cancels? - I will research Uber's policies on cancellations and their impact on driver ratings. Now, let's address each question individually. 1. A good Uber driver rating is usually around 4.7 or higher on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest score. This is because Uber considers a driver with an average rating below 4.6 to be at risk of deactivation. Therefore, a rating higher than 4.7 typically ensures that the driver is considered reliable and providing quality service. 2. Passengers usually cannot rate Uber drivers if the driver cancels the ride, as ratings are based on completed trips. However, frequent cancellations by a driver can negatively impact their overall standing with the Uber platform, and may lead to penalties or even deactivation. At this point, I have provided two separate answers to the given questions. Now I will determine if the questions are the same or not: Comparing the two questions, I can conclude that they are not the same.

Tito, a \\"coyote\\" (a person who helps smuggle people across the border) spends his days as a snake catcher but at night, helps smuggle immigrants across the border. After winning a fight in a local mechanic's garage, Hector tries to get another fight but the entertainment is interrupted by Tito who scolds both Hector and the owner due to the fact that Tito could get into more trouble for illegal gambling fights as if smuggling illegals across the border isn't enough. Corralled, Hector goes to change but is followed in by another illegal; Maria. It soon becomes known that they grew up together as kids and it also becomes apparent that Hector dislikes her (mostly because of her sarcastic teasing). Tito hands Hector medicine for his mother and the three head back to the farm where they all work. After settling all of the immigrants in, Maria goes into her own suite with Hector and makes herself at home despite Hector being less than welcoming. Hector then goes to his mother Rosa to give her the medicine but it becomes apparent that she is getting worse. Hector begs her to not go out to the fields the next day but she declines stating \\"No work, no pay\\". She scolds Hector for fighting to make money and reminds him that a fighter's lifestyle gave his father nothing. Maria walks in and gets reacquainted with Hector's mother who comments on how much she has grown and how beautiful she has gotten after nine years apart. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the character who scolds Hector for fighting?, what is it ?

Specifically, the primary causative agent of tuberculosis is the bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This genus, Mycobacterium, belongs to the phylum Actinobacteria and the family Mycobacteriaceae. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an aerobic, non-motile, acid-fast bacillus that is responsible for causing pulmonary as well as extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is a chronic, infectious disease that predominantly affects the lungs (pulmonary tuberculosis), but it can also affect other organs such as the lymph nodes, bones, joints, kidneys, and the central nervous system (extrapulmonary tuberculosis). The transmission of tuberculosis occurs mainly through the inhalation of airborne droplets containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which are released when an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings. After entering the respiratory tract, the bacteria are phagocytosed by macrophages and start to multiply within them. This triggers an immune response, leading to the formation of granulomas, which are clusters of immune cells that attempt to contain the infection. However, the bacteria can sometimes survive within the granulomas, resulting in latent tuberculosis infection. In some cases, the bacteria can reactivate and cause active tuberculosis, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Diagnosis of tuberculosis involves a variety of tests, including the tuberculin skin test, also known as the Mantoux test, blood tests like the interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA), and microbiological tests. Microbiological tests include sputum smear microscopy, sputum culture, and the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). Imaging studies such as chest X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans can also be helpful in diagnosing tuberculosis. The treatment of tuberculosis involves a combination of antibiotic drugs that target the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium. The first-line drugs include isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. These drugs are administered for a duration of six months to two years, depending on the severity and nature of the disease. In some cases, the bacterium can develop resistance to these first-line drugs, leading to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) or extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), which require different treatment regimens and second-line drugs. It is essential to complete the entire course of treatment to prevent drug resistance and relapse. Prevention strategies for tuberculosis include vaccination (using the Bacille Calmette-Guérin or BCG vaccine), prompt diagnosis and effective treatment of individuals with active tuberculosis, and screening and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection in high-risk populations. Additionally, public health measures such as proper ventilation in confined spaces, infection control practices in healthcare settings, and raising awareness about the disease can help reduce the spread of tuberculosis."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given a conversation between two people.

To determine if the statement is a verifiable fact, we must first understand the key terms and historical context of The Prague Spring. 2. The Prague Spring refers to a period of liberalization and political reform that took place in Czechoslovakia in 1968. During this time, Alexander Dubcek, the leader of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, attempted to implement various liberal reforms to the political, economic, and social systems in the country. 3. The Soviet Union was the leading communist power during this era, and its relationship with Czechoslovakia was essential to examine whether it encouraged The Prague Spring reforms or not. 4. Now that we have an understanding of the context, we need to look for historical sources and evidence to determine the Soviet Union's stance on The Prague Spring. 5. Upon conducting research, it is evident that although there might have been some initial openness to the Czechoslovakian reforms, the Soviet Union ultimately perceived The Prague Spring as a threat to its control over the Eastern Bloc and the stability of its communist system. This led the Soviet Union to intervene militarily in August 1968, ending The Prague Spring and forcibly reversing the reforms. 6. Given this historical evidence, it is inaccurate to claim that \\"The Soviet's proudly encouraged The Prague Spring reforms.\\" The statement is not a verifiable fact as the Soviet Union ultimately suppressed the movement instead of encouraging it.

Article: As a professor I have grown accustomed to the opinion regarding American education. We are repeatedly told that American schools are failing, that colleges are not teaching, and that the students of today are not as good as the students of the past. There are, of course, problems with the education system. Because of economic inequality some schools are significantly better than others and the ideas of equality of education and equality of opportunity are cruel jokes. However, the mere fact that there are some serious problems does not mean that all the _ claims are true. One stock claim is that America has fallen behind the world in education in terms of performance on various tests. While the fact that America is behind other countries is a point of concern, there are at least three points worth considering here. The first is the above-mentioned economic inequality which will tend to result in poorer performance when taking the average for America. The second is that many countries have put considerable effort into improving their education systems and hence it is worth considering that America's decline is also due to the improvement of others. The third is the matter of the measures-- do they, in fact, present an accurate picture of the situation? I am not claiming that the data is bad. I am merely raising a reasonable concern about how accurate our picture of education is at this time. Another stock claim is that American students are doing badly on standardized tests. While there is clearly value in assessment, it is reasonable to consider whether or not such tests are a proper and adequate measure of education. It is also worth considering whether the puzzle with these tests is itself causing damage to education. That is, as teachers teach for the test and students learn for the test, it might be the case that what is being taught is not what should be taught and what is being learned is not what should be learned.

Since Cameron is waiting at a restaurant, most likely for a chance to secure a table and enjoy a meal, one can assume that they might be feeling hungry at the moment. However, it is only a snapshot of their current state or condition, and not an all-encompassing description of their entire character or essence. To better describe Cameron, you could include other aspects of their personality, appearance, or mannerisms. For example, the fact that they are waiting in a crowded lobby suggests that they might be courteous and respectful of social norms, rather than someone who might attempt to skip the line or make a fuss at the restaurant. Additionally, it is mentioned that they are \\"quietly waiting,\\" which could be indicative of patience or a calm demeanor. Overall, while \\"hungry\\" may be a valid adjective to describe Cameron's current state in this scenario, it is important to consider other factors and traits when trying to paint a holistic picture of their character."},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"Context: With the global climate crisis worsening, there's an increasing need for the development and adoption of cleaner and more sustainable energy sources as an alternative to fossil fuels. One of the most promising sources of renewable energy is solar power, which is abundant and essentially inexhaustible. However, the widespread adoption of solar power faces several challenges, such as the high initial cost of installation and the intermittency of solar energy generation due to weather patterns and the day-night cycle. Hypothesis: If innovative solar energy technologies and financial incentives are developed and implemented, the widespread adoption of solar power as a primary source of energy will become economically viable and significantly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. This hypothesis can be tested by examining the various factors that contribute to the adoption of solar power and its potential impact on the environment. Some factors to consider include: 1. Technological advancements in solar energy: Improvements in solar panel efficiency, energy storage solutions (e.g., battery technology), and smart grid integration can contribute to making solar power a more viable option for mass adoption. Efficient and affordable solar panels could drive down the cost of installation, making this renewable energy source more attractive to both individuals and businesses. Additionally, effective energy storage solutions would allow for the continuous use of solar power even during periods of low solar radiation, such as nighttime or cloudy weather. 2. Financial incentives and government support: Government initiatives, such as subsidies, tax credits, and feed-in tariffs, can help offset the initial investment costs of solar power installations and make it more competitive with traditional energy sources. By providing economic incentives, governments can promote the growth of the solar industry and encourage private investment in research and development of solar technology. A successful example of this approach is Germany's incentivization of solar power, which has resulted in the country being a global leader in renewable energy adoption. 3. Environmental impacts: A large-scale adoption of solar power would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuel-based energy sources. To quantify the potential environmental benefits of solar power adoption, researchers can study historical data on how the increase in solar power installations has corresponded with reductions in carbon emissions, and use this information to estimate the potential impact of future solar adoption. 4. Public awareness and education: Raising awareness of the benefits of solar power and providing educational resources on the technology and its applications can help drive the demand for clean energy. Public awareness campaigns, workshops, and school programs can be used to promote the advantages of solar energy and address misconceptions that may hinder its adoption. 5. Collaboration between diverse stakeholders: Cooperation between governments, private sector companies, research institutions, and non-governmental organizations can help support the development and implementation of solar energy technologies and policies. Partnerships and collaborations can facilitate the exchange of knowledge, resources, and expertise, leading to more effective and efficient solutions. In conclusion, the hypothesis that innovative solar energy technologies and financial incentives can lead to the widespread adoption of solar power and a reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions can be tested by examining factors such as technological advancements, government support, environmental impacts, public awareness, and collaboration between stakeholders. By understanding these factors and their relationships, researchers can work towards designing effective strategies and policies that promote solar energy adoption and contribute to mitigating the effects of climate change."},{"instruction":"Please add punctuation to this: On the photo lawn Champion T336","output":"On the photo, Lawn Champion T336."},{"instruction":"Question: Where is Billy Butlin the holiday camp king buried Answer:","output":"Billy Butlin, born Sir William Heygate Edmund Colborne Butlin, was a British entrepreneur best known for founding the Butlin's chain of holiday camps.

Hindu philosophy is an extensive and diverse system of thought that has evolved over thousands of years, encompassing a wide range of interrelated beliefs and practices. Some of the key concepts that form the foundation of Hindu philosophy include Dharma, Karma, Samsara, Moksha, Atman, and Brahman. These concepts not only shape the way Hindus perceive the nature of reality, but also strongly influence their ethical and moral beliefs and practices. 1. Dharma: Dharma is a multifaceted concept in Hinduism, encompassing duty, morality, law, and order. It refers to the proper conduct and ethical responsibilities that an individual must follow in order to maintain balance and harmony in the universe. Dharma is influenced by various factors such as one's age, gender, caste, profession, and personal inclinations. Adherence to one's dharma promotes spiritual growth, while failure to follow it results in negative consequences both in this life and future lives. 2. Karma: Karma is a fundamental principle that governs the cause and effect of actions in Hinduism. It asserts that every action performed by an individual, whether physical, mental, or verbal, generates consequences that will manifest either in the present life or future lives. The principle of 'as you sow, so shall you reap' underlies the concept of Karma, which promotes moral and ethical behavior, as individuals are encouraged to act with kindness and compassion to avoid negative karmic consequences. 3. Samsara: Samsara is the concept of the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth that all beings are subject to. The ultimate goal of human life in Hinduism is to break free from this cycle and attain Moksha or liberation. Samsara serves as a motivating factor for individuals to cultivate ethical and moral values, as one's actions and spiritual development in the present life determine the quality of the next life. 4. Moksha: Moksha is the ultimate spiritual goal of Hinduism, referring to the liberation from the cycle of Samsara. Achieving Moksha entails the realization that the individual self, or Atman, is ultimately identical with the divine essence, Brahman. Adhering to moral and ethical principles, cultivating spiritual knowledge, and engaging in disciplines like meditation and yoga are some of the pathways toward Moksha. 5. Atman: Atman is the individual self, or soul, which is considered eternal, unchanging, and divine in nature. The experience of Atman is central to the understanding of the nature of reality and the ultimate goal of Moksha. The interconnectedness of all beings through their shared divine essence promotes values such as compassion, empathy, and nonviolence in Hindu ethics. 6. Brahman: Brahman refers to the supreme, absolute reality that underlies and pervades all of existence. Hindus believe that all beings and objects are manifestations of this singular divine reality, which is ultimately ineffable and beyond human comprehension. The understanding of the interconnectedness and unity of all beings within Brahman encourages ethical principles like harmony, compassion, and respect for all life. The intricate interplay of these key concepts shapes the ethical and moral beliefs in Hinduism. By understanding the connected nature of reality and recognizing the impact of one's actions on oneself and others, Hindus are encouraged to cultivate ethical and moral values that promote spiritual growth, compassion, and harmony with the world around them."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts.

A key aspect of this structure is the caste system, which assigns individuals to specific social positions based on their birth and family background. While the caste system has undergone changes throughout history, the traditional model consists of four main social positions, also known as \\"varnas.\\" These four varnas are: 1. Brahmins: The Brahmins are the highest-ranking varna in the caste system and traditionally comprise of priests, scholars, and teachers. They are considered the custodians of sacred knowledge, responsible for preserving and disseminating religious texts, rituals, and teachings. Consequently, they play a pivotal role in spiritual guidance and the performance of religious ceremonies. As a result of their deep-rooted wisdom and moral authority, Brahmins generally command a high degree of respect in Hindu society. 2. Kshatriyas: The Kshatriyas constitute the warrior and ruling class in Hinduism. They are responsible for maintaining law and order, ensuring the protection of the people, and governing the territories. Kshatriyas have historically held the role of kings, rulers, military leaders, and administrators, charged with upholding justice and defending their lands from external threats. Upholding a strict code of conduct known as \\"Kshatriya Dharma,\\" they are expected to exhibit qualities such as courage, valor, and strong leadership. 3. Vaishyas: The Vaishya varna represents the trading and business community in Hindu society. They are engaged in commerce, agriculture, and other economic activities, contributing essentially to the wealth and prosperity of society. Historically, Vaishyas were responsible for generating income, managing the distribution of resources, and ensuring that all members of the community could make a living. As traders and merchants, they are expected to be shrewd and fair-minded in their transactions, valuing honesty and the spirit of enterprise. 4. Shudras: The Shudra varna denotes the serving and laboring class in Hindu society. They are responsible for performing menial and manual tasks that underpin the functioning of the other classes. Historically, Shudras provided essential services, such as craftsmanship, sanitation, and agricultural support, which enabled the smooth functioning of the social order. Although they were traditionally perceived as inferior to the other varnas, their roles were indispensable in maintaining the stability of society as a whole. Despite its historic prevalence, the caste system and discrimination based on social position have been legally abolished in India due to their inherently unequal and oppressive nature. However, the remnants of these social hierarchies continue to persist in some areas, influencing cultural practices and social interactions. It is crucial to acknowledge and challenge the inequalities and prejudices stemming from the caste system to work towards a more inclusive and egalitarian society that values people based on their individual qualities and merits, rather than their birth and social position."},{"instruction":"SENTENCE: she took one glance at it , then dropped it . for a woman who had raised three juvenile delinquents , a surprise like this only meant trouble . \`\` a dollar-twenty , '' she said , punching buttons and glancing down the counter to see if anyone was watching . \`\` i have nothing but good news for you , '' sandy said , reaching for the","output":"receipt. \\"Your total comes to a dollar and twenty cents,\\" she reiterated, maintaining a neutral expression, attempting to not draw too much attention to the situation. As the woman gathered the necessary change from her purse, Sandy couldn't help but feel a slight unease creeping up her spine. Raising three juvenile delinquents had sharpened her instincts like a well-honed blade, and she knew all too well that surprises like this rarely ended without some degree of trouble. As the woman handed over the money, Sandy could see the nervousness playing out in her eyes. The truth was, she had been in situations like this before - situations where the unexpected often led to undesirable consequences for herself and those around her. She knew that the only way to minimize the fallout was to stay level-headed and focus on the task at hand. \\"Here's your change,\\" Sandy said as she returned the leftover coins back to the woman. \\"Thank you for your business, and have a wonderful day.\\" She forced a smile, but behind her friendly demeanor, her mind was racing, trying to decipher the hidden meaning behind the woman's sudden appearance. Once the woman left the counter, Sandy kept her eyes trained on her as she exited the establishment. As much as she wanted to put this strange encounter behind her, she couldn't shake the feeling that something more significant was about to unfold. Determined to get to the bottom of it, Sandy decided to take matters into her own hands. After her shift ended, she slipped out of her work uniform and into her casual clothes, taking care to maintain a low profile as she began her investigation. Her first stop was to retrace the woman's steps, hoping to find some clue that would lead her to the origin of the surprise. Following the path, she eventually stumbled upon a group of individuals congregating in a deserted alleyway. Sandy could sense that the air was thick with tension as she overheard snippets of conversation, each word laced with urgency and undertones of danger. Keeping her distance, she listened intently, trying to piece together the puzzle before her. It wasn't long before she learned that the woman was involved in an elaborate scheme, and the item dropped on the counter was a vital piece in helping the group achieve their ultimate goal. However, Sandy knew that intervening at this point would only put her and her family in danger. Wrestling with the moral dilemma, she ultimately decided that her first priority was to ensure the safety of her loved ones. Reluctantly, she withdrew from the alleyway, vowing to never involve herself in such precarious situations again. Despite her decision, the events of that fateful day stayed with her, serving as a constant reminder of how easily the line between good and evil could blur. As she moved forward with her life, she began to take an active role in her community, guiding the youth down the right path and preventing them from falling into the same pitfalls her own children had encountered. Years later, Sandy looked back on that day with mixed emotions, proud of her resilience in the face of danger but saddened by the memory of a moment that had changed the course of her life. Through it all, however, she knew one thing to be true: the importance of resilience and determination, which had allowed her to rise above adversity and mold the world around her for the better."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

(a). wear reading glasses while it is sunny outside.; (b). wear sunglasses while it is sunny outside.;","output":"To accomplish the goal of protecting your eyes from sun damage, it is essential to understand the risks associated with prolonged exposure to sunlight and the possible harmful effects on your eyes. Ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun can damage the eye's cornea, lens, and other delicate structures, potentially leading to cataracts, macular degeneration, and even skin cancer around the eyes. In order to effectively protect your eyes from sun damage, consider the following options: (a) Wearing reading glasses while it is sunny outside may not be the most effective option. Typically, reading glasses only have a corrective purpose, designed to help individuals with presbyopia (age-related difficulty focusing on near objects) see more clearly. Most reading glasses do not have UV protection or polarization, making them less suitable for sun protection. (b) Wearing sunglasses while it is sunny outside is a much better option for protecting your eyes from sun damage. Here are some key features to look for when choosing the right sunglasses: 1. UV protection: Make sure the sunglasses you choose block 100% of both UVA and UVB rays. This is essential to shield your eyes from the damaging effects of the sun. Look for a label that states the sunglasses provide 100% UV protection or UV400 protection. 2. Polarization: While not necessary for UV protection, polarized lenses can help reduce glare caused by the sun's reflection on surfaces, making it more comfortable for your eyes. This is especially helpful when driving or participating in outdoor activities near water or snow. 3. Lens Color: The color of the lenses can impact your visual experience. Gray lenses are popular for maintaining true color perception while reducing brightness and glare. Brown and amber lenses can enhance contrast, which may be beneficial for sports activities. Green lenses can also help with contrast while maintaining color accuracy. 4. Frame design: Look for sunglasses with a wraparound frame or large lenses that provide more coverage for your eyes, as well as the skin around them. This can help prevent sunlight from entering the sides of your sunglasses, offering additional protection. 5. Fit and comfort: Choose sunglasses that fit comfortably and securely on your face, ensuring they won’t slip off during outdoor activities. This is important not only for your comfort but also to ensure proper eye protection. 6. Quality: Invest in a pair of sunglasses from a reputable manufacturer to ensure the lenses and frames are of high quality. Doing so can help guarantee that your sunglasses provide consistent UV protection and durability. In summary, wearing sunglasses with 100% UVA and UVB protection, proper lens color, and a comfortable, secure fit is the most effective way to protect your eyes from sun damage. Reading glasses, unless specifically designed for sun protection, are not the best choice for this particular goal."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

The car didn't go fast, but they ran, so this was better than nothing. However, in the future, we can't cut down all our trees to make gas; we need our trees for other things, too. Besides different types of gas, we can also use electricity to run our cars, but first we must make the electricity! Some countries have coal and they make electricity with that, but we might not always have coal, either. Other countries have big, strong rivers, and they can use the power of water to turn turbines and make electricity more easily and cheaply. We are also able to get power from the ocean tides. We put turbines into the mouth of the river. Then the tide comes in, the water turns the turbines and then it goes out, it turns them again. Which of these ways will be used to run our cars in the future? Question: How many ways are suggested to make electricity in the passage? Answer: Choose your answer from: [a]. 2.. [b]. 5.. [c]. 4..

The weather centre categorises warnings as red, meaning 'take action', orange, meaning 'be prepared' or yellow, meaning 'be aware'. Pranksters poked fun after the BBC reported a warning this morning under the headline: 'Yellow snow warning for Wales'. Scroll down for video. A 'yellow warning' of snow over Wales and central England was later expanded to include most of Scotland. A BBC story was shared more than 1,000 times on Twitter as users of the website poked fun at the headline.

What are some features for NLP classifiers that can be used to differentiate between people who have psychosis and those who don't have it? What are some features for NLP classifiers that can be used to differentiate between people who have bipolar and those who don't have it?","output":"While both questions relate to the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) classifiers to differentiate between two groups of people, they focus on different mental health conditions. The first question seeks to identify features that can distinguish between individuals with psychosis and those without it. In contrast, the second question aims to find features that differentiate between individuals with bipolar disorder and those without it. Although both disorders involve alterations in thoughts and behaviors, they have distinct characteristics and manifestations. Consequently, the features used for NLP classifiers in each case may differ as well. For clarity, let's take a closer look at each question and explore the potential NLP classifier features specific to each condition. 1. What are some features for NLP classifiers that can be used to differentiate between people who have psychosis and those who don't have it? Psychosis is a mental health condition characterized by a disrupted connection to reality, manifesting in delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thinking. In using NLP classifiers, relevant linguistic features could include: a) Lexical features: - High usage of words associated with paranoia, delusions, or hallucinations (e.g., \\"hearing voices,\\" \\"being watched\\"). - Increased use of pronouns and a decrease in the use of concrete nouns. - Unconventional or idiosyncratic vocabulary. b) Syntactic features: - Disorganized sentence structures that might be more challenging to understand. - Frequent usage of incomplete sentences or phrases. - Language may exhibit a \\"word salad\\" pattern with disordered syntactic constructions. c) Semantic features: - Difficulty in maintaining a coherent or consistent train of thought. - Incoherent or tangential speech patterns. - Frequent shifts in topics, often without a clear connection between them. d) Pragmatic features: - Difficulty in understanding and conveying abstract or metaphorical language. - A tendency to be overly literal in interpreting language. - Lack of awareness regarding conversational norms and etiquette (e.g., interrupting, not taking turns). 2. What are some features for NLP classifiers that can be used to differentiate between people who have bipolar and those who don't have it? Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by drastic mood swings, including periods of mania or hypomania and depression. NLP classifier features related to bipolar disorder could include: a) Lexical features: - High usage of emotionally charged words, which might vary between extremely positive (during mania) and negative (during depression). - Increased use of words related to mood, energy levels, and internal experiences (e.g., \\"elated,\\" \\"exhausted\\"). b) Syntactic features: - Increased verbosity and complex sentence structure during manic phases. - Reduced complexity and sentence length during depressive episodes. c) Semantic features: - Rapid shifts in topic during manic phases, which may reflect racing thoughts or distractibility. - Limited topic diversity and focus on negative themes during depressive episodes. d) Pragmatic features: - Difficulty in adhering to conversational norms, such as interrupting or monopolizing conversations during manic phases. - Decreased engagement in conversation and shorter response times during depressive episodes. In summary, while both questions deal with NLP classifiers in the context of mental health, they target distinct disorders with unique characteristics. The features in each case will likely differ as they pertain to the linguistic and behavioral patterns specific to each condition - psychosis and bipolar disorder."},{"instruction":"Make: Porsche Model: 928 Price: Price on request Translate to Russian Russian:","output":"In order to complete this translation task, I will follow the following steps: 1.

So, we can combine them: 0 = (13864*p - 13807*p) - 741 Which simplifies to: 0 = 57*p - 741 Now, we need to isolate the variable 'p' on one side of the equation. We can do that by adding 741 to both sides: 0 + 741 = 57*p - 741 + 741 Which gives us: 741 = 57*p Now, we need to solve for 'p' by dividing both sides of the equation by 57: 741 / 57 = 57*p / 57 The result will be: 13 = p So, the solution to the equation 0 = -13807*p + 13864*p - 741 is p = 13."},{"instruction":"URL de cette page: http://www.ec.gc.ca/contracts-contrats/default.asp?lang=Fr&id=6E296978%09&contrdate=2005-12-21&n=168B9233-11%09&state=details&quarter=3&contractid=9ADBC462&fiscal=2005,%202006&accessible=off Translate this to English?","output":"URL of this page: http://www.ec.gc.ca/contracts-contrats/default.asp?lang=Fr&id=6E296978%09&contrdate=2005-12-21&n=168B9233-11%09&state=details&quarter=3&contractid=9ADBC462&fiscal=2005,%202006&accessible=off Translation to English: URL of this page: http://www.ec.gc.ca/contracts-contrats/default.asp?lang=En&id=6E296978%09&contrdate=2005-12-21&n=168B9233-11%09&state=details&quarter=3&contractid=9ADBC462&fiscal=2005,%202006&accessible=off Please note that the only change made in the URL is the language parameter, from \\"lang=Fr\\" to \\"lang=En\\", which switches the language from French to English.

This tragic event highlights the unstable situation in Kabul, and the ongoing conflict between the Afghan government, Western forces, and insurgent groups such as the Taliban. The December 2009 attack occurred in a neighborhood previously thought to be secure, demonstrating the unpredictable nature of violence in war-torn areas. The suicide car bombing took place near the former Afghan vice president's home, adding a political dimension to the attack. It is likely that the perpetrator, or the group they were affiliated with, intended to send a message to the government and other power structures in Kabul. The fact that the attack also impacted a hotel frequented by Westerners highlights the continued threat to foreign nationals in the region, which further complicates international efforts to assist and stabilize the country. As the attack was carried out by a suicide car bomber, this indicates a level of organization and commitment on the part of the perpetrator or their support network. Such methods are typically used as a way to maximize damage and casualties and are difficult to predict or prevent. The aftermath of the attack saw eight people killed and nearly 40 wounded, illustrating the human cost of such acts of terror. Neighborhoods that were once considered safe become sites of fear and insecurity, and the lives of innocent civilians are forever changed. In a city like Kabul, where international diplomatic efforts and peacekeeping missions take place, the potential for violence to escalate or derail important work is always present. The December 2009 suicide car bombing is just one example of the ongoing challenges faced by the Afghan government, international forces, and NGOs working in the region. The security situation in Kabul, and throughout Afghanistan, is complex and fraught with danger. Addressing the root causes of this instability – ineffective governance, corruption, lack of economic opportunity, and the allure of extremist ideologies – will require comprehensive, long-term strategies that promote peace and development in the country."},{"instruction":"Q:Dialogue: W: Robbie, this new walkman is really wonderful.

According to Sun Landong,a meteorologist with the Lanzhou Meteorology Observatory,visibility was less than 100 meters in Minqin, a Gansu county near Inner Mongolia,because of sand. When visibility drops to less than 1 kilometer, it is called a sandstorm. The sandstorm in Minqin blew up dust in neighboring towns, such as Baiyin,Wuwei,Jinchang and Lanzhou,the capital city of Gansu Province Dust-laden winds also swept into Beijing. Brought by northwesterly blowing at more than 20 meters per second, dust first reached the capital's suburbs at 7 a. m.,downtown areas at 9 a. m. The winds,which died down during the night,brought the temperature down to as low as 8 0C below zero and many flights put off their planned time from the city's airport. It is quite rare for sandstorms,which are frequent between March and June,to happen in winter,when the earth is frozen. The sandstorms in Gansu and Inner Mongolia do not necessarily mean there will be more of them in the spring than last year,when they were serious,but Beijing is taking it very seriously. It is reported that Beijing will spend 6 billion yuan( US 725 million) in preventing sandstorms in the capital and has already set up a special team to make sure what causes them.

This sentence is in French, which is a Romance language that descends from the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire. It is one of the world's major languages spoken by millions of people in countries such as France, Belgium, Switzerland, Canada, and many African countries. French is known for its elegant phrasing and soft sounds, making it a popular choice for diplomatic relations and cultural studies. In addition, it is also one of the six official languages of the United Nations. In this sentence, \\"La jeune fille\\" refers to the young girl, \\"marche\\" means walks, \\"avec\\" is the preposition for \\"with,\\" \\"son chien\\" signifies her dog, \\"au parc\\" translates to \\"in the park,\\" \\"pendant\\" functions as a connector for \\"during,\\" \\"une belle journée\\" alludes to a beautiful day, and \\"ensoleillée\\" means sunny. Altogether, the sentence conveys the idea of a young girl spending a pleasant day outdoors walking with her dog, painting a vivid and serene image for the reader. The French language, like many other Romance languages, follows specific grammatical rules and structures that might differ from those in the English language. For instance, French adjectives usually come after the noun, as seen in \\"une belle journée ensoleillée\\" (a beautiful sunny day) where \\"belle\\" (beautiful) and \\"ensoleillée\\" (sunny) are placed after \\"journée\\" (day). Another noteworthy feature is the gender agreement – every noun in French is either masculine or feminine, and the accompanying articles, adjectives, and pronouns need to agree on the gender. In this sentence, both \\"jeune fille\\" (young girl) and \\"chien\\" (dog) are feminine and masculine nouns, respectively, and therefore require the respective articles \\"la\\" and \\"son.\\" In conclusion, the sentence provided is an example of a well-constructed phrase in French, illustrating the language's unique grammatical rules and word order. It offers a sneak peek into the elegant and rich linguistic features of the French language and serves as a reminder of the cultural and linguistic diversity within our global community."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you need to output 'Yes' if the given number is a prime number otherwise output 'No'.

Images of tabloid headlines inform viewers of the source of Monika's knowledge of Rob and his activities.[5] Meanwhile, Mark (Mark Reeder) heads to his as-yet-unspecified job, and the film then cuts back to a scene of Monika undressing Rob. Mark's job is thereupon revealed to be dubbing porn films, and this scene foreshadows the next, in which Monika has sex with Rob's corpse. Betty (Beatrice Manowski), Rob's ex-girlfriend from the previous film, is then briefly introduced as she discovers, to her disappointment, that Rob's grave has already been robbed. Monika fails to have an orgasm and the sex scene ends with her running to the bathroom. She is disgusted, and about to vomit. The implication is that \\"the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak\\".[5] Once Monika has cleaned Rob's corpse, she takes photos with him using her camera's self-timer. She is seen cuddling the corpse in the photos.[5] Mark, meanwhile, makes plans to meet a friend (Simone SpÃ¶rl) at the movie theater. Mark's friend, however, is late, and Mark offers his ticket instead to Monika, a stranger who happens to be passing by.[5] Monika and Mark hit it off and soon go on a carnival date, after which point Monika decides to break up with Rob. She is apparently attempting to live a normal life with a real boyfriend.[5] She tearfully saws the corpse of Rob into pieces and putting them into garbage bags, saving just his head and genitals.

The term \\"Epipaleolithic\\" is often used for areas outside northern Europe, but was also the preferred synonym used by French archaeologists until the 1960s. - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around . - Yorkshire (or ; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county of Northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom. Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire. - In geography, latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the northsouth position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run eastwest as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. Approximations employed. Two levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of these coordinates. In the first step the physical surface is modelled by the geoid, a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere, but the geoid is more accurately modelled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the \\"actual\\" surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard. - Kirkbymoorside is a small market town and civil parish in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire, England, about north of York, midway between Pickering and Helmsley, on the edge of the North York Moors National Park.

In the narrowest sense of the word it consists of a flat plate (the \\"dial\\") and a \\"gnomon\\" which casts a shadow onto the dial. As the sun appears to move across the sky, the shadow aligns with different \\"hour-lines\\" which are marked on the dial to indicate the time of day. The \\"style\\" is the time-telling edge of the gnomon, though a single point or \\"nodus\\" may be used. The gnomon casts a broad shadow; the shadow of the style shows the time. The gnomon may be a rod, a wire or an elaborately decorated metal casting. The style must be parallel to the axis of the Earth's rotation for the sundial to be accurate throughout the year.

Mr. Lynch, 47, sits on the boards of the British Broadcasting Corporation and the British Library, and was awarded an Order of the British Empire for his service to business. Before Hewlett-Packard bought Autonomy, it was listed on Britain’s major stock index. Its prominence allowed it to hire top engineers, who were worked remorselessly hard compared with their Silicon Valley counterparts, former employees say. People who have worked with Mr. Lynch note both his accomplishments and his temper. “I don’t think I’ve ever called anyone an idiot in the office, but I’m direct,” he said. “That’s part of getting stuff done. I find good people and I value them. That is how I’ve been able to do what I’ve done.” While Autonomy is not well known in the United States, it was considered a pioneer in the booming field of Big Data, and its pattern-seeking algorithms are at work at over 400 companies, including Oracle, Adobe, Cisco and, even before the purchase, Hewlett-Packard. Mr. Lynch personally made about 800 million from the sale to H.P. Even with all of his money, intellect and a doctorate from Cambridge, what Mr. Lynch says he cannot figure out is how H.P. thinks he has done anything wrong. Hewlett-Packard has said that its internal investigation, set off by a whistle-blower, uncovered major problems at Autonomy that were present before the merger. Among them were the booking of hardware sales as higher-margin software sales, and resellers reporting sales that did not exist. Mr. Lynch said Autonomy’s sales fell off a cliff after it merged with Hewlett-Packard — not because it suddenly had to account for things legally, as H.P. claims, but because of institutional foot-dragging. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “They drove out the top 100 people from Autonomy, and a bunch of trainees were put in” to sell Autonomy products, he said. “H.P. salesmen got better commissions for selling our competitors’ products.” Mr. Lynch said H.P. told him it could not formally approve Autonomy’s software for use on its customers’ servers, “when it was already running on thousands of H.P. machines around the world.” He added: “H.P. has core structural problems.” Photo Hewlett-Packard counters that Mr. Lynch was a singular force of resistance to the merger as soon as his check cleared. “He was at every strategy session, was in person or on video for every meeting of the executive council,” said an H.P. executive briefed on the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record. “He wouldn’t work with anyone. Sometimes he was enthusiastic, but other times he’d say, ‘This makes no sense. I’m going back to London.’ ” On at least two different cross-country flights on an H.P. private jet, the executive said, Mr. Lynch went to the back of the aircraft and refused to talk with anyone for the entire flight.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Lynch, Vanessa Colomar, said he had not been on the corporate jet before and “didn’t know the etiquette.” She said he spent the time working. As for the charge that Hewlett-Packard did not personally contact Mr. Lynch before announcing the write-down, Ms. Whitman said in an interview on Tuesday, “Mike Lynch is aware we have questions.” The conversation in June with Mr. Lynch concerned several specific software sales by Autonomy, the H.P. executive said. “He was evasive, not forthcoming, or he didn’t remember,” the executive said. “After something like that, you don’t bother telling him what you are investigating.” Mr. Lynch said the conversation was supposed to be about his severance, but quickly became an “ambush.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hewlett-Packard has said that it contacted both the Securities and Exchange Commission and Britain’s Serious Fraud Office about Autonomy’s accounting. Mr. Lynch said he had heard from neither organization. The pattern of dysfunction at Autonomy that each side says the other fostered illustrates how hard it is for any two companies to fully understand each other before merging. It also calls into question whether what remains of Autonomy, a core element of Hewlett-Packard’s plan for recovery, will quickly or easily deliver meaningful results. Then there are the questions about how Autonomy’s accountants, plus more than a dozen other highly regarded law, banking and accounting firms that received millions for working on the company’s sale, could have missed the problems. Deloitte, Autonomy’s regular auditor, reviewed Autonomy’s books on a quarterly basis, Mr. Lynch said, and was given invoices for every transaction over 100,000, plus those for a random batch of smaller deals. Nigel Mercer, the Deloitte executive whose name appears on Autonomy’s last annual report before the deal, did not return a call requesting comment. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Deloitte denied any knowledge of improprieties. Howard Clabo, a spokesman for Hewlett-Packard, said that “when a group of people willfully distort the truth in their financial results, it can be very difficult to detect.” At the same time, he said, H.P. is “committed to vigorously pursuing all legal options that are in the best interests of H.P. and our shareholders.” Mr. Lynch sees another possible motive in Ms. Whitman’s huge write-down, which sent H.P.’s stock to a level it briefly touched 10 years ago: “There is an attempt to set the bar so low that you can’t possibly fail.” Mr. Clabo dismissed this idea. “H.P.’s leadership is committed to providing our investors, employees and customers with a transparent view of the challenges the company faces,” he said. “It is absurd to suggest that H.P. would take an 8.8 billion impairment charge for any other reason.” If Mr. Lynch is correct, then H.P.’s stock may be a huge bargain. But he isn’t buying. “They have no strategy and vision,” he said. “This was about fighting among divisions.” ||||| Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) was sued by an investor over an 8.8 billion writedown that the company said was partly related to falsified finances at Autonomy Corp., the British software maker it bought last year. The shareholder, in a complaint filed yesterday federal court in San Francisco, alleges that Hewlett-Packard issued false and misleading statements. The company concealed that it had gained control of Autonomy based on financial statements that were unreliable because of accounting manipulation, according to the complaint. Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman and the company’s former CEO, Leo Apotheker, are named as defendants, along with Chief Financial Officer Catherine Lesjak. “At the time Hewlett-Packard agreed in principle to acquire Autonomy, defendants were looking to unwind the deal in light of the accounting irregularities that plagued Autonomy’s financial statements,” according to the complaint. Hewlett-Packard said Nov. 20 that 5 billion of the total charge is due to accounting practices, which were disclosed by a senior executive at Autonomy. Hewlett-Packard said it referred the matter to U.S. and U.K. securities regulators and will also pursue civil litigation. Financial Performance Hewlett-Packard said in a statement last week that some former members of Autonomy’s management team used accounting misrepresentations to inflate its underlying financial performance before the acquisition. Mike Lynch, who founded Autonomy, defended the company’s accounting practices in an interview last week. The complaint filed yesterday seeks class-action status and unspecified damages for all investors who bought company shares from Aug. 19, 2011, to Nov. 20, 2012. Michael Thacker, a spokesman for Palo Alto, California- based Hewlett-Packard, declined to comment on the complaint. The suit also names as a defendant Hewlett-Packard Senior Vice President James T. Murrin. As the company’s chief accounting officer during the period at issue, Murrin sold 132,500 shares for almost 3.5 million while “in the possession of materially adverse and non-public information,” according to the complaint. Negative Trends Hewlett-Packard is accused in the complaint of concealing negative business trends concerning the profit margins of its enterprise services business, formerly known as Electronic Data Systems Corp., which Hewlett-Packard acquired in 2008 for 13.2 billion under then-Chief Executive Officer Mark Hurd. As a result of the misleading statements, Hewlett-Packard’s stock traded at artificially inflated prices, according to the complaint. Apotheker, while he was CEO, agreed in November 2011 to buy Autonomy for 10.3 billion to diversify away from hardware and expand into cloud-computing and add software that searches a broad range of data, including e-mails, music, videos and posts on social networks such as Facebook Inc. Apotheker left in 2011 after less than a year on the job following repeated strategy shifts and forecast cuts. The writedown is another blow for the company, which is already suffering from management turmoil and slowdowns in its personal-computer, printer and technology-services businesses. Hewlett-Packard rose 2.4 percent to close yesterday at 12.74 in New York trading. The case is Nicolow v.

Answer:","output":"Roger Moore lived in various places throughout his life, including London, England, Monaco, and Switzerland."},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"Context: In recent years, online education has become increasingly popular, providing students with more flexibility and convenience in accessing educational opportunities. Millions of people around the world have enrolled in online courses and programs, ranging from casual learners pursuing personal interests to professionals seeking career advancement. However, despite its popularity, there are concerns about the effectiveness of online education compared to traditional, in-person learning. Hypothesis: The participation in online education programs leads to similar or better learning outcomes compared to traditional, in-person education, resulting from a variety of factors such as the convenience and accessibility of online resources, personalized learning opportunities, and improved communication with instructors and peers. To support this hypothesis, the following points can be considered: 1. Accessibility and convenience: Online education allows students to access educational materials from anywhere, at any time, making it particularly beneficial for learners who have geographical limitations or need flexibility in their study schedules. As a result, this increased accessibility could lead to a higher level of engagement and, ultimately, improved learning outcomes. 2. Personalized learning opportunities: Unlike traditional classrooms, where the teaching method is often one-size-fits-all, online platforms often provide a range of learning tools and resources that allow students to learn at their own pace and according to their preferred learning style. These personalized learning opportunities cater to various learning needs, helping students overcome barriers to understanding and achieve better learning outcomes. 3. Improved communication with instructors and peers: Online education platforms often facilitate communication through discussion boards, video conferencing, and other tools, enabling students to receive quick feedback and engage in collaborative learning. This ongoing interaction could lead to a strong sense of community, enhancing motivation and promoting better learning outcomes. 4. Access to diverse resources and experts: Online education often connects students with a wide range of educational materials and subject matter experts from around the world. This exposure to diverse perspectives and expertise can enrich the learning experience and encourage critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity, potentially leading to better learning outcomes. While there is still ongoing debate about the long-term efficacy of online education compared to traditional in-person learning, the hypothesis outlined above suggests that there are multiple factors that can lead to successful learning outcomes for students enrolled in online programs. Further research into the benefits and drawbacks of both online and traditional education would be essential to draw conclusive findings and establish best practices to maximize learning outcomes for all students."},{"instruction":"Not memorable.

They loved each other, but they didn't seem to like each other very much. Dad was too fond of his beer, and he talked down to Mom a lot. When she tried to stand up to him, a fight would unavoidably follow. It was my dad's disease that began to change things. The year 1998 was the beginning of a remarkable transformation for my family. My father, Jim Dineen, the always healthy, weightlifting, never-missed-a-day-of-work kind of dad, discovered he had kidney disease. The decision to go ahead with a transplant for my father was a long and tough one, mostly because he had liver damage too. One physician's assistant told him, \\"According to your file, you're supposed to be dead.\\" And for a while, doctors mistakenly thought that he would need not just a kidney transplant, but a liver transplant too. _ When the donor testing process finally began in the spring of 2003, numerous people, including me, my uncle Tom, and my mom, came back as matches of varying degree. But Mom was the one who insisted on going further. She decided to donate a kidney to my father. She said she was not scared, and it was the right thing to do. We all stepped back in amazement. At last a date was chosen - November 11, 2003. All of a sudden, the only thing that seemed to matter Dad was telling the world what a wonderful thing Mom was doing for him. A month before the surgery, he sent her birthday flowers with a note that read, \\"I love you and I love your kidney! Thank you!\\" Financially, the disease was upsetting to them. So my sister and I were humbled and surprised when, shortly before his surgery day, Dad handed us a diamond jewelry that we were to give to Mom after the operation. He'd accumulated his spare dollars to buy it. At the hospital on the day of the transplant, all our relatives and friends gathered in the waiting room and became involved in a mean euchre tournament. My family has always handled things with a lot of laughter, and even though we were all tense, everybody was taking bets on how long this \\"change of conduct\\" would last in my parents. We would inform Dad that if he chose to act like a real pain on any particular day after the operation, he wasn't allowed to blame it on PMS just because he'd now have a female kidney. The surgeries went well, and not long afterward, my sister and I were allowed to go in to visit. Dad was in a great deal of pain but again, all he could talk about was Mom. Was she okay? How was she feeling? Then the nurses let us do something unconventional. As they were wheeling Mom out of recovery room, they rolled her into a separate position to visit Dad. It was strange to see both my parents hooked up to IVs and machines and trying to talk to each other through tears. The nurses allowed us to present the diamond jewelry to Mom so that Dad could watch her open it. Everyone was crying, even the nurses. As I stood with digital camera in hand, I tried to keep the presence of mind to document the moment. My dad was having a hard time fighting back emotion, and suddenly my parents unexpectedly reached out to hold each other's hands. In my nearly 35 years of existence, I'd never seen my parents do that, and I was spellbound. I snapped a picture and later rushed home to make sure I'd captured that enormous, life-defining moment.

In recent years, the pervasive use of social media has become an integral part of people's lives, particularly among teenagers. The platforms offer countless opportunities for communication, self-expression, and connection with others. However, concerns have been raised about the consequences of excessive usage of social media and its influence on the mental health and wellbeing of young individuals. Previous research studies have delivered mixed results, with some indicating a negative impact on mental health, while others suggesting no significant harm. Hypothesis: Increased usage of social media exacerbates mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, among teenagers. This hypothesis is centered around the potential negative impact that an excessive amount of time spent on social media platforms can have on the mental well-being of teenagers. The main argument here is that an increase in social media usage can lead to heightened levels of anxiety, depression, and other emotional disorders among teens. Multiple factors support this hypothesis: 1. Online comparisons: Social media allows users to share carefully crafted images and stories of their lives, often portraying an unrealistic standard of living or happiness. Teenagers are particularly vulnerable to comparing themselves to others, resulting in feelings of inadequacy or low self-esteem. 2. Cyberbullying: Online platforms can easily become a breeding ground for harassment and bullying, which can directly contribute to the development or exacerbation of anxieties and depressive symptoms in teens. 3. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): Constant exposure to events and experiences that a teenager may not be a part of can create a fear of missing out or feeling left out, which may consequently lead to feelings of loneliness, isolation, and anxiety. 4. Sleep disruption: Excessive social media usage, especially before bed, can result in poor sleep quality and insufficient sleep. A lack of sleep has been linked to both short-term and long-term effects on mental health, including the development of anxiety and depression. To test this hypothesis, researchers could conduct studies employing different methodologies, including longitudinal and cross-sectional designs, to draw a clearer association between social media usage and mental health outcomes. They could also utilize a range of participants from diverse backgrounds and age groups to get a more generalized picture. Ultimately, the findings from such research could guide efforts to create new policies and interventions aimed at mitigating the harmful impact of social media on teens' mental health."},{"instruction":"Here is an article: Amid a lawsuit from food giant Unilever Unilever, Hampton Creek Foods CEO Joshua Tetrick has stayed positive, relatively confident that his company will survive the potentially business-crippling litigation. Apparently, investors think so too, as the food startup, which aims to replace egg products in foods with plant-based alternatives, raised 90 million from repeat backers and new faces including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and billionaire Facebook cofounder Eduardo Saverin. The investment takes the company’s total funding to 120 million and adds to the 23 million-round led by Li Ka-shing’s Horizons Ventures in February. A spokesperson for Hampton Creek declined to disclose the company’s valuation, though sources close to the startup said that it would be valued at around 500 million with the new fundraising. The 90 million round, co-led by repeat investors Horizons and Khosla Ventures, is nearly double the amount that the company was expected to raise as reported by some outlets. Tetrick, who pointed out that his company went from 40 employees to 62 in the last year, said that some of that money will go toward hires who can power Hampton Creek’s research and development. “We’re definitely going to hire more biochemists, data scientists and people on the tech side,” said Tetrick, who does not have a technical background and founded the company after earning a law degree and working as a social entrepreneur. “Our competitive advantage is the technology piece, that’s something, regardless of the infrastructure that we build, that we have to continue to invest on internally.” After raising its first seed round three years ago, Hampton Creek has had a quick rise, placing its flagship product, eggless condiment “Just Mayo,” in stores such as Costco, Walmart and Target Target as well as in the hands of the Compass Group Compass Group, the largest food service company in the world. That dressing, which uses plant-based formulas instead of eggs as the active ingredient, is also the cause of Unilever’s lawsuit against Hampton Creek, with the multibillion-dollar food corporation alleging that “Just Mayo” is mislabeled because mayonnaise by definition must have eggs. Some have ridiculed Unilever over the case, and Tetrick said his company in the process of filing a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which was filed in New Jersey. The Hampton Creek CEO also said that while little progress has been made since the suit was first announced in November, he expects Unilever to eventually withdraw its case. With Saverin and Benioff, Hampton Creek continues to add influential individuals to its pool of supporters, which also includes Bill Gates, Tom Steyer and Yahoo cofounder Jerry Yang. Other notable backers in the round included Braintree cofounder Bryan Johnson; Nicholas Pritzker, II’s Tao Capital Partners; and Bryan Meehan, chairman of Blue Bottle Coffee. The company said it would also continue to expand in Western Europe and Asia. To that end it added Uni-President Enterprises Corporation, a Taiwanese food conglomerate, and Singapore’s Far East Organization, a real estate company which also oversees a food and beverage subsidiary, as investors.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Republic of Bashkortostan (\\"Baqortostan Respublikah\\"), also known as Bashkiria is a federal subject of Russia (a republic). It is located between the Volga River and the Ural Mountains. Its capital is the city of Ufa. With the population of 4,072,292 as of the 2010 Census, Bashkortostan is the most populous of the republics in Russia. - The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean. - Ufa is a city in Russia, the capital of the Republic of Bashkortostan. - Yekaterinburg, alternatively romanised as \\"Ekaterinburg\\", is the fourth-largest city in Russia and the administrative centre of Sverdlovsk Oblast, located in the middle of the Eurasian continent, on the border of Europe and Asia. At the 2010 Census, it had a population of 1,349,772. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - The term dialect (from Latin , , from the Ancient Greek word , , \\"discourse\\", from , , \\"through\\" and , , \\"I speak\\") is used in two distinct ways to refer to two different types of linguistic phenomena: - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - The Ural or Jayq/Zhayyq (, ), known as Yaik before 1775, is a river flowing through Russia and Kazakhstan in Eurasia. It originates in the southern Ural Mountains and ends at the Caspian Sea. At , it is the third-longest river in Europe after the Volga and the Danube, and the 18th-longest river in Asia. The Ural River is conventionally considered part of the boundary between the continents of Europe and Asia. - Russia is not proportionately populated between the smaller western portion (almost 25%) of the country that is considered part of Europe, and the larger eastern portion (more than 75%) that is part of Asia. European Russia contains about 77% of the country's population (110,000,000 people out of about 144,000,000) in an area comprising almost 4 million km (1.54 million mi); an average of 27.5 persons per km (70 per mi). This territory makes up 38% of Europe. Its eastern border is defined by the Ural Mountains and in the south, it is defined by the border with Kazakhstan. This area includes Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the two largest cities in Russia. - The Ural Mountains, or simply the Urals, are a mountain range that runs approximately from north to south through western Russia, from the coast of the Arctic Ocean to the Ural River and northwestern Kazakhstan.

Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - The Volga is the longest river in Europe. It is also Europe's largest river in terms of discharge and watershed. The river flows through central Russia and into the Caspian Sea, and is widely regarded as the national river of Russia. - Moscow (or ) is the capital and most populous city of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the city limits and 16.8 million within the urban area. Moscow has the status of a Russian federal city. - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets. - Novosibirsk is the third-most populous city in Russia after Moscow and St. Petersburg.

In the given statement, \\"The flow of current in an electrical circuit is moved up and down,\\" the focus is on the flow of current within an electrical circuit, not an electrical storm. An electrical circuit is a closed loop that allows electrons to flow through a conducting path, producing various effects such as heat, light, or movement. The flow of current in the context of an electrical circuit generally refers to the movement of electrons through the conducting path. This flow can vary (up and down) based on several factors, including the voltage, resistance, and characteristics of the circuit components. An electrical storm, also known as a thunderstorm or a lightning storm, is a natural phenomenon characterized by the occurrence of lightning and thunder, accompanied by heavy rain, strong winds, or hail. The flow of current in an electrical storm, specifically in a lightning strike, is the result of a massive discharge of electrical energy between the Earth's surface and a thundercloud or between thunderclouds. While both an electrical circuit and an electrical storm involve the flow of electric current, they are different phenomena with distinct properties and behaviors.

Possible answers: [+] Gustav is a Hurricane .; [+] Gustav is a sort of Quake; [+] Gustav is an Angry man .; [+] None of the above choices .; The answer is:","output":"[+] Gustav is a Hurricane. In the passage, the author talks about dealing with the effects of Gustav and how much of the city is without power. This implies that Gustav is a natural disaster, likely a hurricane, as they commonly cause power outages and widespread damage. Gustav is not a sort of Quake because the passage talks about power outages and disruption to the city's normal functioning, which is more characteristic of a hurricane. Gustav is not an Angry man because the passage describes dealing with the effects of Gustav, which suggests it is a natural disaster. Angry men typically do not cause power outages and city-wide disruptions on the scale described in the passage. None of the above choices is incorrect because Gustav is indeed a Hurricane."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: – So why didn't Ivanka Trump fire back when Samantha Bee hurled a vulgarity at her?

Answer:","output":"The best determinant of the number of wolves that can live in an area is the amount of food available in the area. It's essential to understand that the factors mentioned - amount of snow, number of birds, and number of trees - can indirectly impact wolf populations; however, the availability of food resources is the most predominant factor affecting their numbers and survival. Wolves, as carnivorous predators, primarily depend on large ungulates such as elk, deer, moose, and caribou as their primary food source. The presence and abundance of these prey species are essential in sustaining a healthy wolf population. Let's further discuss how the other listed factors are related to food availability and their impact on the number of wolves in an area: 1. The amount of snow in the area each year: Snowfall can impact the accessibility of prey for wolves. Deep snow could make it difficult for wolves to hunt, and sometimes snow can provide an advantage to the prey species, like deer, which are better adapted to navigating snowy terrains than wolves. However, the primary relationship between snow and wolves is that heavy snow can cause the prey population to decrease due to scarcity of food, especially in extreme conditions. When there are fewer prey, it directly impacts the number of wolves an area can support. 2. The number of birds in the area: Birds can play a minor role in a wolf's diet, but they are not a primary food source. While they provide supplementary food in certain situations, birds don't strongly correlate with the number of wolves an area can support. However, the presence of certain bird species can serve as an indicator of a healthy ecosystem, which could indirectly suggest an adequate prey population for wolves. 3. The number of trees in the area: Trees in an area provide shelter and habitat for both wolves and their prey. Dense forests can offer hiding spots for wolves to stalk their prey and can also provide cover to protect their young. On the other hand, an area with fewer trees might not provide sufficient cover, making it challenging for wolves to thrive. However, the number of trees is still not a directly determining factor for the number of wolves that an area can support. In summary, the amount of food available in an area, mainly as large ungulates, is the most significant determinant of the number of wolves that can live in that area. The other factors mentioned can indirectly impact the number of wolves through their effect on prey populations, but they are not directly responsible for the wolf population size. A healthy and sustainable prey population is key to the survival and success of wolf populations."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about a restaurant with all the following attributes: name = Wildwood, eatType = coffee shop, food = Italian, priceRange = moderate, near = Ranch","output":"Before starting to write the sentence, I want to make sure I include all the provided attributes in an organized manner.

It was erected in 2006 and forms part of the River Parrett Trail. The next bridge upstream is Bicknell's bridge, which was formerly known as Bickling bridge, which carries the road from Huish Episcopi to Muchelney. It replaced a footbridge in 1829 or 1830. At Muchelney the Westover Bridge carries a minor road over the river, and another minor road crosses on the Thorney Bridge close to the Thorney (or silent) Mill and a lock. The mill, with an iron overshot wheel, was built to grind corn in 1823. Another bridge and mill occur further upstream at Gawbridge west of Martock, where the mill has been the subject of a feasibility study by the South Somerset Hydropower Group. Carey's Mill Bridge was built of Ham stone in the 18th century and named after Carey's Mill, which originally occupied the site. It is surrounded by a collection of buildings known as the Parrett Iron Works, founded in 1855 on the site of a former snuff mill, which included a foundry, with a prominent chimney, ropewalk, workshops and several smaller workshops and cottages. The sluice which powered the waterwheel and sluice keeper's cottage still exist. Further south the river flows under the A303 near Norton-sub-Hamdon and the A356 near Chedington., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided article, the snuff mill that was replaced by a bridge was located on the site where Parrett Iron Works was later established, which is also the location of Carey's Mill Bridge. The article states that the Parrett Iron Works was founded in 1855 on the site of a former snuff mill, and Carey's Mill Bridge was built of Ham stone in the 18th century and named after Carey's Mill, which originally occupied the site. Although it does not directly mention the exact name of the snuff mill, it is safe to assume that it might have been referred to as 'Carey's Mill' since the bridge was named after it.

The temporary order was imposed earlier by Culture Minister Ed Vaizey. The use of gilding and the high quality of the brooch indicates it was used by an individual of significant social status. An illustration of the Virgin Mary in the 9th Century gospel manuscript, the Book of Kells, shows her wearing a brooch of similar type and also suggests it had a Christian meaning.

Let's break down the sentence: 1. \\"Le soleil\\" means \\"the sun\\" in French. \\"Le\\" is the masculine singular definite article, equivalent to \\"the\\" in English. \\"Soleil\\" is a masculine noun, so it takes the masculine article. 2. \\"Brille\\" means \\"shines\\" and is the third person singular form of the verb \\"briller.\\" French verbs need to be conjugated according to the subject and the tense. In this case, \\"brille\\" is in the present tense, agreeing with the subject \\"le soleil.\\" 3. \\"Aujourd'hui\\" translates to \\"today\\" in English. It is an invariable adverb, meaning it does not change its form and can be used as is. 4. The comma in the sentence is used to separate the two main clauses, similar to its usage in English. 5. \\"Rendant\\" means \\"making\\" and is the present participle of the verb \\"rendre.\\" It is used here to introduce the effect of the sun shining on the atmosphere and people's mood. 6. \\"L'atmosphère\\" is the French word for \\"the atmosphere.\\" The apostrophe before the word represents the contraction of the article \\"la\\" (the feminine singular definite article) with the following vowel \\"a.\\" This is called an \\"elision\\" and is required when a singular definite article ending in a vowel comes before a word starting with a vowel or a mute 'h.' 7. \\"Légère\\" means \\"light\\" and is an adjective qualifying \\"atmosphere\\". It agrees in gender and number with the noun it modifies, so it takes the feminine singular form. If the noun were plural, the adjective would take the plural form, \\"légères.\\" 8. \\"Et\\" means \\"and\\" in French, connecting the two clauses and ideas in the sentence. 9. \\"Les gens\\" means \\"the people\\" in French. \\"Les\\" is the plural definite article, and \\"gens\\" is a plural noun. 10. \\"Se sentent\\" means \\"feel\\" and is a reflexive verb in the third person plural form. Reflexive verbs in French are those where the subject and object are the same, and they are formed using a reflexive pronoun (\\"se\\") followed by the conjugated form of the verb. In this case, \\"sentent\\" is the conjugated form of the verb \\"sentir\\" (to feel) for the subject \\"les gens.\\" 11. \\"Heureux\\" means \\"happy\\" and is an adjective that agrees with the noun \\"gens.\\" Since \\"gens\\" is plural, \\"heureux\\" also takes its plural form. If you were describing a singular noun, the adjective would be \\"heureux\\" for masculine nouns and \\"heureuse\\" for feminine nouns. 12. \\"Et\\" is used again to connect the ideas. In this case, it means \\"and\\" in English. 13. \\"Revigorés\\" means \\"invigorated\\" and is the plural form of the adjective \\"revigoré.\\" It agrees in gender and number with \\"gens,\\" the noun it describes. If you were describing a singular noun, the adjective would be \\"revigoré\\" for masculine nouns and \\"revigorée\\" for feminine nouns. This sentence demonstrates how French can be both similar and different from English. Some elements, like the use of adjectives and verbs, are more complex in French due to the requirements of matching gender and number. However, other elements, like connecting ideas with conjunctions or using adverbs, are similar between the two languages."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article in one sentence. Before reschedule your job interview, try to rearrange your other plans instead. Your job interview serves as a first impression for a potential employer, so rescheduling may come off as unprofessional. If possible, rearrange the other parts of your schedule before rescheduling your job interview. Rescheduling a job interview can be a huge inconvenience to everyone involved. Because of this, it's important that you contact your potential employer to reschedule at least 24 hours before your scheduled interview. When you contact your interviewer, give a brief explanation for your need to reschedule. Be as honest as possible. Give your interviewer a few alternative dates that will work for your rescheduled interview. If you're rescheduling due to another job interview, it's best not to tell your interviewer that. Tell them you've had a work or family conflict come up, and that you'd love to reschedule your interview for another time. If a life emergency happens and you cannot give 24 hour notice, contact your interviewer as soon as possible to let them know what happened. If it's a real emergency (you were injured, you have a family emergency, etc.), your potential employer should understand. If you're still interested in the job, express that when you call to cancel. Say something like \\"I'm very sorry, but an emergency has come up and I won't be able to make our interview tomorrow. I'm still interested in the position and would be extremely grateful if we could reschedule.\\" When possible, make direct contact with your potential employer instead of sending an email or leaving a message. Making contact via phone will make you look like a responsible professional. Make an effort to get in touch with your interviewer in numerous ways, and only leave a message or send an email if you cannot reach them via phone. Never send a text message to reschedule an interview, as it will make you look unprofessional. If you end up leaving a message or sending an email, ask that your interviewer contact you to confirm they got your message. A job interview is normally scheduled around multiple people's schedules. Therefore, cancelling or rescheduling an interview is usually an inconvenience for multiple people. Don't assume that your interviewer's schedule revolves around you, and apologize for causing any inconvenience. Try to be flexible when you ask to reschedule your interview. If your interviewer sees that you are putting in good effort to make this interview work, they will be more likely to reschedule your interview. After you've contacted your interviewer about rescheduling, send them a personal note or email reiterating your apology and your interest in the company. Your interviewer may be frustrated or irritated by you cancelling, so use this note as an opportunity to let them know that you are genuinely sorry and would still like a chance to reschedule an interview.","output":"When you need to reschedule a job interview, first try to change your other plans, but if you must reschedule, contact the interviewer with an honest explanation, suggest new dates, and always be polite because it might inconvenience many people."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog based on this summary: Greg had to trash loads of clothes due to their poor quality, Mary did that too.

History: The art of Samoan tattooing is said to have originated from the island of Fiji, where the twin sisters Tilafaiga and Taema brought the technique to Samoa after learning it from the Fijian demigod Nafanua. In Samoan mythology, these sisters are attributed with the introduction of tatau to Samoan society, and many legends include their journey and the eventual development of different patterns and styles. Tattooing in Samoa holds essential ties to societal hierarchy and governance, as specific designs and motifs were reserved for individuals of high rank, such as chiefs and tribe leaders. These tattoos symbolized power, responsibility, and respect and were believed to offer protection from evil spirits during times of war. Traditional Process and Technique: The process of getting a traditional Samoan tattoo is both painful and time-consuming, usually taking several weeks or even months to complete, with multiple sessions involved. The designs are inked using handmade tools, such as sharpened teeth from animals or bird bones, fastened to a wooden handle. These tools, called \\"au,\\" are dipped into a black ink prepared from the soot of burned candlenut shells mixed with water or oil, then tapped into the skin with a small mallet. During the sessions, the person being tattooed is often surrounded by friends and family singing or telling stories to provide emotional support and encouragement. The tufuga ta tatau, the tattoo master, directs the entire process, and the assistants help in stretching the skin and wiping away blood. The tufuga ta tatau holds a sacred and revered position in Samoan society, as they are the keepers of a vital cultural practice. Tatau and Malu in Contemporary Samoan Culture: While contemporary Samoan tattoos may incorporate modern tools and techniques, the cultural significance and symbolism remain firmly rooted in tradition. Tattooing continues to be a rite of passage for many young Samoans, and obtaining a tatau or malu is viewed as a way of preserving identity and heritage, as well as honoring one's ancestors and family. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in the popularity of traditional Samoan tattooing, fueled in part by the growth of Polynesian cultural pride and the visibility of Samoan tattoos within mainstream media and sports. Prominent athletes and celebrities, such as Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson and Troy Polamalu, have embraced their Samoan heritage through tattoos, further raising awareness and admiration for tatau and malu. In conclusion, traditional Samoan tattooing holds a crucial place in Samoa's cultural and historical landscape. From its mythological roots to its continued practice and popularity today, the tatau and malu serve as essential markers of identity and personal achievement, reflecting the resilience of Samoan culture and its connection to the past."},{"instruction":"● Zaškrtněte políčko Potlačit výchozí hodnoty.

It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music.

Rafer Alston, Luther Head, and me combined to shoot 5 of 33 from the field. Ouch! You aren't going to win too many games like that. Even as poorly as we shot the ball, we STILL had a chance to win the game in the fourth quarter but failed to make the winning plays that you must make to leave the floor victorious.

Roosevelt in the film âHyde Park on Hudson,â which takes place in and around the familyâs rural New York estate. TELLURIDE, Colo. — A film festival held almost 9,000 feet above sea level on a holiday weekend may not be the likeliest setting for philosophical speculation, but for the past four days the Telluride Film Festival has offered something like a seminar on the nature of truth. In an age of reality television, journalistic fakery and political mendacity everyone knows that words and images can distort and mislead. And film is a particularly unstable medium, alluring us with a promise of honesty while it feeds us ever more elaborate fantasies. Yusef Salaam, carrying a book and folder, in âThe Central Park Five.â Marilyn Monroe in the film âLove, Marilyn.â A scene from Sarah Polleyâs new film, âStories We Tell,â not quite fiction, but also not really documentary. Greta Gerwig in âFrances Ha,â a New York story about a young woman in crisis. Emmanuelle Riva in Michael Hanekeâs âAmour.â So we could start our local inquiry with movies that, while clearly fictional, have that elusive, bracing feeling of realness. A movie like Jacques Audiard’s tough and tender melodrama “Rust and Bone,” with its workaday French setting and its restless hand-held camera. Or Noah Baumbach’s “Frances Ha,” a fleet-footed, black-and-white New York story about a young woman in crisis (Greta Gerwig, Mr. Baumbach’s companion and co-writer) that turns self-consciousness into an exalted form of authenticity. Or Michael Haneke’s “Amour,” a work of impeccable formal control that captures, remorselessly but also tenderly, the agony of a long-married couple facing death. Or else we might start with movies that are obviously about real people and events and just as obviously works of entertaining make-believe. In Roger Michell’s “Hyde Park on Hudson,” for example, the role of Franklin D. Roosevelt is played by Bill Murray, who noted at a post-screening Q. and A. session Saturday that he had previously been asked only to portray presidents in comedy sketches, and that Roosevelt was a very big historical deal. “He’s on the dime,” Mr. Murray reminded the audience. “You know what a dime is, right?” he asked Mr. Michell, who is British but who nonetheless seemed to have some notion. Speaking of dimes, “Hyde Park on Hudson” is perhaps a bit shiny and thin, emphasizing Roosevelt’s playful charm and his sexual appetites rather than his political achievements. Taking place in and around his mother’s rural New York estate, the film explores his relationship with Daisy Suckley (Laura Linney), a distant cousin of Roosevelt’s who was also his lover, during a visit in 1939 from the king and queen of England (Samuel West and Olivia Colman). Those two — the characters, not the actors — are the same stuttering Bertie and supportive Elizabeth who popped up on Telluride screens two years ago in “The King’s Speech” and went on to win a bunch of Academy Awards. But we are philosophizing here, not buzzing about prizes. So we will refrain from handicapping the Oscar chances of Ben Affleck’s “Argo,” which arrived in Telluride as a semi-surprise sneak preview and provided a jolt of swift and slick entertainment. We will note, though, that Mr. Affleck’s film, in which he plays a C.I.A. operative trying to rescue Americans trapped in revolutionary Iran, is very much rooted in actual events. Like “Hyde Park on Hudson” it looks at a well-known story (in this case the seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979) from a new angle. Both movies take advantage of information that was made public years after the fact, and they use the standard tools of period filmmaking to reopen and refresh the past. The German film “Barbara” (winner of the top prize in Berlin this year) and “No,” from Chile, are more modest with respect to production design but in other ways more ambitious than their American counterparts, revisiting painful moments from recent history and trying to drag suppressed or dissembled truths into the light. “Barbara,” directed by Christian Petzold, is a quiet, tense drama set in East Germany in 1980 and stars the remarkable Nina Hoss as a doctor struggling to preserve a sense of autonomy and dignity in a society predicated on lies, treachery and paranoia. Pablo Larraín’s “No” takes place later in that same decade, as Chile begins its transition from dictatorship to democracy. “The Central Park Five,” directed by Ken Burns, his daughter Sarah and her husband, David McMahon, looks at the perversion of justice and the suppression of truth closer to home. It is a concise, informative and upsetting chronicle of a crime — the rape and beating of a jogger in Central Park in 1989 — that shocked New York and led to the erroneous conviction of five teenagers, all of whom are interviewed extensively in the film. What happened to them is infuriating, but the fact that they are now free and willing to tell their stories offers at least a small measure of comfort to the viewer. No such reassurance can be found in Joshua Oppenheimer’s “Act of Killing,” even though the atrocities it contemplates — the slaughter of a million Indonesians following the military coup in that country in 1965 — happened relatively long ago. Mr. Oppenheimer visits some of the perpetrators of those killings, and finds them not only unrepentant but positively giddy about what they had done. They set about reconstructing their murders for the camera, sometimes using elaborate sets and costumes and cinematic effects, with an openness and relish that sometimes inspires queasy, horrified laughter. Liz Garbus’s “Love, Marilyn” uses recently discovered letters and notebooks to show sides of Marilyn Monroe’s personality obscured behind the tragic dazzle of her public persona. Ms. Garbus boldly puts Monroe’s words into the mouths of well-known actresses (including Uma Thurman, Viola Davis, Lindsay Lohan and Glenn Close) who appear on screen, blending their own glamour with hers. Friends and acquaintances of Monroe’s are also “played” by familiar movie faces — Adrien Brody is Truman Capote; David Strathairn is Arthur Miller — so that the film becomes a heady cocktail of journalistic rigor and show business flair, a blend that seems, in the end, just right for its blazingly famous, endlessly enigmatic subject. “Stories We Tell,” a remarkable movie by the Canadian actress and filmmaker Sarah Polley, blends factual inquiry and something else — not quite fiction, but also not really documentary — to astonishing effect. I hesitate to say too much, since the movie is built around a series of formal and substantive revelations that must be seen to be believed. The story Ms. Polley has to tell is intensely personal, and in trying to verify some elusive facts about her mother (an actress who died in 1987) she comes close to unraveling her own sense of identity. She may not be who she thought she was, and “Stories We Tell” is decidedly not what it seems, at first, to be. But it is also decidedly not a movie that gives up on or relativizes away the idea of truth, however complex and strange the truth turns out to be. And the best documentary in Telluride this year is also the most bluntly honest. It is “The Gatekeepers,” which consists mostly of the director Dror Moreh’s interviews with six former heads of Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic security service. These men matter-of-factly talk about their work over the past decades, work that encompasses torture, spying and assassination and that includes some devastating failures of intelligence. They also speak frankly about the strategic and political consequences of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza in ways that are unlikely to please or reassure anyone with settled opinions about the Middle East. “The Gatekeepers” is a reminder that sometimes the truth hurts. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are about the Telluride Film Festival and the different films that were shown during the festival. Some of the films mentioned are \\"Rust and Bone,\\" \\"Frances Ha,\\" \\"Amour,\\" \\"Hyde Park on Hudson,\\" \\"Argo,\\" \\"Barbara,\\" \\"No,\\" \\"The Central Park Five,\\" \\"Act of Killing,\\" \\"Love, Marilyn,\\" \\"Stories We Tell,\\" and \\"The Gatekeepers.\\" These films are a mix of fiction and non-fiction works, some based on real events and people while others are purely imaginative stories.

The answer is:","output":"The Tenryū-class cruiser belongs to the category of mean of transportation, more specifically in the subcategory of naval ships or military vessels. The Tenryū-class cruisers were a type of warship class used by the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War I and World War II. The Tenryū-class cruisers were designed to be scout cruisers or the fleet's \\"eyes\\" during naval engagements. They were intended to serve as fast, light cruiser vessels with powerful weaponry that could perform duties such as reconnaissance, escorting, and screening of larger warships. They were developed following the trend of other naval powers in terms of producing smaller, faster, and more versatile ships. The Tenryū-class cruiser comprised of two vessels: the Tenryū and the Tatsuta. Both ships were commissioned during World War I and saw effective service in various engagements throughout their careers, most notably during World War II. The design of the Tenryū-class cruisers prioritized speed and firepower while sacrificing armor protection. They were equipped with an array of weapons, including four single 5.5-inch (140mm) guns, one 3-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft gun, and three Type 21 surface-to-air torpedoes. The ships also had a top speed of approximately 33 knots, which allowed them to effectively carry out their intended roles. During World War II, both ships of the Tenryū-class cruiser took part in major operations. The Tenryū participated in the invasion of the Philippines, the Battle of the Java Sea, and the Battle of Guadalcanal before being sunk by the USS Albacore submarine. The Tatsuta also participated in several operations, including the Battle of Midway and the Indian Ocean raid before being sunk by the submarine USS Sand Lance. In conclusion, the Tenryū-class cruiser falls under the category of mean of transportation, primarily in the naval ships or military vessels subcategory. They were crucial assets to the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War I and World War II, playing a crucial role in supporting larger warships and performing reconnaissance and escort missions. Although both ships were eventually sunk during World War II, their influence can still be felt today as a historical example of effective naval vessels designed with speed and firepower in mind."},{"instruction":"Sutcliffe was born in Bingley in the West Riding of Yorkshire to a working-class family. He was given a Catholic upbringing by his parents, John William Sutcliffe and his wife Kathleen Frances (nee Coonan). Reportedly a loner, he left school aged fifteen and had a series of menial jobs, including two stints as a gravedigger in the 1960s. Between November 1971 and April 1973, Sutcliffe worked at the Baird Television factory on a packaging line. West Yorkshire Police were criticised for being inadequately prepared for an investigation on this scale. It was one of the largest investigations by a British police force and predated the use of computers. Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards. Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork (the floor of the incident room was reinforced to cope with the weight of the paper), it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times, but all information the police had about the case was stored in paper form, making cross-referencing difficult, compounded by television appeals for information which generated thousands more documents. Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield was criticised for being too focused on a hoax confessional tape that seemed to indicate a perpetrator with a Wearside background, and for ignoring advice from survivors of Sutcliffe's attacks, and several eminent specialists including the FBI, plus dialect analysts such as Stanley Ellis and Jack Windsor Lewis, whom he had also consulted throughout the manhunt, that \\"Wearside Jack\\" was a blatant hoaxer. The investigation used it as a point of elimination rather than a line of enquiry and allowed Sutcliffe to avoid scrutiny, as he did not fit the profile of the sender of the tape or letters. The \\"Wearside Jack\\" hoaxer was given unusual credibility when analysis of saliva on the envelopes he sent showed he had the same blood group as the Yorkshire Ripper had left at crime scenes, a type shared by only 6% of the population. The hoaxer appeared to know details of the murders which had not been released to the press, but which in fact he had acquired from his local newspaper and pub gossip. The official response to the criticisms led to the implementation of the forerunner of the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System, the development of the Major Incident Computer Application (MICA), developed between West Yorkshire Police and ISIS Computer Services. In response to the police reaction to the murders, the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group organised a number of 'Reclaim the Night' marches. The group and other feminists had criticised the police for victim-blaming, especially the suggestion that women should remain indoors at night. Eleven marches in various towns across the United Kingdom took place on the night of 12 November 1977. They made the point that women should be able to walk anywhere without restriction and that they should not be blamed for men's violence. In 1988, the mother of Sutcliffe's last victim, Jacqueline Hill, during action for damages on behalf of her daughter's estate, argued in the High Court that the police had failed to use reasonable care in apprehending the murderer of her daughter in Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire. The House of Lords held that the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire did not owe a duty of care to the victim due to the lack of proximity and therefore failing on the second limb of the Caparo test. did another police department take over the case?","output":"No, another police department did not take over the case regarding Peter Sutcliffe, also known as the Yorkshire Ripper. The West Yorkshire Police were in charge of the investigation throughout, despite the criticism they faced due to the enormous scale of this case which required a level of manpower and resources that they were unprepared to handle. This made tracking suspects and information more difficult and allowed Sutcliffe to slip through the cracks repeatedly. This was at a time when the use of computers wasn't prevalent, so all the information was stored on handwritten index cards leading to information overload. It impaired the ability of the authorities to effectively cross-reference data, which was crucial in such a large-scale investigation. Peter Sutcliffe was in fact interviewed nine times, but the manual system of data storage hindered efficient cross-referencing of information, which could have potentially led to his earlier capture. Despite major flaws in the investigation process, such as too much focus on misleading confessions and hoaxes, and the apparent initial neglect of advice from survivors and forensic experts, the West Yorkshire Police maintained control over the case until Sutcliffe was eventually caught. The deficiencies in managing such a major investigation lead to systemic changes in how such cases were managed in the future. Specific reforms that arose from this case included the implementation of systems like the forerunner of the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System and the development of the Major Incident Computer Application (MICA), which was created between the West Yorkshire Police and ISIS Computer Services to improve information management. The case did bring about changes in societal attitude as well, due to criticism towards victim-blaming. This resulted in mass protests organised by various feminist groups and led to the 'Reclaim the Night' marches, stressing that it is not the responsibility of women to restrict their activities due to men's violence. While there was legal action taken against the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire post the conclusion of the case in 1988, the assertion by Jacqueline Hill's mother that the police had failed to exercise reasonable care in apprehending her daughter's murderer was rejected by the House of Lords. They concluded that the Chief Constable did not owe a specific duty of care due to the lack of proximity, thus failing the second limb of the Caparo test, a legal principle in English Law to establish negligence. In conclusion, even amid great criticism and system failures, another police department didn't take over the case. The Yorkshire Ripper case remained under the jurisdiction of the West Yorkshire Police until its resolution. It did, however, bring about significant changes in crime investigation techniques and societal attitudes towards victims."},{"instruction":"How do I choose finance research topic?

Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: Why are the kids wearing those shirts ?","output":"Based on the information provided in the passage, it is difficult to determine the exact reason behind the kids wearing those shirts that read \\"My daddy is the Fallen Angel.\\" Nevertheless, we can suggest several possible scenarios drawn from the given context. 1. Expression of love and admiration: The shirts could symbolize the children's love and admiration for their father. By wearing shirts with a text referring to their dad as the \\"Fallen Angel,\\" the children are essentially paying tribute to him and showcasing their connection to him. The fact that the narrator finds the shirts \\"extra cute\\" suggests that this gesture is viewed positively by the observer. 2. Family theme or inside joke: The message on the shirts could be part of a family theme or an inside joke that the kids and their family members find amusing or meaningful. It is possible that \\"Fallen Angel\\" refers to an incident or an anecdote within the family circle, and the shirts are worn to reflect this shared understanding. 3. Parental choice: The choice to have the kids wear these shirts might have been made by their parents. The children, being very young, are unlikely to have chosen the shirts themselves. The parents might have thought it would be humorous or attractive to have their children wear matching shirts with the \\"My daddy is the Fallen Angel\\" text. 4. Public performance or event: The kids might be wearing those shirts as part of a public event or gathering, where wearing such outfits is appropriate or required. For instance, the family could be attending a themed party or a special occasion where people are encouraged to wear distinctive clothing with textual messages. In summary, although the specific reason behind the kids wearing those shirts is not explicitly mentioned in the passage, we can infer that it could either be an expression of love and admiration for their father, an inside joke, a decision made by the parents, or part of a public event."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What people played a role in the Japanese military prior to modernization? Context: Around the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, the Meiji era was marked by the reign of the Meiji Emperor. During this time, Japan started its modernization and rose to world power status. This era name means \\"Enlightened Rule\\". In Japan, the Meiji Restoration started in the 1860s, marking the rapid modernization by the Japanese themselves along European lines. Much research has focused on the issues of discontinuity versus continuity with the previous Tokugawa Period. In the 1960s younger Japanese scholars led by Irokawa Daikichi, reacted against the bureaucratic superstate, and began searching for the historic role of the common people . They avoided the elite, and focused not on political events but on social forces and attitudes. They rejected both Marxism and modernization theory as alien and confining. They stressed the importance of popular energies in the development of modern Japan. They enlarged history by using the methods of social history. It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously. Japan expanded its military production base by opening arsenals in various locations. The hyobusho (war office) was replaced with a War Department and a Naval Department.

In a series circuit, all the components are connected end-to-end in a single path so that the current flows through each component in turn. 2. Since there is only one loop in the circuit, the current has only one path to flow through. 3. If any part of the loop is interrupted, such as by a switch or a break in the wire, the current cannot flow through the rest of the circuit, causing the entire circuit's electric current to cease. 4. This characteristic of cessation of current upon interruption, combined with the single-loop nature of the circuit, justifies calling it a series circuit."},{"instruction":"Definition: You are given a conversation between two people.

It is a chemical element with the symbol Zr and atomic number 40. Zirconium is a strong, lustrous, and corrosion-resistant transition metal with a silver-white appearance. The element's name is derived from the Persian word \\"zargun\\" which translates to \\"gold-colored.\\" However, despite the name, zirconium exhibits a silver-white hue rather than a golden one. Discovered in 1789 by German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, zirconium is mainly obtained from minerals like zircon and baddeleyite. Today, zirconium is primarily used in a variety of applications, including as an alloying agent in materials that must withstand extreme conditions, such as high temperatures and corrosive environments. Due to its remarkable resistance to corrosion, zirconium has found use in the chemical industry where it constitutes a component of pumps, valves, and heat exchangers. It plays a significant role in the nuclear industry because of its low neutron-absorption cross-section, making it an ideal material for cladding fuel rods in nuclear reactors. Moreover, zirconium compounds have found application in various industries. For instance, zircon – a zirconium silicate – is used as an opacifier and refractory material in ceramics, while zirconium oxide is valued for its toughness and used in cutting tools, abrasive materials, and dental implants. Overall, zirconium's unique properties and diverse applications make it an important element in numerous industrial and technological advancements.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Article: It is believed in some ways that the daughter is father's lover. But my experience has taught me in a different way. For a long time, my father has been a very vague figure to me. He was a man of few words, tall but slim and nothing else. When I was in primary school, my father was never there to pick me up, and he never came to any of my parent-teacher meetings. He was always busy doing projects. I remember when I was in middle school and my head was badly hurt in a PE class. During my operation, my father was nowhere to be found. This hurt me most. At that moment, I considered my father as a cold-blooded man who did not care about me at all. But things seemed different at my high school graduation ceremony, where I was chosen to represent my class and give a speech. My father, once again, told me he had a business trip in a place outside the city and would be unable to show up . \\"Don't come. I will be very nervous if I see you,\\" I told him. I remember my speech went smoothly. After the ceremony was over and I was about to leave. I suddenly noticed a familiar looking man sitting in a corner of the hall. It was my father! I was so surprised that I rushed to him with tears running down my face. \\"Well done,\\" he said. His eyes were also filled with tears. Later, I found out that my father had managed to finish his work by staying up late, and he drove for eight hours to get back. He had been sitting in the corner because he didn't want me to see him. My father remembered every word in my speech. For much of my life, I described my father was a cold-blooded man who only cared about his work.

The Cutty Sark was designed and built specifically for the lucrative China tea trade in the 19th century but eventually took part in the wool trade between Great Britain and Australia. Launched in November 1869, Cutty Sark was a British clipper ship that measured 212 feet in length and could reach speeds of up to 17 knots. The ship was designed by Hercules Linton and built by Scott & Linton, a shipbuilding firm in Dumbarton, Scotland. It was named after the fictional \\"cutty sark,\\" or \\"short chemise,\\" of the witch Nannie Dee in Robert Burns' poem \\"Tam o' Shanter.\\" In the 19th century, the sailing ships that transported tea from China to England would often compete in informal races, known as tea clipper races, to deliver their valuable cargo quickly and earn a premium on their return cargoes. Cutty Sark's design, which combined many innovative features such as a narrower hull and increased sailing area, was intended to make it a fast and efficient ship for this purpose. However, by the time Cutty Sark was readied for service, the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 had led to a decline in the demand for sailing ships. The steamships, which could take advantage of the Canal's shorter route, gradually took over the tea trade. Despite this, Cutty Sark proved its mettle and speed in its first few voyages. It sailed between London and Shanghai, regularly carrying cargoes of tea, completing the voyages in record-breaking times. With the tea trade increasingly dominated by steamships, the Cutty Sark's owners turned to the Australia-to-England wool trade. The ship made eight such voyages from 1883 to 1895, transporting seasonally sheared wool from Australia to England. It managed to set record times for these journeys and earned a reputation as \\"the fastest ship in the wool trade.\\" Apart from tea and wool, Cutty Sark also carried other general cargoes, such as wine, beer, food, coal, clothes, crockery, and musical instruments, during its service. It even transported British emigrants to Australia in 1882. Cutty Sark ceased active service in 1895 and went on to serve as a sailing and training ship, including a stint in Portugal, until being retired in 1954. It is now preserved as a museum ship and a popular tourist attraction located at Greenwich, London, where visitors can learn about its fascinating history and the wider story of international trade during the 19th century."},{"instruction":"What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?

Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied? Title: Cool! Review: Never had a speedloader before this one. It is easy to use and as compact as it can be. Simply put six rounds in and twist...they are held firmly in place and ready to go. The knob feels like it would \\"untwist\\" and release the rounds on its own, but that hasn't happened. When you're ready to load, just pop out the cylinder on your revolver, use the plunger to expel the spent casings, push the new rounds in with the speedloader, then twist the knob to release.One caveat...loading is definitely a two-handed operation. You have to hold the gun's cylinder in place, or when you rotate the knob, the cylinder will rotate with it, and nothing will happen. So, it is necessary to hold the cylinder or the black plastic part of the speed loader in place before you rotate the knob. Kinda fiddly, but with practice it isn't hard...certainly easier than loading six rounds by hand.So far, the unit seems solid and it works great. The price is right, too. I only wish I had gotten more than one. The answer is:","output":"The customer appears to be satisfied with the product. In their review, they describe multiple aspects of the product they find positive, such as the ease of use, compact design, and firm hold of the rounds. The customer also mentions that the speedloader is more convenient than loading six rounds by hand, which indicates that the product meets their needs. Moreover, the customer addresses a potential concern about the knob untwisting and releasing the rounds unintentionally but negates it by saying that it hasn't happened. Thus, alleviating the concern and showing that the customer is satisfied with the product's performance. Although the reviewer does express a caveat that loading the speedloader is a two-handed operation and could be considered fiddly, they acknowledge that practice makes the process easier. This does not seem to have a significant negative impact on their satisfaction with the product. Furthermore, the customer states that the unit appears solid and works well, and they appreciate the affordability of the speedloader. They even mention wishing they had purchased more than one, which indicates a high level of satisfaction with the product. In conclusion, the customer's overall tone and description of the product's features and performance can be interpreted as an indication of satisfaction with the speedloader. Even though there is a minor drawback mentioned in the review, the positive aspects seem to outweigh it, resulting in a satisfied customer."},{"instruction":"Add spaces: Whether...Readmore»","output":"Okay, let's add spaces to make it easier to understand: Whether...

Here is a potential response: A: \\"It's completely normal to feel that way sometimes, and I understand why you might think you haven't achieved anything. However, it's important to recognize that we all have different ways of gauging our progress and accomplishments. It could be that you're just being hard on yourself, or it's possible that you've been working on tasks that don't necessarily have a tangible or immediate outcome. First, take a moment to reflect on your goals and priorities. Clarify whether you're focused on the right tasks and if they align with your long-term aspirations. It might be helpful to create a list of specific objectives you want to achieve and break them down into smaller, more manageable tasks. Also, consider reassessing your definition of success and the standards you've set for yourself. Sometimes, we set unrealistic expectations that can make us feel like we're never doing enough. Remember, it's okay to celebrate small wins along the way, and they can often lead to bigger accomplishments over time. In the future, make it a habit to periodically evaluate your progress and accomplishments, as this can help you stay motivated and recognize the impact of your efforts. Additionally, don't hesitate to reach out to friends or mentors for advice and guidance when you're feeling stuck or unproductive. Finally, remember that everyone's journey is unique, and comparing yourself to others can be counterproductive. Focus on your personal growth and accomplishments, and try to be patient with yourself.

The reporter indicates that Sarah was an activist from Chicago involved in helping refugees from the Chilean government and that her death may cast new light on the movement. Fielding is completely distraught over hearing this news and the movie begins.The first 3/4 of the movie unfolds on parallel timelines in the 70s and early 80s: the progression of Fielding & Sarah's complicated, volatile relationship and Fielding's ascension into power as an upcoming politician dealing with the recent loss (and haunting memories) of Sarah.Fielding meets Sarah as he is returning, in uniform, from duty in the Coast Guard and meeting up with his brother, who is a editor. The brother, Fielding and Sarah all go to lunch where Fielding is very ouspoken in his political ideals about current events. Sarah and Fielding are both immediately intrigued by each other, Fielding's attraction being more sexual and blatant and Sarah's attraction more of curiousity and intrigue. A few dates quickly lead to a sexual relationship despite an obvious difference in political thinking between the two. Sarah asks why Fielding wants to be a senator and his very serious reply is that he doesn't- he wants to be president. Sarah is later quoted as saying \\"Ambition is the ice in the lake of emotion.\\" And when Fielding tries to comfort Sarah's fear of his Coast Guard duty leading to a Vietnam tour, she replies \\"but if you go over there, you'll be shooting at the guys that I want to win.\\" Their intense love outweighs their differences, though, and their relationship quickly becomes serious.Meanwhile Fielding is a young politician being groomed to be congressman by the current govenor because of a scandal involving Jerry Carmichael 's (Ed Harris in a cameo role) resignation due to his homosexuality.

However, I can help you analyze the movie proposal in other ways to help you determine if it is worth investing in. 1. Marketability and target audience: Consider the potential marketability of the movie, as well as the intended target audience. Waking the Dead focuses on the themes of love, ambition, politics, and differences in ideologies. This makes the film appealing to a mature audience, specifically those who enjoy romantic dramas with a political backdrop. The combination of romance and political intrigue may attract a wide range of moviegoers, helping increase the potential for commercial success. 2. Cast and crew: The film proposal features talented actors like Billy Crudup, Jennifer Connelly, and Ed Harris. Their presence can significantly boost the appeal of the movie and improve its chances at the box office. An experienced and skilled director, screenplay writer, and crew are also important for ensuring the high quality and visual storytelling of this complex narrative. 3. Narrative structure and storytelling: The nonlinear narrative structure of Waking the Dead, with its parallel timelines, may intrigue viewers and keep them engaged, but it will also require skilled storytelling to be executed effectively. Additionally, the movie must strike a balance between political intrigue and character-driven drama, ensuring that the development of Fielding's career and his relationship with Sarah remain the focal points. Given these factors, there could be potential for a captivating and unique movie experience if the story is properly developed and executed. 4. Social and political relevance: Waking the Dead's focus on political ambition, activism, and ideological differences taps into current global discussions and may resonate with contemporary viewers, creating potential for a meaningful and timely movie. Moreover, by weaving in themes such as loyalty, sacrifice, and the impact of personal beliefs on relationships and career, this movie may become a rich, thought-provoking exploration of interconnected human experiences. 5. Investment potential: Considering the factors discussed above, Waking the Dead has potential for both critical and commercial success. If the aspects of marketability, cast, storytelling, and social relevance are executed effectively, the film could have strong investment potential.

The Tigers enjoyed their first win in 11 at Bruce’s former club Sunderland on Boxing Day to climb out of the drop zone. They now have the chance to put nine points between themselves and bottom club Leicester City, who visit the KC Stadium on Sunday afternoon. Steve Bruce believes Sunday's clash with Leicester City is 'bigger than the cup final' last season. Yannick Sagbo (left) congratulates Nikica Jelavic on his late goal in Hull's 3-1 win at Sunderland. Hull have the opportunity to put nine points between themselves and bottom club Leicester with a win. Hull (4-4-2): McGregor; Elmohamaday, Bruce, Davies, Rosenior; Brady, Livermore, Meyler, Quinn; Ramirez; Aluko. And Bruce said: ‘It’s a bigger game for me than the cup final. Yes, I know that’s quite a statement, but that’s what it means to me. ‘If we turn them over to go nine points clear of them at the halfway stage, it’ s a big turnaround to be caught. ‘As we’ve seen, it’s been difficult enough to win one or two games, let alone turn around a three-game swing.’ He added: ‘We’ve only been in the division a total of four years in our history so we’re going to be in and around it at the bottom. We always expected to be. Bruce celebrates with son Alex after Nikica Jelavic makes sure of Hull's Boxing Day win at Sunderland. Gaston Ramirez jumps for joy after scoring Hull's equalising goal at the Stadium of Light. James Chester (left) celebrates with Ahmed Elmohamedy after scoring against Sunderland. James Chester is suspended, as is midfielder Tom Huddlestone, but Jake Livermore returns from his ban. Steve Bruce must decide whether to recall Nikica Jelavic - who scored in the win at Sunderland - or keep faith with Sone Aluko. ‘The league is starting to take shape at halfway. The teams you think are going to be at the top are there – with one or two surprises like there always is. ‘And I could have called the bottom eight – and we have to accept we are going to be one of them.’ Gaston Ramirez scored his first for the club during the 3-1 win at Sunderland, and Bruce believes only now are they starting to see the best of the Uruguayan playmaker. ‘We got him on loan from Southampton after he went there for £12million and it does take them time,’ he said. 'At Sunderland, he looked a really good player because he’s been given time to adjust to the food, the culture, the cold and the language barrier. We have to let him adjust and find his way.’","output":"In a recent article, Hull City manager Steve Bruce discussed the importance of their upcoming match against Leicester City. Bruce insisted that Hull City must accept their role as one of the teams involved in this season's relegation scrap, following their first win in 11 games against Sunderland on Boxing Day. Heading into their match against Leicester, Hull have a golden opportunity to put a significant gap between themselves and the bottom of the table. A win would propel them nine points clear of Leicester, marking substantial breathing room halfway through the season. Bruce emphasized the magnitude of the match by stating, \\"It's a bigger game for me than the cup final as if we turn them over to go nine points clear of them at the halfway stage, it's a big turnaround to be caught.\\" He acknowledged that winning consecutive games has been difficult but believes that the upcoming clash could prove crucial in Hull's fight against relegation. With Hull's history of only being in the top division for a total of four years, Bruce admits that they fully expected to be fighting in the lower half of the table. The league has already taken shape halfway through the season, and Hull must embrace their position and battle against relegation. Hull has also seen improvements from Uruguayan playmaker Gaston Ramirez, who scored his first goal for the club during a 3-1 win against Sunderland. Bruce believes that Ramirez is starting to find his footing as he adjusts to life in the Premier League. He credits Ramirez's adaptation to factors such as time, culture, food, and language barriers. A few changes could be seen in Hull's lineup against Leicester, with James Chester and Tom Huddlestone suspended, while Jake Livermore returns from his ban. Steve Bruce faces the tough decision of bringing back Nikica Jelavic or keeping Sone Aluko in the squad. In conclusion, Hull City's upcoming match against Leicester City is of great importance in their fight against relegation. With the possibility of gaining a nine-point lead against the bottom club and improving performances from key players, the Tigers will be hoping for a positive result to bolster their position in the league as the season continues."},{"instruction":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Nelson Island is not land lock Nelson Island is an island in the Sunshine Coast region of the South Coast region of British Columbia.

Solve this problem.","output":"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like we are looking for how many candies (g) are there: 1. First, we have this equation: 131*g - 351 = 230*g - 102*g 2. Now, let's look at the right side of the equation, we see two groups of candies, 230*g, and -102*g. We can combine these groups into one big group: 230 - 102 = 128, so we have 128*g. So now our equation looks like this: 131*g - 351 = 128*g 3. Now, we want to find how many candies (g) are there. So we need to get g alone on one side. Let's move the 128*g group from the right side to the left side. We do it by subtracting 128*g from both sides: 131*g - 128*g - 351 = 128*g - 128*g This simplifies to: 3*g - 351 = 0 (because 128*g - 128*g is 0) 4. Now, we are almost there. We have 3 groups of candies with g candies in each group. To find g, we need to get rid of the -351. We do this by adding 351 to both sides: 3*g - 351 + 351 = 0 + 351 This simplifies to: 3*g = 351 5. The last step is to find out how many candies (g) are in each group. Since we have 3 groups with an equal number of candies in them, we can find g by dividing the total number of candies (351) by the number of groups (3): g = 351 ÷ 3 6. Finally, we find out that: g = 117 So, there are 117 candies (g) in each group."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Jerzy Antczak ( born 25 December 1929 in Wodzimierz Woyski ) is a Polish film director .

Stevie Nicks wrote the title track of the album; however, after receiving word that Colter and Jennings might divorce, Nicks released her own version of the song as a duet with Don Henley. It peaked at No. 6 on Pop chart, also in 1981.

And he rebuffed criticism of the agency's methods, saying, \\"We do use deception at times to catch crooks, but we are acting responsibly and legally.\\" Comey said the agency had determined that the suspect was a narcissist and so set out to snare him making use of that. The agent who posed as an AP reporter \\"asked if the suspect would be willing to review a draft article about the threats and attacks, to be sure that the anonymous suspect was portrayed fairly,\\" he wrote. As a result of the suspect clicking on a link relating to the fake story, the agency was able to track him down using court-authorized tools, Comey said. \\"No actual story was published, and no one except the suspect interacted with the undercover 'A.P.' employee or saw the fake draft story,\\" he wrote. \\"Only the suspect was fooled, and it led to his arrest and the end of a frightening period for a high school.\\" However, AP executive editor Kathleen Carroll slammed the agency's tactics, according to an AP report. \\"This latest revelation of how the FBI misappropriated the trusted name of The Associated Press doubles our concern and outrage, expressed earlier to Attorney General Eric Holder, about how the agency's unacceptable tactics undermine AP and the vital distinction between the government and the press,\\" Carroll said in a statement. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press sent a letter Thursday to Comey and Holder expressing its deep concern over what it said was an \\"inexcusable\\" failure to comply with their own offices' guidelines on impersonation of the news media. \\"The utilization of news media as a cover for delivery of electronic surveillance software is unacceptable. This practice endangers the media's credibility and creates the appearance that it is not independent of the government,\\" it said. \\"It undermines media organizations' ability to independently report on law enforcement. It lends itself to the appearance that media organizations are compelled to speak on behalf of the government.\\" In a letter sent to the Justice Department last week, the AP requested Holder's word that the Justice Department would never again misrepresent itself as the news agency, an AP report said. The AP also asked for policies to ensure the department does not impersonate other news organizations in the future. \\"The FBI both misappropriated the trusted name of The Associated Press and created a situation where our credibility could have been undermined on a large scale,\\" AP General Counsel Karen Kaiser wrote. \\"The FBI may have intended this false story as a trap for only one person.

He captained the Australian team in two Tests, winning both. Trumble took 141 wickets in Test cricket--a world record at the time of his retirement--at an average of 21.78 runs per wicket. He is one of only four bowlers to twice take a hat-trick in Test cricket. Early in the 1889-90 Australian season, Trumble endured a period where he was not able to take wickets consistently. With selection of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time, Trumble was anxious about this poor run of form. Noting his anxiety while playing, a friend offered him a beer during the lunch break to revive his spirits. Previously a teetotaler, Trumble enjoyed his first taste and ordered another before re-entering the field of play. Feeling relaxed, although wondering about his steadiness of step, Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure his selection in the Australian team. Trumble finished the season with 27 wickets at an average of 14.20 per wicket. The 1890 Australian team touring England was relatively inexperienced. The team missed the all-round ability of George Giffen, who had refused to join the squad, thinking it unlikely the tour would be a sporting or financial success. The Australians won 13 matches on tour, losing 16 and drawing 9. Trumble made his Test cricket debut in the First Test against the English team at Lord's Cricket Ground. He took only one wicket, dismissing Bobby Peel caught and bowled for 1. Batting at number eleven in the first innings he made 1 not out and in the second, 5 runs batting at number ten. Despite this lack of success, he retained his spot in the team for the Second Test at The Oval where he failed to take a wicket. He was selected for the Third Test at Old Trafford but continuous rain saw the match abandoned without a ball being bowled. Trumble played 28 first-class matches during the tour, scoring 288 runs at an average of 8.47 and took 52 wickets at an average of 21.75. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack wrote, \\"Reports from Australia had led us to expect a great deal of ... Trumble\\" but his \\"straightness and regular length [were] insufficient to compensate for an obvious lack of 'devil' and variety\\". Trumble was not selected for the Australian team to play Lord Sheffield's touring English team in 1891-92. He did not return to the Australian team until his selection in the squad to tour England in 1893. Before the Test matches he took 14 wickets for 116 runs (14/116) against the Players followed by 12/84 against Kent at Gravesend. He played in all three Test matches in 1893, taking 6 wickets at an average of 39.00. Trumble scored 58 runs in the Tests with a highest score of 35 but had more success in the other matches, scoring 774 runs, including one century in all first-class matches on tour. Wisden noted that \\"An immense improvement on his form of three years before was shown by Hugh Trumble, who bowled consistently well all through the tour\\" and \\"... the reports of Hugh Trumble's improvement in batting were amply borne out, his hitting in many matches being remarkably fine\\". When Andrew Stoddart's English team visited Australia in 1894-95, Trumble played only one Test, the Second at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In the first innings, England scored 75 runs with Trumble taking 3 wickets. England fought back in their second innings, scoring 475 runs to win the Test by 94 runs; Trumble failed to take a wicket.

Plato was the pupil of which famous teacher?","output":"Plato was the pupil of the famous ancient Greek philosopher Socrates. Socrates, born in Athens circa 470/469 BCE, is considered to be one of the founding figures of Western philosophy. Socrates had a profound influence on the intellectual development of young Plato. This relationship played a pivotal role in defining Plato's philosophic ideas and his philosophical methods. Socrates was known for his Socratic method, a dialectical approach to engage in discussions and elicit truth from logical arguments. Plato adopted and developed this methodology in his works, especially in the form of dialogues where Socrates often appeared as the central character. Plato's association with Socrates began around 407-405 BCE, when he became Socrates' pupil at 18 years old. Socrates did not leave behind any written works, but his teachings have been immortalized through Plato's dialogues such as \\"The Apology,\\" \\"Crito,\\" \\"Phaedo,\\" \\"The Symposium,\\" \\"The Republic,\\" and many others. The Platonic dialogues not only convey philosophical ideas and arguments but also give significant insight into the life and personality of Socrates. Socrates' open criticism of Athenian democracy and his rigorous questioning of traditional values led to him being accused of impiety and corrupting the youth. He was sentenced to death by drinking a cup of poison hemlock in 399 BCE. Plato was deeply affected by the trial and execution of his mentor, which ultimately led him to pursue a career in philosophy. Plato, in turn, became the founder of the first institution of higher learning in the Western world, the Academy in Athens. Some of his major works, including \\"The Republic\\" and \\"The Laws,\\" discuss the notion of an ideal state and propose ideas for creating a more just and equitable society. One of Plato's most significant contributions to the history of ideas is his notion of the \\"Theory of Forms\\" or \\"Theory of Ideas,\\" which suggests that non-material abstract forms (or ideas) possess the most fundamental kind of reality, as opposed to the material world. In conclusion, Socrates was the famous teacher of Plato, who played a significant role in shaping Plato's philosophic ideas and methods. Through the writing of his dialogues, Plato immortalized the teachings of Socrates, ensuring that his influence would extend far beyond the ancient world and continue to shape philosophical discussions in modern times. As such, the teachings of these two great thinkers remain closely intertwined, forming a remarkable legacy in the history of Western philosophy."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the prosecuting counsel's son?

Available options: (A). yes (B). no","output":"(A). yes One of the subjects of a treatise by Ibn Sina, also known as Avicenna, is metaphysics. Ibn Sina was a Persian polymath and one of the most significant thinkers in the history of Islamic philosophy. His work covered numerous disciplines, including medicine, astronomy, alchemy, and psychology. However, he is best remembered for his immense contributions to the field of philosophy. In his vast philosophical corpus, Ibn Sina wrote several treatises on the subjects of logic, ethics, and metaphysics, but his most famous work in philosophy is \\"Al‑Shifa\\" (The Healing) and \\"Al‑Najat\\" (The Deliverance). Within these treatises, he covers both the theoretical and practical aspects of these disciplines and builds upon the works of earlier philosophers like Aristotle and al-Farabi. These works played a crucial role in transmitting the ideas of Greek philosophy to the Islamic intellectual tradition. \\"Al‑Shifa\\" is a large encyclopedic work divided into four sections: logic, natural sciences, mathematics, and metaphysics. In his treatise on metaphysics, Ibn Sina elaborates on the nature of existence, causality, and the relationship between the material and immaterial worlds, developing and extending Aristotle's metaphysics. Notably, he introduces the argument for the existence of a \\"Necessary Existent,\\" which is a precursor to the arguments for the existence of God in later Western philosophy. Aside from his discussions on the nature of being and existence, Ibn Sina's treatise on metaphysics delves into the organization and structure of the universe, including the celestial spheres and the principles of motion. He also investigates questions about the nature of the human soul, arguing that the soul is independent of the body and can achieve immortality. In conclusion, one of the subjects of a treatise by Ibn Sina is metaphysics, which can be found in his famous works, \\"Al‑Shifa\\" and \\"Al‑Najat.\\" His contributions to this field not only had a significant impact on Islamic intellectual traditions but also influenced Western philosophy in the later Middle Ages and Renaissance."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this \\"Don't self-medicate. Talk to your doctor. Ask your physician about antidepressants. Ask your doctor about benzodiazepine.\\" Article:","output":"Title: The Risks of Self-Medication: The Importance of Consulting With Your Physician In a world where information is just a mouse click away, it has become increasingly common for individuals to try and diagnose or treat their own health conditions. However, even with an abundance of resources available, self-medicating can prove extremely harmful. This article seeks to explain why it is essential to rely on expert guidance when it comes to medication, particularly in regards to antidepressants and benzodiazepines. When it comes to physical or mental health, professionals have years of education, training, and experience that equip them to make the best health choices on your behalf. The mantra \\"Don't self-medicate, talk to your doctor\\" holds significant truth and is something we should all consider before deciding to treat ourselves. For instance, consider the medications used for treating anxiety and depression. Antidepressants are complex drugs, and their use needs to be monitored by healthcare professionals. They have numerous potential side effects and can interact with other medications, making them, at times dangerous when used without medical guidance. Furthermore, individuals react differently to these medications, so what may work for one might not be the best choice for another. The same applies to benzodiazepines, medications primarily used for treating anxiety or insomnia. These drugs work by slowing down the brain's activity and can be highly addictive. Their misuse may lead to physical dependence or even an overdose, especially when used in conjunction with other substances like alcohol. Setting aside potential side effects and addictive qualities, another critical factor to consider is that both these types of drugs require careful administration and dosage adjustments that should only be done by a licensed medical professional. Moreover, the cessation of these drugs often requires a gradual decrease in dosage, quit 'cold turkey' can provoke withdrawal symptoms that could be dangerous. Asking a doctor about an antidepressant or benzodiazepine is a critical step in treating any mental health condition or any other illness requiring these medications. This conversation ensures that you are provided the correct drug and the right dose while also making sure any potential side effects are anticipated and managed appropriately. It also gives you an opportunity to discuss your overall well-being and explore other potential treatment options that might be a better fit for you. In conclusion, the apparent convenience and immediate access provided by self-medication often overshadow its potential risks. It's of paramount importance to encourage dialogue between patients and their physicians. It's always best to remember: \\"Don't self-medicate, ask your doctor,\\" before deciding on what steps to take concerning your health. Remember, your health comes first, and only a qualified physician should guide your medical decisions, not just search engine results or anecdotal evidence. Engaging in open conversations about antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and your health in general can pave the way towards safer, healthier decisions."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Question: What's the disease mentioned that a vaccine was created for Context: Early progress toward the development of vaccines occurred throughout this period, primarily in the form of academic and government-funded basic research directed toward the identification of the pathogens responsible for common communicable diseases. In 1885 Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux created the first rabies vaccine. The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths. In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde. In 1944, Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis. Hilleman would later move to Merck where he would play a key role in the development of vaccines against measles, mumps, chickenpox, rubella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and meningitis.

Exploration occurs in all non-sessile animal species, including humans. In human history, its most dramatic rise was during the Age of Discovery when European explorers sailed and charted much of the rest of the world for a variety of reasons. Since then, major explorations after the Age of Discovery have occurred for reasons mostly aimed at information discovery. - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - Space exploration is the ongoing discovery and exploration of celestial structures in outer space by means of continuously evolving and growing space technology. While the study of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, the physical exploration of space is conducted both by unmanned robotic space probes and human spaceflight. - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole. - Human spaceflight (also referred to as manned spaceflight) is space travel with a crew or passengers aboard the spacecraft. Spacecraft carrying people may be operated directly, by human crew, or it may be either remotely operated from ground stations on Earth or be autonomous, able to carry out a specific mission with no human involvement. - The International Astronomical Union (IAU UAI) is an international association of professional astronomers, at the PhD level and beyond, active in professional research and education in astronomy. Among other activities, it acts as the internationally recognized authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies (stars, planets, asteroids, etc.) and any surface features on them. - Stamatios ( Tom ) M. Krimigis ( Greek : ) is a Greek - American scientist in space exploration . He has contributed to many of the United States ' unmanned space exploration programs of the Solar System and beyond . He has contributed to exploration missions to almost every planet of the Solar System . In 1999 , the International Astronomical Union named the asteroid 8323 Krimigis ( previously 1979 UH ) in his honor . - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury. - An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole. What entity does 'stamatios krimigis' has the relation 'occupation' with? The answer to this question is:","output":"Stamatios Krimigis has the relation 'occupation' with space exploration as a Greek-American scientist. He has contributed to many of the United States' unmanned space exploration programs of the Solar System and beyond, working on exploration missions to almost every planet in the Solar System."},{"instruction":"Lexie is 6 years older than her brother and her sister is twice her age. If Lexie is 8, what is the age difference between her brother and her sister? Give me reasons, before answering the question","output":"Let's break down the information given: 1. Lexie's age: Lexie is 8 years old 2. Lexie's brother's age: Lexie is 6 years older than her brother. 3. Lexie's sister's age: Her sister is twice her age. Now let's determine the age of each sibling step-by-step: Step 1: Lexie's brother's age: Since Lexie is 6 years older than her brother and Lexie is 8 years old, we subtract 6 from 8 to find her brother's age: 8 - 6 = 2 So, Lexie's brother is 2 years old. Step 2: Lexie's sister's age: Since Lexie's sister is twice her age and Lexie is 8 years old, we multiply 8 by 2 to find her sister's age: 8 * 2 = 16 So, Lexie's sister is 16 years old. Step 3: Age difference between Lexie's brother and sister: To find the age difference between Lexie's brother and sister, we subtract the brother's age from the sister's age: 16 (sister's age) - 2 (brother's age) = 14 The age difference between Lexie's brother and sister is 14 years."},{"instruction":"Q:Article: China Daily Classified Page Advertising Rates Published every Wednesday and Friday.

Which lake had less occurrences of divers drowning? Ryan explored two lakes; Big lake, and Arrow lake to the south. Arrow lake had a river flowing into it, while Big lake presented evidence of underwater geothermal activity. Many divers drowned in Arrow lake because of temperature shock. Hint: Thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3] The answer is:","output":"Big Lake had less occurrences of divers drowning. The paragraph mentions that many divers drowned in Arrow Lake because of temperature shock, while Big Lake presented evidence of underwater geothermal activity. Although thermoclines can occur in both lakes, the text specifically points out the drowning incidents in Arrow Lake due to this phenomenon."},{"instruction":"I heard that Lee loved to put makeup on his clients to make them look beautiful.

Question: If cancer is detected late and treatment immediately late, the chances of a cure would be increased or decreased? Paragraph : The sooner cancer is treated, the greater the chances of a cure. Answer:","output":"If cancer is detected late and treatment is initiated immediately, the chances of a cure could be decreased in comparison to early-stage detection and treatment. The paragraph states that \\"The sooner cancer is treated, the greater the chances of a cure.\\" This implies that early detection and treatment play a critical role in increasing the likelihood of a successful outcome. The late detection of cancer means that the cancer has had more time to grow and potentially spread to other parts of the body, making it more challenging to treat effectively. As cancer progresses, it becomes more aggressive and more resistant to treatment options, such as chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. Despite the decreased chances of a cure with late detection, initiating treatment immediately after identification can still improve the prognosis and overall survival rate. Treatment options at advanced stages may focus more on controlling the growth and spread of cancer, palliative care for symptom management, and improving the patient's quality of life. In summary, if cancer is detected late but treatment is initiated immediately, the chances of a cure would be decreased compared to situations with early detection and treatment. However, immediate intervention is still crucial in providing the best possible outcome and improving the patient's overall survival rate and quality of life."},{"instruction":"Tweet: really cba anymore! pain!

Using census data for more than one million people in Austria, Denmark and Australia, scientists at the Max Planck Institute in the northern German town of Rostock found the month of birth was related to life expectancy over the age of 50. Seasonal differences in what mothers ate during pregnancy, and infections occurring at different times of the year could both have an impact on the health of a new-born baby and could influence its life expectancy in older age. \\"A mother giving birth in spring spends the last phase of her pregnancy in winter, when she will eat less vitamins than in summer,\\" said Gabriele Doblhammer, one of a team of scientists who carried out the research. \\"When she stops breast-feeding and starts giving her baby normal food, it's in the hot weeks of summer when babies are prone to infections of the digestive system.\\" In Austria, adults born in autumn (October-December) lived about seven months longer than those born in spring (April-June), and in Denmark adults with birthdays in autumn outlived those born in spring by about four months. In the southern hemisphere, the picture was similar. Adults born in the Australian autumn--the European spring--lived about four months longer than those born in the Australian spring. The study focused on people born at the beginning of the 20th century, using death certificates and census data. Although nutrition at all times of the year has improved since then, the seasonal pattern persists, Doblhammer said. But on the other hand, according to a study of more 40,000 people, those born in spring and summer report themselves luckier than those born in autumn or winter. Professor Richard Wise-man who led the research explained that the temperature at the time of birth might influence the development of the brain and seasonal factors make a difference as well. The census data of the following countries is used for research EXCEPT _ . A) Germany. B) Denmark. C) Australia. D) Austria. The answer is:","output":"A) Germany. The research mentioned in the question used census data from Austria, Denmark, and Australia. The study was conducted by scientists at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, which is located in Germany. However, the census data from Germany itself was not used in this research. Instead, the study focused on data from the three other countries mentioned, finding that individuals born in the autumn months had longer life expectancies and were less likely to fall chronically ill as they aged. The research primarily examined the link between the month of birth and life expectancy over the age of 50. The primary factors considered were seasonal differences in maternal diet during pregnancy, as well as the prevalence of infections during various times of the year. The researchers hypothesized that these factors played a significant role in the health of newborn babies and, subsequently, their life expectancies in their later years. The study found that, in Austria, adults born in October to December (autumn) lived approximately seven months longer than those born in April to June (spring). In Denmark, a similar pattern emerged, with autumn-born individuals outliving spring-born individuals by about four months. In Australia, which is in the southern hemisphere, the results were still consistent with autumn-born adults living about four months longer than those born in the spring. The research was conducted on individuals born at the beginning of the 20th century, utilizing death certificates and census data. Despite improvements in nutrition and overall health since that time, the scientists observed that the seasonal patterns in life expectancy persist. Interestingly, another study found that people born in spring and summer reported themselves as luckier than those born in autumn or winter. This suggests that temperature and other seasonal factors may influence brain development and overall life experience as well."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: A car that runs on coffee is unveiled(shown to the public for the first time)today but at between 25 and 50 times the cost of running a car on petrol, the invention won't please any motor industry accountants. Nicknamed the Car-puccino, it has been created using a 1988 Volkswagen Scirocco bought for PS400 and it was chosen because it looked like the time-traveling DeLorean in the movieBack To The Future.The car will be driven the 210 miles between Manchester and London powered only by roasted coffee granules .It has been built by a team from the BBC1 science programme Bang Goes The Theory and will go on display at the Big Bang science fair in Manchester to show how fuels other than traditional petrol can power vehicles. The team calculates the Car-puccino will do three miles per kilo of ground coffee -- about 56 cups of espressos per mile.The journey will use about 70 kilos of ground coffee which, at supermarket prices of between PS13 and PS26 a kilo depending on brand and quality, will cost between PS910 and PS1,820, or between 25 and 50 times the PS36 cost of petrol for the journey.In total, the trip will cost 11,760 espressos, and the team will have to take 'coffee breaks' roughly every 30 to 45 miles to pour in more granules.They will also have to stop about every 60 miles to clean out the 'coffee filters' to rid them of the soot and tar which is also generated by the process.So despite a top speed of 60mph, the many stops mean the going will be slow, with the journey taking around ten hours. Sadly, the inventors will still have to pay duty on their coffee fuel---even though tax collectors at Her Majesty's Revenue and Custom haven't yet worked out how much.

The book was first published in the year 1813 and is considered one of Jane Austen's most popular and enduring works, alongside her other novels \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" \\"Emma,\\" \\"Mansfield Park,\\" \\"Northanger Abbey,\\" and \\"Persuasion.\\" \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is set in early 19th-century England and tells the story of Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist, and her four sisters as they navigate the complexities of love, social class, and marriage amidst societal expectations. Elizabeth is the second daughter of the Bennet family, and she is intelligent, quick-witted, and possesses strong character. The novel primarily focuses on her relationship with the proud and wealthy Mr. Darcy, and their journey through a series of misunderstandings, judgments, and changing perceptions about each other. The famous first line of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" sets the tone for the novel's theme, which revolves around the idea that a man of great wealth must be looking for a suitable wife to marry. This assumption, however, is often challenged and questioned throughout the story, leading to self-discovery and a deeper understanding of each other's true character for both Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Austen's exploration of the expectations and consequences surrounding marriage during this time period, as well as her portrayal of various aspects of human nature, like pride and prejudice, provides valuable insight into the society of early 19th-century England. Jane Austen's witty and engaging writing style, combined with her keen observations of human behavior and social manners, make \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" a timeless work beloved by readers across generations and cultures."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following tweet?

From my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness. Before I was treated I thought I just needed someone else, the right person to come along to love me in just the right way, being mindful of trauma and never triggering my symptoms. I was living in a fantasy world. You cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!! I have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed. I am no longer the girl who needs extra reassurance daily that he's coming home from work. I can breathe when he goes to hang out with his friends.

The drivers that came in the box would not load, so I let the OS finsih the install without loading drivers then used Window's update function to add them. Windows still didn't like the drivers, but I forced them through and the device changed status to Code 10, Cannot Start.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"1. How do you pronounce love? The word \\"love\\" is pronounced as /lʌv/. To pronounce it correctly, follow these steps: - Begin with the 'l' sound. Place the tip of your tongue against the upper front part of your mouth (the alveolar ridge, just behind your upper front teeth) and release air through the sides of your tongue. - Next comes the short 'uh' sound, also known as the schwa sound. It is represented by the symbol /ʌ/. Relax your tongue and vocal tract and pronounce a short, neutral vowel sound. - Finish with the 'v' sound. Gently bite your lower lip and vibrate your vocal cords to produce the sound. When put together, these three sounds create the pronunciation of \\"love\\" - /lʌv/. 2. How do you pronounce “Annelise”? \\"Annelise\\" can have a few different pronunciations, depending on the speaker's language or accent. However, the most common pronunciation in English is /ˈænəˌliːz/. Here's how to pronounce it: - Start with the 'a' sound in \\"cat\\" (/æ/). Open your mouth wide and say the short 'a' sound while keeping the tip of your tongue low in your mouth. - Next, pronounce the 'n' sound by pressing the front of your tongue against the alveolar ridge while allowing air to pass through your nose. - For the second 'a', produce the schwa sound (/ə/). Keep your tongue and vocal tract relaxed and release a short, neutral vowel sound. - Then, pronounce the 'l' sound similarly to the first step of saying “love”. - Follow this with the long 'ee' sound (/iː/). Keep your tongue high and slightly forward in your mouth while producing a tense, long 'ee' sound. - Lastly, say the 'z' sound by placing the tip of your tongue behind your upper front teeth and vibrating your vocal cords. The /ˈænəˌliːz/ pronunciation should result in a suitable rendering of \\"Annelise\\". 3. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. A paraphrase is a restatement of the same meaning using different words or a different form. The first question asks how to pronounce the word \\"love,\\" whereas the second question asks how to pronounce the name \\"Annelise.\\" The two questions are unrelated and seek pronunciation guidance for two different words with distinct meanings."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - The German National Prize for Art and Science was an award created by Adolf Hitler in 1937 as a replacement for the Nobel Prize (he had forbidden Germans to accept the latter award in 1936 after an anti-Nazi German writer, Carl von Ossietzky, was awarded the 1935 Nobel Peace Prize). The award was designed by Hermann Müller and created in the form of a pendant studded with diamonds. In fact, it was so heavy that a special mount had to be created so that it would stay on the wearer's jacket. An extremely ornate presentation box contained the pendant and a wide red and white sash also complemented the award. - Hansa und Brandenburgische Flugzeugwerke (more usually just Hansa-Brandenburg) was a German aircraft manufacturing company that operated during World War I. It was created in May 1914 by the purchase of \\"Brandenburgische Flugzeugwerke\\" by Camillo Castiglioni, who relocated the factory from Liebau to Brandenburg an der Havel. Brandenburg's chief designer, Ernst Heinkel was retained by the new enterprise. By Autumn 1915, it had become the largest aircraft manufacturer in Germany, with a capital of 1,500,000 Marks, 1,000 employees, and two more factories - one in Rummelsburg, Berlin, and one in Wandsbek, Hamburg. - Dr. Ernst Heinkel (January 24, 1888 January 30, 1958) was a German aircraft designer, manufacturer, Wehrwirtschaftsführer in the Third Reich, and member of the Nazi party. His company Heinkel Flugzeugwerke produced the Heinkel He 178, the world's first turbojet aircraft and jet plane, and the Heinkel He 176, the first rocket aircraft. He was awarded the German National Prize for Art and Science in 1938. - The Hansa - Brandenburg B.I was an unarmed military trainer and reconnaissance biplane of World War I flown by the Austro - Hungarian Air Service . Early models were known internally to the Hansa - Brandenburg firm as the type D , while later models with a more powerful engine were designated FD . This aircraft was one of the earliest designs of Ernst Heinkel , who was working for Hansa - Brandenburg at the time . It was an entirely conventional two - bay biplane with staggered wings of unequal span . The pilot and observer sat in tandem in a long open cockpit . The aircraft was produced under license by Aero both during the war , and afterwards ( when it became known as the Aero Ae 01 ) , and also by Letov , as Š10 . Experience gained with this design would provide Aero with the basis for a number of derivative civil and military designs throughout the 1920s . The design formed the basis for the C.I and C.II armed reconnaissance types . - The National Socialist German Workers' Party (abbreviated NSDAP), commonly referred to in English as the Nazi Party, was a political party in Germany that was active between 1920 and 1945 and practised the ideology of Nazism. Its precursor, the German Workers' Party (\\"Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.

How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of knowing if you have gas in your car, there are several methods and steps you can follow: 1. Check the fuel gauge while the car is running: The most common and easiest method is to check your car's fuel gauge. The fuel gauge indicates the level of fuel available in the fuel tank. When you start or turn on your car, take a look at the dashboard. Locate the fuel gauge, which typically has an icon of a fuel pump. The gauge usually displays the letter ‘E’ at one end, representing “Empty,” and ‘F’ at the other end, representing “Full.” The needle of the gauge will point to the current fuel level in the tank. If the needle is closer to the ‘E,’ your fuel level is low and it's time to refill the tank. 2. Using the digital display (if available): Some modern cars have digital displays that may show the remaining fuel range. These displays usually indicate the estimated distance your car can travel with the remaining fuel in the tank. This information might be displayed on either the dashboard or an infotainment screen. You can use this information to gauge how much fuel you have left. 3. Evaluate the fuel warning light: Most cars have a fuel warning light that illuminates when the fuel level is low. The warning light usually comes on when your fuel tank is down to its last few gallons (or liters). It is typically an amber or yellow light on the dashboard with a fuel pump icon. When this light comes on, it's a sign that you need to refill the tank soon. 4. Measure the fuel distance traveled since the last refill: If you tracked your mileage from the most recent full tank refill, you can roughly assess the amount of fuel left in your tank. To do this, you need to know your car's average fuel consumption. Subtract the distance traveled from the car's total range to calculate how much fuel is left. Note that this method isn't very accurate as driving conditions and habits vary and fuel consumption may differ over time. 5. Use of an OBD-II scanner: OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostics) scanners allow you to connect to your car's onboard diagnostic system, obtain diagnostic information, and sometimes even check the fuel level. Connect the scanner to your car's OBD-II port (found in most vehicles made after 1996) and use a smartphone app or other software provided by the scanner's manufacturer to display fuel-related information. 6. Perform a manual check of the fuel tank: Though a less common method, you can perform a manual check of your fuel level. First, make sure your car's engine is turned off and locate your fuel cap. Compressed gas might release when opening the fuel cap, so it's better to do this with extreme caution. You can then use a dipstick or flashlight to inspect the fuel level inside the tank. However, this can be potentially hazardous due to fuel fumes or possible ignition sources, so it is not recommended for most people. In conclusion, to know if you have gas in your car, monitor your fuel gauge, digital display, or fuel warning light, which are the safest and easiest methods. Remember to regularly refuel your car to avoid running out of gas while driving."},{"instruction":"Question: What are cells in plants and animals?

The techniques make farming possible in places where there is not enough water. Because of this, he won this year's World Food Prize. Hillel is using the techniques in his orchards near his home in Israel. Irrigating drop by drop -- called drip irrigation -- has changed agriculture by greatly reducing the amount of water needed. Farmers now rely on it in places from Spain, to Africa, to America. \\"We in California grow about 50 percent of the fruits and vegetables of the continental United States,\\" says Jan Hopmans from University of California at Davis. \\"And these drip irrigation techniques make it possible.\\" Hillel got his start in dry land farming in Israel's Negev Desert in the 1950s. \\"The key was making good use of water,\\" he says. \\"There's much land. Water is limited.\\" These farmers did not have the advantage of running irrigation water through channels to their crops. So Hillel and others gave plants just what they needed and just where they needed it. \\"The idea is to use water little by little,\\" Hillel says. It worked so well that Hillel was soon traveling around the world, showing others how to do it. Experts say drip irrigation's importance is growing, as climate change and rising population make water supplies become few in many parts of the world. \\"This is where water use, climate change and crop production all meet at one point,\\" Hillel says. \\"And this has been really the essence of my career.\\" A career whose importance can be measured drop by drop.

Introduction In sports, every point scored contributes to a team's success. From the opening whistle to the final buzzer, every shot, every goal, and every successful play matters. But today, we'll focus on the first points of any game - a moment that can set the tone for the rest of the match. Before diving into the subject, it is essential to specify which game and which particular match we are referring to. However, since this information was not provided, we will instead examine some general concepts and potential strategies when scoring the first points of a game. The Importance of the First Points At first glance, the score at the beginning of a match may not seem particularly significant. After all, there are many opportunities to catch up and overtake the opposing team. However, the first points scored can help shape a team's morale, create momentum, and establish a psychological advantage over the opponents. Depending on the game, scoring early on can serve as a way to put pressure on the opposing team, forcing them to adapt their strategies to catch up. Factors Affecting the First Points Several factors come into play when determining which player will score the first points in a match. These factors might include: 1. Position: Depending on the sport, certain positions may have a higher likelihood of scoring the first points. For example, in a basketball game, the first possession often goes to the team that wins the initial jump ball. Therefore, the player from that team who is best suited to make that first shot - often a guard or a forward - would have a better chance to score the very first points. 2. Skill Level: The abilities of a player undeniably play a role in scoring points. The more skilled and experienced a player is, the more likely they are to contribute to scoring first. Their familiarity with the game and their opponent's tactics might give them an edge in finding an opportunity to score. 3. Game Plan: A coach's strategy and game plan can allocate certain roles to specific players at the beginning of the match. Coaches often have a designated player to take the first shot or make that initial play, putting their team in the lead. The designated player's past performance and current form could also influence this decision. 4. Opponent's Defense: The opposing team's defensive capabilities and matchups will factor into which player is most likely to score first. If the defense is strong against a particular position or player, the opportunity might fall to someone else in the team to make that first scoring play. Conclusion Answering the question of which player scored the first points of a game requires information about the sport, the specific match, and the players involved. The importance of these initial points lies in their ability to establish momentum, boost morale, and create a psychological advantage. Various factors, such as position, skill level, game plan, and opponent's defense, impact the likelihood of a specific player scoring the first points in a match. Ultimately, regardless of which player scores first, it is the collective team effort, adaptability, and determination that steer a team towards victory."},{"instruction":"Produce a detailed sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = Fitzbillies, eatType = coffee shop, eatType = restaurant, food = Italian, priceRange = £20-25, customer rating = high, area = riverside, familyFriendly = yes Sentence:","output":"Fitzbillies is a fun place by the riverside where you can go with your family to eat yummy Italian food like pizza and pasta, as if it's a restaurant and a coffee shop at the same time.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), slated for launch in 2021, is one such groundbreaking marvel of engineering. With unparalleled capabilities that far surpass its predecessors, the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope, JWST is expected to uncover secrets from the very beginning of our universe, including the possibility of detecting light from the earliest galaxies. History of Telescopes The first known practical telescope was invented in the early seventeenth century by Dutch mathematician and astronomer Hans Lippershey. However, it was the works of Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei that garnered the attention of the world to the power of telescopes. Since then, telescopes have come a long way and undergone a multitude of advancements, including the iconic Hubble Space Telescope, which has been in orbit since 1990. JWST is envisioned as the scientific successor to Hubble. Named after NASA administrator James E. Webb, who played a pivotal role in the Apollo program, JWST is a collaborative effort between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The James Webb Space Telescope JWST is equipped with a large, segmented, and gold-coated mirror that measures 6.5 meters (over 21 feet) in diameter. This colossal mirror allows the telescope to collect more light and observe objects with greater detail than its predecessors. JWST is also configured to observe in the infrared spectrum, which is crucial in detecting light from the early universe. These capabilities make it possible for JWST to probe deeper into the cosmos than ever before, reaching regions that have been inaccessible until now. Discovering the Light from the Earliest Galaxies The universe came into existence nearly 13.8 billion years ago with the Big Bang. As the universe expanded and cooled, hydrogen atoms combined to form the first stars and galaxies. Detecting the light from these ancient celestial bodies is vital in understanding the origins of the universe and its evolution. Due to the expansion of the universe, the light emitted by these early galaxies has been stretched and redshifted to the infrared spectrum, making it challenging for most telescopes to detect. JWST is uniquely tailored to tackle this challenge. Its infrared capabilities, combined with its powerful mirror, enable the telescope to potentially capture light from faint galaxies that formed approximately 100 to 250 million years after the Big Bang. This remarkable feat will provide astronomers with invaluable information about the birth and evolution of these galaxies, helping us uncover the mysteries of the early universe. The First Galaxies and Their Impact on the Universe Observing the earliest galaxies will shed light on how they were formed, their cluster patterns, and how they interacted with dark matter. Studying these galaxies will also provide insights into the process of reionization – when the universe transitioned from being opaque to transparent due to the formation of stars and galaxies. Reionization allowed photons to travel through space, paving the way for the formation of more complex structures like larger galaxies, stars, and eventually, planets. The James Webb Space Telescope's groundbreaking capabilities are expected to revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos. By potentially capturing the elusive light from the earliest galaxies, we can hope to answer some of the most profound questions about the origins and evolution of our universe. With these extraordinary accomplishments on the horizon, the age of cosmic discovery is poised to enter a thrilling new chapter."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: Stock Chart for Goldman Sachs Group Inc/The (GS) Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein’s 19 million compensation for 2010, almost double the prior year, ended two years in which the firm’s top executives gave up cash bonuses. Blankfein’s pay included 5.4 million in cash, 12.6 million in restricted stock, a 600,000 salary and about 464,000 in other benefits, a proxy statement from the New York- based firm showed. Blankfein’s 9.8 million pay for 2009 included 9 million in restricted stock plus salary and other compensation. Cash awards are back at Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, after a 38 percent drop in annual earnings and a year in which the stock price ended close to where it began. While pay is up from 2008, when Blankfein, 56, and six other senior officers got no bonuses, it remains below Blankfein’s record-setting 67.9 million award for 2007. “The fact that they would return to a more market-based pay is probably not surprising” after 2008 and 2009, said Rose Marie Orens, a senior partner at Compensation Advisory Partners LLC in New York. “They’re not quite back to anything remotely like what they paid in the prior years.” Goldman Sachs’s 2010 share performance -- a decline of less than half of 1 percent -- outstripped competitors including Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS), which was the second- biggest U.S. securities firm after Goldman Sachs before both converted to banks in 2008. Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), which reported a record profit last year, rose 1.8 percent during the year. ‘Difficult Market Conditions’ “While our performance in 2010 was not as strong as in 2009 due to difficult market conditions for much of the year, we continued to create value for our shareholders and prudently manage our firm from a risk perspective,” Goldman Sachs said in the proxy. All 30 members of the management committee received only restricted stock for their 2009 bonuses and four of them --Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar, 55, President and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn, 50, and Vice Chairmen J. Michael Evans, 53, and John S. Weinberg, 54 -- received the same 9 million award as Blankfein. For 2010, Goldman Sachs once again matched those four executives’ bonuses to Blankfein’s 12.6 million in restricted stock and 5.4 million in cash. All four also received a 600,000 salary in 2010. ‘Partnership Mentality’ “They’ve had a history of paying their top five like partners,” Orens said. “It’s unusual, but it really comes from their partnership mentality.” The firm disclosed in January that Blankfein’s salary will increase to 2 million in 2011 and that Cohn, Viniar, Evans and Weinberg will each receive a 1.85 million salary starting this year. Each of them had received a 600,000 salary since 1999, the year the firm became a public company. Blankfein and eight deputies reaped a total of 125 million during 2010 from their investments in private equity and hedge funds managed by the firm, the proxy disclosed. Blankfein’s payments, which included profits and any return of capital, totaled 27.2 million, outstripping his compensation. After Blankfein, the largest fund distributions were 23.3 million to General Counsel Gregory K. Palm; 20.2 million to Cohn; 16.7 million to Viniar; and 13.7 million to Evans. The others disclosed in the filing were 10.9 million to Vice Chairman Michael S. Sherwood; 6.4 million apiece to Weinberg and General Counsel Esta E. Stecher, and 430,000 to Alan M. Cohen, global head of compliance. Goldman Sachs’s executives stand to earn more cash bonuses in future years under a long-term incentive plan, the LTIP, disclosed in the proxy. The payments are contingent on two financial measures: return on equity and book value per share. Board’s Choice The initial measurement period is three years and the board can extend it through the end of 2018. The notional value of the award for all five executives named in the proxy was 7 million, a figure that wasn’t included in the 2010 compensation because it won’t be delivered for three years. For the executives to receive the awards in full, return on equity, or ROE, must average 10 percent and book value per share must rise an average of 7 percent, the proxy shows. They will receive 150 percent of the bonus if the average ROE is 15 percent or more and book value per share climbs an average of 12 percent or more. The ROE target is below the firm’s long-stated goal of achieving 20 percent return on tangible equity, which equates to more than 15 percent ROE, over the economic cycle. Eleanor Bloxham, president of the Corporate Governance Alliance in Columbus, Ohio, said Goldman Sachs seemed to be responding to regulators’ efforts to align pay to the firm’s longer-term performance. ‘Paying out Cash’ “Going forward I’m pleased that the LTIP cash will include these deferral mechanisms so that it doesn’t encourage risk- taking and that risk measures look at longer-term horizons,” she said. “There’s still a way to go in this year’s plan because they’re paying out cash.” To be sure, all of the executives own company stock worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Blankfein owned 3.29 million shares as of March 7, the proxy disclosed, worth 527.6 million at the 160.23 share price on April 1. Cohn’s 1.96 million shares were worth 313.4 million and Viniar’s 1.89 million shares were worth 302.4 million. The SEC requires that the company’s proxy disclose how much compensation executives received during the fiscal year. Under that methodology, which includes awards received during 2010 for performance in prior years, Blankfein received a total of 14.1 million in compensation. Goldman Sachs’s board has unanimously recommended that the firm give shareholders a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation every year. The firm is set to hold its annual shareholder meeting at 9:30 a.m. on May 6 in Jersey City, New Jersey.

The Sisters of Saint Joseph of Boston, Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, the Sisters of St Francis of Philadelphia and the Benedictine Sisters of Mt Angel – all investors in the bank – have put their name to a proposal to review its remuneration policies, after it emerged its five most senior employees were collectively awarded 69.5m (£43m) in pay last year. The securities and exchange commission disclosed the challenge in a filing ahead of Goldman Sachs' annual meeting next month. The nuns asked that \\"shareholders request that the board's compensation committee initiate a review of our company's senior executive compensation policies and make available a summary report of that review by 1 October, 2011 (omitting confidential information and processed at a reasonable cost). We request that the report include: 1. An evaluation of whether our senior executive compensation packages (including, but not limited to, options, benefits, perks, loans and retirement agreements) are 'excessive' and should be modified. 2. An exploration of how sizeable layoffs and the level of pay of our lowest paid workers impact senior executive pay. 3. An analysis of the way in which fluctuations in revenues impact: a) the company's compensation pool; b) the compensation of the company's top 25 senior executives; and c) the company's shareholders.\\" The nuns have made their feelings on Goldman's pay levels clear in previous years, with about as much success as the coalition government in its attempts to limit UK bank bonuses. Chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, who has claimed to be doing \\"God's work\\" at Goldman, saw his pay reach 14m in 2010, with four other senior executives receiving a similar amount. Goldman said it would resist the request. \\"Shareholders already have access to the information necessary to understand and assess the compensation decisions made with respect to our senior executives, and the firm as a whole. Our board believes that the preparation of the requested report would be a distraction to our compensation committee and our board, would entail an unjustified cost to our firm and would not provide shareholders with any meaningful information.\\" ||||| Summary:","output":"In 2010, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

I had to wait for over 10 minutes to even speak to a host and request a table. They barely acknowledged my presence and appeared entirely disinterested in providing any kind of positive experience. When I finally managed to secure a table, it was dirty and lacked sufficient cutlery. I had to ask the staff multiple times for a simple setup, but again, they seemed to be focused on everything else except their customers. As for the food, which almost everyone looks forward to when visiting a restaurant, it was absolutely subpar. The menu was limited and the dishes that I ordered were far from what was advertised. The presentation left much to be desired, and the taste was mediocre at best. It truly felt like no care or effort was put into the preparation of the meals. To make matters worse, the service was painfully slow. It took over an hour to receive our first course, and the subsequent dishes arrived at an agonizingly glacial pace. This resulted in us spending an inordinate amount of time at the restaurant while achieving nothing more than increasing frustration. Throughout the entire ordeal, not once did a staff member check in on us to ensure we were satisfied or even to acknowledge our concerns. Additionally, the constant errors in the bill were the icing on the cake. We were overcharged on multiple items, and it took a considerable amount of time for the issue to be resolved. In conclusion, my visit to this establishment was nothing short of a nightmare. The dreadful customer service combined with the poorly executed dishes have left me with a bitter aftertaste that I won't soon forget. I would absolutely NOT recommend this place to anyone on the hunt for a good dining experience. Save yourself the trouble and spend your hard-earned money elsewhere."},{"instruction":"Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The intro shows a camera recording faces of corpses, with their mouths being moved by medical students. Med school student Teddy Grey (Milo Ventimiglia) graduates top of his class from Harvard and joins one of the nationâs most prestigious pathology programs. There, a rivalry develops between a group of interns and Teddy. They invite him into their group, which entertains itself with a secret after-hours game at the morgue of who can commit the perfect undetectable murder. Eventually the group's leader, Jake Gallo, realizes that Teddy is sleeping with his girlfriend, Dr. Juliette Bath. When Teddy catches several members of the group in lies, he realizes that what initially seemed like vigilante killings are, in actuality, just innocent people murdered for sport. Teddy's fiancÃ©e Gwen arrives to stay with him in his apartment. Gallo, angered by Juliette's infidelity, kills her for the next game. However, just as they are about to begin the autopsy on Bath (in the meantime plotting Teddy's death), Gallo realizes that the gas has been left on in the room, resulting in a massive explosion as one of the group lights a meth pipe, killing everyone but Teddy who was not in the room. Gallo realizes what is about to happen and survives. Teddy is seen walking away from the explosion. Later, Gallo manages to kill Gwen in what he believes to be the \\"perfect murder\\". Upon completing his autopsy report on his murdered fiancÃ©e, Teddy is knocked out by Gallo and then is forced to trade verbal barbs with him. Teddy uses some of Gallo's own rhetoric against him in reverse psychology fashion, after which fellow pathologist Ben Stravinsky frees Teddy and together they kill Gallo in exactly the same way that he killed Teddy's fiancÃ©e. In the process, they vivisect Gallo. Answer:","output":"Considering the complex and twisted relationships between the characters, the underlying motivation for the killings, and the ultimate consequences faced by the main protagonists, an appropriate question about this movie plot could be: How does the dangerous rivalry between Teddy Grey and Jake Gallo escalate from a secret after-hours game of creating undetectable murders to a series of vengeful killings and manipulation, ultimately culminating in both Teddy and Ben Stravinsky seeking retribution for the loss of their loved ones by vivisecting Jake Gallo in the same manner as his crimes?"},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: what year did the galaxy s come out?","output":"The Samsung Galaxy S, the first smartphone in Samsung's highly popular Galaxy S series, was announced in March 2010 and officially released in June 2010.

A: Answer:","output":"Some parasitic fungi are considered plant pathogens due to their ability to cause diseases in plants and affect their growth, development and productivity. These fungi are harmful to a variety of plant species, including agricultural crops, ornamental plants, and native vegetation. They can lead to significant economic and environmental impacts, and may even lead to reduced biodiversity if left uncontrolled. Plant pathogenic fungi exhibit an extensive range of diversity and are commonly classified into three major groups: 1. Biotrophic Fungi: These fungi require a living plant host to support their growth and reproduction. They establish a close relationship with the host plants by forming specialized structures known as haustoria, which penetrate the host cells to obtain nutrients. Biotrophic fungi often manipulate the host's defense system and metabolism to their advantage, avoiding detection and ensuring their survival. Well-known examples of biotrophic fungi include powdery mildew, downy mildew, and rust fungi. 2. Hemibiotrophic Fungi: Hemibiotrophic fungi initially form a biotrophic relationship with the host plant but eventually switch to a necrotrophic mode, killing the host cells and deriving nutrients from the dead tissue. This dual lifestyle allows them to evade host defense mechanisms during the early stages of colonization and exploit the host's resources once the cells have been killed. An example of a hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen is the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. 3. Necrotrophic Fungi: Necrotrophic fungi kill the host plant cells and tissues upon infection, releasing enzymes and toxins that break down the plant's structures. These destructive pathogens rapidly colonize the dead plant material as their primary source of nutrients. Examples of necrotrophic fungi include Botrytis cinerea (gray mold) and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (white mold). Some of the most important plant diseases caused by pathogenic fungi include: - Late Blight: Caused by the oomycete (a fungus-like organism) Phytophthora infestans, it primarily affects potato and tomato crops. Late blight was responsible for the Irish Potato Famine in the 19th century, which resulted in the death and migration of millions of Irish people. - Fusarium Wilt: A group of soilborne fungi belonging to the genus Fusarium cause this disease, infecting the roots, stem, and leaves of various plants, including tomato, cotton, and banana. The infected plants exhibit wilting, yellowing, and necrosis of tissues. - Dutch Elm Disease: Caused by the ascomycete Ophiostoma ulmi and O. novo-ulmi, this highly destructive disease affects elm trees by plugging the tree's water-conducting vessels, leading to wilting and eventual tree death. - Corn Smut: Ustilago maydis, the basidiomycete fungus responsible for corn smut, infects corn plants and leads to the development of large, tumor-like galls filled with fungal spores. The disease causes significant yield losses in affected cornfields. Efficient plant disease management strategies are essential to mitigate the effects of fungal pathogens on plant health. These strategies include genetic resistance through the development of disease-resistant plant varieties, chemical control using fungicides, biological control methods involving the use of beneficial microorganisms, and cultural practices such as crop rotation, plowing to bury infected plant debris, and proper irrigation. By understanding the biology and ecology of pathogenic fungi, researchers continue to develop new and innovative approaches to protect plants and enhance agricultural production."},{"instruction":"Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 0 = -14*k - 5*k + 32 + 196 for k.","output":"Okay, let's solve this step-by-step. 1. Simplify the equation by combining like terms. After combining, the equation would look like this: 0 = -19k + 228. Here's why: First, combine -14k and -5k , the like terms, to get -19k. Second, combine 32 and 196, to get 228. 2. Next, we want to solve for k. This involves isolating k in our equation. So take +228 on both sides and the equation now looks like: 228 = -19k Here's why: To isolate variable k, we need to get rid of the 228 on the right side of the equation. To do this, we subtract 228 from both sides of the equation. 3. Now, divide both sides by -19 to solve for k. This gives: k = -228 / -19 = 12 Why: again, to isolate variable k, we need to divide by the coefficient in front of k, which is -19. Therefore, the solution of the equation -14k - 5k + 32 + 196 = 0 is k = 12."},{"instruction":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Whilst working for the CIA, Chan Ka-kui (Jackie Chan) is assigned to follow leads of a nuclear smuggling case.

The footage clocking in at just under a minute was uploaded to YouTube August 16. The caption written in Arabic read: 'The army shoots on peaceful protesters in Ismailia.' Ismailia is a city in northeastern Egypt, where Reuters reported that four protesters were killed Friday during a 'Day of Rage.' Scroll down for videos. Appalling conditions: After they were arrested at a protest in August (pictured), the pair said they were beaten and subjected to degrading treatment in the Egyptian prison. Under fire: About 30 seconds into the video, rapid gunfire erupts, prompting some of the protesters to drop down to a crouch and others to flee. It has not been established if the four deaths confirmed in Ismailia are related to the events depicted in the video. NBC News foreign correspondent Ayman Mohyeldin tweeted that the news agency Storyful had confirmed the video's authenticity. A YouTube user by the moniker ahmedkhtr wrote in the comments section, apparently referring to one of the protesters who was allegedly shot in the video: 'He is my friend. His name is Ahmed Hachim one of the best guys ever he is a communication engineer, had a family son&daughter.’ The unsettling clip begins with a group of men numbering more than two dozen marching on four tanks positioned on a city street. Defiant: As most people ran away, one man remained standing directly in front of a tank with his arms raised. Gunned down: The demonstrator (seen in background) appears to be struck repeatedly struck by bullets, and then falls down. Aftermath: The alleged shooting victim is seen rolling over on the ground next to another man. Fact or fiction? NBC News foreign correspondent Ayman Mohyeldin tweeted that the news agency Storyful had confirmed the video's authenticity. The demonstrators appear unarmed, many of them raising or waving their hands in the air. Two of participants are carrying an unfurled banner. About 30 seconds into the video, rapid gunfire erupts, prompting some of the protesters to drop down to a crouch and others to flee. As more shots are fired, most of the people abandon the street. One person, however, remains standing directly in front of a tank with his arms raised above his hand. Just seconds later, the defiant protester wearing blue jeans, a T-shirt and a white hat appears to be struck by a bullet in his leg. He then falls down after apparently being shot again. A young man in the foreground who witnessed the shooting grimaces and gesticulates in anguish before running away, while the alleged shooting victim is seen rolling over on the ground next to another man. Pivotal moment: The alleged shooting of the unarmed man was also captured on a cell phone video taken from a different angle. A cell phone video of the alleged shooting, recorded from a different angle by another eyewitness, was also posted to YouTube. That clip shows the protester getting shot directly in front of a tank. News reports said more than 40 people died in clashes that spread to Alexandria, Ismailia, Damietta, Fayoum and other cities. Egypt's military-backed government said there were 27 confirmed deaths nationwide. Last night, at least 91 protesters and police were feared dead in Cairo as a ‘Day of Rage’ ended in inevitable bloodshed. Supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi called for fresh demonstrations after more than 600 people were killed when attempts to clear protest camps earlier in the week turned into a massacre.

Street battle: A Morsi supporter is taken from the crowd after he was injured during a protest outside Al-Fath Mosque in Ramses Square, in Cairo. Home-made weaponry: Morsi protesters throw rocks, lamps and what appears to be kitchen appliances, near the Four Seasons hotel in Garden City area of Cairo. Twitter user @sarahcarr posted this picture of people jumping off 6 October bridge near a police station after the large crown was trapped by armed police. Dozens died when security forces opened fire in Ramses Square, the focal point for demonstrators. Some marchers heading towards the square jumped from road bridges to escape bullets and clouds of tear gas. Another 25 demonstrators were killed. outside the capital, according to reports, and security officials said. 24 policemen had died in the fighting. David Cameron was due to discuss the. crisis by telephone last night with French President Francois Hollande. amid urgent calls for EU foreign ministers to meet over the. deteriorating situation. It came as British tour operators came. under increasing pressure to suspend holidays to Egypt as governments. around Europe started warning their citizens to stay at home. Police violence: Morsi supporters carry an injured demonstrator during clashes outside Azbakeya Police Station. Temporary care: The Al-Fath mosque was turned into a field hospital after armed police opened fire outside Azbakeya Police Station. Residents and protesters: More prominently than during earlier violence, there were street battles between Morsi supporters and vigilante residents rather than police. Companies such as Thomas Cook are. cancelling holidays booked by German customers – but are still flying. Britons out to Red Sea resorts such as Sharm el Sheikh because of. differing advice issued by the two countries. The Muslim Brotherhood – the party of. the ousted president – called for a ‘Friday of Anger’ in response to the. mass killing on Wednesday when security forces cleared protest camps. set up after last month’s military coup. Beforehand the military-backed. government had authorised the use of live ammunition, warning anyone. attacking the police or official buildings would be dealt with. ‘severely’. Tanks and armoured vehicles blockaded key routes around. Cairo and when protesters converged on Ramses Square, police fired tear. gas and gunshots echoed around the capital. In a nearby mosque, transformed into a field hospital, one witness counted at least 35 bodies. Fury: Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood supporters walk towards Ramses square in Cairo as they take part in a 'march of anger'. Violent clashes have already left 17 people dead. Hurt: Protesters who support the ousted Egyptian President transport injured people following the clashes in Ramses Square. Desperate: Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood supporters carry a wounded protestor in Cairo's Ramses square. Fury: Muslim Brotherhood supporters in Sanaa shout slogans during the rally in protest at the recent violence in Egypt. Much of the anger was directed at Egypt’s army commander General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. ‘The people want the butcher executed,’ said Mustafa Ibrahim, 37, as he marched with a crowd of several thousand demonstrators. But the population remains deeply. divided, with residents helping the army block access to Cairo’s Rabaa. al-Adawiya mosque, the focal point of Wednesday’s bloodbath when at. least 638 were killed and thousands injured. While the capital has seen the worst. of violence, there are increasing fears it will spread to popular Red. Sea resorts, just an eight-hour drive from Cairo. More than 40,000 British holidaymakers are in Egypt, predominantly in these resorts. Germany’s Foreign Ministry advised Germans not to go anywhere in Egypt, prompting Thomas Cook and Tui to suspend all holidays. Protests: Smoke rises near Al-Fath Mosque during clashes at Ramses Square. Unstable: Protestors run away from tear gas during clashes in Cairo. Angry: Supporters of Morsi throw stones at a gasoline station that belongs to the Egyptian Army in Cairo. Meanwhile in the UK, both Thomas Cook. and Thomson, owned by Tui, are continuing to fly out holidaymakers,. citing current Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice that it remains. safe to do so. Thomson said: ‘Should FCO advice change we have contingency plans in place and we will act accordingly.’ Thomas Cook said: ‘Further to our. FCO’s directive, Thomas Cook UK & Ireland’s booking conditions will. remain as normal until such a time as their advisory changes.’ Kuoni yesterday began offering UK holidaymakers worried by the violence refunds or a ‘suitable alternative holiday’.

It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack. Cannons taken from the fort were transported to Boston to lift its siege by the British, who evacuated..., can you guess it ?

Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

Old West Your detailed answer is as follows: If you are at a location where you are buying whiskey, grain, and saddles at a general store, you are most likely in the Old West. The Old West, also known as the Wild West or American West, refers to the period and region in the United States in the late 19th century, mainly including the western territories of Colorado, California, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, and Arizona. This era is associated with westward expansion, frontier life, and cowboy culture. During this time, general stores were common establishments that served as a central place for people living in frontier towns to buy a wide variety of goods. These stores would carry everything from food and clothing to tools and supplies needed for daily life. The items mentioned - whiskey, grain, and saddles - all fit within the types of products typically found in such a store. Whiskey was a popular drink during the Old West era, with saloons in almost every town serving as both drinking establishments and social hubs. Grain was essential for both human and livestock consumption, as frontier families had to feed themselves and their animals. Finally, saddles were crucial for anyone who owned a horse, as they enabled people to travel long distances on horseback and transport goods more easily. None of the other options provided - salt (A), checkers (B), shopping mall (C), or meat store (E) - accurately represent a location where you would specifically buy whiskey, grain, and saddles at a general store.

OPTIONS: a). making a model of outer space b). asking questions to other scientists c). collecting information about planets d). looking at the night sky with a telescope","output":"Option d). looking at the night sky with a telescope would best help a scientist discover a new planet. A telescope is a crucial tool for the observation and study of celestial objects, including planets. There are several reasons why using a telescope to look at the night sky would be the most effective way of discovering a new planet among the given options. First, telescopes allow scientists to observe the vast expanse of the universe more clearly and in more detail than the naked eye can. Telescopes can magnify the appearance of distant objects, making it easier to spot smaller or fainter objects, such as new planets, which may not be visible without their aid. The ability to study these faraway celestial objects up close is invaluable to scientists in their efforts to discover new planets. Second, telescopes can be equipped with specialized instruments, such as spectrographs, to analyze the light emitted by celestial objects, including planets. This can provide critical data about the composition, temperature, and other properties of these objects. The analysis of this data can help scientists identify unknown celestial bodies, including previously undiscovered planets. Third, modern telescopes have the capability to operate across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum. This versatility means that they can detect objects not only in visible light, but in other wavelengths such as infrared, radio, ultraviolet, or even X-ray. This extended range of observation increases the chances of detecting new planets that may not be detectable through visible light alone. Compared to the other options, using a telescope is a more direct and efficient way to discover a new planet. While making a model of outer space (option a) could help scientists visualize the positions and characteristics of known celestial objects, it is unlikely to lead to the discovery of new planets which were previously unknown. Option b, asking questions to other scientists, can be a valuable way to exchange information and ideas, but it would not necessarily lead to the discovery of a new planet. It would largely depend on the knowledge and findings of other scientists. Option c, collecting information about planets, might increase our understanding of known planets, but it would not directly contribute to the discovery of a new planet by actually observing the night sky and searching for undiscovered celestial bodies. In conclusion, option d). looking at the night sky with a telescope is the most effective approach to discovering a new planet among the presented options. It allows scientists to directly observe celestial objects with a level of detail and precision that cannot be achieved through other methods, and its versatility offers a broader range of observations to increase the likelihood of finding previously unknown planets."},{"instruction":"What is the best way to: Bake the pumpkin in oven at 350 degrees.","output":"Baking a pumpkin in the oven at 350°F (175°C) is a simple and delicious way to enjoy the flavors of fall. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you achieve the best results: 1. Preheat your oven: Set your oven to 350°F (175°C) and allow it to preheat while you prepare the pumpkin. 2. Select the right pumpkin: Choose a small pie or sugar pumpkin that is specifically meant for baking and not a large carving pumpkin. The smaller pumpkins tend to have sweeter and more tender flesh. 3. Clean the pumpkin: Thoroughly rinse the pumpkin with water to remove any dirt or debris. Pat it dry with a clean towel. 4. Cut the pumpkin: Use a sharp knife and cutting board to carefully cut the pumpkin in half or into quarters, depending on its size. Be extra cautious while cutting through the thick skin to avoid any accidents. 5. Scoop out the seeds and fibrous strands: Use a sturdy spoon or a pumpkin scraper to remove the seeds and strands from the pumpkin halves. Save the seeds for roasting, if you like. 6. Optional: Season the pumpkin: If you want a savory pumpkin dish, brush the cut sides of the pumpkin with olive oil and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and any herbs or spices that you prefer. For a sweeter dish, brush the pumpkin with melted butter and then sprinkle with cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, or the sweetener and spices of your choice. 7. Prepare the baking sheet: Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil for easy cleanup. Place a wire rack on the baking sheet if you have one. 8. Arrange the pumpkin: Place the pumpkin halves or quarters cut-side down on the lined baking sheet or wire rack. This will allow the moisture to escape and help the pumpkin cook evenly. 9. Bake the pumpkin: Place the baking sheet with the pumpkin in the preheated oven and bake for 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the size of your pumpkin pieces. It is ready when a fork can easily be inserted into the flesh. 10. Check for doneness: Keep an eye on the pumpkin as it bakes to ensure it does not overcook or burn. To test for doneness, insert a fork into the flesh. If it slides in easily, the pumpkin is cooked thoroughly. 11. Rest and cool the pumpkin: Once the pumpkin is fully cooked, remove it from the oven and let it cool on the baking sheet or wire rack for about 10-15 minutes. 12. Prepare pumpkin puree, if desired: Once the pumpkin is cool enough to handle, you can scoop out the flesh and discard the skin. For a smooth puree, process the flesh using a food processor, immersion blender, or a fine mesh sieve. 13. Enjoy or store: You can now use the cooked pumpkin or pumpkin puree in various recipes such as pumpkin soup, pumpkin pie, or even pumpkin smoothies! Otherwise, store the pumpkin in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week or freeze for up to three months. By following this detailed guide, you can easily bake pumpkin at 350°F (175°C) and enjoy the delicious, versatile results!"},{"instruction":"Here are some keywords about a restaurant: name = Blue Spice, food = Italian, priceRange = less than £20, area = riverside.

But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship. Tillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein. The move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings. “It’s all very Trumpian,” said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump’s transition team. “When the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.” During his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public. The animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a “moron” following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account. Tillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia — including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain. In return, Trump on numerous occasions publicly undermined his top diplomat, including in October when he tweeted Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Answer choices: - sweating - attract females - Release energy - repels females - attract enemies - attract males - adding heat - dangerous Answer:","output":"The substance that male dogs have in their urine to mark their territory primarily serves to attract females. When a male dog urinates and thus marks its territory, it's essentially leaving a message via its urine that carries a wealth of information such as the dog's health, age, and sexual status. Thus, the marked territories can be seen as advertisements to available females. The scent can be picked up by female dogs who can determine if the male dog is suitable for mating. So, while the act of marking territory does assert a canine's dominance over a particular area, it also aims to attract females for the prospect of reproduction."},{"instruction":"Question: What was the topic of the first Solvay Conference?

The very first Solvay Conference in 1911 was indeed devoted to \\"the theory of radiation and quanta\\". This conference marked a key event in the history of modern physics, bringing together many of the greatest scientific minds of that time to discuss and share ideas on the cutting-edge research of radiation and the newly emerging concept of quanta. The Solvay Conference is a prestigious international conference that has been held every few years since 1911, organized by the International Solvay Institutes for Physics and Chemistry. It was founded by Belgian chemist and industrialist Ernest Solvay to foster exchanges and collaborations between top scientists from different countries. The conference gained international renown for its impact on the development of quantum physics and related fields. The first Solvay Conference was held in Brussels, Belgium, and featured some of the brightest scientific minds of that era. Among the attendees were notable physicists like Max Planck, who introduced the concept of quanta in 1900, Albert Einstein, who developed the theory of relativity, and Marie Curie, who conducted groundbreaking research in radioactivity. These, along with other notable participants like Henri Poincaré, Ernest Rutherford, and Hendrik Lorentz, contributed significantly to the discussions that took place during the conference. In the context of the early 20th century, the theory of radiation and quanta was a groundbreaking topic that had the potential to revolutionize the understanding of the physical world. The discussions at the conference focused on the new concepts proposed by Max Planck and Albert Einstein on the quantization of energy and the behavior of electromagnetic radiation. The conference also saw intense debates regarding the nature of atoms, the interaction of light with matter, and the thermodynamics of radiation. The outcome of the first Solvay Conference was instrumental in setting the stage for the development of quantum mechanics, a fundamental theory in physics that would eventually replace classical mechanics for microscopic systems. Crucial developments in our understanding of atomic structure, wave-particle duality, and the uncertainty principle can be traced back to the interactions and debates held during this historic conference. In summary, the answer that the first Solvay Conference in 1911 was devoted to \\"the theory of radiation and quanta\\" is accurate and highlights the importance of this event in shaping the course of modern physics."},{"instruction":"Can you generate a question with a factual answer?","output":"Question: What is the largest living species of shark, the lengths of which can reach up to 40 feet?

Despite their massive size, they pose no significant threat to humans; in fact, they are known to be quite gentle and even curious around divers. As a species, whale sharks are classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to various threats such as fishing, bycatch, habitat degradation, and climate change which are causing a decline in their population."},{"instruction":"Q: when was the last time mount cameroon erupted? A:","output":"The last time Mount Cameroon erupted was in 2000. Mount Cameroon, also known as Buea Mountain or Mongo ma Ndemi, is one of Africa’s most active volcanoes. It is situated in the Southwest region of Cameroon near the Gulf of Guinea coast. This stratovolcano has had several eruptions in the past, with the most significant ones occurring in 1999 and 2000. Mount Cameroon is characterized by swift and frequent eruptions, which are mainly effusive in nature. The eruptions are typically characterized by the outpouring of lava flows from fissures along the summit and flanks, leading to the construction of parasitic cones and lava domes. Pyroclastic flows are typically not a major hazard during eruptions. Instead, lava flows and ashfall pose risks to surrounding areas, including nearby towns and villages. The 2000 eruption started on May 28 and lasted for about two months, ending in July. This eruption was similar in nature to previous eruptions at Mount Cameroon, with lava flows spewing from fissures and numerous small earthquakes preceding the eruption. The seismic activity prompted the evacuation of nearly 5,000 people from the surrounding villages of Bokosso, Bakingili, Molyko, and Limbe. The eruption resulted in substantial damage to infrastructure, particularly around the town of Bakingili, which was directly in the path of the lava flow. Significant ashfall affected nearby towns and roads, causing respiratory issues for some residents and impacting air travel. Additionally, the eruption destroyed farmland and crops, leading to food shortages in some areas. Since the 2000 eruption, Mount Cameroon has not experienced another significant eruption. However, given its history of frequent eruptions and ongoing monitoring by scientists, it is likely that Mount Cameroon will erupt again in the future. As it stands now, researchers continue to study the volcano and its associated hazards, working on developing better predictive models in order to minimize the impact on human populations when the volcano inevitably erupts again."},{"instruction":"Fact 1: Endospores are commonly found in soil and water. Fact 2: Endospore-forming bacteria produce a unique resting cell called an endospore . Given the two facts above, a type of resting cell from what type of organism is often found in soil and water? Answer:","output":"Given the two facts mentioned above, a type of resting cell often found in soil and water is an endospore, which is produced by endospore-forming bacteria. Endospores are remarkably resistant to a variety of environmental stressors, such as heat, radiation, chemicals, and desiccation, which enable them to survive in harsh conditions for prolonged periods. Endospore-forming bacteria belong to two major phyla: Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. The most extensively studied endospore-forming bacteria are from the genus Bacillus and Clostridium within the phylum Firmicutes. These bacteria are Gram-positive, rod-shaped microorganisms that can be either aerobic or anaerobic. The capacity to form endospores gives them the ability to withstand unfavorable conditions in soil and water and to survive, sometimes for thousands of years, until suitable conditions for growth arise. In response to environmental stress or nutrient depletion, endospore-forming bacteria undergo a process known as sporulation, during which a vegetative cell transforms into a highly resistant, metabolically inactive structure called an endospore. The core of the endospore contains genetic material, essential enzymes, and other cellular components required for the resumption of metabolic activity when the conditions become favorable. Additionally, the endospore has multiple protective layers, including an inner membrane, a peptidoglycan-like cortex, a germ cell wall, an outer membrane, and a proteinaceous coat, which help maintain its structural integrity and resistance to adverse conditions. When endospores encounter a suitable environment for growth, they undergo germination, a process during which the dormant endospore returns to its vegetative state. Germination can be triggered by various factors, such as the availability of specific nutrients, water, heat, or specific chemical germinants. During germination, the protective layers of the endospore are degraded, the metabolic machinery is reactivated, and cellular division and growth resume. The presence of endospores in soil and water has significant ecological and practical implications. Endospore-forming bacteria play an essential role in nutrient cycling, especially in the breakdown of complex organic compounds, thus contributing to soil fertility. They also have various biotechnological and industrial applications, such as the production of enzymes, antibiotics, and other bioactive compounds. However, some endospore-forming bacteria, such as certain species of Clostridium, can cause serious diseases in humans, animals, and plants through the production of potent toxins, emphasizing the importance of understanding and monitoring their presence and behavior in different environments. In conclusion, the type of resting cell often found in soil and water is an endospore, produced by endospore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus and Clostridium species. These resistant structures allow the bacteria to survive and persist in various environmental conditions until they encounter favorable conditions for growth and germination."},{"instruction":"Question: Given the fact that: The closer together the particles are, the greater the amplitude of the wave. Answer the question: Theo moved far from Gary. The amplitude of the light bouncing off of them likely decreases or increases? Answer:","output":"The amplitude of the light bouncing off of Theo and Gary likely decreases as they move farther apart from each other. This is because the statement you provided refers to the relationship between particle density and wave amplitude. When particles are closer together, they can interact more strongly, leading to a greater amplitude of the resulting wave. However, it's essential to note that light waves are different from mechanical waves, as they are electromagnetic waves and don't need a medium to travel. Therefore, the distance between Theo and Gary doesn't directly affect the light waves' amplitude. What may change, though, is the intensity or brightness of the light perceived at a greater distance, due to the Inverse Square Law. As the distance between Theo and Gary increases, the intensity of the light bouncing off them will decrease, making it appear less bright."},{"instruction":"Read this article and answer this question Greater Manchester is home to a diverse population and is a multicultural agglomeration with an ethnic minority population comprising 8.5% of the total population in 2001.

Trigger sudden emotions.","output":"Title: The Science Behind Triggering a Release: Sudden Emotions, Temperature Changes, and More Introduction Ever felt the need to release stress or a built-up emotion, but felt unable to do so? Sometimes our bodies require a little push to clear the air and make us feel more relaxed. In this article, we will explore some interesting ways that one can trigger a release in their body, allowing them to ease tension and feel lighter. Read on as we discuss swallowing a large mouthful of air, forcing yourself to burp, taking a shower with an abrupt temperature change, and triggering sudden emotions. 1. Swallowing a Large Mouthful of Air Step 1: Inhale deeply Start by taking a deep breath, filling up your lungs with fresh air. This action can help increase your blood's oxygen levels, leading to improved concentration and alertness. Step 2: Swallow the air While holding this large volume of air inside your lungs, use your throat muscles to swallow a significant portion of it. As the air moves down your esophagus, it will create pressure to facilitate a physical release. 2. Forcing Yourself to Burp Step 1: Create pressure After swallowing a large mouthful of air, you will need to apply pressure in the form of a forced burp. Since burping is a natural process to expel excess air from the digestive tract, this can lead to a feeling of relief. Step 2: Release Allow the burp to come out naturally, offering an instant release of tension. As the air escapes, you should feel lighter and more relaxed. 3. Taking a Shower with Abrupt Temperature Change Step 1: Begin with your preferred temperature Start by taking a shower at your ideal, comfortable water temperature. Allow your body to adjust to the warmth and enjoy the sensation as you begin to relax. Step 2: Switch to cold water Without warning, quickly turn the shower knob to a significantly lower temperature, so that the once warm water is now cold. This abrupt and unexpected change will shock your system, triggering the release of endorphins, which will help to reduce stress and tension. 4. Triggering Sudden Emotions Step 1: Identify the emotional trigger Consider which emotions are building up inside you. Pick one that needs a release and think of a situation or memory that can stir up these emotions. Step 2: Embrace the emotional release Allow yourself to feel the full spectrum of these emotions and embrace the catharsis that follows when you let go. This emotional release can lead to a state of well-being and overall mental and physical relaxation. Conclusion Our bodies often require a physical or emotional release to alleviate built-up tension and stress. By following these methods outlined in this article – swallowing a large mouthful of air, forcing yourself to burp, taking a shower with an abrupt temperature change, and triggering sudden emotions – you can successfully achieve a renewed sense of relaxation and satisfaction, leaving you lighter and more at ease."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Will Shaw (Henry Cavill) works as a financial advisor in San Francisco.

Their primary goal was to address the economic hardships faced by these groups due to various reasons, including falling crop prices and the lack of credit available for farmers. These organizations both called for major financial and economic reforms that would aid the struggling agrarian communities and bolster their economic stability. Key demands that were championed by both the Greenback Party and Farmers' Alliances include: 1. Monetary Policy Reform: Both movements recognized the need for reforming the nation's monetary system. The Greenback Party and Farmers' Alliances advocated for expanding the currency supply by increasing the circulation of greenbacks – the fiat paper money issued by the federal government during the Civil War. They believed that this inflationary policy would raise crop prices, ease the repayment of debts, and benefit the farmers. 2. Increased Availability of Credit: One major concern shared by these organizations was the difficulty farmers faced in obtaining loans to support their agricultural operations. They believed that the national banks catered mostly to the interests of Eastern industrialists and businesses, and the high-interest loans provided by local banks were too expensive for struggling farmers. As a result, both called for the establishment of public or cooperative banking systems that would lend money at lower interest rates, making credit more accessible to the agrarian communities. 3. Regulation of Railroads and Transportation: The high transportation costs due to unregulated railroad monopolies impacted the farmers' profits significantly. Both the Greenback Party and Farmers' Alliances demanded the stricter regulation of railroads and other transportation-related industries to ensure fair prices and treatment for farmers. They sought the transition of railroads and related services into public utilities, which would prevent monopolistic practices and provide better cost management of this vital resource. 4. Progressive Income Tax: An important aspect of the Greenback Party and Farmers' Alliances was their desire for a more equitable distribution of wealth. They supported the introduction of a progressive income tax, which would impose higher tax rates on wealthier individuals, thus helping to reduce income inequality and channel more resources towards the less privileged classes. 5. Direct Election of Senators: At the time, U.S. Senators were chosen by state legislatures, which often led to corruption and the selection of Senators who did not adequately represent the interests of farmers and laborers. Both movements advocated for direct election of Senators by the people, thereby promoting more democratic representation and addressing the concerns of rural populations. While neither the Greenback Party nor the Farmers' Alliances were ultimately successful in achieving their goals, they contributed to the eventual formation of the more influential Populist Party in the 1890s. This movement, which combined the objectives of these earlier organizations with new demands, significantly influenced U.S. politics and helped to bring about some long-lasting reforms in the nation's financial and political systems."},{"instruction":"– Last July, 27-year-old Seth Rich was shot and killed near his home in Washington DC.

Fox News states the story didn't meet the \\"high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting.\\" The story was based on an interview with Rod Wheeler, a private investigator (and Fox News regular), who claimed there was evidence proving Rich's involvement with WikiLeaks. According to the Daily Beast, Wheeler took back that claim after getting a cease-and-desist letter from Rich's family. No evidence to support the theory has been put forward, and police believe Rich was killed in a botched robbery.

The initial founding members of the Arab League were Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Transjordan (now Jordan), and Yemen. Over the years, other Arab countries joined the organization, and it now represents 22 member states in total. The objectives of the Arab League include strengthening the relationships between its member states, coordinating their policies, ensuring non-intervention in domestic affairs, respect for the sovereignty of member states, and encouraging joint economic and military projects. It also aims to safeguard the national independence, sovereignty, and cultural heritage of the Arab countries. Despite being established in Cairo, the Arab League's headquarters were not permanently housed in the city from the outset. Initially, the headquarters were situated in a temporary location until the construction of the league's official headquarters was completed. The Arab League building, a modern structure reflecting the shared aspirations of the Arab world, was finally inaugurated by Gamal Abdel Nasser, the President of Egypt at the time, in 1957. Since its inception, the Arab League has played a significant role in various key events and conflicts in the region, such as the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the Suez Crisis in 1956, the Lebanese Civil War in 1975-1990, and the Gulf War in 1990-1991, among others. Although the league has faced various challenges and criticisms related to its effectiveness in resolving disputes within the Arab world, it remains as an essential forum for dialogue and consultation among its member states."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Two analogies that relate places/locations to the associated travel mode is given in the form \\"A : B.

Options: - roof - field - meadow - garden - garbage can Explain why a human would choose \\"roof\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"roof\\" as the answer to the question because it is the least likely place to find bugs among the given options. Here's the step-by-step justification for this choice: 1. Analyze the options: You have five options to choose from: roof, field, meadow, garden, and garbage can. 2. Identify commonalities: Most of the options, i.e., field, meadow, garden, and garbage can are on ground level, while the roof is set apart. 3. Consider bug habitats: Bugs generally prefer environments with vegetation, dampness, and sources of food, which are more likely to be found in fields, gardens, meadows, and garbage cans than on rooftops. 4. Human perception of bugs: People often associate bugs with grassy or green areas, as well as areas where waste products can be found, which further supports choosing the roof as the unlikely location to find bugs. Taking these factors into account, a reasonable human conclusion would be that it is unlikely to find bugs on a roof compared to the other options."},{"instruction":"Information: - The Northern Hemisphere is the half of Earth that is north of the equator. For other planets in the Solar System, north is defined as being in the same celestial hemisphere relative to the invariable plane of the solar system as Earth's North pole. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, winter in the Northern Hemisphere lasts from the December solstice (typically December 21 UTC) to the March Equinox (typically March 20 UTC), while summer lasts from the June solstice (typically June 21 UTC) through to the September equinox (typically September 23 UTC). The dates vary each year due to the difference between the calendar year and the astronomical year. - Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. Bears are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails. - Claudius Ptolemy (\\"Klaúdios Ptolemaîos\\", ; ) was a Greek writer, known as a mathematician, astronomer, geographer, astrologer, and poet of a single epigram in the Greek Anthology. He lived in the city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt, wrote in Koine Greek, and held Roman citizenship. Beyond that, few reliable details of his life are known. His birthplace has been given as Ptolemais Hermiou in the Thebaid in an uncorroborated statement by the 14th-century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes. This is a very late attestation, however, and there is no other reason to suppose that he ever lived anywhere else than Alexandria, where he died around AD 168. - Ursa Major (also known as the Great Bear) is a constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. One of the 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy (second century AD), it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It can be visible throughout the year in most of the northern hemisphere. Its name, Latin for \\"the greater (or larger) she-bear\\", stands as a reference to and in direct contrast with Ursa Minor, \\"the lesser she-bear\\", with which it is frequently associated in mythology and amateur astronomy. The constellation's most recognizable asterism, a group of seven relatively bright stars commonly known as the \\"Big Dipper\\", \\"the Wagon\\" or \\"the Plough\\" (among others), both mimics the shape of the lesser bear (the \\"Little Dipper\\") and is commonly used as a navigational pointer towards the current northern pole star, Polaris in Ursa Minor. The Big Dipper and the constellation as a whole have mythological significance in numerous world cultures, usually as a symbol of the north. - Polaris, designated Alpha Ursae Minoris (Ursae Minoris, abbreviated Alpha UMi, UMi), commonly the North Star or Pole Star, is the brightest star in the constellation of Ursa Minor. It is very close to the north celestial pole, making it the current northern pole star. The revised Hipparcos parallax gives a distance to Polaris of about 433 light-years (133 parsecs), while calculations by other methods derive distances around 30% closer. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Ursa Minor (Latin: \\"lesser-Bear\\", contrasting with Ursa Major), also known as the Little Bear, is a constellation in the Northern Sky. Like the Great Bear, the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle, hence the North American name, Little Dipper: seven stars with four in its bowl like its partner the Big Dipper. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Ursa Minor has traditionally been important for navigation, particularly by mariners, because of Polaris being the North Star. - In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, concentric with Earth. All objects in the observer's sky can be thought of as projected upon the inside surface of the celestial sphere, as if it were the underside of a dome or a hemispherical screen. The celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy, allowing observers to plot positions of objects in the sky when their distances are unknown or unimportant. - In modern astronomy, the sky (celestial sphere) is divided into 88 regions called constellations, generally based on the asterisms (which are also called \\"constellations\\") of Greek and Roman mythology. Those along the ecliptic are the constellations of the zodiac. - Amateur astronomy is a hobby whose participants enjoy watching the sky, and the abundance of objects found in it with the unaided eye, binoculars, or telescopes. Even though scientific research is not their main goal, many amateur astronomers make a contribution to astronomy by monitoring variable stars, tracking asteroids and discovering transient objects, such as comets and novae. - The International Astronomical Union (IAU UAI) is an international association of professional astronomers, at the PhD level and beyond, active in professional research and education in astronomy. Among other activities, it acts as the internationally recognized authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies (stars, planets, asteroids, etc.) and any surface features on them. - NGC 4194 , the Medusa merger , is a pair of interacting galaxies in the constellation Ursa Major . A region of extreme star formation 500 ly ( 150 pc ) across exists in the center of the Eye of Medusa , the central gas - rich region . - A constellation is formally defined as a region of the celestial sphere, with boundaries laid down by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The constellation areas mostly had their origins in Western-traditional patterns of stars from which the constellations take their names. - The Big Dipper (US) or Plough (UK) is an asterism consisting of the seven brightest stars of the constellation Ursa Major; six of them are of second magnitude and one, Megrez (), of third magnitude. Four define a \\"bowl\\" or \\"body\\" and three define a \\"handle\\" or \\"head\\". It is recognized as a distinct grouping in many cultures. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'instance of' with 'galaxy'. The answer to this question is:","output":"NGC 4194, also known as the Medusa merger."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

On that day last year, many online stores offered a big discount and free delivery service. The biggest online shopping sites in China,Taobao.com and Tmall.com ,sold things worth 19.1 billion yuan in total. \\"Goods online are often much cheaper. It also saves me a lot of time. And we often have more goods on many online stores than in shopping malls,\\" Wang Xin, an online shopping lover in Beijing, said to China Daily. She stayed up very late for a lot of cheap goods online. She spent several thousand that day. Another big advantage of online shopping is that it helps people get things from different cities, even different countries, _ . \\"I like eating duck neck very much and I often buy it on Taobao from shops in Wuhan. It's much more delicious than what our local stores sell, but cheaper,\\" said Zang Xin, a girl in Yangzhou. While enjoying online shopping, many people also have worries, especially for middle school student buyers.

D: Online stores may have more kinds of goods.","output":"The answer to the question \\"According to the article, which of the following is not an advantage of shopping online?\\", based on the information provided in the text, is B: Online stores have better quality goods. Let's analyze each option separately for clarity: A: It can save people time and money - The article supports this statement as an advantage. Wang Xin notes that, \\"Goods online are often much cheaper. It also saves me a lot of time,\\" and further points out that discounts and free delivery services are sometimes offered. B: Online stores have better quality goods - The article does not mention or indicate that the quality of goods in online stores is better than that found in physical stores. Zang Xin, a customer, comments that she can buy a certain product, duck neck, which she finds tastier than what is available locally, but this is a matter of personal preference rather than a statement about the general quality of online goods. C: People can buy things from different places - The article mentions this as one of the advantages of online shopping. Wang Xin states that she can purchase goods from many online stores, implying a wide range of options, while Zang Xin verifies this advantage by explaining that she buys a product from another city because it's more delicious. D: Online stores may have more kinds of goods - The article supports this statement. Wang Xin explains that there are often more goods available in online stores than in physical shopping malls. So, it can be concluded from the article that the correct answer is B, as it does not indicate that online stores inherently have better quality goods as an advantage of online shopping."},{"instruction":"Instructions: You are given a statement written in Gujarati.

He was a candidate for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 election. Cruz was raised in Houston, Texas. After high school, he attended and graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School. Cruz's victory in the Republican primary was described by the Washington Post as \\"the biggest upset of 2012 ... a true grassroots victory against very long odds\\". On January 19, 2011, after U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison said she would not seek re-election, Cruz announced his candidacy via a blogger conference call. In the Republican senatorial primary, Cruz ran against sitting Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst. Cruz was endorsed first by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and then by the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative political action committee; Erick Erickson, former editor of prominent conservative blog RedState; the FreedomWorks for America super PAC; nationally syndicated radio host Mark Levin; Tea Party Express; Young Conservatives of Texas; and U.S. Senators Tom Coburn, Jim DeMint, Mike Lee, Rand Paul and Pat Toomey. He was also endorsed by former Texas Congressman Ron Paul, George P. Bush, and former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania Rick Santorum. Former Attorney General Edwin Meese served as national chairman of Cruz's campaign. Cruz won the runoff for the Republican nomination with a 14-point margin over Dewhurst. Cruz defeated Dewhurst despite being outspent by Dewhurst who held a statewide elected office. Dewhurst spent 19 million and Cruz spent only 7 million. Dewhurst raised over 30 million and outspent Cruz at a ratio of nearly 3-to-1. In the November 6 general election, Cruz faced Democratic candidate Paul Sadler, an attorney and a former state representative from Henderson, in east Texas. Cruz won with 4.5 million votes (56.4%) to Sadler's 3.2 million (40.6%). Two minor candidates garnered the remaining 3% of the vote. According to a poll by Cruz's pollster Wilson Perkins Allen Opinion Research, Cruz received 40% of the Hispanic vote, vs. 60% for Sadler, outperforming Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney with the Hispanic vote in Texas. After Time magazine reported on a potential violation of ethics rules by failing to publicly disclose his financial relationship with Caribbean Equity Partners Investment Holdings during the 2012 campaign, Cruz called his failure to disclose these connections an inadvertent omission. In January 2016, The New York Times reported that Cruz and his wife had taken out low-interest loans from Goldman Sachs (where she worked) and Citibank, and failed to report the nearly 1 million in loans on Federal Election Commission disclosure statements as required by law. Cruz disclosed the loans on his Senate financial disclosure forms in July 2012, but not on the Federal Election Commission form. There is no indication that Cruz's wife had any role in providing any of the loans, or that the banks did anything wrong. The loans were largely repaid by later campaign fundraising. A spokesperson for Cruz said his failure to report the loans to the FEC was \\"inadvertent\\" and said he would be filing supplementary paperwork. What happened after that?","output":"After Kay Bailey Hutchison said she would not seek re-election, Rafael Edward Cruz, also known as Ted Cruz, decided to run for the United States Senator position from Texas. He got support from many important people like Sarah Palin, Ron Paul, and Rick Santorum. Cruz competed against David Dewhurst in the Republican primary and surprisingly won, even though he spent less money on his campaign. In the general election, Cruz won against Paul Sadler, a Democratic candidate. He got 4.5 million votes, which was 56.4% of the votes. Some people found out that Cruz didn't tell everyone about his connection to a company called Caribbean Equity Partners Investment Holdings, and also about some loans from banks, which he should have. He said that he forgot to mention them by mistake. Lastly, Cruz and the banks did everything right, and the money from the loans was mostly paid back by people who gave money to his campaign."},{"instruction":"Here is a premise: \\"A man on a jet ski soars through the waves.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"The man is jet skiing while on vacation.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","output":"Step 1: Examine the premise The premise states: \\"A man on a jet ski soars through the waves.\\" This tells us the man is riding a jet ski and enjoying his time in the water.

China announced last November, in a joint declaration with the US, that it would peak its carbon emissions by 2030. This target forms the blueprint for China's offer. Although the core commitments are not likely to change, more details of China's climate action plan will become clear when it publishes its INDC, expected before the end of June. Beijing has already set a goal of getting 15% of its energy from clean sources by 2020. There are many acronyms around climate change and INDC (intended nationally determined contributions) is one that you will be hearing a lot about in the coming months. INDCs are the climate action plans pledged by countries taking part in the UN talks in December. They outline the actions each country intends to take after 2020 on climate change, and will form part of any new global agreement on curbing climate change. A number of countries have already submitted their INDCs, including the EU, US, Russia and Mexico. There is speculation that China may publish its INDC at a summit with the EU this week. China is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases (by volume), accounting for more than a quarter of global emissions. The country has relied heavily on coal in its development, and overtook the US as the world's biggest producer of carbon dioxide several years ago. Many of China's cities are heavily polluted, and China has declared \\"war on pollution\\". Like all countries, China's INDC will reflect its ambition for curbing climate change and how it intends to reduce carbon emissions, taking into account domestic circumstances. If China is ambitious, this may encourage other countries to step up their plans. China is moving faster in reducing its carbon intensity - the carbon dioxide emitted per unit of energy produced - than most other countries. It is also the world's biggest investor in green energy, spending more than 90bn in 2014 alone. There are reports that China could further strengthen its plans for cutting carbon intensity. A strong signal from China on tackling climate change will add momentum in the run-up to Paris. The goal of world leaders is to limit global temperature rises to no more than two degrees on pre-industrial times. Once China has set out its stall on carbon emissions, it will be possible to analyse how the countries emitting about half of all of the world's greenhouse gases intend to act.

Your task is to generate answer \\"yes\\" when the tweet has that particular sentiment, otherwise generate answer \\"no\\". Q: Review: \\"Laugh, Clown Laugh\\" released in 1928, stars the legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clown named Tito. Tito has raised a foundling (a young and beautiful Loretta Young) to adulthood and names her Simonetta. Tito has raised the girl in the circus life, and she has become an accomplished ballerina. While Chaney gives his usual great performance, I could not get past the fact that Tito, now well into middle age, has the hots for the young Simonetta. Although he is not her biological father, he has raised her like a daughter. That kind of \\"ick\\" factor permeates throughout the film. Tito competes for Simonetta's affections with a young and handsome 'Count' Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta clearly falls for the young man, but feels guilt about abandoning Tito (out of loyalty, not romantic love). The whole premise of the film is ridiculous, and I find it amazing that no one in the film tells Tito what a stupid old fool he is being (until he reveals it himself at the end). The film is noteworthy only because of Loretta Young, who would go on to have a great career. While I adore Chaney's brilliance as an actor, this whole film seems off to me and just downright creepy.

Close up: This phrase indicates a view or perspective at a short distance, allowing us to see small details of the subject matter. In the context of photography or videography, it refers to a shot that is taken from very close to the subject, which allows the viewer to observe a greater degree of detail and texture that's not usually discernible from a distance. 2. Yellow flowers: This term specifies the primary subject of the image, focusing on flowers that are yellow in color. It helps to describe the type and color of the flowers, which differentiates the scene from any other potential subjects. The mention of 'yellow flowers' brings to mind warmth, brightness, and a bit of cheerfulness. 3. Leaves: This word references another part of the plant or subject matter. It adds variety and extra context to the scene, as leaves often provide visual interest and texture. Additionally, leaves are a vital component of the plant's life cycle and are associated with growth and change. 4. Rain: The reference to 'rain' in this sentence adds another layer of depth, as it provides a sense of the environment, atmosphere, and timing in which the close-up was taken. Rain is often associated with freshness and rejuvenation, so it suggests the flowers and leaves might be glistening with water droplets, which typically adds an aesthetic appeal and enhances the overall impact of the scene. The mention of rain heavily impacts our understanding and appreciation of the image described. In summary, these four words – \\"close up,\\" \\"yellow flowers,\\" \\"leaves,\\" and \\"rain\\" – are crucial in providing essential information about the scene. They create a vivid mental image of yellow flowers and their leaves captured up close after a rain shower, allowing the reader to understand the context, details, and the aesthetic appeal of the scene."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the bio below and try to give details on paola tedesco 's: - birth date - name - image - birth place - occupation Bio: paola tedesco -lrb- born 28 march 1952 -rrb- is an italian actress , voice actress and singer .

Answer the above question based on the context below: Altrincham became a Free Borough, a self-governing township, when it was granted a charter in June 1290 by the Lord of the Manor, Hamon de Massey V. The charter allowed for the creation of a merchants' guild, run by the town's burgesses to tax people passing through the borough. Burgesses were free men who lived in the town. The borough was ruled by a Court Leet and elected a mayor since at least 1452. Amongst the court's responsibilities were keeping the public peace and regulating the markets and fairs.The borough was not one of those reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, and continued to exist under the control of the Lord of the Manor and the Court Leet until its final abolition in 1886. The Public Health Act of 1848 led to the creation of Altrincham's Local Board of Health in 1851 to address the unsanitary conditions created by the town's growing population – the first such board in Trafford.The local board was reconstituted as an urban district council in the administrative county of Cheshire under the Local Government Act 1894. Altrincham Urban District was expanded in 1920 when parts of Carrington and Dunham Massey Civil Parishes were added. A further expansion took place in 1936; Timperley Civil Parish was abolished and most of its area incorporated into Altrincham UD. At the same time, there was a minor exchange of areas with Hale Urban District; a minor addition from Bowdon Urban District; and a further substantial portion of Dunham Massey Civil Parish was added. In 1937 the urban district was granted a charter of incorporation and became a municipal borough. The new borough was granted armorial bearings which featured heraldic references to the Masseys and Earls of Stamford. With the passage of the Local Government Act 1972, the administrative counties and municipal boroughs were abolished and Altrincham became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford in Greater Manchester on 1 April 1974.Trafford Council is responsible for the administration of local services, such as education,...

Review the options: We have five possible answers - walk, change shoes, play tag, smell smoke, and reach over. 3. Evaluate each option: - Walk: While walking could be a chosen activity, it is not necessarily the most exciting or engaging for a bored child. However, it is still a better option than some of the others. - Change shoes: This action does not seem related to alleviating boredom, as it is more of a functional activity rather than a fun one. - Play tag: This is a fun, engaging, and interactive game that children commonly enjoy. It involves physical activity and social interaction, both of which can effectively alleviate boredom. - Smell smoke: This option does not seem to be related to alleviating boredom at all. The act of smelling smoke is not an activity that a bored child would typically do to entertain themselves. - Reach over: This action also does not seem to be related to alleviating boredom. It is a simple physical movement, and not an engaging activity for a child. 4. Choose the best option: Based on the evaluation of each option, \\"play tag\\" stands out as the most engaging and fun activity that a bored child might choose to do. 5. Conclusion: The correct choice is \\"play tag\\", as it is a fun, engaging, and interactive game that can effectively help a child alleviate boredom."},{"instruction":"Translate the following.

When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease. John is studying a species in two similar countries, country A and country B. Country A has large population, but country B has small population of that species. John is pondering about how this species would fare in the future in these two countries. Would country A see higher or lower growth rate of the species than country B? Answer:","output":"Based on the principles of population dynamics in nature, it is likely that Country A would have a lower growth rate of the species than Country B. This conclusion can be drawn by considering the following factors: 1. Resource availability - As described, when there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can reproduce more easily, resulting in a high birth rate, and thus, a high growth rate of the species. Since Country A has a large population of the species, it is likely that the resources are more limited compared to Country B, which has a smaller population. Consequently, the species in Country A could face increased competition for limited resources, making it difficult for each individual to thrive, reproduce, and contribute to population growth. 2. Carrying capacity - The carrying capacity refers to the maximum number of individuals of a species that a given environment can sustain. When an ecosystem reaches its carrying capacity for a specific species, the growth rate of that species decreases. As the population size in Country A is large, it is possible that it could be approaching or has already reached its carrying capacity for the species. On the other hand, the population of the same species in Country B is smaller, indicating that there might be more room for population growth before reaching its carrying capacity. 3. Density-dependent factors - As population density increases, some factors can cause higher mortality rates or decreased reproduction in a species due to increased competition. These factors, known as density-dependent factors, include limited food supply, increased predation, competition for mates, and increased exposure to diseases and parasites. In Country A, with a larger population, these density-dependent factors could contribute to a lower growth rate when compared to Country B. 4. Genetic diversity - Although not directly related to population growth rate, genetic diversity within a population is important for long-term sustainability. A smaller population, such as in Country B, is more prone to losing genetic diversity due to inbreeding. While this might not influence the immediate growth rate, it can result in long-term negative effects on the population, such as decreased adaptability, increased vulnerability to environmental changes, and a reduced ability to cope with diseases. In conclusion, considering the elements that influence population growth in nature, it is likely that Country A would experience a lower growth rate of the species compared to Country B. However, it is essential to keep in mind that actual outcomes might depend on various external factors, such as intervention efforts, changes in environmental conditions, or the introduction of new species into the ecosystem that could affect the dynamics of species growth."},{"instruction":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Polish.

Henry Moore was born in Castleford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Mary Baker and Raymond Spencer Moore. His father was of Irish origin and became pit deputy and then under-manager of the Wheldale colliery in Castleford. He was an autodidact with an interest in music and literature. Determined that his sons would not work in the mines, he saw formal education as the route to their advancement. Henry was the seventh of eight children in a family that often struggled with poverty. He attended infant and elementary schools in Castleford, where he began modelling in clay and carving in wood. He professed to have decided to become a sculptor when he was eleven after hearing of Michelangelo's achievements at a Sunday School reading.On his second attempt he was accepted at Castleford Grammar School, which several of his siblings had attended, where his headmaster soon noticed his talent and interest in medieval sculpture. His art teacher broadened his knowledge of art, and with her encouragement, he determined to make art his career; first by sitting for examinations for a scholarship to the local art college. Moore's earliest recorded carvings – a plaque for the Scott Society at Castleford Secondary School, and a Roll of Honour commemorating the boys who went to fight in the First World War from the school – were executed around this time.Despite his early promise, Moore's parents had been against him training as a sculptor, a vocation they considered manual labour with few career prospects. After a brief introduction as a student teacher, Moore became a teacher at the school he had attended. Upon turning eighteen, Moore volunteered for army service. He was the youngest man in the Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles regiment and was injured in 1917 in a gas attack, on 30 November at Bourlon Wood, during the Battle of Cambrai.

She looks like Ilsa, the wife of the baron (played by Boris Karloff), who died twenty years before. Investigating who the woman really is, Andre stumbles upon a hidden secret of the Baron: After he found Ilsa sleeping with another man named Eric, the Baron killed his wife while his servant killed Eric, or so he explains. All the while, the phantom of Ilsa remained under the control of a peasant witch (Dorothy Neumann), who has commanded the ghost to torment the Baron for the previous two years.

This space should be ideal for your projector and have plenty of room for the screen to hang an appropriate distance from your projector. Make sure you have a wall with enough empty space to accommodate your finished screen. You should have enough space in the room to allow your projector the right amount of distance from the screen. All projector models will have different requirements. Once you've found the ideal space in your home for your projector and projector screen you will want to measure the actual size of the image from your projector. Measuring the image size that you plan on using will allow you to determine the final size of your projector screen. Turn your projector on and have it set to its test image. Measure the size of the image where you will be using your screen. Record both the width and the length of the screen. Having measured the image size that your projector will be using, you are ready to gather your materials for the screen. The size you are building your screen will vary depending on space and projector model. However, you will need the following basic materials: Four pine boards for the frame. Two will be longer and will run horizontally and two shorter boards will be used for the vertical sides of the frame. Material for the screen itself. 53” seamless white paper or blackout cloth can be good choices. Make sure to have at least an extra 5” of your screen material so that you can attach it to the back of your frame. Screws and a screwdriver. Flat corner braces. Three or four picture hangers. A level and pencil to mark guidelines. The frame will be the base upon which your projector screen will be fixed. Creating a square and level frame will help keep your screen flat, smooth, and optimized for using your projector on. Take the following steps to create the perfect frame: Cut your boards with a handsaw to the length you need if they are too long. Lay the frame out. Place a corner brace on each corner where the boards meets. Sink your screws into the wood through the corner braces. Check to see how stable your frame is. You can add additional braces if needed. Once your frame has been built you can affix your projection screen material on and over it. Make sure you work slowly and carefully when attaching the screen to ensure that it properly covers the frame and is free from any wrinkles or dips that could affect picture quality. Lay your screen down flat on the floor. Place your frame on top of your screen and center it. Pull the extra screen material up and over the edge of the frame. Start stapling the screen to the frame. Space your staples about ten inches apart. Keep the screen tight as you add staples, removing wrinkles as you go. Go around again and place staples every five inches. Although your screen is technically ready to be used you will want to add a few more elements to it. These last few additions will allow you to easily hang it on a wall and can help make the edges of the screen look clean and professional. Screw in regular picture hangers evenly along the top horizontal beam of your frame. You can try adding black artists tape to the edges of your screen to give it a nice stylistic finish. Adding a dark border can also help improve picture quality by cutting down on light reflection. Before you can hang your projector screen you will need to make sure you are hanging it in the right place. Once you hang your projector screen it will be difficult to reposition, so take your time and be exact. Turn your projectors test image on. Use a pencil to lightly outline where the image is being projected. Use this guideline to help you hang your projector screen in just the right place. Now that your screen has been attached to your frame it's time to hang the entire screen on a wall. Place your screen in the exact position that you took your original screen measurements from to ensure that the projected image will fit. Once your screen is hung on the wall it's time to sit back and enjoy your favorite films on it. Use a stud finder to locate stable places on your wall to install the hanger screws and mark them with a pencil. Draw a level line between the points where you will be adding the hanger screws. Install the hanger screws using a screwdriver. Hang the projector screen and enjoy.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Less isotopes turn into different elements happens, how will it affect LESS radioactive decay occurring. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If less isotopes turn into different elements, it implies that there is a decrease in the rate of radioactive decay. The perturbation hypothesis focuses on the possibility of a decrease in radioactive decay. To answer your question, yes, the supposed perturbation has a direct effect on the process. To elaborate, let's revisit the process and consider the impact of the perturbation hypothesis at each stage: 1. An isotope has too many protons: This initial stage remains unchanged, as isotopes with an excessive number of protons will still exist. 2. The isotope is unstable: The unstable nature of the isotope due to having too many protons is still present. 3. The isotope emits radiation: The isotopes will continue to emit radiation as a result of their instability. However, the rate of emission may be affected by the perturbation hypothesis. 4. The isotope decays: At this stage, the perturbation hypothesis comes into play. If fewer isotopes turn into different elements, the rate of decay will be reduced compared to the normal process. 5. The isotope loses some atomic particles: This process is still involved. However, since the decay rate has been reduced by the perturbation hypothesis, fewer atomic particles will be lost over a given period. 6. The isotope turns into a different element: This stage is directly affected by the hypothesis. As fewer isotopes turn into different elements, the occurrence of new elements produced through radioactive decay will be reduced. 7. The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation: The perturbation hypothesis affects the time it takes for an isotope to reach this stage. As fewer isotopes turn into different elements, the decay process becomes slower, and isotopes will take longer to stop decaying and emitting radiation. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis suggesting that fewer isotopes turn into different elements has a direct effect on the radioactive decay process, leading to a reduction in the rate of decay and the formation of new elements. This results in a prolonged time for isotopes to reach stability and stop emitting radiation."},{"instruction":"Sentence: name = The Waterman, eatType = restaurant, food = Fast food, customer rating = 1 out of 5, area = riverside, familyFriendly = yes Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","output":"Certainly!

Norm was a totally normal individual, while Ian had Down syndrome. Their parents loved them both equally. But I can use this background: One of the most common chromosome abnormalities is Down syndrome , due to nondisjunction of chromosome 21 resulting in an extra complete chromosome 21, or part of chromosome 21 ( Figure below ). Down syndrome is the only autosomal trisomy where an affected individual may survive to adulthood. Individuals with Down syndrome often have some degree of mental retardation, some impairment of physical growth, and a specific facial appearance. With proper assistance, individuals with Down syndrome can become successful, contributing members of society. The incidence of Down syndrome increases with maternal age. The risk of having a child with Down syndrome is significantly higher among women age 35 and older. What is an answer for this question: Which brother didn't have an autosomal trisomy ? The answer to this question is:","output":"Norm is the brother who did not have an autosomal trisomy. To better understand this answer, let's explore a bit more about autosomal trisomies and how they relate to the characteristics of Norm and Ian. An autosomal trisomy occurs when an individual has three copies of a certain chromosome, rather than the usual two. In the case of Down syndrome, this results from an extra copy of chromosome 21, also known as trisomy 21. This genetic abnormality can result from nondisjunction, a process where chromosomes fail to separate properly during cell division. Down syndrome, an autosomal trisomy, typically presents with several characteristic features which can vary in their expression and severity. Individuals with Down syndrome often have some degree of intellectual disability, delayed physical growth, and a distinctive facial appearance. Despite these challenges, with proper assistance and support, people with Down syndrome can lead successful, fulfilling lives and contribute to society in meaningful ways. Now, let's examine the brothers in question. Norm is described as a \\"totally normal individual,\\" which implies that he does not exhibit any of the signs or symptoms associated with Down syndrome. In other words, he does not have an autosomal trisomy affecting chromosome 21, or any other chromosome for that matter. On the other hand, Ian is described as having Down syndrome, a condition resulting from an autosomal trisomy of chromosome 21. This means that unlike his brother Norm, Ian has three copies of chromosome 21. To conclude, Norm is the brother who did not have an autosomal trisomy, as he does not display the signs or symptoms associated with Down syndrome. Ian, who has Down syndrome, is the one with the autosomal trisomy of chromosome 21, which contributes to the unique traits and challenges he experiences."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

Thảo was told by Khiêm, his superior, to locate Diệm and prevent him from being killed. When Thảo arrived at Ma Tuyen's house, he phoned his superiors. Diệm and Nhu overheard him and Thơ drove them to the nearby Catholic church of St. Francis Xavier, which they had frequented over the years. Lieutenant Thơ died a few months later in a plane crash, but his diary was not found until 1970. Thơ recorded Diệm's words as they left the house of Ma Tuyen as being \\"I don't know whether I will live or die and I don't care, but tell Nguyễn Khánh that I have great affection for him and he should avenge me\\". Soon after the early morning mass was celebrated for All Souls' Day (the Catholic day of the dead) and after the congregation had left the building, the Ngô brothers walked through the shady courtyard and into the church wearing dark grey suits.

Given that the reviewer states, \\"It works as promised!\\" the review seems to be expressing a favorable sentiment. However, the review is quite brief and lacking specific details, which makes it difficult to assign a clear rating. Nevertheless, I will base my analysis on the provided information. Considering the positive sentiment, I would rate this review as follows: - Sentiment: 4 out of 5 – The reviewer appears to be happy with the product and feels that it meets its purpose. However, without specific details on the qualities or features that they liked, this assessment is not as strong as it could be. - Informativeness: 2 out of 5 – The review is lacking in detail and fails to mention any specifics that could help other consumers make a more informed decision. It's essential to provide information on the specific reasons why a product works as promised or, in the case of a negative review, examples of why it falls short. In its current form, the review does little to give potential buyers a comprehensive understanding of the product. - Persuasiveness: 3 out of 5 – The positive sentiment can have a persuasive impact on potential customers; however, the lack of supporting details or examples leaves room for doubt. A more comprehensive review would ideally feature specific aspects or experiences with the product that justify the \\"works as promised\\" assertion. Overall, I would rate this review as a 3 out of 5. While the positive sentiment may encourage some potential buyers, the lack of information makes it difficult to assess the true value and user experience of the product. If the reviewer provided more context or specific examples to back up their claim, the review would likely be more valuable and informative for future customers."},{"instruction":"\\"Good Kid M.A.A.D City\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Answer:","output":"The sport you're referring to is Futsal. Futsal is a variant of football (soccer) that is generally played on a smaller, indoor court. The dimensions you have mentioned are typically standard for a futsal court. Usually, a futsal court can range from 20 x 10 meters (for a mini court in youth levels) to 30 x 20 meters (for an international standard court). Let's go more into detail about Futsal. Futsal originated in Uruguay in 1930 and has grown in popularity since then. Futsal is governed differently around the world. FIFA and the Asociación Mundial de Futsal (AMF) both govern the sport, but each has its unique set of rules. The sport was named “Futebol de salão”, which translates to room football, as it was initially played in small, confined spaces. The name was eventually shortened to Futsal. The game of Futsal is known for its fast-paced nature, which enhances skill development such as ball control, footwork, coordination, and spatial awareness. It’s also famous for its emphasis on improvisation, creativity, and technique. Speaking of the players, a typical team consists of five players, including one goalkeeper, similar to the number you stated. A total of seven players including substitutes are allowed 'in play' at any one time per side. However, during the course of the game, Futsal allows unlimited substitutions, meaning all twelve players listed on a team's game card prior to the match kick-off can participate in the game. The duration of a Futsal match is split into two halves, each lasting 20 minutes, for a total game time of 40 minutes at the professional level. Instead of the four periods lasting about 8 minutes each you have mentioned, the match typically consists of two halves of 20 minutes. However, in some instances, the match can be played in four periods, especially in youth levels and in certain leagues or tournaments. This format helps minimize fatigue and helps players maintain a high tempo and quality of play. The game is generally free flowing, but the referee can stop the clock for fouls, injuries, or other interruptions, which is known as 'stoppage time', similar to traditional football. There’s also a halftime break, ranging from 10 to 15 minutes. This can extend the overall duration of the match beyond 40 minutes. In conclusion, the sport you are referring to, which is played in an area varying between 20 x 10 and 30 x 20 meters with 7 players in play at any one time per side playing for around 8 minutes for each of four periods, matches the description of Futsal, primarily when played at youth levels or in certain leagues or tournaments."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this \\"Open the Google Play Store.

As of 2010, the most efficient yellow phosphor is still the YAG phosphor, with less than 10% Stoke shift loss. Losses attributable to internal optical losses due to re-absorption in the LED chip and in the LED packaging itself account typically for another 10% to 30% of efficiency loss. Currently, in the area of phosphor LED development, much effort is being spent on optimizing these devices to higher light output and higher operation temperatures. For instance, the efficiency can be raised by adapting better package design or by using a more suitable type of phosphor. Conformal coating process is frequently used to address the issue of varying phosphor thickness.\\" Answer: The answer is:","output":"Stoke shift loss causes a smaller loss compared to internal optical losses. Step 1: Identify the information given in the context. - YAG phosphor has less than 10% Stoke shift loss. - Internal optical losses account for 10-30% of efficiency loss. Step 2: Compare the losses. - Stoke shift loss: less than 10% - Internal optical losses: 10-30% Step 3: Determine which loss is smaller.

Cristiano Ronaldo made it 2-2 from the spot after Gareth Bale had headed in Real's first. Substitute Alvaro Morata then nodded in the winner seven minutes from time. Real have 55 points, one clear of Barcelona who defeated Atletico Madrid 2-1 earlier on Sunday. Real also have a game in hand over their fierce rivals and over Sevilla, who sit in third with 52 points. Relive the action as it happened Coach Fran Escriba's Villarreal went into the match with the tag of 'the meanest defence in the league', having conceded only 15 goals this season. They lived up to that in the opening half, by barely giving Real a sniff. The closest the visitors came to scoring was when Karim Benzema's header was spectacularly saved by Sergio Asenjo, from point-blank range, The keeper was substituted having suffered a knee injury in keeping out the France striker's effort. It was later revealed the 27-year-old had suffered cruciate damage. After the break, Villarreal took a deserved lead when Manu Trigueros fired a half volley past the reach of keeper Keylor Navas. Six minutes later, Real were rocked once more when Congolese forward Cedric Bakambu out-muscled Sergio Ramos to fire in low. The visitors were staring at defeat. Los Blancos pulled a goal back in the 64th minute when full-back Dani Carvajal picked out Bale with a great cross. However, Villarreal still looked comfortable until the 73rd minute when their opponents were awarded a hotly disputed penalty. Victor Ruiz blocked Toni Kroos' low shot but the ball spun up on to the arm of Bruno Soriano. Referee Gil Manzano thought it was intentional handball and pointed to the spot leading to furious exchanges between Villarreal staff on the touchline and the fourth official. Substitute Roberto Soldado was shown a yellow card for dissent. Ronaldo fired in the penalty and Real sensed that they could snatch one of their most surprising wins of the season. With seven minutes of the contest left, Real realised just that when substitute Morata headed in from Marcelo's pinpoint cross. In the 88th minute, Bale was replaced by Lucas Vazquez moments after he appeared to land awkwardly on his ankle. The Wales international, who has only just recently returned to action after two months out, did not appear to be in discomfort as he walked off the pitch. Match ends, Villarreal 2, Real Madrid 3.

The turning point of the game came at the score of 2-1, when Villarreal's Bruno Soriano was purported to have committed a handball in the penalty area, a call that was debated as to whether it was intentional or not. Cristiano Ronaldo of Real Madrid capitalized on this opportunity, scoring from the penalty spot to tie the game 2-2 after Gareth Bale had netted Real's first goal earlier in the match. The winning score was delivered by substitute player Alvaro Morata, who managed to make a successful shot with just seven minutes to spare. As a result, Real Madrid now leads with 55 points, just one more than Barcelona. The match was played against the backdrop of Villarreal's reputation as having the toughest defense in the league, having only conceded 15 goals this entire season. They maintained this standing during the first half of the match, shutting out Real Madrid from scoring opportunities, including an impressive save of Karim Benzema's header by Villarreal's goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo at point-blank range. Asenjo later had to be substituted due to a knee injury sustained during his save. In the second half of the match, Villarreal led initially with Manu Trigueros and Cedric Bakambu scoring for their team. However, Real Madrid caught up with goals from Bale and Ronaldo, leading to Morata's winning shot later on. The match saw its share of penalties and yellow cards over the lineups of both teams. Villarreal's Roberto Soldado, Bruno Soriano, Mario, and Alvaro Gonzalez were all shown yellow cards, with Soriano's alleged intentional handball leading to Ronaldo's game-tying penalty shot. Real Madrid's Sergio Ramos and Pepe were also shown yellow cards. Despite their victory, some concern was shown for Real Madrid's Gareth Bale, who had to be substituted near the end of the game after seeming to land his ankle awkwardly, though he appeared undisturbed as he exited the pitch. Subsequent attempts at goal by both teams were unsuccessful, leaving the final score at Villarreal 2, Real Madrid 3."},{"instruction":"using the web to tweet, phone is crap Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.

Ecologist Dr Derek Lee, founder of the Wild Nature Institute (WNI) , which conducts scientific research on at-risk wildlife species, took the amazing photographs in Tarangire National Park. “Omo is leucistic, meaning many of the skin cells are incapable of making a pigment. Some are, so she is pale but not pure white, with red or blue eyes, as a true albino would be,” he explained. “Omo is the only pale giraffe we are currently aware of, but we have also observed leucistic waterbuck, Cape buffalo and ostrich in Tarangire. “Omo appears to get along with the other giraffes, she has always been seen with a large group of normally coloured giraffe, they don't seem to mind her different colouring.” Photo: DEREK LEE/ CATERS NEWS However he warned that her unique colour could make her a target for poachers in the African park. He added: “Omo is now 15 months old. She survived her first year as a small calf, which is the most dangerous time for a young giraffe due to lion, leopard and hyena preying on them. “Her chances of surviving to adulthood are good but adult giraffes are regularly poached for bush meat, and her colouration might make her a target. “We and our partners are working on giraffe conservation and anti-poaching to help give Omo and her relatives a better chance of survival. “We hope that she lives a long life and that someday she has calves of her own.” The WNI blog adds: “We were lucky enough to see her again this January, almost exactly one year [after the first sighting]. “We are thrilled that she is still alive and well.

While Omo may appear to be an albino, she is actually leucistic, according to the organization. “One way to tell the difference between albino and leucistic animals is that albino individuals lack melanin everywhere, including in the eyes, so the resulting eye color is red from the underlying blood vessels,” the organization said.

In order to understand this, let's break down and analyze the components of the sentence: 1. \\"of an overripe episode of tv 's dawson 's creek\\": The word “overripe” typically carries a negative connotation, implying that something has gone past its peak and is no longer fresh or enjoyable. In this context, the implication is that the episode in question is stale and not at its best, regardless of whether the show itself is considered good or bad. As a result, this part of the sentence has a negative sentiment. 2. \\"and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story\\": This segment refers to a version of a love story that has been “recycled” and “dumbed-down.” The word “recycled” indicates that the story is unoriginal and has borrowed heavily from other sources, which is generally seen as negative. Similarly, “dumbed-down” implies that the story has been simplified and reduced to a lower level of quality or intellectual engagement, further contributing to the negative sentiment. Thus, by considering the individual components of the sentence, it becomes evident that the sentiment of the entire sentence is negative. The sentence suggests that the subject matter is stale, unoriginal, and has been cheapened or oversimplified, and these are all negative qualities."},{"instruction":"Select from the following. +performs tricks with the instrument. +smiles while sitting and watches the gymnast perform. +assembles a gymnastics equipment piece in the living room. +spins himself around the beam several times and poses for the audience.Choose from options above and answer: What most naturally follows?

In the question, the two main elements are: - Austin was a nice person. - Austin improved Lee's situation. Step 2: Understand the emotional impact of each element. As Austin is described as a nice person, it can be deduced that they would have good intentions and possibly feel positive emotions when helping others. Moreover, the fact that Austin improved Lee's situation indicates that something beneficial or good has been done for Lee due to Austin's actions. Step 3: Assess the possible answers based on the context and the emotional impact of each element. Great: This answer aligns with the context and actions of Austin, as they are a nice person who helped improve Lee's situation. The feelings of accomplishment and fulfillment of helping someone else are consistent with possibly feeling great afterwards. Angry: This answer is not in line with the context, as there is no indication that Austin would feel angry after helping someone, since they are described as a nice person. Upset: This answer also does not align with the context. As a nice person who improved someone's situation, there is no reason to assume Austin would feel upset afterwards.

Adam Crafton for the Daily Mail. Mathieu Flamini believes Arsenal are finally getting to grips with the perils of life on the road in the Barclays Premier League after the Gunners rallied to hold Everton to a 2-2 draw at Goodison. The Londoners were humbled 3-0 on this ground late last season and looked to be heading for further embarrassment on Merseyside after Seamus Coleman and Steven Naismith gave Everton a two-goal lead going into the break. But, after Aaron Ramsey cut the deficit after 83 minutes, substitute Olivier Giroud headed a late equaliser from Nacho Monreal's cross. Scroll down for videos... On the road: Mathieu Flamini claims that Arsenal have learned how to play difficult away games. One downbeat note for the Gunners was the half-time substitution of Chilean Alexis Sanchez, their £35million summer signing, who manager Arsene Wenger felt 'struggled with the physicality' and which saw the lively Giroud brought on. But French midfielder Flamini said: 'We've learned a lot from last year about playing these kind of teams away and we came back today and tried to be stronger. 'We didn't give up until the last second so it was a game to remember for us. It was a great performance from the team because being 2-0 down was not easy for us. Even though we were losing in the first half we had a few occasions to score so it was a bit unfair for us.' Hope: Aaron Ramsey collects the ball after scoring late to bring the score to 2-1 at Goodison. Game changer: Olivier Giroud came off the bench to score the equaliser before a late ankle injury. Meanwhile, Arsene Wenger praised Giroud for changing the game after coming on as a second-half substitute. 'We looked much more dangerous (after Giroud came on),' the Arsenal manager said. 'I knew we were dominating the game in the second half and we needed some physical presence up front. That presence was very important. 'He had a very good second half.' Unfortunately for Wenger, Giroud suffered an ankle injury in the dying minutes and could now miss the second leg of Arsenal's Champions League play-off against Besiktas. 'It is a big game and I hope we have not lost him,' said Wenger of Giroud, who left Goodison Park with a protective boot on his left foot. 'In the final minute he stretched his ankle. At the moment it doesn't look too good. ' Not fit enough! Alexis Sanchez was withdrawn at half-time after an ineffectual performance. Sanchez is likely to lead the line against the Turks, who gained a 0-0 draw against the Gunners in Istanbul on Wednesday. Wenger said he had no option but to withdraw the £35million signing at half-time on Saturday. 'At the moment he is not completely ready physically,' Wenger said. 'He knows he is not at his best physically but when he is his confidence will come back.'

Tree A, B, and C possess varying quantities of these magical fruits. We are given that when we sum the fruits on these three trees, the total fruits we get is 18. We can denote the number of fruits on each tree as follows: - Number of fruits on Tree A = a - Number of fruits on Tree B = b - Number of fruits on Tree C = c The given information can be represented as an equation: a + b + c = 18 Now, finding the possible values for a, b, and c: 1. a=1, b=2, c=15 (here, a is the smallest and c is the largest) 2. a=1, b=3, c=14 (a and b are incremented by 1, and c is decremented by 1) 3. a=1, b=4, c=13 4. a=1, b=5, c=12 5. a=1, b=6, c=11 6. a=1, b=7, c=10 7. a=1, b=8, c=9 8. a=2, b=3, c=13 (starting with a as 2, and incrementing a and b while decrementing c) 9. a=2, b=4, c=12 10. a=2, b=5, c=11 11. a=2, b=6, c=10 12. a=2, b=7, c=9 13. a=3, b=4, c=11 (starting with a as 3, and incrementing a and b while decrementing c) 14. a=3, b=5, c=10 15. a=3, b=6, c=9 16. a=4, b=5, c=9 (starting with a as 4, and incrementing a and b while decrementing c) 17. a=4, b=6, c=8 18. a=5, b=6, c=7 (last possibility, as further incrementing a and b would make their sum larger than 18) Hence, there are 18 different combinations of fruit count for trees A, B, and C that total 18 magical fruits.

Inspired by the variety of music that his parents listened to, which included country, rock, disco and R&B, McGaughey first sang in his church choir before founding an R&B band. He later switched his focus to country music, performing in various bars and clubs in Texas. McGaughey, after attending junior college near his hometown, found work selling shoes at a shopping mall. Context: He then signed to Atlantic Records in 1990, changing his surname to McCoy per the label's request, as fans had already begun to refer to him as McCoy. His debut album, At This Moment, was released that year. None of the three singles made the country Top 40, although the lead-off single \\"If I Built You a Fire\\" was a Top 20 country hit in Canada. The other two releases were the title track, a cover of Billy Vera and the Beaters' hit song from 1987, and \\"This Time I've Hurt Her More Than She Loves Me\\", which was co-written by Earl Thomas Conley and originally recorded by Conway Twitty. McCoy continued touring and developed a \\"reputation for exciting, freewheeling live shows.\\" A second album for Atlantic, Where Forever Begins, followed in 1992.
