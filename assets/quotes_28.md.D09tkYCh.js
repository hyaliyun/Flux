La Loi sur la citoyenneté canadienne est entrée en vigueur le 1er janvier 1947. Translate to English.","output":"The Canadian Citizenship Act came into force on January 1, 1947.  The Canadian Citizenship Act, also known as the Citizenship Act of 1946 or the Act of 1947, marked a significant milestone in the history of Canada and Canadian immigration. Prior to the enactment of this law, Canadian citizens were considered British subjects, and there was no unique Canadian citizenship. The Act aims to define Canadian citizenship and the rights and responsibilities that come with it. The adoption of the Canadian Citizenship Act in 1947 was an important step towards Canada's evolution into an independent nation with its distinct national identity. The transition from British subject to Canadian citizen symbolized the country's growing autonomy from Great Britain. The Act established the criteria for obtaining Canadian citizenship, which included: 1. Birthright citizenship: Individuals born in Canada were automatically considered Canadian citizens, regardless of their parents' nationality. 2. Naturalization: Immigrants who had lived in Canada for a specific period (originally five years) could apply for Canadian citizenship. They had to demonstrate the knowledge of one of the two official languages (English or French), exhibit good character and understanding of Canadian rights and responsibilities, and pass a Citizenship exam. This made it more accessible to immigrants of various cultural and linguistic backgrounds. 3. Citizenship by descent: Children born to Canadian citizens outside of Canada could claim Canadian citizenship through their parental lineage. The Act also specified conditions under which an individual could lose their Canadian citizenship, such as fraud, revocation of naturalization, denaturalization, or through voluntary renunciation. Over the years, the Canadian Citizenship Act has gone through several amendments to address the changing needs and concerns of the Canadian population. Some of these revisions included the elimination of discriminatory clauses, the introduction of dual citizenship, the expansion of eligibility requirements, and the international adoption of children by Canadian citizens. Today, the Canadian Citizenship Act continues to serve as the foundation for defining Canadian citizenship and the rights and responsibilities that come with it. This legislation symbolizes the unique Canadian identity and accentuates the nation's commitment to diversity, equality, and multiculturalism."},{"instruction":"Question: Pick one category for the following text.

Q: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) approaches have been an influential framework for the usage of unlabeled data when there is not a sufficient amount of labeled data available over the course of training. SSL methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently provided successful results on standard benchmark tasks such as image classification. In this work, we consider the general setting of  SSL problem where the labeled and unlabeled data  come from the same underlying probability distribution. We  propose a new approach that adopts  an Optimal Transport (OT) technique serving as a metric of similarity between discrete empirical probability measures to  provide pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data, which can then be used in conjunction with the initial labeled data to train the CNN model in an SSL manner. We have evaluated and compared our proposed method with state-of-the-art SSL algorithms on standard datasets to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our  SSL algorithm.

Does every object have a lever arm? What is a lever arm (physics)? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"Hello little buddy! Let's talk about lever arms. 1. Does every object have a lever arm? Every object doesn't exactly have a lever arm, but you can use a lever arm with almost any object. Let's say you want to lift a big rock. If you use a long stick and put it under the rock with one end on the ground, you can push down on the other end to lift the rock. The stick acts like a lever, and the distance from the rock to the end you push on is the lever arm. The longer the lever arm, the easier it is to lift the rock. 2. What is a lever arm (physics)? A lever arm is like a helper in physics. Think of a see-saw, where two kids sit on opposite ends and go up and down. The lever arm is the distance from the center (where the see-saw balances on) to where the kids sit. The longer the lever arm, the more help it gives to move something. Remember the lifting rock example? The long stick was like a see-saw, and the lever arm helped you lift the rock! 3. Would you say that these questions are the same? These questions are related but not the same. The first question asks if every object has a lever arm, while the second question asks for the meaning of a lever arm in physics. Now you know that objects don't have lever arms, but you can use lever arms with objects to make things easier to move!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

She is married to Gordon Wink (Richard Steinmetz), a detective with the LAPD, with whom we see some flashbacks of their relationship. Fairfax (Charles M. Huber), a ruthless South African criminal mastermind prone to quoting Shakespeare, is intent on collecting a series of four interlocking electronic devices or circuits that can somehow \\"shift the balance of power in the world.\\" It is not in any way explained how these devices will achieve this, other than mention that it is involved with satellite tracking, that a whole city could be destroyed and a Third World country is in danger. Through deception and violence he has managed to acquire three of the devices. Carrie, unbeknownst to her, has shuttled two of Fairfaxâs goons to the site of one of their exchanges. The location of the fourth device, tucked away in the Zitex building, an 86-floor skyscraper in downtown Los Angeles, is the scene where most of the drama unfolds as Fairfax sets his sights on securing the last device. Carrie is again called to pick up a pair of VIPs, who this time turn out to be Fairfax himself and his French assistant Jacques (Jonathan Fuller). She takes them to the Zitex building, where Fairfax has his band of terrorists take over the entire security system and liquidate the security guards as well appropriate an entire floor. Somehow there seems to be very few people in the 86-floor building. He meets up with Cranston (Eugene Robert Glazer), the possessor of the fourth device. As with the previous three deliverers of the devices, Fairfax plans on killing him. Cranston is mortally wounded in a shootout. Before entering the building, Cranston had suspected trouble, so his companion went in unseen. Before he dies, Cranston escapes with the suitcase holding the device and meets up with Carrie, who helps him up to the roof. He gives her the suitcase and admonishes her...

Through the fissure, a giant monster appears, and destroys portions of San Francisco. After many days and countless lives, the creature is defeated by human military forces.However, what seemed to be an isolated attack builds, as more creatures begin to come through the fissure, attacking coastal cities around the Pacific. The World unites to stop the invaders, and build The Jaeger Program: a series of giant mechanical 'monsters,' intended to stop the creatures.Original tests to have one pilot per Jaeger prove unsuccessful, as the test subjects were not able to handle the stress and strain of controlling such a huge robot by themselves. It was then decided that each Jaeger would be piloted by two pilots, their memories linked together in The Drift, synchronizing their movements to maneuver the massive machines.As the Jaegers go to work, they begin to turn the tides, and take down the creatures (known as Kaiju). Pretty soon, the world is enthralled by the Jaegers and their pilots. They become celebrities, and even have merchandise made. As well, the dead Kaiju are soon seen as a black-market commodity, their parts sold off for various collections and medicinal purposes.But just as the war seems to be turning in humanity's favor, the Kaiju's attacks become more frequent and more brutal.In 2020, seven years after the fissure opened, one of the more famous Jaeger duos, Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam), and his older brother, Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) have become heroes with an impeccable record of defeating Kaijus.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Most flatworms have a distinct head region that includes nerve cells and sensory organs, such as eyespots. The development of a head region, called cephalization , evolved at the same time as bilateral symmetry in animals. This process does not occur in cnidarians, which evolved prior to flatworms and have radial symmetry.   Q: The development of a head region is called what?   A: A:","output":"The development of a head region in animals is called cephalization. This evolutionary process involves the concentration of nerve cells, sensory organs, and other important structures in the anterior (front) part of an organism, forming a distinct head region. Cephalization is closely associated with the emergence of bilateral symmetry, as it allows for more efficient movement and coordinated responses to environmental stimuli. In comparison, cnidarians, which evolved earlier than flatworms, do not exhibit cephalization; instead, they have radial symmetry, with body parts arranged symmetrically around a central axis. The presence of a head region, or cephalization, in flatworms and other bilaterally symmetric animals demonstrates an important step in the evolution of complex body plans and neurological systems. This concentration of neural and sensory components in the head region allows these animals to better process and respond to their surroundings, ultimately enhancing their survival and adaptability in various environments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A red dye called Kermes was made beginning in the Neolithic Period by drying and then crushing the bodies of the females of a tiny scale insect in the genus Kermes, primarily Kermes vermilio. The insects live on the sap of certain trees, especially Kermes oak trees near the Mediterranean region. Jars of kermes have been found in a Neolithic cave-burial at Adaoutse, Bouches-du-Rhône. Kermes from oak trees was later used by Romans, who imported it from Spain. A different variety of dye was made from Porphyrophora hamelii (Armenian cochineal) scale insects that lived on the roots and stems of certain herbs. It was mentioned in texts as early as the 8th century BC, and it was used by the ancient Assyrians and Persians. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What kind of bural was at Adaoutse, Bouches-du-Rhône?","output":"The burial at Adaoutse, Bouches-du-Rhône was likely a Neolithic cave-burial, as indicated by the context in which the jars of Kermes dye were found. Cave burials, in general, were a type of interment in which the remains of the deceased were placed in natural or artificially excavated caves. These burials can either contain individual or multiple bodies, depending on the specific cultural practices of the people occupying the area. In this particular case, it is not explicitly mentioned whether the cave burial contained a single individual or multiple bodies. However, the discovery of Kermes dye within the burial site suggests that this substance held cultural significance and may have been associated with funeral rituals or used as an offering to the dead. Artifacts found within cave burial sites often provide valuable insights into the cultural practices, beliefs, and daily lives of Neolithic people. The Neolithic Period, during which the use of Kermes dye originated, is marked by significant developments in human society, including the beginnings of agriculture, animal domestication, and the construction of permanent dwelling structures. As such, we can surmise that the burial at Adaoutse, Bouches-du-Rhône, reflects a community with complex social structures and evolving cultural beliefs surrounding death and the afterlife. In summary, the burial at Adaoutse, Bouches-du-Rhône was a Neolithic cave burial, a type of interment where remains were placed in natural or artificially excavated caves. The specific characteristics of this burial, such as the number of individuals interred and further details about the rituals performed, are not explicitly mentioned, but the presence of Kermes dye within the site highlights the cultural importance of this substance during this period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Tokyo (CNN) Under crisp blue skies, about 1,000 well-wishers turned out at the Meiji Shrine in Tokyo Monday to catch a glimpse of Japan's Princess Ayako and her groom Kei Moriya on their wedding day.      As the smiling couple entered the shrine, the crowd shouted their congratulations with the Japanese word \\"Banzai\\" -- meaning an auspicious wish for long life. Close family members and friends welcomed the bride and groom as they made their way to the ceremony hall.      Princess Ayako was dressed in a light yellow-colored uchiki kimono embroidered with pink flowers and green leaves and a deep purple hakama -- wide-legged pleated trousers that fall to the ankles. She also carried a fan made of Japanese cypress, called a hiougi. Moriya wore a western-style black morning coat, gray pin-striped trousers and a silk hat that belonged to Ayako's late father, Prince Takamodo.      Ayako's kimono is similar in style and design to that worn by her sister Princess Noriko when she married Kunimaro Senge in 2014.      The 28-year-old Princess Ayako is the youngest child of Princess Hisako and the late Prince Takamodo, cousin of Emperor Akihito. According to Japan's imperial law, female members of the royal family forfeit their titles, status and allowance if they choose to marry someone who does not have royal or aristocratic family ties. The same rule does not apply to male members of the royal family.      On marrying 32-year-old Moriya -- an employee of shipping company Nippon Yusen KK -- the princess will renounce her royal status and take a lump sum of 950,000 from the Japanese government for living expenses.      Japanese Princess Ayako, dressed in traditional ceremonial gown, and Japanese businessman Kei Moriya, arrive at Meiji Shrine for their wedding ceremony in Tokyo, Oct. 29, 2018.      Before the ceremony began, Ayako changed her kimono into a more formal Shinto-style robe. She wore a red kouchiki, a \\"small cloak\\" with long, wide sleeves, and a long divided brown skirt called a naga-bakama.      The ceremony itself was a private affair, attended only by close family members. Inside, the couple would have performed several rituals that mark a Shinto-style wedding, including exchanging nuptial sake cups and presenting a sacred Tamagushi branch as an offering. The newlyweds would have also exchanged marriage vows and rings.      After final prayers, the couple emerged from the shrine as husband and wife. Moriya said he thought his new wife looked \\"beautiful,\\" as they took questions from reporters. \\"I would like to support her firmly and, hand in hand, build a happy family with lots of laughter,\\" he said.      \\"I am awed by how blessed I am,\\" Ayako said. From a young age, Ayako said she was taught that being born into the imperial family meant her duty was to support the emperor and empress. \\"I will leave the imperial family today, but I will remain unchanged in my support for his majesty and her majesty,\\" she said.      Princess Ayako on her way to her wedding ceremony in Tokyo, Oct. 29, 2018.      The shrine where the ceremony took place is of huge symbolic importance. Opened in 1920, the Meiji Shrine is dedicated to the deified souls of Ayako's great-great grandfather Emperor Meiji and his wife, Empress Shoken.      \\"I am very happy that we held the wedding at this Meiji Shrine where my great grandfather Meiji Emperor is worshiped,\\" Ayako said. \\"I feel so happy.\\"      Ayoko's marriage and resignation from royal duties comes at a trying time for the world's oldest monarchy. The country's much-loved Emperor Akihitio announced that he will abdicate on April 30, 2019, passing the Chrysanthemum Throne to his son Crown Prince Naruhito. Imperial law states that the throne must be passed to male heirs, and as Naruhito has only one son, the 12-year-old Prince Hisahito could be left with the sole responsibility of carrying on the royal line.      Akihitio's abdication and the forthcoming marriage of his granddaughter Princess Mako reignited debate about the role women play in Japan's monarchy and whether imperial law should change to allow women to inherit the throne.      Newlyweds Princess Ayako and Kei Moriya speak to the reporters after their marriage ceremony at Meiji Shrine in Tokyo, Oct. 29, 2018.      \\"It is a sensible option and necessary in terms of managing risk but the elite conservatives that govern have resisted strongly despite robust public support for female succession,\\" said Jeff Kingston, Director of Asian Studies at Temple University Japan and author of upcoming book Japan.      Unlike in the United Kingdom, where Queen Elizabeth approved changes to the royal line of succession and gave equal rights to sons and daughters of British monarchs to inherit the throne, officials in Japan have ruled out a similar move.      An abdication law that allows Akihitio to resign was passed without a proposed resolution that potentially questions whether women who marry outside the family have to rescind their royal rights.      \\"Apparently they take no inspiration from Queen Elizabeth ... and instead take refuge behind fatuous patriarchal justifications for not doing so,\\" Kingston said. \\"The law will change only if it absolutely must.\\" ||||| Japanese Princess Ayako, right, dressed in traditional ceremonial robe, and groom Kei Moriya, left, speak to the reporters after their wedding ceremony at Meiji Shrine in Tokyo, Monday, Oct. 29, 2018....

(Associated Press)      TOKYO (AP) — Japan's Princess Ayako married a commoner in a ritual-filled ceremony Monday at Tokyo's Meiji Shrine.      Ayako and groom Kei Moriya were shown on national news walking slowly before guests at the shrine. The wedding took place in one of the pagoda-like buildings in the shrine complex and included an exchange of rings and a sharing of a cup of sake, according to Japanese media.      Both rituals are relatively routine for Shinto-style weddings, including those of regular Japanese.      Ayako, 28, is the daughter of the emperor's cousin, and Moriya, 32, works for major shipping company Nippon Yusen.      She wore a Heian-era style hairdo, which is swept back into a ponytail, and a traditional robe splashed with red and green patterns, while Moriya wore coattails. She later changed into a red Japanese robe.      \\"I am filled with happiness,\\" she told reporters after the ceremony.      Women who marry into the imperial family become members of the family, but those who marry commoners, like Ayako, must leave.      Moriya said he hoped to help Ayako adjust to a commoner's life.      \\"I want us to work together, hand in hand, to create a family filled with smiles,\\" he said.      Ayako bid farewell to Emperor Akihito last week. She said Monday she hoped to continue to help the emperor and empress as a former member of the imperial family.      The eldest granddaughter of the emperor is set to marry a commoner in 2020.      Akihito has said he will abdicate next year. His eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito, will ascend to the Chrysanthemum Throne on May 1.      Ayako and Moriya said when they announced their wedding plans that they met because their mothers were friends and hit it off immediately.      \\"It didn't feel as though we had met for the first time,\\" Ayako told reporters at their engagement.

Question: Did Fielding and Sarah have political differences? Movie title: Waking the Dead Movie plot: The first scene of the movie introduces Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup) as he is watching news footage showing that Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connelly) has been killed in a suspected car bombing. The reporter indicates that Sarah was an activist from Chicago involved in helping refugees from the Chilean government and that her death may cast new light on the movement. Fielding is completely distraught over hearing this news and the movie begins.The first 3/4 of the movie unfolds on parallel timelines in the 70s and early 80s: the progression of Fielding & Sarah's complicated, volatile relationship and Fielding's ascension into power as an upcoming politician dealing with the recent loss (and haunting memories) of Sarah.Fielding meets Sarah as he is returning, in uniform, from duty in the Coast Guard and meeting up with his brother, who is a editor. The brother, Fielding and Sarah all go to lunch where Fielding is very ouspoken in his political ideals about current events. Sarah and Fielding are both immediately intrigued by each other, Fielding's attraction being more sexual and blatant and Sarah's attraction more of curiousity and intrigue. A few dates quickly lead to a sexual relationship despite an obvious difference in political thinking between the two. Sarah asks why Fielding wants to be a senator and his very serious reply is that he doesn't- he wants to be president. Sarah is later quoted as saying \\"Ambition is the ice in the lake of emotion.\\" And when Fielding tries to comfort Sarah's fear of his Coast Guard duty leading to a Vietnam tour, she replies \\"but if you go over there, you'll be shooting at the guys that I want to win.\\" Their intense love outweighs their differences, though, and their relationship quickly becomes serious.Meanwhile Fielding is a young politician being groomed to be congressman by the current govenor because of a scandal involving Jerry Carmichael 's (Ed Harris in a cameo role) resignation due to his homosexuality. Fielding seems ambivalent about the offer to be put on the... Answer:","output":"Yes, Fielding and Sarah had significant political differences throughout the movie plot of \\"Waking the Dead.\\" Fielding Pierce, portrayed by Billy Crudup, is an ambitious and aspiring politician with plans to one day become the president. His political ideals are more in line with the mainstream and upholding the status quo. He is seen pursuing a political career, initially being groomed to be a congressman by the current governor due to a scandal involving Jerry Carmichael (played by Ed Harris). On the other hand, Sarah Williams, portrayed by Jennifer Connelly, is a passionate activist from Chicago who dedicates her life to helping refugees from the Chilean government. Her political beliefs lean more towards challenging the system, and she is vocal about her support for the underprivileged and those fighting against oppressive regimes. An example of the couple's differences in political views is highlighted when Sarah expresses her support for the people opposing the Vietnam War, stating that if Fielding went to Vietnam, he would be shooting at the people she wants to win. Despite their stark differences in political beliefs, Fielding and Sarah find themselves attracted to and intrigued by each other. Their intense love and strong emotional connection overshadow their contrasting political views, and they quickly become involved in a deep, complicated relationship. As you consider investing in this film proposal, it is important to weigh the potential market interest in a movie that delves into the complexities of a relationship amid the backdrop of contrasting political beliefs and ideals. While the storyline presents a unique combination of romance, politics, and personal growth, its success will depend upon the execution, talent involved, and the target audience's appreciation for such themes. Understanding the current market trends, the relevance of the subject matter, and how it might resonate with audiences will be crucial in making an informed decision about whether or not to invest in this film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was drafted by the New York Giants in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft. He played college football at Texas A&M, where he earned All-American honors. Hypothesis: Damontre moore was 16 years old when he was drafted into the NFL.","output":"To evaluate the given hypothesis, we should first extract relevant information from the context and then perform necessary calculations. Step 1: Extract relevant information - Damontre Moore was drafted in the 2013 NFL Draft. - He was born on September 11, 1992. Step 2: Calculate his age at the time of the draft - The 2013 NFL Draft took place from April 25 to April 27, 2013. - To find Damontre Moore's age during the draft, we need to calculate the difference between his birth date and the draft date. Calculation: - Draft year: 2013 - Birth year: 1992 - Difference in years: 2013 - 1992 = 21 years  Since Damontre Moore's birth date is September 11, 1992, and the draft took place in April 2013, we can deduce that he was still 20 years old during the time of the draft (He would turn 21 later in September 2013).

What is the answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who was bitten by a monkey? from the following article ?  By the 18th century, the menagerie was open to the public; admission cost three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. By the end of the century, that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811. An 1800 inventory also listed a tiger, leopards, a hyena, a large baboon, various types of monkeys, wolves and \\"other animals\\". By 1822, however, the collection included only a grizzly bear, an elephant and some birds. Additional animals were then introduced. In 1828 there were over 280 representing at least 60 species as the new keeper Alfred Copps was actively acquiring animals.After the death of George IV in 1830, a decision was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.In 1999, physical evidence of lion cages was found, one being 2x3 metres (6.5x10 feet) in size, very small for a lion that can grow to be 2.5 meters (approximately 8 feet) long. In 2008, the skulls of two male Barbary lions (now extinct in the wild) from northwest Africa were found in the moat area of the Tower. Radiocarbon tests dated them from 1280–1385 and 1420–1480. During 2011 an exhibition was hosted at the Tower with fine wire sculptures by Kendra Haste. The answer to this question is:","output":"Seymour.

He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.”  Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. Question: What will likely happen to those who continue to eat burgers and cheese fries? Options:  A. not enough information  B. they will have an increased risk of disease  C. they will enjoy their food more  D. they will be healthier than those who don't The answer is:","output":"B. they will have an increased risk of disease Step 1: Understand the context provided - The context talks about the benefits of the Mediterranean diet and how it can contribute to a healthier aging process. It also mentions that the standard American diet is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, and processed food, which can be harmful to one's health. Step 2: Review the question - The question asks what will likely happen to those who continue to eat burgers and cheese fries, which are examples of unhealthy food options. Step 3: Analyze the options - Option A, not enough information, can be eliminated because the context provides information about the consequences of unhealthy food choices. Option C, they will enjoy their food more, may be true but does not specifically address the long-term consequences of their food choices. Option D, they will be healthier than those who don't, is contradictory to the information provided in the context. Step 4: Choose the correct option - Based on the information from the context, option B, they will have an increased risk of disease, is the correct answer. This is because the context discusses how unhealthy food choices can increase the risk of health problems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Another popular argument for affirmative action is the compensation argument. Blacks were mistreated in the past for a morally irrelevant characteristic of being black so society today should compensate for the injuries. This causes reverse discrimination in the form of preferential hirings, contracts, and scholarships as a means to ameliorate past wrongs. Many opponents argue that this form of reparation is morally indefensible because if blacks were harmed for being black in the past, then preferential treatment for this same trait is illogical. In addition, arguments are made that whites today who innocently benefited from past injustices should not be punished for something they had no control over. Therefore, they are being reverse discriminated against because they are receiving the punishment that should be given to people who willingly and knowingly benefited from discriminatory practices Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): In the compensation argument, who should supposedly have to make up for past discrimination against blacks?","output":"In the compensation argument for affirmative action, the responsibility to make up for past discrimination against blacks is generally placed on various entities involved in perpetuating or benefiting from past discriminatory practices. The justification for this approach is rooted in rectifying historical injustices and promoting social equity. Here, we will examine some stakeholders that may hold this compensatory responsibility: 1. Government: Since governments either promoted or failed to prevent discriminatory practices in the past, they hold a significant responsibility to make amends. Affirmative action policies instituted by governments at various levels can help in addressing historical imbalances. Examples include the establishment of quotas in educational institutions, preferential treatment in public sector hiring, and increased spending on social programs targeting disadvantaged groups. 2. Private institutions and businesses: Many private institutions and businesses benefited, either directly or indirectly, from past discriminatory practices against blacks. As a result, they hold some responsibility in addressing this issue. Companies could implement diversity hiring policies, create targeted scholarships and training programs, and establish partnerships with minority-owned businesses. 3. Society at large: Society as a whole played a role in perpetuating racial discrimination, so it can be argued that every member of society should contribute to remedying past wrongs. Educating individuals about historical injustices, fostering racial understanding, and encouraging open conversations about race can help achieve social equity. Additionally, supporting non-profit organizations working for racial justice can be a way for members of society to contribute. 4. Educational institutions: Schools and universities have a responsibility to promote diversity and address historical inequalities. They can do this by implementing affirmative action admission policies, offering targeted scholarships for underrepresented communities, and creating inclusive curricula to understand and appreciate various cultures and their histories. With regard to the concern of reverse discrimination, affirmative action policies ideally do not seek to punish innocent individuals who have unintentionally benefitted from past discrimination. Instead, the primary goal is to level the playing field for those who have faced historical disadvantages and to ensure equal opportunities for all. However, it is essential to maintain a balance in these policies to avoid unfairly disadvantaging any particular group. This requires constant monitoring and adjustment of affirmative action policies based on their effectiveness and fairness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the specific name of the heavenly figures whose heads are highly circular and who wear round haloes? ?  Perhaps influenced by van Eyck's Madonna in the Church, Lochner closely detailed the fall and gradient of light. According to the art historian Brigitte Corley, the clothes of \\"protagonists change their hues in delicate reaction to the influx of light, reds being transformed through a symphony of pink tonalities to a dusty greyish white, greens to a warm pale yellow, and lemon shading through oranges to a saturated red\\". Lochner employed the notion of supernatural illumination not just from van Eyck, but also from von Soest's Crucifixion, where light emanating from Christ dissolves around John's red robe, as yellows rays eventually become white. There is a real possibility that a number of the faces of saints are modelled on historical persons, i.e. as donor portraits of the commissioners and their wives. Figures fitting this theory include St Ursula and St Gereon panels from the City Saints altarpiece.Unlike the painters in the Low Countries, Lochner was not so concerned with delineating perspective; his pictures are often set in shallow space, while his backgrounds give little indication of distance and often dissolve into solid gold. Thus, and given his harmonious colour schemes, Lochner is usually described as one of the last exponents of the International Gothic. This is not to say his paintings lack contemporary northern sophistication; his arrangements are often innovative. The worlds he paints are hushed, according to Snyder, achieved with the symmetry of subdued use of colour and the often repeated stylistic element of circles. Angels form circles around the heavenly figures; the heavenly figures' heads are highly circular and they wear round haloes. According to Snyder, the viewer is slowly \\"drawn into empathy with the revolving forms\\".Because of the paucity of surviving attributed works, it is difficult to detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of... A:","output":"The specific name of the heavenly figures whose heads are highly circular and who wear round haloes in the given article is \\"angels.\\" These angels form circles around the heavenly figures, creating a sense of harmony and unity in the composition.

While both sentences discuss a reduction in the number of closings and advisories for beach areas, they are referring to different locations and provide different numbers regarding the reduction. The first sentence is specifically discussing Ventura County, and it mentions a 73 percent decrease in closings and advisories from 1,540 in 2001 to 416 last year. This information reveals a significant reduction in beach advisories in Ventura County over time. On the other hand, the second sentence focuses on Texas beaches and states that the number of advisory days dropped from 317 in 2001 to 182 last year. While it also describes a decrease in beach advisories, the context is different because it pertains to Texas beaches rather than Ventura County. The numbers provided are also distinct. In summary, while both sentences share the theme of a reduction in the number of beach advisories, the differences in location (Ventura County versus Texas beaches) and the specific details provided prevent them from being considered paraphrases of each other.

A:","output":"A: The music for the Pirates of the Caribbean film series was primarily composed by renowned German composer Hans Zimmer, with contributions from other composers and music producers such as Klaus Badelt, Geoff Zanelli, and Rodrigo y Gabriela. The series, which comprises five installments so far, features individual scores for each movie. The first film, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), had its soundtrack composed by Klaus Badelt, with Hans Zimmer serving as a score producer and contributing some themes. This score has been recognized for its memorable and iconic themes, most notably \\"He's a Pirate,\\" which became the main theme of the entire series. For the second and third installments, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007), Hans Zimmer took over as the primary composer. These scores included several well-known themes such as \\"Davy Jones,\\" \\"The Kraken,\\" and \\"One Day.\\" Zimmer maintained the unique sound from the first film while developing the music further to suit the evolving storylines and characters. Zimmer continued his work on the series with the fourth installment, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011). For this film, Zimmer collaborated with acclaimed Mexican guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela to create a distinct sound that blended classical orchestral elements with traditional Latin American and Spanish guitar. The soundtrack includes cues like \\"Angelica\\" and \\"Blackbeard\\" which added to the rich musical tapestry in the series. In the fifth and most recent film, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017), Zimmer passed on the compositional baton to his long-time collaborator, Geoff Zanelli. Zanelli had worked with Zimmer on all previous installments as a member of Zimmer's team. While he composed the original score for this movie, Zanelli built upon and incorporated some of the themes created by Zimmer and Badelt, maintaining the characteristic musical atmosphere tied to the series. In summary, the music for Pirates of the Caribbean primarily comes from the creative genius of Hans Zimmer, with vital contributions from Klaus Badelt, Geoff Zanelli, and the guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela. The iconic music from the series is cherished for its adventurous, swashbuckling, and action-packed sound that perfectly complements the films' legendary pirate tales."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What album featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts?  After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs from the record addressed topics such as nuclear proliferation (\\"Seconds\\") and the Polish Solidarity movement (\\"New Year's Day\\"). War was U2's first record to feature...

Please answer a question about the following article about Religion in ancient Rome: In Rome, state cult to a living emperor acknowledged his rule as divinely approved and constitutional. As princeps (first citizen) he must respect traditional Republican mores; given virtually monarchic powers, he must restrain them. He was not a living divus but father of his country (pater patriae), its pontifex maximus (greatest priest) and at least notionally, its leading Republican. When he died, his ascent to heaven, or his descent to join the dii manes was decided by a vote in the Senate. As a divus, he could receive much the same honours as any other state deity – libations of wine, garlands, incense, hymns and sacrificial oxen at games and festivals. What he did in return for these favours is unknown, but literary hints and the later adoption of divus as a title for Christian Saints suggest him as a heavenly intercessor. In Rome, official cult to a living emperor was directed to his genius; a small number refused this honour and there is no evidence of any emperor receiving more than that. In the crises leading up to the Dominate, Imperial titles and honours multiplied, reaching a peak under Diocletian. Emperors before him had attempted to guarantee traditional cults as the core of Roman identity and well-being; refusal of cult undermined the state and was treasonous. What was the emperor's rule in Rome?","output":"In ancient Rome, the emperor's rule was acknowledged as divinely approved and constitutional through state cult to a living emperor. As the \\"princeps\\" or first citizen, he had to respect traditional Republican values while possessing virtually monarchic powers which he needed to restrain. The emperor held various titles such as pater patriae (father of his country), pontifex maximus (greatest priest), and was considered the leading figure for the Republicans. When he died, his ascent to heaven or descent to join the dii manes (spirits of the deceased) was determined by a vote in the Senate. The emperor could receive honors as a divus, similar to any other state deity. Although it is unknown what the emperor did in return for these honors, he is suggested to have acted as a heavenly intercessor.

A touchdown is worth 6 points, and they also scored the extra point after the touchdown, which is worth 1 point. So, the Packers scored a total of 7 points in the second quarter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Choose how you want this story to end. By Victoria Woollaston It won’t be long until Twitter and Facebook are virtually indistinguishable as the sites continue to borrow features from each other. The latest swap involves Twitter replacing its iconic 'Retweet' button with a Facebook-style share option. Twitter users began tweeting about the change last night, and many users were angry with how similar the sites are becoming. As part of the changes, the Retweet button has been replaced with 'Share with followers' and 'Quote Tweet' is now 'First add comment', pictured. It appears the change is being rolled out gradually. Twitter often experiments with new features but not all get a full release Previously, when users clicked the arrows button beneath a post they were given the option to Retweet, or OPTIONS: - Facebook. - Quote Tweet. - Retweet. - Twitter. - Victoria Woollaston.","output":"In this story, the change in Twitter's iconic features creates a divide among its users. As more people continue to notice the shift, the online debate becomes heated, with users expressing their opinions on various platforms. Twitter users are split into two camps - the \\"traditionalists\\" who strongly believe that Twitter should maintain its original features and characteristics, and the \\"innovators\\" who think that mixing features borrowed from other platforms can drive user engagement and growth. The debate on Twitter and other websites eventually catches the attention of major news outlets and tech blogs who begin covering the story. Meanwhile, Victoria Woollaston picks up on the response and curates an article about the ongoing debate. Her piece highlights various tweets and posts from both sides of the argument, showing the depth of the controversy. The article generates more buzz, leading people to express opinions on what separates Twitter from Facebook and how the platform should evolve. The resulting immense pressure on Twitter eventually forces the company to listen to its users' concerns. Twitter decides to conduct a poll to seek user input on whether to revert to the classic 'Retweet' button or stick with the new 'Share with followers' option. Users express a strong preference for the traditional 'Retweet,' leading Twitter to announce that they will be bringing back the beloved icon. After a few weeks, Twitter rolls back the update and reinstates the 'Retweet' button. The move is praised by the majority of users who value the platform's unique identity. However, a small group of innovators is unhappy with the decision and forms a Twitter-based community to brainstorm and discuss ideas about possible future changes to the platform. Ultimately, Twitter learns a valuable lesson about preserving its identity and balancing it with user feedback when implementing new features. The traditionalists celebrate the decision, while the innovators continue to work on ways to enhance the user experience on the platform. The story becomes an example of how social media platforms should consider a balance between innovation and maintaining their unique identities in the face of ongoing competition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: Lewis Hamilton was born in which home counties town?","output":"Lewis Hamilton, the highly successful British Formula One racing driver, was born in Stevenage, a town located in the home county of Hertfordshire, England.  Stevenage is situated to the east of junctions 7 and 8 of the A1(M), and is located between Letchworth Garden City to the north, and Welwyn Garden City to the south. It is known for its fast intercity train links provided by the East Coast Main Line and has a blend of a modern town centre and the historic Old Town. Hamilton was born on January 7, 1985, to Carmen Larbalestier and Anthony Hamilton. As a child, Hamilton quickly showed his prowess for racing, famously approaching McLaren team principal, Ron Dennis, at the Autosport Awards ceremony at the age of 10 and telling him, \\"I want to race for you one day...I want to race for McLaren.\\" Only three years later, McLaren and Mercedes-Benz signed him to their Young Driver Support Programme. Hamilton's early years in Stevenage were marked with a strong interest and participations in car racing. He began his racing career at Rye House Kart Circuit and rapidly ascended up the ranks of motorsport from there. His precocious talent and relentless determination brought him to the apex of his sport, becoming one of the World Champions in Formula One with an astounding record. He has proven himself as one of the most successful drivers in the history of the sport and has carved out a legacy that will be remembered for generations to come. His success brought a great deal of pride to his hometown, and he has been quoted saying that his upbringing in Stevenage played a huge role in his success as it taught him to \\"aim higher\\". Despite now living in Monaco, Hamilton often speaks affectionately of the town where he was born and raised.

What percentage of them will vote for Clinton? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"To provide answers to both questions and analyze their similarity, I will perform the following steps: Step 1: Understand the context and background of the questions Both questions are related to the 2016 US Presidential election. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton were both running for the Democratic nomination, while Donald Trump was the Republican candidate. The questions are concerned about the voting behavior of Bernie Sanders supporters if Clinton secures the Democratic nomination. Step 2: Analyze the first question \\"Will Bernie supporters withhold their vote for Clinton even though that helps Trump?\\" This question asks whether Bernie Sanders supporters would not vote for Clinton in the general election, even if it might increase Trump's chances of winning. Step 3: Analyze the second question \\"Will Bernie Sanders supporters support Clinton or withhold their vote? What percentage of them will vote for Clinton?\\" This question is similar to the first one, asking whether Bernie Sanders supporters would vote for Clinton or not. Additionally, it also asks what percentage of them might vote for Clinton. Step 4: Determine similarity between the two questions Both questions ask whether Bernie Sanders supporters would choose to vote for Hillary Clinton or not.

The group, known as 'The Global Emancipators,' conspires to create a hidden underwater cache of nuclear warheads, intending to use them to threaten the world's governments into submission. CIA intelligence reports reveal a top-secret message sent by a rogue US government operative named Houghton. The message indicates that Houghton has sent an American submarine named 'USS Poseidon' to deliver the last piece of the puzzle to The Global Emancipators - a state-of-the-art control chip that would enable the separatists to launch the nuclear warheads remotely. The US government assembles a highly skilled and diverse team of Navy SEALs and intelligence operatives to foil this plot. The mission, known as 'Operation Crimson Tide,' involves an underwater infiltration and the recovery of the submarine and its potentially devastating cargo. The team is tasked with boarding the USS Poseidon and retrieving the control chip while, at the same time, neutralizing the onboard threat - including the notorious operative Houghton. The team, led by Commander James Carter, embarks on the treacherous mission. As they near the submarine, they discover that the situation is more complex than initially anticipated. In addition to The Global Emancipators, there is also a rogue Russian faction called the Red Wolves involved - aiming to hijack the submarine for their endgame. While the team successfully infiltrates the submarine, they find themselves in a deadly game of cat and mouse with Houghton, The Global Emancipators, and the Red Wolves. Trust is tested in a series of intense battles and psychological warfare, as the mission's stakes grow ever higher. Members of the team start to doubt the extent of their loyalties, creating tensions within the group. As the race to secure the control chip and avert a global catastrophe intensifies, Houghton's true motivations come to light - he is a double agent, secretly working to sabotage The Global Emancipators and Red Wolves from within. Houghton sends a cryptic message to Commander Carter, offering a plan to not only save the world from mass destruction but to dismantle both extremist groups in the process. In a nerve-wracking climax, the team faces off against the enemies in an underwater battle royal, successfully recovering the chip. However, devastating sacrifices must be made, and not everyone makes it back to the surface alive. The Houghton Assignment is a thrilling, action-packed story that combines elements of military, espionage, and psychological drama. It highlights themes of loyalty, trust, and the personal costs of heroism, all within an intricate plot that keeps the audience guessing until the very end."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

He was an important person who helped take care of a big group of people called the members of the Majlis. The Majlis was like a big team of people who made decisions for the country. One day, Zia'eddin changed his job and started helping people in a new way. We call becoming this kind of helper a \\"servant\\". So when did Zia'eddin Tabatabaee become a servant? To answer this question, let's look back in time to when Zia'eddin was born. He came into this big world on February 3, 1889. He was a very smart kid, and he grew up learning a lot in school. Eventually, he became a wise and important grown-up  who helped make big decisions for Iran. Zia'eddin Tabatabaee had many different jobs in his life. For example, he was a journalist, which means he wrote articles, just like this one! He also taught others important knowledge that he learned. But when did Zia'eddin become a servant to help people? It was around 1910 when Zia'eddin started a newspaper called Nowbahar. This is when many people say he changed into a servant, because he started using his new job and his writing skills to help the people of Iran. He wrote about the things that mattered to the people so they could understand what was going on in their country. Let's fast forward to 1925. This was another important time in Zia'eddin Tabatabaee's life. He was chosen to be someone very important, called the Prime Minister of Iran. This meant that he was in charge of helping the people and making decisions for the whole country. Some people say Zia'eddin Tabatabaee really became a servant when he stepped up as Prime Minister because he took on a bigger responsibility to serve and protect his people. But it was when he was a journalist that he first started to help people by writing about important things and sharing important information. So, we could say that Zia'eddin Tabatabaee became a servant around 1910 when he started his newspaper, Nowbahar. In conclusion, Zia'eddin Tabatabaee was a very important man who helped his country in different ways. Though we might not know for sure the exact moment when he became a servant, we do know that he started helping others from early on in life. And as he grew up and took on bigger and bigger jobs, he continued to be a helper and a servant to the people of Iran."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose biographer was Michael Kennedy? from the following article ?  Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.

As rubbish Nic Cage movies go, Bangkok Dangerous is just about watchable, but as far as pointless remakes are concerned, you're much better off renting the original instead. 2. What Cage -- such a fine actor when the mood's upon him -- is doing wasting his time in listless junk like this is anybody's guess. 3. Certainly lives down to its title, which sounds like a caveman giving travel advice. 4. the proverbial sound and fury, filled with typical Asian action film gravitas yet signifying nothing. A whole lot of nothing. 5. Instead of killing people, Nicolas Cage's character should have been more worried about getting a haircut. 6. Couldn't the Pangs have spent some of that studio money on more lights? 7. All it proves is that on their home turf the Pangs can make an international hit-man tale every bit as trashy and dull as the ones made in Hollywood or Europe. 8. For a man obsessed with The King -- he even married his daughter -- it makes sense that Cage has finally entered the fat Elvis act III of his career. I hope we don't read about him flat-lining on the commode, face down in the \\"Ghost Rider 3\\" script. 9. Bangkok Dangerous pretends to have a lot on its mind. It moves slow as molasses and has the same general coloring. 10. [A] stylish but laborious thriller.","output":"In these ten movie reviews, \\"Bangkok Dangerous\\" starring Nicolas Cage is criticized for being a subpar and disappointing remake. The general consensus is that the film is watchable but lacks the charm and excitement of the original. Cage, who is usually a talented actor, is viewed as wasting his time in this seemingly lackluster endeavor. The film's title is mocked as uninteresting, with comparisons to cavemen giving travel advice. Additionally, the movie is said to be filled with sound and fury but ultimately signifying nothing, pointing to its disappointing and unengaging nature. Cage's character, a contract killer, is made fun of for his poor hairstyle, while the film's production is criticized for its low budget and poor lighting choices. The Pangs, the film's creators, are seen as having failed in their attempt to create a thrilling international hit-man tale, as reviewers found it to be just as trashy and dull as similar stories from Hollywood and Europe. Cage's involvement in \\"Bangkok Dangerous\\" is likened to the unfortunate downfall of Elvis Presley, foreshadowing possible grim consequences for Cage's career.  In summary, \\"Bangkok Dangerous\\" is seen as a stylish yet slow and laborious thriller that lacks the excitement and engagement one would expect from such a film. Despite its visuals, the movie moves like molasses and its overall reception has been overwhelmingly negative across these ten diverse reviews."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

În acest sondaj de opinie realizat printre 1.000 de cetățeni, aproape 69% dintre respondenți au declarat că sunt în favoarea colaborării dintre Serbia și Curtea Internațională de Justiție de la Haga. Aceste cifre arată că o proporție semnificativă a populației este în favoarea unei implicări active a Serbiei în mecanismele internaționale de judecată și de cooperare cu instituțiile juridice internaționale. Implicarea Serbiei în cooperarea cu Curtea de la Haga ar putea avea mai multe implicații și beneficii pentru țară. Pe de o parte, aceasta ar putea contribui la consolidarea statutului și credibilității Serbiei pe scena internațională. De asemenea, o asemenea colaborare ar poate facilita procesul de integrare europeană al Serbiei, oferind o platformă pentru ca țara să demonstreze angajamentul său în direcția respectării standardelor și normelor internaționale de justiție și drepturile omului. Pe de altă parte, cooperarea cu Curtea de la Haga ar putea contribui la rezolvarea unor probleme istorice și la reconcilierea dintre grupurile etnice din regiune. În trecut, Serbia a fost implicată în conflicte violente și s-au săvârșit crime de război pe teritoriul său. Prin colaborarea cu Curtea de la Haga și aducerea la răspundere a celor vinovați de aceste crime, Serbia ar putea arăta că este dispusă să înfrunte trecutul și să repară nedreptățile provocate. Rezultatele acestui sondaj indică, așadar, o perspectivă pozitivă în ceea ce privește cooperarea Serbiei cu Curtea de la Haga.

În concluzie, faptul că o majoritate a cetățenilor interogați în cadrul acestui sondaj susțin cooperarea Serbiei cu Curtea de la Haga este un indiciu important al dorinței populației de a aborda problemele trecutului și de a contribui la construirea unei societăți mai incluzive și responsabile pe plan internațional."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper. Stevenson pushes for the band to tour, but Lombardo declines and quits. He is replaced by Doug Carrion, and this lineup records 1986's Enjoy!, after which Cooper and Carrion both leave the band. Stevenson recruits bassist Karl Alvarez from Salt Lake City, who brings in his close friend Stephen Egerton to play guitar.

Zibo, as a crucial city in this province, is recognized for its booming industries, including the production of ceramics and glass. Additionally, it is known for being rich in natural resources, particularly coal and iron, playing a crucial role in the economic development of Shandong province.  The city of Zibo is divided into several districts, each with its own unique characteristics and strengths. As a whole, Zibo has a robust economic infrastructure. It is also home to several tourist attractions, such as the Zhoucun Ancient City, Zibo Chinese Ceramics Museum, Zibo Museum, and Mount Tai, offering rich experiences in history, culture, and art. On the other hand, Huaiyin District of Huai'an is located in the Jiangsu province, which is situated to the south of Shandong province where Zibo is located. Similar to Shandong, Jiangsu province possesses a distinct historical and cultural heritage but is universally recognized for its prosperity and well developed higher education and research institutions. Huaiyin District in the city of Huai'an, like Zibo, is an economic hub with a vast industrial park and numerous companies contributing to Jiangsu's economy. The district is famous for its abundant water resources, being surrounded by lakes and canals, resulting in fertile land perfect for agriculture. Huai'an, and notably Huaiyin District, is also known as the birthplace of Zhou Enlai, the first Premier of the People's Republic of China, adding to its historical significance.

Many visually-impaired individuals automatically assume there is no place for them in the workplace due to their affliction. Fortunately, this is absolutely not the case. Before you even start sending out resumes, it's a good idea to nurture a positive attitude. Stamp out negative thoughts, and replace them with something positive. For example, if you find yourself thinking something like \\"I'll never find a job. No one will ever hire me because I'm blind,\\" replace the thought with something constructive: \\"I may be blind, sure, but it doesn't stop me from being a worthwhile and valuable human being.\\" In many ways, living in today's society comes with the expectation that you have full use of your eyes. If this isn't the case with you, it can be easy to feel hopeless about one's situation. However, the vast majority of modern professions are available for the visually-impaired to pursue. You should never let yourself get down. Being visually impaired may be tough in many situations, but if you take a moment to look, you'll find hundreds of success stories of people who have gone on to do great things in spite of their disability. Many of these success stories end up using their disability as a motivator to excel in other ways. Never let a disability keep you from doing what you are capable of. People with visual impairment are sometimes stigmatized in the workplace. However, anti-discrimination laws have made it so that it's never been easier to find work as a blind person. Mid-size and larger corporations are often offered incentives to hire the legally blind and visually impaired. Although you'll still need to have the other skills in order to be hired, you should never see your disability as an obstacle with the vast majority of jobs. In the United States, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was enacted to help ensure equal opportunities for people with disabilities. Depending on the country you're currently residing in, there should be similar laws passed to make it easier for you to find work. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about how blind people might have trouble finding a job because they feel bad about themselves and think they can't do the work.

Tech International, the part's Johnstown, Ohio-based distributor, estimates that just 8,600 of roughly 6 million of those valves are defective. The valve is a replacement snap-in tire valve -- Model No. TR413 -- manufactured between July and November 2006.

According to the recall, the rubber part of the valve may crack after being in use for about six months, causing a gradual loss of tire pressure. Continuing to drive on underinflated tires can cause them to burst, possibly leading to crashes. Tech International told the NHTSA that the company doesn't have records of the final purchasers of the valve stems.

Please answer this question: Someone who has an abnormal fear of dogs is suffering from what?","output":"Someone who has an abnormal fear of dogs is suffering from a specific phobia known as cynophobia. The term cynophobia originates from the Greek words \\"Kyón\\" and \\"Phóbos,\\" which mean \\"dog\\" and \\"fear\\" respectively. Cynophobia is classified under \\"specific phobias,\\" a category defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a diagnostic reference book used by clinicians and psychiatrists. Cynophobia, like other specific phobias, is characterized by an excessive and irrational fear towards a specific situation, object, or animal-in this case, dogs. People suffering from cynophobia experience extreme anxiety or panic attacks at the sight of dogs, the thought of getting close to dogs, or even the mere mention or depiction of dogs. The fear is so intense that the person goes out of their way to avoid dogs or anything associated with dogs. Several factors can lead one to develop cynophobia. It could be due to a traumatic experience in the past involving dogs, such as being bitten or attacked, or witnessing someone else being harmed by a dog. Such traumatic incidents may imprint a fear in the person's mind, causing an automatic fear response whenever they encounter dogs. Even hearing about these incidents second-hand or watching traumatic scenes involving dogs on TV can potentially trigger cynophobia. Cynophobia may also be learned behavior. Children can inherit fears and phobias from their parents or other adult role models through observational learning. If a child sees their parent showing fear of dogs, they may adopt the same fear, believing that dogs are something to be afraid of. Genetic factors may also play a significant role. Some people might be genetically disposed to anxiety disorders, including phobias. If a person has family members suffering from any kind of phobia, they may be at a higher risk of developing a phobia themselves. The symptoms of cynophobia can vary based on the person's level of fear. Physical responses can include sweating, rapid heart rate, trembling, dry mouth, nausea, or having trouble breathing. Behavioral responses can include an earnest effort to avoid areas where dogs might be present, even if it disrupts their regular routine. Psychological symptoms may include intense fear, panic, dread, or terror. They might also experience anticipatory anxiety, where they feel anxious even thinking about coming in contact with a dog. Treatment for cynophobia, as with other specific phobias, can be conducted through various therapeutic interventions. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is commonly used, where the person learns how to manage their fear responses and change their thought patterns regarding dogs. Exposure therapy can also be helpful, where they are gradually and repeatedly exposed to dogs (or images and sounds related to dogs) in a safe environment, to extinguish the fear response. In severe cases, medication might also be considered to manage acute symptoms of anxiety, although it won't cure the phobia itself. In conclusion, cynophobia is a specific type of phobia where one has an intense and irrational fear of dogs. Not all people who fear dogs suffer from cynophobia as the fear has to be extreme and interfere with their daily life, causing intense distress. It's essential to remember that people with this condition aren't just afraid of dogs; their fear is deeply rooted, often linked to past trauma, and can greatly impact their quality of life. Treatment can be very effective, so seeking help from a healthcare professional is crucial."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: In earliest times, men considered lightning to be one of the great mysteries of nature. Some ancient people believed that lightning and thunder were the weapons of the gods.  In reality, lightning is a flow of electricity formed high above the earth. A single flash of lightning 1.6 kilometers long has enough electricity to light one million light bulbs . The American scientist and statesman, Benjamin Franklin, was the first to show the connection between electricity and lightning in 1752. In the same year he also built the first lightning rod  . This device protects buildings from being damaged by lightning. Modern science has discovered that one stroke of lightning has a voltage   of more than 15 million volts  . A flash of lightning between a cloud and the earth may be as long as 13 kilometers, and travel at a speed of 30 million meters per second. Scientists judge that there are about 2,000 million flashes of lightning per year. Lightning hits the Empire State Building in New York City 30 to 48 times a year. In the United States alone it kills an average of one person every day. The safest place to be in case of an electrical storm is in a closed car. Outside, one should go to low ground and not get under tress. Also, one should stay out of water and away from metal fences. Inside a house, people should avoid open doorways and windows and not touch wires or metal things.

It is unclear what initial musical education he received; his father, Georg Händel, was not a music lover, and did not at first appreciate or encourage his son's precocious talents. Nevertheless, by the age of ten Handel had become an accomplished organist; his playing in the royal chapel at Weissenfels, where his half-brother Karl was in the service of the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, impressed the duke, who persuaded Händel senior that the boy should have a proper musical education. As a result, Handel began formal study under Friedrich Zachow, the organist of the Lutheran church at Halle.Handel's biographer Jonathan Keates writes that: \\"From [Zachow] Handel learned not only a great deal about the line and shape of an aria, about strong, adventurous bass lines and solid choral writing, but also about those delicacies of instrumental colouring which he later perfected in his own style\\". Handel's musical development also benefited from an early and lasting friendship with Georg Philipp Telemann, whom he met in 1700. In February 1702 Handel enrolled at the University of Halle, perhaps intending to study law. In March he took up the post of organist at Halle's Calvinist cathedral (Domkirche), a prestigious appointment for one so young and indicative of his burgeoning musical reputation in the city.At some time, possibly in late 1702 or early 1703, Handel visited Berlin, where his father had held an honorary post as physician to the elector who, in 1701, had become the Prussian king Frederick I. In Berlin Handel first experienced Italian opera, and may have met the Italian composers Giovanni Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti, who were writing operas for Frederick's court. The king heard of Handel's abilities, and wanted him to train as a future court composer, but Handel's horizons had been broadened by his sojourn in Berlin and he was developing his own ideas for his future. He declined the king's offer, and returned to Halle to fulfil... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose initial musical education is unclear?, what is it ?","output":"The last name of the person whose initial musical education is unclear is Handel."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Megacorporation, or megacorp, a term popularized by William Gibson, derives from the combination of the prefix \\"mega-\\" with the word \\"corporation\\". It has become widespread in cyberpunk literature. It refers to a corporation (normally fictional) that is a massive conglomerate, holding monopolistic or near-monopolistic control over multiple markets (thus exhibiting both a horizontal and a vertical monopoly). Megacorps are so powerful that they can ignore the law, possess their own heavily armed (often military-sized) private armies, hold \\"sovereign\\" territory, and even act as outright governments. They often exercise a large degree of control over their employees, taking the idea of \\"corporate culture\\" to an extreme. Such organizations as a staple of science fiction long predate cyberpunk, appearing in the works of writers such as Philip K. Dick (\\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\", 1968), Thea von Harbou (\\"Metropolis\\", 1927), Robert A. Heinlein (\\"Citizen of the Galaxy\\", 1957), Robert Asprin (\\"The Cold Cash War\\", 1977), Andre Norton (the \\"Solar Queen\\" novels) and David Weber (\\"the \\"Honorverse\\" novels).  - , abbreviated as media (and sometimes as OAV, original animated video), are animated films and series made specially for release in home video formats without prior showings on television or in theatres, though the first part of an OVA series may be broadcast for promotional purposes.

The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking.  - The game begins as a wanderer named Bartz investigates a fallen meteor. There, he encounters several characters, one of whom reveals the danger facing the four Crystals that control the world's elements. These Crystals act as a seal on Exdeath, an evil sorcerer.

Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country.  - The series consists of eight games across multiple video game consoles, and future titles are planned.

Beginning his writing career in the late 1970s, his early works were noir, near-future stories that explored the effects of technology, cybernetics, and computer networks on humansa \\"combination of lowlife and high tech\\"and helped to create an iconography for the information age before the ubiquity of the Internet in the 1990s. Gibson notably coined the term \\"cyberspace\\" in his short story \\"Burning Chrome\\" (1982) and later popularized the concept in his acclaimed debut novel \\"Neuromancer\\" (1984). These early works have been credited with \\"renovating\\" science fiction literature after it had fallen largely into insignificance in the 1970s.   - Thea Gabriele von Harbou (27 December 1888  1 July 1954) was a German screenwriter, novelist, film director, and actress.

However, most later localizations used the original title. \\"Final Fantasy VI\\" was the first game in the series to be directed by someone other than producer and series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi; the role was filled instead by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito. Yoshitaka Amano, a long-time contributor to the \\"Final Fantasy\\" series, returned as the image and character designer, while regular composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote the game's score, which has been released on several soundtrack albums.  - David Mark Weber (born October 24, 1952) is an American science fiction and fantasy author.

State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.  - A video game console is an electronic, digital or computer device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game that one or more people can play.  - Philip Kindred Dick (December 16, 1928March 2, 1982) was an American writer, who published works mainly belonging to the genre of science fiction.  Dick explored philosophical, sociological and political themes in novels with plots dominated by monopolistic corporations, authoritarian governments, alternate universes, and altered states of consciousness. His work reflected his personal interest in metaphysics and theology, and often drew upon his life experiences in addressing the nature of reality, identity, drug abuse, schizophrenia, and transcendental experiences.  - Final Fantasy VII is a role-playing video game developed by Square for the PlayStation console.

These preparations may contain a combination of milk powder, sugar, cocoa powder, and other essential ingredients. The resulting product, known as milk crumb, is often an intermediate step in producing milk chocolate that has a consistent texture and a rich, pleasing taste. The request for packings of greater than 2 kg suggests that this product is intended for industrial or large-scale use. Bulk packaging in larger quantities is beneficial for chocolate manufacturers and businesses that produce significant amounts of milk chocolate. Some advantages of purchasing milk crumb preparations in packings of greater than 2 kg include: 1. Cost-effective: Purchasing chocolate milk crumb preparations in bulk can significantly lower the price per kilogram, allowing manufacturers to save money on production costs. 2. Consistent quality: Purchasing a large package of chocolate milk crumb helps ensure consistent quality across different batches, leading to a more uniform final product. 3. Efficient production: Having a larger package of milk crumb on hand enables the chocolate manufacturer to produce more batches without having to reorder the product frequently, ultimately enhancing production efficiency. 4. Storage convenience: Chocolate milk crumb preparations in packings of more than 2 kg are usually vacuum-packed or packed in moisture-proof bags or containers, protecting the product from humidity and contamination. This packaging format ensures that the product will be safely stored until it is needed. 5. Sustainability: Using larger packages can also help minimize waste by reducing the amount of packaging materials required for smaller quantities, which is beneficial for both the environment and cost reduction. To produce chocolate milk crumb preparations in packings of more than 2 kg, the following steps are generally followed: 1. Mixing and blending ingredients: Milk powder, sugar, cocoa powder, and any additional ingredients are blended together to create a uniform mixture. The specific ratios of the components may vary depending on the desired final product. 2. Heating and caramelization: The blended mixture is heated in a controlled environment, which allows the sugar to caramelize and react with the milk proteins. This process develops the desired flavor and aroma of the milk crumb. 3. Cooling and pulverizing: The resulting caramelized mixture is cooled and then processed into small crumbs using specialized equipment. This step prepares the milk crumb for incorporation into chocolate products. 4. Packaging: The milk crumb is weighed and packaged into appropriate quantities greater than 2 kg, ensuring it is properly sealed to preserve its freshness and quality. By following these general guidelines, chocolate milk crumb preparations in packings of greater than 2 kg can be efficiently produced and distributed to chocolate manufacturers, ultimately contributing to the creation of delicious milk chocolate products."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Write an article based on this summary: Find a word with meaning to you. Use a pop culture or literary reference. Get inspiration from common products or things. Pick a random name. Use your own name (or your initials). Make up a new word.","output":"Title: From Life's Ordinary to the Extraordinary: Discovering Personalized Words with Profound Meaning Introduction: In the age of digital communication and constant exchange of information, it can seem like all the words we use have lost their spark and value. They fade into the background of our daily lives, passing by almost unnoticed. But what if we could find or create words that truly resonate with us, that hold inherent meaning and can act as a representation of who we are? From pop culture and literary references to random names and even our own initials, there is a world of inspiration out there waiting to be untapped. Let's explore how! Step 1: Drawing from Pop Culture or Literary References A great starting point for discovering words that carry personal meaning is to reflect on the pop culture and literary references that have profoundly impacted your life. Whether it was a spellbinding movie, a thought-provoking book or even a catchy song, think past the surface and dive into the deeper symbolism and significance of those works. As you do, you're likely to find special words and phrases that reach beyond their original context and strike a chord with your own beliefs and experiences. Step 2: Seeking Inspiration from Common Products or Things It may sound unconventional, but taking a closer look at the products and items that surround us daily can open up a trove of potential words. The names or labels of everyday objects often contain interesting or lesser-known terms, which can be repurposed or combined to create a truly unique word. By doing so, you can inject creativity into your language, imbuing even mundane items with new and exciting layers of meaning. Step 3: Picking a Random Name Sometimes, the simplest solution can be the most rewarding. When all else fails, taking a leap into the unknown by selecting a random name or word generator can be the catalyst for finding a word that holds profound personal significance. Give destiny a chance – let the universe guide you toward an unexpected gem that you connect with on an emotional and intellectual level. Step 4: Embracing Your Own Name or Initials Our own names and initials are deeply tied to our identity and can serve as a source of inspiration for finding a word that truly represents us. By taking a closer look at the components of your name and its history, or by blending your initials into a single, harmonious expression, you can leverage your own background and experiences to create a word imbibed with your essence. Step 5: Inventing a New Word Ultimately, the search for a distinctive and meaningful word may lead you to the ultimate act of creativity: inventing a brand new word from scratch. The process may require careful thought, self-analyzing, and consideration of etymology to ensure it fulfills the criteria of representing who you are. But, the end result will be a linguistic embodiment of your personality, values, and aspirations – a custom-made word that serves as an extension of your identity. Conclusion: In a world full of words, it's easy to let them lose their magic. But by opening your mind to the possibilities and taking inspiration from every facet of life, you can rediscover the power of language and find (or create) words imbued with personal meaning. Be it a pop culture reference, random name, or a word of your own making, allow these words to serve as a testament to your uniqueness and the beauty of self-expression."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The Goonies include optimist Mikey Walsh, his older brother Brand, the inventive Data, the talkative Mouth, and the overweight klutz Chunk. While rummaging through the Walshes' attic, they come across a 1632 doubloon and an old treasure map purporting to lead to the famous pirate \\"One-Eyed\\" Willy's hoard located nearby. Evading Brand for one last adventure together, the kids find themselves at a derelict restaurant near the coast, which coincides with the doubloon and the map. They encounter the Fratellis, a family of criminals hiding out at the restaurant. Evading detection by returning outside, the kids run into Brand and two girls: the popular cheerleader Andy, who has a crush on Brand, who shares the same feelings for her, and Stef, a nerdy, tough-talking girl and Andy's best friend. Mikey convinces Brand to return to the restaurant to explore after the Fratellis leave, discovering that the criminals are running a counterfeiting operation. As the Fratellis return, the group finds a tunnel beneath the restaurant and hides in there, sending Chunk to notify the authorities. They explore the tunnel and find the remains of a previous treasure explorer, who also searched for the treasure, and Mikey is sure they are on the right trail.

Possible answers: a). remorseful; b). be ignored by friends; c). be given a party; Q: Aubrey sent text messages to all of her friends telling them she was leaving.  Given the context: What will happen to Aubrey? A:","output":"Given the context provided, it is not possible to definitively predict the outcome for Aubrey after sending the text message. However, I can present an analysis of the possible scenarios listed, and evaluate the likelihood of each one based on typical human behavior and response patterns. a) Remorseful:  There is a possibility that Aubrey may feel remorseful after sending the text messages. Remorse is a feeling of regret or guilt that may arise from realizing that an action might have had negative consequences. If Aubrey is someone who tends to feel guilty or concerned about the potential negative impact of her actions on others, she may be more likely to experience remorse in this situation. Factors that may contribute to Aubrey feeling remorseful could include her reasoning for leaving, the emotional connection she shares with her friends, and her past experiences in similar situations. b) Be ignored by friends: Aubrey's friends may choose to ignore her after receiving the text messages. This response may be a result of them feeling hurt, shocked, or betrayed by Aubrey's decision to leave. Depending on the relationships Aubrey shares with her friends, the bond between them, and whether they could have sensed or anticipated Aubrey's departure, the decision to ignore her may be perceived as justified or unreasonable by her friends. However, this response may not be permanent, as some friends might need time to process the new situation or confront their own feelings before reaching out to Aubrey for dialogue or closure. c) Be given a party: In some cases, Aubrey's friends might decide to throw her a farewell party. This would typically happen if her friends empathize with her reasons for leaving and wish to show their appreciation and support for her. Organizing a party for Aubrey would demonstrate the strength of their bond, as well as their understanding of her situation. Factors that could influence the decision to host a party for Aubrey might include the quality of her friendships, the reasons for her departure, and her friends' willingness to cherish the positive aspects of their relationships. In conclusion, the nature of Aubrey's relationships with her friends, her motive for leaving, and her friends' reactions and emotions contribute significantly to forecasting the most probable outcome. Without additional context, it is challenging to determine with certainty which scenario would play out for Aubrey. Each of the options presented — feelings of remorse, being ignored by friends, or being given a party — has potential connections to different circumstances and relationship dynamics."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Video game is the most common form today, and for this reason the terms are often mistakenly used synonymously. Other common forms of electronic game include such products as handheld electronic games, standalone systems (e.g. pinball, slot machines, or electro-mechanical arcade games), and exclusively non-visual products (e.g. audio games).  - Konami is famous for popular video game series such as \\"Castlevania\\", \\"Contra\\", \\"Dance Dance Revolution\\", \\"Gradius\\", \\"Frogger\\", \\"Suikoden\\", \\"Ganbare Goemon\\", \\"Metal Gear\\", \\"Mirmo\\", \\"Beatmania IIDX\\", \\"Pro Evolution Soccer\\", \\"Boktai\\", \\"Silent Hill\\", \\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\\", and \\"Sound Voltex\\".

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Florida (Spanish for \\"land of flowers\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the U.S. states. Jacksonville is the most populous municipality in the state and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is Florida's most populous urban area. The city of Tallahassee is the state capital.  - Oncidium, abbreviated as Onc. in the horticultural trade, is a genus that contains about 330 species of orchids from the subtribe Oncidiinae of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). As presently conceived (May 2014), it is distributed across much of South America, Central America, Mexico and the West Indies, with one species \\"(O. ensatum)\\" extending into Florida. Common names for plants in this genus include dancing-lady orchid and golden shower orchid. In 2008, Oxfords Annals of Botany labeled the \\"Oncidium\\" alliance \\"grossly polyphyletic.\\" The American Orchid Society labeled this genus a \\"dumping ground.\\" After DNA testing and much debate, a consensus was announced (April 2013) resulting in major taxonomic changes to \\"Oncidium, Gomesa, Odontoglossum, Miltonia,\\" and others. Much of this debate and subsequent housekeeping was initiated by significant research for the scientific publication Genera Orchidacearum Volume 5. As a result, much of the information in this article is now deprecated, but still of great value. One significant change is the move of most Brazilian \\"Oncidium\\" with a fused lateral sepal to the genus \\"Gomesa\\". The Royal Horticultural Society system, the World Checklist of Monocots database at http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/home.do and the American Orchid Society have already updated their databases to reflect most of these changes.  Description. This genus was first described by Olof Swartz in 1800 with the orchid \\"Oncidium altissimum\\", which has become the type species. Its name is derived from the Greek word , \\"onkos\\", meaning \\"swelling\\". This refers to the callus at the lower lip.  - The Oncidiinae is a subtribe within the Orchidaceae that consists of a number of genera that are closely related.   - Odontoglossum, first named in 1816 by Karl Sigismund Kunth, is a genus of about 100 orchids. The scientific name is derived from the Greek words \\"odon\\" (tooth) and \\"glossa\\" (tongue), referring to the two tooth-like calluses on the base of the lip. This genus of cool to cold growing orchids is to be found on open spots in the humid cloud forest at higher elevations from Central- and West South America to Guyana, with most species around the northern Andes. The abbreviation for this genus is Odm. in the horticultural trade.  - Olof Peter Swartz (September 21, 1760  September 19, 1818) was a Swedish botanist and taxonomist. He is best known for his taxonomic work and studies into pteridophytes. He attended the University of Uppsala where he studied under Carolus Linnaeus the Younger and received his doctorate in 1781.  He first traveled in 1780, to Lapland in the company of several other botanists. In 1783 he sailed for North America and the West Indies, primarily in the area of Jamaica and Hispaniola, to collect botanical specimens. His botanical collection, of an impressive 6000 specimens, is now held by the Swedish Museum of Natural History, as part of the Regnellian herbarium. By 1786 he left for London to prepare his collection. There he met Joseph Banks, who was impressed with his knowledge of Botany. He was offered a position with the British East India Company as a travelling physician, but turned it down, and returned to Sweden in 1787. Ten years later he proposed to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (of which he became a member in 1789) the idea of a permanent travel grant, based on the methods he had seen employed by Banks within the British Empire. In 1791 he became Professor Bergianus at the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1805.  - The American Orchid Society is a horticultural society devoted to education, conservation, and research of orchids (plant family Orchidaceae). The organization was founded in 1921, and now has a worldwide membership. The organization publishes a monthly magazine, \\"Orchids, The Bulletin of the American Orchid Society.\\" The society's website American Orchid Society website has the answer to all questions orchid, including helpful, reliable information on how to grow your orchids.   - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León.  - The West Indies or Caribbean Basin is a region of the North Atlantic Ocean in the Caribbean, that includes the island nations and surrounding waters of three major archipelagoes: the Greater Antilles, the Lesser Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago. The term is synonymous with the term \\"Caribbean Basin\\". The region is known as the area running from Florida westward along the Gulf coast, then south along the Mexican coast through Central America and then eastward across the northern coast of South America. Bermuda is also included within the region even though it is in the west-central Atlantic, due to its common cultural history created by European colonization of the region, and in most of the region by the presence of a significant group of African descent.  - The Orchidaceae are a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants, with blooms that are often colourful and often fragrant, commonly known as the orchid family.  - Colmanara, abbreviated Colm. in the horticultural trade, is the nothogenus comprising intergeneric hybrids between the orchid genera \\"Miltonia\\", \\"Odontoglossum\\" and \\"Oncidium\\" (Milt. x Odm. x Onc.).  - Annals of Botany is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal, founded in 1887, that publishes research articles, brief communications, and reviews in all areas of botany. The journal is supported and managed by Annals of Botany Company, a non-profit educational charity, and published through Oxford University Press. According to the 2011 \\"Journal Citation Reports\\" it has an impact factor of 4.030, in 2009 ranking 18th out of 172 in the category Plant Sciences.  - Miltonia, abbreviated Milt. in the horticultural trade, is an orchid genus formed by nine epiphyte species and eight natural hybrids inhabitants of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one species reaching the northeast of Argentina and east of Paraguay. This genus was established by John Lindley in 1837, when he described its type species, \\"Miltonia spectabilis\\". Many species were attributed to \\"Miltonia\\" in the past, however, today, the species from Central America and from cooler areas on northwest of South America have been moved to other genera. \\"Miltonia\\" species have large and long lasting flowers, often in multifloral inflorescences. This fact, allied to being species that are easy to grow and to identify, make them a favorite of orchid collectors all over the world. Species of this genus are extensively used to produce artificial hybrids.  - Odontocidium , abbreviated as Odcdm . in the horticultural trade , is the nothogenus comprising intergeneric hybrids of the two orchid genera Odontoglossum and Oncidium ( Odm . x Onc . ) . Many orchids formerly classified as Colmanara have been reclassified as Odontocidium by the American Orchid Society .  - Oncidium altissimum, Wydler's dancing-lady orchid, is a species of orchid native to the West Indies (Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles), with an 18th-Century citation from Jamaica.  - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about .

His colleague Phil studied human settlement from 8-10,000 years ago. They were both fascinated by their findings.  Which colleague studied that more people settled down in cities?  Hint: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is evident that Phil, who studied human settlements from 8-10,000 years ago, focused on the period when more people settled down in cities. This conclusion can be drawn from the hint provided, which states that human beings invented agriculture around 10,000 years ago. The development of agriculture was a significant turning point in human history, as it led to a stable and reliable food supply. This allowed people to transition from a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a more settled way of life, as the practice of farming led to the establishment of permanent villages and eventually cities.  Since Brad studied much earlier ancient human settlements from 100,000 years ago, the evidence suggests that greater urbanization was not yet a feature of human society during that time. His research would have centered primarily on the lifestyle and practices of early human populations that were still reliant on hunting and gathering for their sustenance. With the advent of agriculture, human societies experienced changes in their birth and death rates. The accessibility to more food and the benefits of a settled life led to increased birth rates. However, the growth of dense human settlements resulted in the spread of diseases, often transmitted from domestic animals, which contributed to higher death rates as well. Despite the rise in both birth and death rates, overall population growth remained slow, but more people began to settle in villages and cities. In conclusion, Phil, who studied human settlements from 8-10,000 years ago, researched the period when more people began to settle down in cities, following the invention of agriculture."},{"instruction":"Given this review: \\"Its ok\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? Why do many people shake their leg involuntarily, or while thinking? Why do so many people think dolls are creepy? Possible answers: (1). no (2). yes","output":"The answer is (1). No, these questions do not have the same meaning. The first question, \\"Why do many people shake their leg involuntarily, or while thinking?\\" is inquiring about a specific human behavior which is often unintentional. It is asking about the reasons why people might shake their leg when they're not consciously controlling their movement, or when they are deep in thought. The question would likely be answered with explanations about habits, cognitive processes, or possibly even neurological responses. The possible underlying reasons could be due to restless leg syndrome - a neurological disorder that creates an irresistible urge to move the legs, or it could be a subconscious mechanism for releasing nervous energy or stress. Furthermore, leg shaking could be a kind of stimming behavior - repetitive movements that some individuals use for self-stimulation, which is often common in people with neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD or Autism.  The second question, \\"Why do so many people think dolls are creepy?\\" is looking for answers about a largely psychological response to a specific object, namely dolls. It's delving into the area of phobias, fears and, more specifically, an aspect of culture known as uncanny or eerie feelings. What the question essentially asks is why dolls, objects meant for amusement, manage to inspire feelings of fear and discomfort in many people.  Dolls can often create what is called an 'uncanny valley' effect - they look human, but not convincingly so, which can cause a sense of unease or discomfort. One theory from the discipline of psychology suggests that this reaction could be a primitive defensive mechanism: humans have evolved to recognize and react with alarm to things that look similar to us but are \\"off\\" in some way as they could indicate illness or danger. In conclusion, while both questions are centered on understanding human behaviors and responses, they are significantly different in focus. One is about physical, often unconscious action (shaking legs), and the other is about emotional and psychological reactions to inanimate objects (dolls). The apprehension to 'creepy' dolls is more psychological and influences our emotion, while the act of shaking legs usually is a physical reaction to various internal and external stimuli."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

And the answer is?","output":"The Seventh-day Adventist Church is a Christian denomination that observes the Sabbath on Saturday, following the biblical example of seventh-day rest as described in the Holy Bible. This religious group upholds the belief that Saturday, the seventh day of the week according to the Gregorian calendar, should be observed as the day of rest and worship, rather than Sunday. The origin of the Seventh-day Adventist Church can be traced back to the Millerite movement in the United States during the early 19th century. The movement was named after its leader William Miller, a Baptist preacher who predicted the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, based on his interpretation of the prophecies in the Book of Daniel. When Miller's predictions failed, the event known as the \\"Great Disappointment\\" ensued, causing disillusionment among his followers. However, several groups emerged from the ashes of the Millerite movement, and one of them became the foundation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Officially established in 1863, the Seventh-day Adventist Church not only observes the Sabbath on Saturday but also emphasizes other key beliefs, such as the imminent return of Jesus Christ, the importance of a healthy lifestyle, and adherence to the teachings of the Bible. They follow the Ten Commandments, with a particular focus on the fourth commandment, which states the observance of the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship, sanctified by God in the book of Genesis after he created the world in six days. The practice of Saturday Sabbath observance by the Seventh-day Adventist Church is rooted in the early Christian Church's tradition, which observed the Sabbath as per Jewish custom. However, the majority of Christianity shifted to Sunday observance under the influence of the Roman Empire and its traditions. The Seventh-day Adventist Church continued with the practice of the original Sabbath observance as they believe that it is a direct commandment from God. Today, the Seventh-day Adventist Church is a large international community with millions of members across the globe. They are known for their commitment to education, healthcare, and humanitarian aid, as well as their dedication to evangelism and sharing their beliefs with others. Their practice of observing the Sabbath on Saturday underscores their devotion to adhering to what they believe are the original teachings of the Bible and God's plan for his followers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: You and your ex will need to handle logistical details like canceling the venue rental, the entertainment, the flowers and décor, the cake and the honeymoon plans. Because of the strong emotional fallout after the wedding, you might ask family and close friends to assist you in handling these matters. Regardless, the burden for cancelling everything and retrieving deposits (if possible) should be shared by the would-be bride and groom. Once the wedding has been fully cancelled, you and your ex need to discuss what will happen to the engagement ring. This decision varies among couples. The general rule of thumb is whoever decided to call off the wedding didn’t hold up their end of the bargain, and therefore, doesn’t get the ring. One exception to this rule involves rings of extraordinary value or family heirlooms. In such cases, the ring should be returned to the family it belongs to. If your home is surrounded with reminders of your failed engagement and wedding (if not relationship), put them away - at least for the time being. Ask friends to help you toss out any wedding-related items such as invitations. Donate any wedding decor that could be used for other events, or try to resell them to recoup costs.  If the failed engagement also brings the end of the relationship (NOT necessarily!), then cutting the entire thing out of your life would be cutting a part of yourself out - rather, put it away so that it is out of sight, out of mind.

Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Air goes through all the little branches in your lungs to fill up the air sacs, or alveoli - Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries - The oxygen goes into the bloodstream - Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up - You breathe it out through your lungs - Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the following process is \\"inhaling or taking a breath.\\" This step is crucial as it initiates the respiratory system by drawing in oxygen-rich air from the environment into your lungs. The detailed and long answer to the entire process is as follows: 1. Inhaling or taking a breath: The process of respiration begins when you inhale oxygen-rich air from the environment. The act of breathing relies on the movement of your diaphragm, a large dome-shaped muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. When the diaphragm contracts and moves downward, it creates a partial vacuum in the chest cavity which allows air to be sucked into your lungs. 2. Air goes through all the little branches in your lungs to fill up the air sacs, or alveoli: After entering your lungs, the air travels through a complex system of passageways called bronchi and bronchioles, which further divide into smaller branches. These passageways eventually lead to tiny air sacs called alveoli. The alveoli are crucial for gas exchange as they have thin walls and a large surface area, making it easier for the oxygen to pass through and into your bloodstream. 3. Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries: As the oxygen-rich air reaches the alveoli, it encounters a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries. These capillaries are in close contact with the walls of the alveoli, making it possible for efficient gas exchange to occur. The oxygen molecules diffuse from the air in the alveoli and pass through the walls of the alveoli into the nearby capillaries. 4. The oxygen goes into the bloodstream: Once inside the capillaries, the oxygen molecules bind to a protein called hemoglobin, found in red blood cells. Hemoglobin is responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body - a process known as oxygenation. The oxygen-rich blood now flows from the capillaries and into larger blood vessels called veins, which carry the blood back to the heart. 5. Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up: As the oxygen-rich blood circulates throughout your body, the oxygen molecules are delivered to your cells, where they participate in cellular respiration to produce energy needed for various bodily functions. During this process, cells consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide as a waste product. Carbon dioxide then diffuses from the cells and into the surrounding capillaries. 6. You breathe it out through your lungs: The carbon dioxide-rich blood is carried by veins back to the heart, which pumps it to the lungs. In the lungs, the carbon dioxide molecules pass from the capillaries into the alveoli by diffusion, essentially reversing the earlier process of oxygen crossing the walls of the alveoli. As you exhale, the carbon dioxide exits your body, and the process begins anew as you take another breath, inhaling oxygen-rich air to maintain the continuous and vital process of respiration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Answer:","output":"Dan"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sentence 1: Throughout her relationship , the couple lived in London and Los Angeles , though Seymour spent more time in Los Angeles for their work . Sentence 2: During their relationship the pair lived in Los Angeles , though Seymour spent more time in London and Los Angeles for her work . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"Step 1: Analyze both sentences for their main topics. Sentence 1's main topic is about the couple living in London and Los Angeles during their relationship, specifically noting Seymour's time spent more in Los Angeles for work. Sentence 2's main topic is about the couple living in Los Angeles during their relationship, mentioning that Seymour spent more time in London and Los Angeles for work. Step 2: Compare the main topics of both sentences. Both sentences talk about the couple's living situation during their relationship and Seymour's work engagements. Step 3: Identify the differences between the two sentences. Sentence 1 states that the couple lived in both London and Los Angeles. In contrast, Sentence 2 implies that they lived only in Los Angeles. Additionally, Sentence 1 mentions that Seymour spent more time in Los Angeles for their work, while Sentence 2 specifies that Seymour spent more time in both London and Los Angeles for her work, in contrast to their relationship living situation. Step 4: Determine if the differences impact the overall information conveyed. The differences in living locations and the distribution of Seymour's time between London and Los Angeles impact the information conveyed by each sentence. Conclusion: Although the sentences share some similarities, they do not convey the same information because of differences in where the couple lived during their relationship and the time Seymour spent in the mentioned cities for work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Color, for example, changes a lot according to what the producers are trying to sell. Health foods are packed in greens, yellows or browns because we think of these as healthy colors. When some kind of medicine was brought out recently, researchers found that the color of the package  caused the shoppers to lose interest because they made the product look ineffective .

(CNN) -- A dinosaur from the Middle-Late Jurassic period, found in China, gives scientists new understandings of how birds evolved, according to a Wednesday report from the journal Nature. The newly discovered species is called Aurornis xui. \\"Aurora\\" is Latin for \\"daybreak\\" or \\"dawn.\\" Ornis is Greek for \\"bird.\\" The last part of the name, xui, honors paleontologist Xu Xing. The dinosaur lived about 150 million years ago, said Pascal Godefroit, lead author and researcher at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels. Read about more dinosaur discoveries The critter was 51 centimeters -- about 20 inches -- long. It had teeth and probably fed on insects, Godefroit said. It was found in the Tiaojishan Formation of Liaoning Province, China. This is the skeleton of the newly discovered dinosaur, which is about 150 million years old. This dinosaur appears to have had four wings, two along the arms and two along the legs, Godefroit said. It could probably glide but not actively fly off the ground. The specimen, exceptionally preserved in a clay sediment, appears to be an adult. This dinosaur ate like a falcon Another fossil from about 150 million years ago, called Archaeopteryx, was previously considered the most primitive known bird. Godefroit said the newly discovered dinosaur throws that into question, as the new find appears to represent an even more primitive, older bird. Alan Turner, assistant professor of anatomical sciences at Stony Brook University in New York, who was not involved in the study, said in an e-mail that the find was \\"a very interesting fossil discovery.\\" It demonstrates just how similar the earliest birds were to the earliest members of the dinosaur groups, dromaeosaurids and troodontids, Turner said. These groups are all theropods, small meat-eating dinosaurs that walked on two feet. Michigan cousins go after crayfish, hook a mastodon Because of how well-preserved and well-prepared the specimen is, it provides useful information about the creature's evolutionary position and the changes that were taking place in the lineage that led to birds, he said. Still, Aurornis xui's exact position in its family tree is likely not set in stone, he said. The relationships between the earliest bird species and their dinosaur relatives can change in subtle ways depending on the data set being used by particular groups of researchers. That means that species that were once called \\"birds\\" can become considered \\"troodontids,\\" or vice versa. The exact details are still being worked out, Turner said. \\"That's why new discoveries like Aurornis xui are both very exciting and frustrating because they often raise as many questions as they answer,\\" he said. More space and science news from CNN Light Years What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"A long time ago, about 150 million years, there was a dinosaur named Aurornis xui that lived in a place called China.

It had something like four wings, two on its arms and two on its legs. It could glide but not fly from the ground.

Question 2: What is the mass in grams of 11 atoms of potassium? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1: Imagine a toy box filled with different types of marbles.  1. Atomic Mass: Think of atomic mass like the total weight of all the marbles in the toy box. It's a single number that tells us how heavy the average marble is, considering all the different types of marbles that we have. 2. Mass Number: Now let's say we pick one specific marble (or a type of atom). The mass number is the total number of small parts (called protons and neutrons) that are inside the \\"heart\\" of the marble (or the nucleus of the atom).  3. Atomic Weight: Atomic weight is like atomic mass, but instead of just giving us the average weight of the marbles, it tells us how much each different type of marble (or a type of atom) contributes to the average weight based on how many of each kind we have. 4. Relative Atomic Mass: This one is a bit simpler. Relative atomic mass is just a way to compare the weights of different types of marbles (atoms) by choosing one marble (like a hydrogen atom) as a reference. So, instead of saying \\"this marble weighs 4 grams,\\" we say \\"this marble is 4 times heavier than the reference marble.\\" Question 2: To find the mass in grams of 11 atoms of potassium, we need to know the weight of one potassium atom and then multiply it by 11. Let's say that 1 potassium atom (like one of our marbles) has a weight of 39 grams. So, if we have 11 potassium atoms, we'll use: 11 atoms x 39 grams/atom = 429 grams So, the mass of 11 potassium atoms would be 429 grams. Answer: The two questions are different and their answers are not the same. Question 1 talks about various ways to describe the mass of atoms like marbles, whereas Question 2 provides the answer to the mass of a specific number of potassium atoms."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What type of TV show is Kaufman's first? ?  Andy Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. He catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \\"villain character\\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience. Kaufman's profile increases with appearances on Saturday Night Live, but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his strange anti-humor and demand that he perform as Latka. At one show, he deliberately antagonizes attendees by reading The Great Gatsby aloud from start to finish. Kaufman shows up on the Taxi set as Clifton and proceeds to cause chaos until he is removed from the studio lot.

Is it true that does alternative minimum tax apply to capital gains based on the following text? Each year a taxpayer must calculate and then pay the greater of an alternative minimum tax (AMT) or regular tax. Effectively for high income earners who mitigate their tax position from the day-to-day income tax, an end-of-year consolidation of all taxable income is requested and submitted. This is then paid in arrears (from the normal payroll income tax) less any allowable deductions. For many taxpayers, the effective marginal tax rates are 0% (exemption), 26% (low bracket), 28% (high bracket), 32.5% (low bracket with exemption phase out), and 35% (high bracket with exemption phase out), with increasing taxable income as modified for AMT. As with regular federal income tax, rates and exemptions vary by filing status. The lower rate and the exemption are phased out above certain income levels at 25% of AMT income.

Question: Who designed the Commando Elite action figures? Movie plot title: Small Soldiers Movie plot: Top defense contractor GloboTech Industries acquires the Heartland Toy Company and as part of the move, Globotech CEO Gil Mars (Denis Leary) tells Heartland toy designers Larry Benson (Jay Mohr) and Irwin Wayfair (David Cross) to develop actual live-action toys capable of \\"playing back\\". Mars selects Larry's action figures, the Commando Elite, for the project and Irwin's educational toys, the Gorgonites, for their enemies, with the toyline expected to hit the market in three months. Faced with such a tight deadline, Benson forgoes safety testing, then uses Irwin's password and chooses GloboTech's overly powerful X1000 microprocessor to control the toys. Teenager Alan Abernathy (Gregory Smith) signs off for a shipment of the toys at his family's toy store without his father's consent. He and delivery driver Joe activate the leaders for each group - Archer (Frank Langella) for the Gorgonites and Chip Hazard (Tommy Lee Jones) for the Commando Elite. Alan's neighbor and love interest, Christy Fimple (Kirsten Dunst), buys Chip as a birthday present for her brother Timmy. Alan returns home to discover Archer in his backpack; he realizes Archer is sentient, but in the meantime, the Commando Elite awaken and apparently destroy the Gorgonites in the toy store. Alan calls the company and files a complaint. Later, when Larry and Irwin listen to Alan's voice mail, Irwin is terrified to discover the X1000 was designed for smart munitions guidance; a Globotech engineer reveals the AI circuit is designed to learn over time, but mass production was scrapped due to issues with EMP shielding. Meanwhile, Chip and his squad pursue Alan to his home and attempt to kill him and Archer; unlike the Gorgonites, the Commando Elite do not understand they are just toys. Alan is attacked by Nick Nitro (Clint Walker), whom he mortally wounds. The next day, Alan and Archer find the rest of the Gorgonites in a dumpster at the shop. At home, Alan learns the primary goal of the Gorgonites is to seek their homeland Gorgon, which they mistakenly...

Phillips, who works in China, released his report saying China's suicide rate from 1995 to 1999 reached 0.023 percent, the country has been ranked among those with the highest suicide rates in the world. But Jing Jun, a professor of sociology in Tsinghua University, challenges that view and presents the true picture through his nationwide research. Jing and his students took one year to set up the first national database on suicide rate to grasp the overall trend of suicides in China. They collected data from the Health Statistics Annuals of the World Health Organization (sample size 10 million), and the country's Health Statistics Annuals (which cover 100 million people). The database covers 23 years, from 1987 to 2009. Jing calculates the suicide rate in China based on these data. Though the suicide rate was comparatively high in the early years, his study shows it has dropped in recent years, as opposed to the ascending trend in the rest of the world. According to Jing's calculation, China's suicide rate had dropped to about 0.01 percent in 2004. In 2009, the figure dropped further to 0.007 percent, which is rather low compared with the global rate of 0.016 percent. Even if the \\"missing\\" suicides were added, China's suicide rate in 2009 would still be below 0.008 percent.[:Zxxk.Com] Jing has found that one of the main reasons why the suicide rate has dropped was the steady and big decline in the number of suicides committed by rural women. In the early years, researchers generally agreed that the suicide rate among Chinese women was higher than among men, which is pretty rare in the rest the world. But the suicide rate among Chinese women, especially in rural areas, has declined remarkably in recent years. In fact, it is almost equal to that of Chinese men. As a sociologist, Jing regards suicide as a social issue, and believes improvement of social policies will reduce the suicide rate even further.

Answer: A:","output":"In Jing's opinion, to reduce the suicide rate, improvement of social policies should be prioritized.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: ‘Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2’ brings the funny and the feels      Like many a sequel to a slam-bang, much-liked mega-hit, “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” isn’t quite as much fun, not quite as clever, not quite as fresh as the original — but it still packs a bright and shiny and sweet punch.      Any big-budget superhero movie willing to place the opening action sequence to soft-focus background while a baby tree jams to ELO’s “Mr. Blue Sky” is all right by me.      The original “Guardians” (2014) was like the class clown of superhero movies, if the class clown also had a strong heart and a supple brain lurking beneath the goofball exterior. It was cool and snarky and warm and fuzzy at the same time. It was one of those movies you know you’re going to see again and enjoy just as much the second time around.      “Guardians of the Galaxy 2” follows the same recipe, from the return of that lovable ragtag band of universe-saviors to the constant bickering and bantering to the “Mix Tape” soundtrack of pop-rock hits from the 1970s. (And of course, in the tradition of just about every sequel ever, we’re introduced to new, important characters as well.)      I’ve always liked the corny, AM-friendly, storytelling hit “Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)” by Looking Glass. It’s put to good use here, just to the brink of overkill. I’m good with not hearing “Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)” by Looking Glass until about 2020.      One of the most impressive special effects in this candy-colored, explosion-riddled, 3-D extravaganza is the appearance of a young Kurt Russell in a 1980 prelude at the top of the story, in which Russell’s character of Ego is romancing Meredith Quill, who will become the mother of Peter Quill/Star-Lord. (Reports say a combination of CGI and makeup and other tricks of the trade gave us the young Kurt. I’d rather not know. It’s just pretty amazing to see what appears to be a 30ish Kurt Russell, awesome ’80s haircut flowing in the breeze.)      They’re zipping down the highway, clearly in love, singing along to “Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)” by Looking Glass. And then Ego shows Meredith a strange orb glowing in the woods, and he talks about his master plan, and …      Cut to 34 years later, with the Guardians of the Galaxy gearing up for battle. In addition to Chris Pratt’s wisecracking but noble Peter, there’s Zoe Saldana’s brave (and green) but emotionally cautious Gamora; Dave Bautista’s hulking and ferocious but rather dim and goofy Drax; the sly and outwardly selfish Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and the adorable Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel).      The Guardians get mixed up in all kinds of dangerous intergalactic hijinks interspersed with sticky-sweet sentimental moments. Songs such as Fleetwood Mac’s “The Chain” and Cat Stevens’ “Father and Son” set the tone (and in some cases hammer home the point).      At times the special effects are wondrous and cool; other times, they’re so cheesy and obviously CGI one can’t help but wonder if that’s the effect director James Gunn and the army of special effects wizards were trying to achieve. (Scenes on various planets when oozing blue goop spreads across landscapes, apparently killing thousands of humans and other human-like species, are straight out of a B-movie.)      Michael Rooker has one of the best roles in the movie as Yondu, the infamous space pirate with the blue skin and startlingly horrible teeth and red, Mohawk-like device atop his head. Yondu’s the worst! Or is he? Either way, things liven up quite a bit whenever Yondu starts controlling the deadliest arrow ever by whistling. (Man, Yondu better hope nobody ever stuffs a bunch of crackers down his throat at the wrong moment and quells the whole whistling thing.)      There’s a whole lot of family dynamic at play, with the vengeful and deeply warped Nebula (Karen Gillan) intent on killing her sister Gamora; Drax establishing some kind of weird sibling kinship with the nice but creepy Mantis (Pom Klementieff), who if anything is even more socially awkward than Drax; and the major unresolved relationship in the story, between Peter and his dad, a celestial being that calls himself Ego and rules a planet (and maybe more than just one planet) of his own creation.      Chris Pratt and Kurt Russell are terrific together as a father and son who have a lot of baggage to deal with, even in a superhero universe where it sometimes feels as if MOST fathers and sons are dealing with a lot of baggage. As the story gets deeper and darker and more convoluted, it’s hard to care about the particulars of the plot — especially when the screenplay is constantly reminding us not to take it too seriously, what with the references to David Hasselhoff and “Cheers” and Mary Poppins and other pop-culture touchstones.      Oh, and we haven’t even talked about Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), a golden-skinned warrior princess who leads an army of supposedly perfect creations who are rather terrible at remote-control bombing missions.      And yet even with all the silliness and all the snarkiness, the Guardians can put a lump in your throat when someone suffers a serious setback, or someone does a solid and risks everything to save someone else. We look forward to the next adventure, with the hopes the Awesome Mix Tape will be the soundtrack for something just a little smarter, a little less bloated, a little more focused.      ★★★      Marvel Studios presents a film written and directed by James Gunn. Rated PG-13 (for sequences of sci-fi action and violence, language, and brief suggestive content). Running time: 136 minutes. Opens Friday at local theaters. ||||| Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2      Director James Gunn narrates a sequence from the film featuring Zoe Saldana and Karen Gillan.      Starring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Michael Rooker, Kurt Russell, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Elizabeth Debicki and Sylvester Stallone. Written and directed by James Gunn. Opens Friday at major theatres. 136 minutes. PG Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 misses a trick with its “awesome mix” of cheesy 1970s pop songs: Andrea True’s 1976 disco hit “More, More, More” isn’t on the soundtrack. It would have been perfect for a movie deep-diving into franchise formula, by larding in more characters, more plot lines, more explosions and more banter, as if returning writer/director James Gunn is playing cosmic pinball rather than telling a story.      Article Continued Below      Just like almost every other blockbuster sequel, in other words, although this property originally sought to blow up convention. It arrived in 2014 smirking at Marvel Comics superhero angst, as its bickering misfits fought intergalactic badness for kicks and cash. But like a visit from amusing friends who stay a bit longer than expected, it’s easy to forgive the indulgence. Vol. 2 sees E.T.-abducted Earthling Peter “Star-Lord” Quill (Chris Pratt), blade-wielding warrior Gamora (Zoe Saldana), tattooed muscleman Drax (Dave Bautista), hybrid handyman Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and adorable offshoot Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) confronting not just an expanded universe of villains but also more complicated family and romantic connections. They’ll be joined, with mixed motives and outcomes both comic and dramatic, by Gamora’s angry adopted sister Nebula (Karen Gillan), insect-faced alien Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and blue-skinned Ravagers bandit Yondu (Michael Rooker), the latter in a significantly enlarged role from the first Guardians, where he played Peter’s crime mentor, surrogate father and nemesis all in one. All of the above has already been revealed in multiple trailers, along with the supposed shocker that Peter’s long-gone birth father is suddenly back in his son’s life. He’s a celestial planet builder aptly called Ego, played by Kurt Russell. He wants to make up for not being there when Peter was grieving his mother’s cancer death and being kidnapped by aliens.      Frome left, Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillan, Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista and Rocket, voiced by Bradley Cooper, in a scene from, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 ( Disney-Marvel via AP )      The movie opens on Earth in 1980 with the man now called Ego and Peter’s mom-to-be Meredith (Laura Haddock) as they cruise a Missouri highway with the soft-rock hit “Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)” on the radio, immediately establishing itself as this movie’s main ear worm.      Jump ahead 34 years and Peter and the other Guardians are fighting a giant space thingie, in a colourfully rendered battle set to Electric Light Orchestra’s “Mr. Blue Sky.” They’re also irritating a superior celestial race called the Sovereign, who look like angry Oscar statues and who quickly develop a murderous grudge against the Guardians. Elizabeth Debicki is wonderfully pompous as Ayesha, their diva of a leader. And so it goes with this pinball game of a movie. The Guardians ricochet from one confrontation to another, some involving galaxy-saving and others just affairs of the heart — such as whether Peter and Gamora are ever going to acknowledge this love thing they feel coming on.      Article Continued Below      Fortunately, Gunn is savvy enough not to let the proceedings or the characters get too serious or too sappy. He punctures Ego’s balloon in one scene by having him interrupt his bloviating with a need to urinate. In another, Ego explains to Peter why “Brandy” is Earth’s finest song ever, which is like that moment in Dumb and Dumber when Jim Carrey says the Beatles were a huge influence on the Monkees. So even if the gags go on too long — the David Hasselhoff and Cheers references are just plain goofy — and the cheeseball soundtrack isn’t quite the retro joy it was three years ago, these Guardians are still worth hanging with, if only to marvel at the imaginative characters and production design. To those who disagree, I quote the knuckleheaded but weirdly profound Drax: “You Earthlings have hang-ups.” ||||| Disney/Marvel      What an oddball corner of the Marvel space-time continuum the Guardians of the Galaxy occupy! They can do quantum leaps between interstellar dimensions while bopping to carefree ’70s dance-pop on a cassette player. They battle big, bad aliens while name-checking Mary Poppins and David Hasselhoff, and discuss their complicated interpersonal relationships through references to Sam and Diane from “Cheers.” Their high-flying dogfights happen amid audiovisual arcade game nods to Galaga and Pac-Man.      Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ★★★★ out of 4 stars Rating: PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action and violence, language and brief suggestive content.      You don’t get more back to the future than this wholehearted embrace of sci-fi and golden oldies nostalgia. No franchise is so gifted at exploiting the popularity of superhero movies while satirizing the genre. “Deadpool” was too over the R-rated top. “Ant-Man” was too small-scale for non-geeks. “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” is just right. It’s hyperbolic nonsense wrapped in the colors of a neon rainbow, bouncing from one artfully wacky scenario to the next. Here it’s sleekly futuristic, there it’s older than mud. It’s the galaxy’s silliest thrill show.      The film continues the threads we saw formed in the Guardians’ initial appearance as small-time mercenaries turned halfhearted defenders of the universe. We know that Peter Quill, aka Star Lord, is a cocky swashbuckler with a neurotic core, the kind of fixable bad boy Chris Pratt was born to play.      Zoe Saldana is his female counterpart as Gamora, a hard-fighting green gladiatrix with an ornery streak and a tendency to tell the girlfriend-craving Peter to drop the mushy stuff because such a thing as romance between their species could never happen for real anyway.      Dave Bautista’s Drax is a comically plain-spoken goliath, now trying to understand humor and laughing at every wrong moment. Vin Diesel has his deep bass tuned to a squeak in voicing Groot, the massive walking extraterrestrial tree that was felled and returned to life as a cute little humanoid twig, while Rocket the genetically enhanced raccoon (spoken by Bradley Cooper) remains as abrasive as an electric grinder. His interest in once again staving off Armageddon is purely financial: “We’re really gonna be able to jack up our prices if we’re two-time Galaxy savers!”      The threats arrive on jumbled story lines. A society of gold-colored tech nerds attack the Guardians for running off with a bag of priceless light bulbs. Gamora’s jealous sister Nebula (Karen Gillan) arrives to prove she’s the family’s most efficient assassin by killing her sibling. A space army of Ravagers led by blue-skinned Yondu (Michael Rooker), who snatched young, orphaned Peter from Earth and became his shady papa figure, comes after them to settle scores of their own. Meanwhile, in a nearby subplot, Peter meets Ego (Kurt Russell), the universal life force that actually created him. Peter and Ego have a heart-to-heart while interpreting the lyrics to Cat Stevens’ “Father and Son,” giving the maudlin song a feeling of real pathos.      Drax (Dave Bautista) and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) flying high in \\"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2.\\"      Written and directed again with tongue-in-cheek flair by James Gunn (of “Slither” and “Super” fame), this is first-rate goofy escapism. While the mentality and much of the dialogue is adolescent again, this time the adventure includes some interesting concepts and emotional undercurrents, adding a neat bonus of heart. Russell gives a nuanced turn as Ego reveals where the root word for egomania came from. Russell moves through Ego’s lifelong neglect of Peter, to his amiable warmth, and then his mercurial storming as if Ego were a classic alcoholic father.      Of course there are oooh-and-aaah-worthy special effects, but they’re not the entire story. “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” is touching and bawdy, violent and hilarious, glamorous and goofy. It’s as close as comic book movies come to being all things to all people. ||||| Correction: A previous version on this review incorrectly described the planet of Berhert. The story has been updated.            From left, Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Star-Lord/Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Drax (Dave Bautista) and Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) reprise their roles in Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.” It’s more expansive, more beautiful, funnier and nuttier than the first film — and it features another great soundtrack. (Film Frame/Marvel Studios)      With a title slyly evoking the music-compilation aesthetic embodied by its 1970s-hit-heavy sound track, “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” manages to re-create the formula of self-aware, snarky humor and unapologetic action that made the original 2014 film such a pleasing package of ear and eye candy, while at the same time avoiding the sophomore slump of sequels that risk audience fatigue by repeating rather than building on what worked the first time. The new film is more expansive, more beautiful, funnier, nuttier and — this is the most difficult trick for any comic-book movie to pull off — more touching than the first film.      The team of five quarrelsome superheroes returns intact, or mostly intact, with the barely articulate tree-man Groot having been reduced, at the end of the last film, to the sapling-size Baby Groot, still voiced by Vin Diesel, but as if he were exhaling helium from a party balloon. And the film kicks off like a party, with an opening credit sequence featuring Groot shaking his adorably twiggy booty to Electric Light Orchestra’s “Mr. Blue Sky” on a boombox as Chris Pratt’s Peter “Star-Lord” Quill, Zoe Saldana’s Gamora, Dave Bautista’s Drax and Bradley Cooper’s CGI raccoon Rocket do battle with an alien starbeast intent on attacking the Anulax batteries they have been hired to protect.      Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). (Film Frame/Marvel Studios)      The Guardians may be mercenaries, but they’re far from all business, occasionally pausing to queue up one of Peter’s favorite tracks as a sonic backdrop to the impending action. (The filmmakers, led by returning director and co-writer James Gunn, also oblige, as in the film’s tour-de-force set piece: a scene featuring mass killing, set to “Come a Little Bit Closer” by Jay and the Americans, as a flying arrow on autopilot — the signature weapon of Michael Rooker’s Yondu the Ravager — pierces through multiple bodies over the course of the tonally inappropriate yet perfectly curated song.)      That’s not the only dazzling visual, in this sharply ­choreographed and ravishingly designed comedic space opera. One scene, featuring Gamora’s green body, silhouetted against a red landscape, is so painterly pretty, a la “Avatar’s” moon of Pandora, that my eyes hurt — in a good way.      The real story doesn’t get underway until our ­ethically tarnished heroes — having stolen some of the same batteries they had previously been guarding against theft — crash-land on the planet of Berhert. There, Peter meets his long-lost father, the appro­priately named Ego (Kurt Russell), leading to what appears to be a tender family reunion — and striking a tone that will characterize the rest of the film, much of which takes place on Ego’s home planet. Family — the kind that is defined by blood, and the kind for whom you will spill blood, even without sharing DNA — is the theme of this tale, which manages to evoke genuine, deep feelings, along with belly laughs.      Much of the film’s humor has to do with stupidity resulting from efforts to look cool. One villain character, who has given himself the moniker Taserface (Chris Sullivan of “This Is Us”), is mocked repeatedly for the ­ineffectuality of his meant-to-be-threatening handle. In another scene, Peter compares Yondu — his surrogate father, who raised him as a child — to Mary ­Poppins, as Yondu descends from the sky, like the famous nanny, ­holding his arrow aloft like her umbrella. “Mary Poppins? Is he cool?” asks the clueless Yondu.      Yes, Mary Poppins is cool, Peter reassures him, with an implied wink to the audience. Winks, of a more literal variety, are a recurring sight gag, as the cynical Rocket tries, unsuccessfully, to signal his sarcastic digs, by repeatedly batting the one eye that everyone can see.      “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” suffers from no such fatal exertions. Gunn, whose film includes more world building than the original movie — and the introduction of a charming new character, the buglike empath Mantis (Pom Klementieff) — delivers backstory, story and the promise of stories to come with the breezy, effortless skill of a master raconteur.      This is not a superhero movie in the ponderous mold of DC Comics’s “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” or even its fellow Marvel movies centering on Captain America and the Avengers. Falling somewhere ­between the sardonicism of the “Iron Man” trilogy and the self-aware meta-movie high jinks of the R-rated yuk-fest “Deadpool,” “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” is a toe-tapping, eye-popping indication that summer is here, and that it might not be so bad after all. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"\\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\\" is basically the sequel to the first \\"Guardians of the Galaxy,\\" but with a lot more fun and laughs.

Still owned by the Trust, the site is open to visitors all year round, free of charge. On their website, the Trust advises visitors to look for \\"stunning views from the top of the barrow\\". John H. Evans characterised the site as \\"the most impressive\\" of the Medway Megaliths, while Grinsell described it as \\"the finest and most complete\\" of the group.Among the Pagans who use the Coldrum Stones for their ritual activities, there is general satisfaction with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in the centre of the monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so in the same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The answer to your friend's question is: The site's name is the Coldrum Stones. The responsible Trust warden for this site has chosen to leave the patch of scorched earth rather than seeding it over. This decision was made in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so in the same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He had spent years maintaining control of his darker urges, integrating with Chicago's society, and generally trying to act like a human being. This was no easy task for someone with supernatural abilities and a dark past, but it was necessary for his survival and to protect those he cared about. As a member of the White Court of vampires, his primary concern was concealing his true nature from the humans he interacted with daily. My protagonist, let's call him John, had worked hard to establish a new life in Chicago and to distance himself from the negative aspects of his vampiric heritage. His life was a delicate balancing act, as he needed to keep his kinship a secret from a number of different groups: the White Court who controlled the city's supernatural underworld, the human society he was part of, and the Council who were a powerful force within the supernatural community. The Council was a major concern for John because they had the power to expose and destroy him if they ever found out about his presence in their territory. They would have used him as a pawn to bring down the White Court, and in doing so, they would have placed him and his loved ones in great danger. The same went for the vampires who might use him to get closer to the Council. John had to be very cautious about the relationships he formed and the friendships he cultivated, always wary that his secret might be discovered. This constant state of vigilance was a heavy burden for John, but he managed to bear it while maintaining the facade of a normal human being. He formed friendships, found love, and even built a career in Chicago. He became a valuable member of that society, using his abilities to help others in need without revealing his true nature. Over time, his resolve grew stronger, and he was determined to never let his darker instincts control him again. However, nothing lasts forever, and eventually, something terrible happened to John that shattered his carefully constructed world. He was attacked by an unknown supernatural force, and in the process of defending himself and his friends, he was forced to reveal his secret to someone close to him. This exposed him not only to the Council, but also to other supernatural factions within the city who sought to exploit or eliminate him. The revelation of his secret also shattered the trust and relationships he had built over the years with those who knew him only as a human. Despite the adversity he faced, John did not give up. Understanding the gravity of the situation, he realized that his only chance of survival was to face his fears and confront his past demons. He stopped trying to blend into human society and instead embraced his true nature as a member of the White Court. This was a difficult transition, as he needed to learn how to navigate life without hiding who he was and face the many supernatural challenges that lay ahead. In doing so, John reconnected with his White Court siblings and began to forge alliances with other supernatural beings in the city who were willing to aid him in his battles against the forces that sought his destruction. It was during this time that he discovered that whoever had attacked him was part of a larger plot by an unknown enemy who wanted to control not only the White Court but all of the supernatural factions within Chicago. Together, John and his newfound allies fought back against their enemies and strove to protect not only their own, but also the innocent humans who were caught in the crossfire. Throughout his journey, John learned that it was possible to accept his vampiric heritage without succumbing to the darkness within him. Only by embracing his true self - both the light and the darkness - could he hope to protect his loved ones, vanquish his enemies, and ultimately find peace with his dual identity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On 22 August, nearly two months after the main uprisings had been defeated, about 1,000 French soldiers under General Humbert landed in the north-west of the country, at Kilcummin in County Mayo. Joined by up to 5,000 local rebels, they had some initial success, inflicting a humiliating defeat on the British in Castlebar   and setting up a short-lived \\"Irish Republic\\" with John Moore as president of one of its provinces, Connacht. This sparked some supportive uprisings in Longford and Westmeath which were quickly defeated, and the main force was defeated at the battle of Ballinamuck, in County Longford, on 8 September 1798. The Irish Republic had only lasted twelve days from its declaration of independence to its collapse. The French troops who surrendered were repatriated to France in exchange for British prisoners of war, but hundreds of the captured Irish rebels were executed. This episode of the 1798 Rebellion became a major event in the heritage and collective memory of the West of Ireland and was commonly known in Irish as Bliain na bhFrancach and in English as \\"The Year of the French\\". On 12 October 1798, a larger French force consisting of 3,000 men, and including Wolfe Tone himself, attempted to land in County Donegal near Lough Swilly. They were intercepted by a larger Royal Navy squadron, and finally surrendered after a three-hour battle without ever landing in Ireland. Wolfe Tone was tried by court-martial in Dublin and found guilty. He asked for death by firing squad, but when this was refused, Tone cheated the hangman by slitting his own throat in prison on 12 November, and died a week later.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step of the process is the muscle fiber getting a signal from its nerve. This occurs when the nervous system sends an electrical signal, called an action potential, to the muscle fiber through a specialized nerve cell called a motor neuron. The motor neuron's axon terminal makes contact with the muscle fiber at a junction known as the neuromuscular junction. At this junction, the action potential reaches the nerve terminal, causing the release of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine (ACh). The acetylcholine molecules diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to the receptors on the muscle fiber's membrane, which subsequently results in the generation of an action potential within the muscle fiber. This action potential initiates the series of steps involving proteins and chemicals that release energy, leading to the contraction or relaxation of the muscle and ultimately the movement of the bones connected to the muscle."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: The history of the Ottoman Empire during World War I began with the Ottoman engagement in the Middle Eastern theatre. There were several important Ottoman victories in the early years of the war, such as the Battle of Gallipoli and the Siege of Kut. The Arab Revolt which began in 1916 turned the tide against the Ottomans on the Middle Eastern front, where they initially seemed to have the upper hand during the first two years of the war. The Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October 1918, and set the partition of the Ottoman Empire under the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres. This treaty, as designed in the conference of London, allowed the Sultan to retain his position and title. The occupation of Constantinople and İzmir led to the establishment of a Turkish national movement, which won the Turkish War of Independence (1919–22) under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal (later given the surname \\"Atatürk\\"). The sultanate was abolished on 1 November 1922, and the last sultan, Mehmed VI (reigned 1918–22), left the country on 17 November 1922. The caliphate was abolished on 3 March 1924.

Question: Why is bistro called like that? Context: In addition to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Cafe Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \\"bistro\\" means \\"quickly\\" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day.

The Queen’s eldest granddaughter, who is an equestrian Olympic silver medalist from the British eventing team is clearly keen to pass on her own love of riding to little Savannah. The two-year-old. the Queen's great-granddaughter, is the eldest child of Zara’s brother Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn, and sister to one year old Isla. Zara has given her two-year-old niece Savannah (right) a Shetland pony, perhaps hoping to pass on her own love of horses to the next generation The girls, who are 12th and 13th in line for the throne, played in the sunshine as they watched their aunt OPTIONS: - Autumn, compete. - British, compete. - Isla, compete. - Katy Winter, compete. - Olympic, compete. - Peter, compete. - Peter Phillips, compete. - Queen, compete. - Savannah, compete. - Shetland, compete. - Silver for Britain, compete. - Zara, compete. - Zara Phillips, compete.","output":"- Zara Phillips, compete. In this story, Zara Phillips is the professional horsewoman and Olympic silver medalist who is giving her niece, Savannah, a Shetland pony. It would make sense that she is the one to compete in the story.  Here's why other options are wrong: - Autumn: She is Savannah's mother, but the story does not mention her having any equestrian skills. - British: This is just an adjective describing the team Zara was a part of. - Isla: She is Savannah's sister, a one-year-old, too young to compete. - Katy Winter: The author of the story, not a character in it. - Olympic: Another descriptor, relating to Zara's accomplishments. - Peter: Savannah's father, but the story doesn't mention his involvement in equestrian sports. - Peter Phillips: Same as Peter, just his full name. - Queen: She is related to Zara and Savannah but not the one competing. - Savannah: She is only two years old, too young to compete. - Shetland: Refers to the type of pony given to Savannah, not a character. - Silver for Britain: This describes Zara's accomplishment in the Olympics, not a character. - Zara: Although this is correct, the better option is \\"Zara Phillips\\" as it provides her full name."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The gist of the film- Lilith was Adam's first wife and she was considered imperfect and banished from the garden of Eden because she considered herself Adam's equal and refused to submit to him. See, I took those words straight from the script. Then the film keeps going on and though she is the heroine of the film, the only time that she becomes acceptable is when she does what the men tell her to do! She ends the film under the control of The Faith- an all male group! Other than that the script was predictable and the FX were awful. Apart from the obvious hatred of females that is usually a lot more subtle in modern film, there was nothing original about Darklight. What is the sentiment of this review?

A scientist named Kathy walks into her office to see two neon signs plugged into the wall and hanging above her desk. Confused, she looks around to see if there's any clue as to who put them there. Seeing nobody, she flips the light switch on and walks in. Upon flipping the light switch, only the large sign lights up. Even though they are clearly both plugged in, the small sign isn't turning on. Kathy leaves her office to find someone to ask who put these random signs up in her room.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which sign's electrons are at a higher energy level?  Hint: Noble gases are also used to fill the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure below . Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light. Answer:","output":"Given the information provided, the large sign's electrons are at a higher energy level. This is because the large sign is lit when Kathy flips the light switch, indicating that its electrons have been energized and jumped to a higher energy level. When they return to their original energy level, they emit energy as light, causing the sign to be illuminated. The small sign, however, does not light up, suggesting that its electrons have not been energized to a higher energy level."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Now it turns out that they may not be good for our minds, either. A new study of more than 260,000 people has found a link between sweetened soft-drinks and depression, and diet sodas may be making matters worse. Americans drink far more sodas than people in other countries-- as much as 170 liters per person per year. But the impact of this study isn't limited to the United States. \\"Sweetened drinks, coffee and tea are commonly consumed worldwide and have important physical consequences. And they may have important mental-health consequences as well,\\" study author Dr Honglei Chen said in a statement. The study studied 263,925 people between the ages of 50 and 71. Researchers followed their consumption of drinks like soda, tea coffee, and other soft drinks from 1995 to 1996 and then. 10 years later, asked them if they had been diagnosed with depression since the year 2000. More than 11,3000 of them had. Participants who drank more than four servings of sodas per day were 30 percent more likely to develop depression than participants who did not drink sodas at all. People who stuck with fruit punch , had a 38 percent higher risk than people who didn't drink sweetened drinks. And all that extra sugar isn't the actual problem. Researchers say that the artificial sweetener _ may be to blame. The study found a link but could not surely determine whether sodas and other sweet soft drinks cause depression. Still, the results \\"are consistent with a small but growing body of evidence suggesting that artificially sweetened beverages may be linked to poor health outcomes.\\" But there's a bright side for those who can't live without their daily sodas. Adults who drank coffee had a 10 percent lower risk of depression compared to people who didn't drink any coffee, according to the study. \\"Our research suggests that cutting out or down on sweetened diet drinks or replacing them with unsweetened coffee may naturally help lower your depression risk,\\" said Chen.

Article: To make a simple bubble solution, all you need is liquid dish soap, water, and glycerin. Dawn and Joy brands work best, but feel free to experiment with other detergents.  You can buy glycerin at craft stores or from a pharmacy.  You can use light corn syrup instead of glycerin. Mix 2/3 cup dish soap, 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water, and 2-3 tablespoons of glycerin for a basic bubble solution. Stir the ingredients together gently, taking care not to create too much foam.  It is best to keep your solution in a clean jar with a lid.  If you are replacing the glycerin with corn syrup, you will need to adjust your ratios. Use 1/4 cup of light corn syrup for each tablespoon of glycerin.  For best results, let the solution sit overnight. There are several different recipes for making bubble soap. The ratio of the ingredients will determine the strength of your bubbles. Soap helps the water to form a bubble by stabilizing the water molecules. Increasing the amount of soap in your solution may yield a stronger bubble. However, too much soap could cause the bubbles to collapse.

Police here have opened an investigation into the search of a man's home by Apple employees, an official said Wednesday. San Francisco police were flooded with inquiries and barraged with criticism after releasing a statement on Friday saying four officers had aided Apple, which sent two of its security officials to search a man's home for a \\"lost item.\\" At the time of the search last month, Apple declined to file a formal report with the police. Apple did not find the device at the man's home, police said. The item they were looking for was a prototype for the next iPhone that was lost in a bar, according to CNET, making this the second time in as many years that an Apple employee has lost a prototype while out for drinks. CNET reported earlier Wednesday that the police had opened an investigation. Lt. Troy Dangerfield confirmed that police are now investigating the case, but he declined to comment further, citing a policy that prohibits officials from discussing open investigations. \\"It's not something we can just let pass,\\" Dangerfield said. Police officials said they were unable to confirm until Friday that a search had taken place because those involved did not file paperwork, at Apple's request. Apple had not returned an official's initial request for comment, police spokesman Albie Esparza said last week. The official statement came after police finally conferred with Apple. Apple declined CNN's request for comment on Friday. A man told the publication SF Weekly last week that he consented to a search of his home when the people arrived and identified themselves as police. He reportedly said it wasn't clear that the pair searching his home were Apple employees, not police; he also told the publication he would not have authorized the search if he had known.

The pyramid is used by countless health organizations, clinics, doctors and many others to guide people to eat in a healthy manner. It is the standard to live by and health professionals unanimously agree that by following this diet pyramid, your health will benefit tremendously. The pyramid is a wonderful synopsis of what the Mediterranean Diet entails. It shows four different food groups and the optimal number of servings of each group that should be consumed. The pyramid was created based on research of the diet that the people in the Mediterranean countries consume. The area was selected as the model because of the low incidence of heart disease and high life expectancy found in the region. One of the primary reasons for the healthy results of the diet is that the people not only use fresh, unadulterated ingredients, they also cook their meals in very healthy ways. They are among the minority of the world’s population that have not embraced the fast food culture that dominates the US and Australia. It should be noted that both countries are battling an obesity epidemic. There are no processed foods, colas, white flour products, pizzas or any unhealthy food in the food pyramid. There are only categories of fresh, healthy foods: fruits and vegetables, nuts and grains, beans, fish and seafood, and healthy oils (primarily olive oil) – plus a little red wine. Your fat consumption should be moderate along with consumption of dairy products such as yogurt and cheese. Eggs can be consumed daily. Fish (seafood) is preferred over meat and should be consumed twice a week. Poultry is also preferred over red meat and should be consumed once a week. Red meat should only be consumed 3 to 4 times a month. The rest of the time, vegetables, legumes, and/or pasta should be the focal point of your meals.

Astronauts making a rare, hastily planned spacewalk replaced a pump outside the International Space Station this weekend in the hopes of plugging a serious ammonia leak. The prospects of success grew as the minutes, then hours passed and no frozen flecks of ammonia appeared. Mission Control said it appeared as though the leak may have been plugged, although additional monitoring over the coming weeks will be needed before declaring a victory. 'I will tell you that we're happy. We're very happy,' said Joel Montalbano, NASA's deputy space station program manager. The spacewalk outside the International Space Station was captured on film by the tweeting, Facebooking, social media maven and space station commander Chris Hadfield. 'Amazing day,' he said. 'EVA (extra-vehicular activity) went off without a hitch. Great crew, phenomenal ground support and a supportive audience. Who could ask for anything more?' Space: Cassidy and Marshburn work outside the ISS in the 'approaching orbital sunset, the harshest of light, a blackness like endless velvet,' said Hadfield. Illuminating: Chris Cassidy and Tom Marshburn turn on their helmet lights 'doing their best to light the universe on the dark side of the Earth,' said Chris Hadfield. One small step: 'Climbing out of the airlock, quite the commute to work!' said Chris Hadfield via Twitter. Chris Cassidy, Navy SEAL and lead spacewalker on Saturday. Say cheese: Chris Cassidy and Tom Marshburn take a minute with visors open to have their picture taken by Chris Hadfield, inside the ISS. Dr. Tom Marshburn, well-dressed for a day's work outdoors. 'We didn't see any obvious signs of a leak, but it's going to take some. time...for us to look at the system, evaluate the system and make sure. we did, indeed, stop the leak.' Montalbano expects it will take 'a good four weeks, five weeks, maybe even a few weeks longer.' 'Obviously, the longer you go, the more confidence you get,' he told reporters. Christopher. Cassidy and Thomas Marshburn installed the new pump after removing the. old one suspected of spewing flakes of frozen ammonia coolant two days. earlier. They uncovered 'no smoking guns' responsible for the leak and. consequently kept a sharp lookout for any icy flecks that might appear. from the massive frame that holds the solar panels on the left side. Spacewalk: Astronaut Chris Cassidy took photos as he worked on repairs to the ISS on May 11, 2013. Cassidy and crewmate Tom Marshburn are believed to have repaired the dangerous ammonia leak. Concern: NASA emphasized that the lives of the multinational crew were not in danger but both Russian and US space experts were scrambling to swiftly fix the problem. Emergency: This picture shows the astronauts being prepared for their spacewalk at the International Space Station. Ammonia: Astronauts discovered a leak of ammonia coolant in its power system. 'Let. us know if you see anything,' Mission Control urged as the fresh pump. was cranked up. Thirty minutes later, all was still well. 'No snow,' the. astronauts radioed. 'We have our eyes on it and haven't seen a thing,' Marshburn said. NASA. said the leak, while significant, never jeopardized crew safety. The. space agency never before staged such a fast, impromptu spacewalk for a. station crew. Even during the shuttle program, unplanned spacewalks. were uncommon. The. ammonia pump was the chief suspect going into Saturday's spacewalk. So. it was disheartening for NASA, at first, as Cassidy and Marshburn. reported nothing amiss on or around the old pump. 'All. the pipes look shiny clean, no crud,' Cassidy said as he used a long,. dentist-like mirror to peer into tight, deep openings. 'I can't give you any good data other than nominal, unfortunately. No smoking guns.' Engineers. determined there was nothing to lose by installing a new pump, despite. the lack of visible damage to the old one. The entire team - weary and. stressed by the frantic pace of the past two days - gained more and more. confidence as the 5 1/2-hour spacewalk drew to a close with no flecks. of ammonia popping up. 'Gloved. fingers crossed,' space station commander Chris Hadfield said in a. tweet from inside. 'No leaks!' he wrote a half-hour later. Space station Commander Chris Hadfield of Canada has tweeted that the problem, while serious, has been stabilized. Crew noticed white flakes of ammonia leaking out of the station on Thursday. Flight. controllers in Houston worked furiously to get ready for Saturday's. operation, completing all the required preparation in under 48 hours. The astronauts trained for just such an emergency scenario before they. rocketed into orbit. This area on the space station is prone to leaks. The. ammonia coursing through the plumbing is used to cool the space. station's electronic equipment. There are eight of these power channels,. and all seven others were operating normally. 'We. may not have found exactly the smoking gun,' Cassidy said, 'but to pull. off what this team did yesterday and today, working practically 48. straight hours, it was a remarkable effort on everybody's behalf.' NASA. officials remain mystified as to why the leak erupted. Ammonia already. had been seeping ever so slightly from the location, but the flow. increased dramatically Thursday. Montalbano. did not know, as of Saturday evening, how much ammonia was lost. Another spacewalk will be needed to replenish the supply. With. the repair work behind them, the astronauts and ground controllers. turned their attention to the impending departure of three of the six. crewmen. Marshburn. has been on the space station since December and is set to return to. Earth late Monday, along with Hadfield, a Canadian, and Russian Roman. Romanenko. Cassidy is a new arrival, on board for just 1 1/2 months. By coincidence, the two Americans performed a spacewalk at this troublesome spot before, during a shuttle visit in 2009. 'This. type of event is what the years of training were for,' Hadfield said in. a tweet Friday. 'A happy, busy crew, working hard, loving life in. space.'

Answer the following question: In a race with national implications, Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory in a very close special congressional election held Tuesday in Pennsylvania. Officially, the race has not been called for Lamb, who holds a lead of 627 votes over Republican candidate Rick Saccone, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump. It’s possible Saccone and his supporters may request a recount, given the close vote. Even though Lamb’s apparent victory is narrow, the Pennsylvania result could broaden implications for Republicans looking to defend their congressional majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November midterm elections. Lamb ran surprisingly strong in a district that Trump carried by nearly 20 points, campaigning as a moderate Democrat. “We fought to find common ground, and we found it, almost everywhere. Democrats, Republicans, independents — each of us, Americans,” Lamb told supporters early Wednesday. Saccone was not ready to concede the race. “We are going to fight all the way to the end. You know I never give up.” The Pennsylvania race follows Democratic victories late last year in Virginia and Alabama, fueled in large part by what some analysts see as an anti-Trump theme that continues to build. “The opposition to Donald Trump is as intense as I have seen since the last year of [Richard] Nixon’s presidency,\\" said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato via Skype. “It is so intense, it is so hot, that it could result in a much bigger turnover than we think in the midterm elections to the Democrats and away from the Republicans.” Saccone cast himself as the president’s “wingman,” and Trump campaigned on his behalf at a rally last Saturday when Trump urged Republicans to get out and vote. “We want to keep the agenda, the make America great, going. You have got to get him in. This is a very important race,” Trump said. Democrats were thrilled with the result, while some Republicans saw the race as a “wake-up” call for what could be a devastating midterm in November. According to the above context, answer the following question. How long has Donald Trump probably been in politics? Answer:","output":"Donald Trump has probably been in politics since June 2015, when he announced his candidacy for the President of the United States.

Answer the following question: Question: what is a lapping machine I found the following answer on Google: This can take two forms. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, that answer does not provide a clear or detailed explanation of what a lapping machine is. A lapping machine is a precision finishing device used in various industries for the purpose of smoothing, polishing, or achieving the required surface finish on a workpiece. It functions by rubbing two surfaces together with an abrasive material between them. This process helps to achieve a high level of surface accuracy and to remove burrs, surface irregularities, and other defects. Lapping machines typically consist of a lapping plate, which is either flat or cylindrical, and various fixtures to hold the workpiece in place. The abrasive material, also known as a lapping compound, is a loose mixture of various grain sizes, suspended in a liquid medium like water or oil. Lapping machines are used in industries such as aerospace, automotive, electronics, and precision manufacturing for refining and finishing critical components, including fuel injection nozzles, mechanical seals, valve seats, and optical lens elements, among others. The lapping process can be carried out using machines with manual control or through automated machines with computer numerical control (CNC) for better precision and efficiency."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a hypothesis: The falls are one of the largest in Japan. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the information provided in the premise, it is not possible to conclude with certainty that the hypothesis is true. It is important to consider that the premise and hypothesis are two distinct statements, and there is no direct correlation between the two that proves the hypothesis true if the premise is true. In the premise, it is mentioned that the Shiraito Falls are located due south of Motosu-ko and are a great location for a picnic. However, this information does not offer any insight into the size of the falls or their ranking among the largest waterfalls in Japan. Furthermore, the hypothesis asserts that the Shiraito Falls are one of the largest waterfalls in Japan. To validate this claim, one would need additional information regarding the size and ranking of waterfalls in Japan, including the width, height, volume, and any other relevant factors that contribute to their size or popularity. Comparing these factors against those of the Shiraito Falls could potentially verify the hypothesis. In conclusion, without any additional information linking the two statements or validating the hypothesis separately, it is not possible to establish that if the premise is true, the hypothesis is also true. To confirm the hypothesis, one must gather more information about the size and ranking of waterfalls in Japan and directly compare them with the Shiraito Falls."},{"instruction":"Question: David is an entomologist. He recently got interested in ants and their behaviors. To that end, he studied a group of ants, which be labeled as case A. To compare ants with other ant like creatures he studied another hymenopteran group, which he labeled as case B. Moreover, he noticed two distinct trails made by the ants, trail A or trail B. Trail A was followed by many ants, but trail B was abandoned by them.  Would case B show less or more developed pheromone chemical signal than case A?  Hint: Ants communicate with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use \\"propaganda pheromones\\" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to...

Solve -41 - 31 = -12*b for b.","output":"To solve the equation -41 - 31 = -12*b for b, you should follow these steps: 1. First, simplify the left side of the equation so that it becomes easier to deal with. The operation -41 - 31 equals -72, therefore the equation becomes -72 = -12*b. 2. Next, you want to isolate 'b'. To do this, you have to divide both sides of the equation by -12.  3. When you divide -72 by -12, the result is 6. And on the right side of the equation, -12b divided by -12 just leaves b. Therefore, the solution to the equation becomes b = 6.  The reason we divide both sides of the equation by the same number is to keep the equation balanced, while allowing us to isolate the variable. This gives us the solution. Now we can substitute b = 6 into the original equation to check if it holds true: -41 - 31 = -12*6 => -72 = -72  which is True. Therefore, b = 6 is the correct solution to this equation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

What is the best way to: How to keep bread from going off?","output":"To determine the best way to keep bread from going off, I will consider various storage methods and factors that affect bread's freshness. Step 1: Understand the factors causing the bread to go off There are a few factors that cause bread to spoil or become stale: - Exposure to air causing the bread to dry out - High humidity, promoting mold growth - Temperature: too much heat may speed up the staling process, whereas too much cold may affect the bread's texture Step 2: Consider various storage methods for bread There are several methods for storing bread to keep it fresh: - In a bread box or container - In a plastic bag or wrap - In a paper bag - In a cool and dry place - In the refrigerator - In the freezer Step 3: Evaluate the pros and cons of each storage method - Bread box/container: It provides an environment with reduced airflow, slowing down mold growth. However, it may still be prone to drying out or staling if not properly sealed. - Plastic bag/wrap: It helps retain the moisture, but increases the potential for mold growth.  - Paper bag: It allows the bread to \\"breathe\\" and can prevent mold, but the bread might still dry out quickly. - Cool and dry place: It prevents mold growth, but the bread will still be exposed to air, causing it to stale or dry out. - Refrigerator: While it can slow down mold growth, refrigeration can actually cause bread to stale faster due to a process called \\"retrogradation.\\" - Freezer: Freezing bread prevents mold growth and staling, but the bread has to be thawed before use, which might not be as convenient. Step 4: Determine the best storage method Based on the evaluation, the freezer seems to provide the best solution for keeping bread fresh for a longer period of time without promoting mold growth or staling. However, the bread will require thawing before consumption. Step 5: Implement the best storage method To store bread in the freezer: 1. Slice the bread if it is not already sliced. 2. Wrap the bread tightly in plastic wrap or a freezer-safe plastic bag to minimize air exposure. 3. Place the wrapped bread in a resealable freezer-safe plastic bag. 4. Label the bag with the bread type and date of storage. 5. Put the bag in the freezer, and store the bread up to three months. To use the frozen bread, remove the desired number of slices, and allow them to thaw at room temperature for about 30 minutes or gently toast them in a toaster or oven. By following these steps, you can keep bread from going off for a longer period and enjoy its freshness whenever desired."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

But the possibility existed that BP would be required to open it in the event of a storm and the evacuation of underwater robots and other equipment that are keeping a close watch for any new leaks. Allen said that after days of consultations and careful monitoring, federal scientists were confident enough in their knowledge of the surrounding seabed to leave the well sealed and will no longer require BP to get daily extensions for the seal. “What we’re slowly doing is understanding the neighborhood, creating a 3-D model of the neighborhood,” Allen said. with winds exceeding 39 mph is expected to reach the vicinity of the well site 50 miles off the Louisiana coast early Saturday, possibly forcing evacuation of the fleet of response and drilling vessels.

In this dialogue, it's been stated that there seems to have been a misunderstanding between Betty and her friend Susan about the place and timing of their meet-up for a shopping trip. Betty claimed to have specified a meet-up time at 2 o'clock at the east entrance, but Susan misunderstood it as 2:30 at the main entrance. This miscommunication led to them losing valuable shopping time which resulted in them finally meeting at 3 o'clock in the women's clothing department by accident. Upon being asked what she had initially planned to buy, Betty corrected the man, saying that she had been seeking to buy a blouse, not a sweater as he suggested. However, due to the delayed meeting with her friend, the blouses which had been on sale were all sold out when she finally got a chance to browse the women's clothing department. Therefore, she had to make do with buying a skirt instead. So, while the skirt is what she finally purchased, Betty's initial intention was to buy a blouse."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Holst had formed the Purcell Singers, a small semi-professional choir, in October 1952, largely at the instigation of Pears. From 1954 the choir became regular performers at the Aldeburgh Festival, with programmes ranging from rarely heard medieval music to 20th-century works. Among choir members who later achieved individual distinction were the bass-baritone John Shirley-Quirk, the tenors Robert Tear and Philip Langridge, and the founder and conductor of the Heinrich Schütz Choir, Roger Norrington. Langridge remembered with particular pleasure a performance in Orford church of Thomas Tallis's forty-part motet Spem in alium, on 2 July 1963.   When she gave up the conductorship of the choir in 1967, much of its musical mission, in particular its commitment to early music, was assumed by other groups, such as Norrington's Schütz Choir and the Purcell Consort formed by the ex-Purcell Singers chorister Grayston Burgess.On 2 June 1967 Holst shared the podium with Britten in the concert inaugurating the Aldeburgh Festival's new home at the Snape Maltings. From 1972 Holst was involved with the development of educational classes at the Maltings, which began with weekend singing classes and developed into the Britten-Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies, with its own training orchestra. By this time Imogen's performances at the festival had become increasingly rare, but in 1975 she conducted a concert of Gustav Holst's brass band music, held outdoors at Framlingham Castle. A report of the event described an evening of \\"persistent drizzle ... until a diminutive figure in a special scarlet dress took the conductor's baton. The band was transformed, and played Holst's Suite as it has never been played before\\".Britten had been in poor health since undergoing heart surgery in 1973, and on 4 December 1976 he died.

He quickly became a favorite with child audiences, and shot to stardom after appearing in the first all-color all-talking musical comedy On with the Show (1929). He starred in a number of lavish Technicolor Warner Brothers musical comedies including: Sally (1929), Hold Everything (1930), Song of the West (1930), and Going Wild (1930). By 1931, Joe E. Brown had become such a star that his name was billed above the title in the films in which he appeared.  He appeared in Fireman, Save My Child (1932), a comedy in which he played a member of the St. Louis Cardinals, and in Elmer, the Great (1933) with Patricia Ellis and Claire Dodd and Alibi Ike (1935) with Olivia de Havilland, in both of which he portrayed ballplayers with the Chicago Cubs.  In 1933 he starred in Son of a Sailor with Jean Muir and Thelma Todd. In 1934, Brown starred in A Very Honorable Guy with Alice White and Robert Barrat, in The Circus Clown again with Patricia Ellis and with Dorothy Burgess, and with Maxine Doyle in Six-Day Bike Rider.  Brown was one of the few vaudeville comedians to appear in a Shakespeare film; he played Francis Flute in the Max Reinhardt/William Dieterle film version of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935) and was highly praised for his performance. He starred in Polo Joe (1936) with Carol Hughes and Richard \\"Skeets\\" Gallagher, and in Sons o' Guns. In 1933 and 1936, he became one of the top ten earners in films. He was sufficiently well known internationally by this point to be depicted in comic strips in the British comic Film Fun for twenty years from 1933.  He left Warner Brothers to work for producer David L. Loew, starring in When's Your Birthday? (1937). In 1938, he starred in The Gladiator, a loose film adaptation of Philip Gordon Wylie's 1930 novel Gladiator that influenced the creation of Superman. He gradually switched to making \\"B\\" pictures.

Burges inspired considerable loyalty within his team of assistants, and his partnerships were long-lived. John Starling Chapple was the office manager, joining Burges's practice in 1859. It was Chapple, designer of most of the furniture for Castell Coch, who completed its restoration after Burges's death. Second to Chapple was William Frame, who acted as clerk of works. Horatio Walter Lonsdale was Burges's chief artist, contributing extensive murals for both Castell Coch and Cardiff Castle. His main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls who started with Burges at Cork, completing hundreds of figures for Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, worked with him on his two major churches in Yorkshire, and undertook all of the original carving for the Animal Wall at Cardiff.William Gualbert Saunders joined the Buckingham Street team in 1865 and worked with Burges on the development of the design and techniques of stained-glass manufacture, producing much of the best glass for Saint Fin Barre's. Ceccardo Egidio Fucigna was another long-time collaborator who sculpted the Madonna and Child above the drawbridge at Castell Coch, the figure of St John over the mantelpiece in Lord Bute's bedroom at Cardiff Castle and the bronze Madonna in the roof garden. Lastly, there was Axel Haig, a Swedish-born illustrator, who prepared many of the watercolour perspectives with which Burges entranced his clients. Crook calls them \\"a group of talented men, moulded in their master's image, art-architects and medievalists to a man – jokers and jesters too – devoted above all to art rather than to business.\\" Answer:","output":"The name of the person whose main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls is not explicitly mentioned in the provided article. However, considering the context and the projects that Thomas Nicholls worked on, it can be inferred that the person in question is likely William Burges. Burges was an architect who inspired loyalty within his team of assistants, and Thomas Nicholls worked with him on several major projects, such as Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, churches in Yorkshire, and the Animal Wall at Cardiff."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Help as much as you can. Question: Barry and Will are two geologists. Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor. Will is specialized in montology.  Which person learned more about the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean?  Hint: As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13  cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Answer:","output":"Barry learned more about the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. His specialization in subduction zones and new seafloor is directly related to the processes occurring in the Ring of Fire, such as the subduction of oceanic crust along plate boundaries, which leads to volcanic activity. Will's specialization in montology, the study of mountains, is less directly related to the complex geological processes taking place in the Ring of Fire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To successfully complete his mission, the spy had to carefully devise a plan which involved multiple steps. Step 1: Gather intelligence on the facility Before making any moves, the spy had to gather as much information as possible about the facility. This included identifying the layout, security measures, and employee routines. By doing so, the spy could pinpoint the location of the note and prepare for possible obstacles. Step 2: Infiltrate the facility After acquiring a thorough understanding of the facility, the spy had to find an inconspicuous way to enter. Opting for a disguise, the spy posed as a maintenance worker to bypass initial security and gain access to restricted areas. Step 3: Reach the note's location With the disguise in place, the spy redirected the attention of the guards to create a clear path to the note’s location. This involved tampering with security systems, such as disabling CCTV cameras, to ensure that any suspicious activity went unnoticed. Step 4: Retrieve the paper Once at the note's location, the spy used advanced lock-picking skills to access the room where the paper was stored. The spy quickly grabbed the paper and concealed it in their tool bag, making sure not to leave any traces behind. Step 5: Attempt to acquire the note While obtaining the paper went smoothly, the note proved to be more challenging. It was stored in a highly secure vault, guarded by both heavy surveillance and reinforced doors. With the limited time the spy had before arousing suspicion, they made the difficult decision to abandon the quest for the note. Step 6: Exfiltrate the facility The spy knew that escaping with the paper was crucial, and any further effort towards acquiring the note would jeopardize the mission. Therefore, the spy carefully retraced their steps and left the facility, using their disguise to blend in with the exiting employees. Step 7: Deliver the paper to headquarters After successfully leaving the facility, the spy covertly handed over the retrieved paper to their handler. Although the note was not recovered, the information on the paper served as valuable intelligence that contributed to the overall success of the mission. In conclusion, the spy's resourcefulness, adaptability, and strategic thinking allowed them to retrieve crucial information despite facing numerous challenges.

If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli .  Story: There are two cells inside a Petri dish in a laboratory, cell X and cell Z. These cells are from the same organism, but have different characteristics.

The image may be life size or not, the scale is often shown, and may show the habit and habitat of the plant, the upper and reverse sides of leaves, and details of flowers, bud, seed and root system.  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - Ulster (or \\"Cúige Uladh\\" , Ulster Scots: \\"Ulstèr\\" or \\"Ulster\\") is a province in the north of the island of Ireland. In ancient Ireland, it was one of the fifths ruled by a \\"rí ruirech\\", or \\"king of over-kings\\".  - Botanical illustration is the art of depicting the form, colour, and details of plant species, frequently in watercolour paintings. They must be scientifically accurate but often also have an artistic component and may be printed with a botanical description in book, magazines, and other media or sold as a work of art. Often composed in consultation with a scientific author, their creation requires an understanding of plant morphology and access to specimens and references.   - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth.  - The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago.  - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.

Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: How often do you go on holiday? Going on holiday makes you feel good while you're there-you gain the health benefits for months, new research shows. Jetting off to exotic destinations such as the Maldives cuts your blood pressure, helps you sleep better and bounce back from stress, it found. The benefits last at least a fortnight longer than the vacation and can be felt for months in some cases where it is claimed. Experts say workers should always take their full holiday entitlement each year-as many as one in three don't-to get the benefits. The study compared key health markers in holidaymakers visiting Thailand, Peru or the Maldives, with people who stayed at home and continued working. The average blood pressure of those on holiday dropped by 6% while the workers saw their blood pressure rise by 2% over the same period. The sleep quality of holiday-makers improved by 17% while that of the non-holidaymakers _ by 14%. The study also found the ability of vacationers to recover from stress--known as the stress-resilience test-improved by 29%. There was a 71% fall in stress resilience scores among workers. Test showed a fall in blood glucose levels, reducing the risk of diabetes, trimmer waistlines and enhanced mood and energy levels, with the effects sustained for at least 2 weeks after returning home. The Holiday Health Experiment was conducted by tour operator Kuoni and Nuffield Health, the UK's largest healthcare charity. Question: Which of the following can we infer from the passage? Options: A: Holiday makers are more adaptable than non-holidaymakers. B: The result of the study is mostly based on the description from the people involved. C: The further you go, the better you benefit. D: Most people like to stay at home during the holiday. The answer is:","output":"A: Holiday makers are more adaptable than non-holidaymakers.

Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: Who was defeated at the Battle of Megalopolis? is inside the article: Alexander perhaps undercut his own rule by demonstrating signs of megalomania. While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331 BC. His attempt in 327 BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of proskynesis borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana (near modern Hamadan, Iran) in 330 BC, this was \\"symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people\\", according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328 BC is described as \\"vengeful and reckless\\" by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of Darius III, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324 BC.Meanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice (perhaps by order of Alexander) of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian..., can you guess it ?

My family has been loyal to DeFalco's since its Phoenix inception back in 1972.  For me, this is home away from home.  Stepping in to DeFalco's takes me back to the days where we'd spend all day in Grandma's kitchen preparing for Sunday family dinner.  Preparing everything from homemade sauce, meatballs, chicken parmesan, and almond biscotti to name a few.   DeFalco's offers an extensive menu (both for takeout and dine-in), and although I venture here 2-3 times per week I remain loyal to a few selections on their menu.  If you are feeling like a sandwich I urge you to order the homemade Meatball Sandwich on the crispy baguette - or - if you're feeling like chicken then I must recommend you try the Chicken Pesto Sandwich (again, on the crispy baguette).  I'm a hot/toasted sandwich type of girl so I can't speak for the cold sandwiches, but I can assure you won't be disappointed with any selection given that all their breads are delivered fresh daily, meats and cheeses are sliced to order in house, and their toppings are fresh to boot!  To complete my go-to list I also recommend trying the Chicken Pesto Salad and a few side salads including the tuna pasta salad (BEST EVER), the chicken caesar pasta salad, pesto pasta salad, and....the tomato and basil salad (of course you must drizzle a little evoo and balsamic to make it truly Italian). They also offer many pasta dishes, pizza/calzones, soups & sides, salads and desserts, oh my, and nothing will leave you disappointed or starving for more since their portions are generous in size (it's an Italian thing)!!    And not only does DeFalco's do Italian favorites just right, but their store is also stocked with Italian specialty foods for purchase (hint grocery in the name), and many wonderful and rare wine selections only to be found in their store.    My Sunday dinner now belongs to DeFalco's as it makes me feel like I'm back at Grandma's place.  Heck, you can sip on some vino while you await your lunch or dinner to be served in the dining room or outside on the terrace!

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? spirited film  Pick your answer from: (a). negative; (b). positive;","output":"(b). positive The sentiment of the sentence \\"spirited film\\" is positive. The term \\"spirited\\" when used to describe a movie or film generally implies a sense of liveliness, energy, enthusiasm, or vivacity. It usually means that the film is full of heart or passion that it manages to convey through its storytelling, acting, direction, cinematography, and other elements. Typically, this would refer to a film that is engaging, dynamic, uplifting, or inspirational in some way. Therefore, the sentiment is certainly positive as it implies a degree of enjoyment and appreciation. The phrase would most likely be used as praise by a reviewer or audience member, in both informal conversation or formal critique. In evaluating sentiment, we are looking at the tone or mood conveyed by the language used. Sentiment may be positive, negative, or neutral. Positive sentiment indicates a favorable or optimistic view of the subject in question. Negative sentiment, on the other hand, suggests an unfavorable or pessimistic view. Neutral sentiment indicates a lack of particularly strong feelings either way; the language used is neither strongly positive nor negative. In this case, the use of 'spirited' indicates a positive sentiment.  To further analyze this sentence, one must understand the role of adjectives and how they convey sentiment. The word \\"spirited\\" is an adjective that is being used to describe the noun \\"film\\". Adjectives in language are used to add characteristics or attributes to the noun, these can include emotions, qualities, amounts, size, condition, origin etc. The adjective used here express an emotional state - spirited being positive here. This notion of sentiment analysis plays a significant role in fields such as data mining, social media monitoring, brand management, and consumer reviews, where understanding public opinion or mood towards a particular item, product, or event is of utmost important. This forms a part of natural language processing, text analysis and computational linguistics, where an AI, like me, is trained to analyze human language, making it beneficial for these domains."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They encounter a crazy druggie who tells them that a small-time drug dealer named Frankie Tahoe wants to kill Vincent. Joshua and Mickey inform Vincent, and the trio intimidate a guy who works for Tahoe into telling them where he can be found.  They find Tahoe at a nightclub.

Liverpool’s penalty shootout win over Manchester City in New York will be little consolation for losing out in the Premier League title race on the final day of last season, but it gave some indication that Brendan Rodgers’s side are set to be contenders again. Both sides are expected to line up quite differently on August 17 and made a number of changes throughout Wednesday’s match, making it difficult to judge their pre-season progress. MailOnline looks at what we learned from the slug-out at Yankee Stadium …. Scroll down for videos. First blood: Liverpool defeated Manchester City on penalties in the International Champions Cup friendly. Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho impressed among the Liverpool starters and Raheem Sterling gave his side a much sharper attacking edge when he came on in the second half before scoring the late equaliser. It wasn’t the best of days again for Steven Gerrard whose latest slip let in Stevan Jovetic for City’s opening goal, but Rodgers has no doubt his skipper will be a key player in that deep-lying role again this season. ‘We were unfortunate with the first goal that deflected off Stevie and Jovetic got a toe on it,’ said the Liverpool boss. ‘But he’s been playing that role for the last 12 months and I’m sure he’ll play it this season as well. He’s got a wonderful range of pass, his movement is good to get on the ball and he’s very committed.’ Red leader: Steven Gerrard (C) is set to resume his deep lying position in midfield. Making up for lost time: Stevan Jovetic scored both of Manchester City's goals in normal time. It’s early days but already Jovetic looks determined to make up for lost time after an injury-hit first season at City. The Montenegro international scored twice to take his total to two in four games on tour, and will be as good as new signing 12 months after arriving from Fiorentina for £22m. Joe Hart made three fantastic saves after coming on at half-time even though he was outshone by Simon Mignolet in the shootout. The Liverpool keeper kept out Yaya Toure’s effort as the Ivorian made a subdued first appearance since threatening to quit the champions this summer. Liverpool changed formation and players so often it was hard to keep track. Rodgers may well settle for his midfield diamond again this season although it is clear he wants his side to be versatile as well. He said: ‘We played two different formations – a 4-4-2 diamond in the first half which refreshed the players from some of the work they had last season. At times we worked it well but it was good to see it. Second half it was more of a 4-3-3 and then we changed again with 20 minutes to 4-2-3-1. Multi-talented: Philippe Coutinho's versaility gave Liverpool plenty of options with formations. Double salvo: Jovetic scores City's second goal but could do nothing to prevent them losing on penalties. ‘We had a connection through Coutinho who played a lot from the sides and the top of the diamond. The last 20 minutes he played in behind Daniel Sturridge to connect midfield and the front men. That made passes shorter and the movement better.’ City lined up in more of a conventional 4-4-2 formation with Edin Dzeko and James Milner their first World Cup players to make an appearance in the US, although Manuel Pellegrini will probably revert to his favoured 4-2-3-1 once the season starts. It will be interesting to see how new £12m signing Fernando fits in with Toure and Fernandinho occupying those defensive midfield slots last season. City certainly have more in reserve with David Silva, Samir Nasri and Alvaro Negredo among the unused substitutes at Yankee Stadium. They are also waiting to welcome back captain Vincent Kompany, Fernandinho and World Cup finalists Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta and Martin Demichelis, who report back on Monday. Super sub: Raheem Sterling made an impression after coming off the bench at the Yankees Stadium. In the family: City goalkeeper Joe Hart embraces brothers Kolo and Yaya Toure at full-time. ‘The five players who arrived last Thursday, Hart, Milner, Yaya, Silva and Dzeko, I think that they will be ready for the Premier League,’ said Pellegrini. ‘We will with see the rest of the players who arrive next Monday. Can they be fit in 15 days? Maybe not all of them will do it.’ Sterling made the biggest impact of Liverpool’s substitutes, but Lucas Leiva supplied a sublime touch for Henderson to score their first goal and Mignolet emerged as the hero of the shootout. Both of the men in charge seemed happy enough with the evening’s exertions, if not the quality of parts of the playing surface. Coach Rodgers was delighted with the way his team twice fought back from a goal down. ‘Even though it was a pre-season game it was highly competitive,’ he said. ‘The players showed the character to keep going and come back. It was a really good game. We have to respect the quality we were playing against. City are a top side, one of the best teams in Europe.’ Coach trip: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (L) and Man City's Manuel Pellegrini (R) were generally pleased. Coach Pellegrini knows there is more to come from his squad but was satisfied with what he saw. ‘It was a very useful game for both teams,’ said the City boss. ‘We are trying to prepare our team in the best way. We’ve had a very good pre-season with part of the team. We had another five players playing some minutes today. The rest of the squad arrive next week we are preparing well for the Community Shield and Premier League.’ Liverpool still need to convince people that they can withstand the loss of Luis Suarez and re-establish themselves as title contenders this season. New signing Rickie Lambert wasted a gilt-edged chance in the first half and Daniel Sturridge was also subdued for long periods. Kolo Toure and Sebastian Coates started in central defence but some question if they can be trusted after defensive frailties cost Liverpool dear last season. Weak link: There were question marks over Kolo Toure's performance in central defence. City, meanwhile, need to complete the £32m signing of Eliaquim Mangala which has been dragging on since January. Despite signing Fernando, Bacary Sagna and Willy Caballero, a new centre-back was the priority and Mangala does not seem to be falling over himself to come to Manchester. Judging by the form of Kelechi Iheanacho on tour, City also need to sort out a work permit for the Nigerian teenager as soon as possible. Of the squad that turned up at Yankee Stadium, Scott Sinclair, Matija Nastasic, Micah Richards, Javi Garcia and Jack Rodwell could all be gone by the time the transfer window shuts. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1. Liverpool defeated Manchester City on penalties in the International Champions Cup friendly. 2.

A dark-haired woman (Harring) escapes her own murder, surviving a car accident on Mulholland Drive. Injured and in shock, she descends into Los Angeles and sneaks into an apartment that an older, red-headed woman has just vacated. An aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts) arrives at the same apartment and finds the dark-haired woman confused, not knowing her own name.

Iwasaki's careful respect for the Long Beach program and its lawyers earned him the political capital he needed to complete his takeover in a matter of weeks. \\"The Long Beach program had strong support in the community so in a situation like that, one has to recognize that it's not like a takeover where I have all the answers and I know best,\\" Iwasaki said. \\"The people in the community who are working there have the contacts and the knowledge that will allow service to continue.\\" Things have gone less smoothly across town. There, Dudovitz, a longtime poverty lawyer and executive director of the San Fernando Valley's 36-year-old legal aid program, continues to struggle with his hostile takeover of the neighboring San Gabriel-Pomona Valleys service area one year after it was accomplished. On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, 6.5 million last year. However, his clash with the old San Gabriel program resulted in litigation, bitter feelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused on serving poor people. \\"It was a difficult situation that was probably mishandled by everyone,\\" a longtime observer of the public interest community said of the San Fernando Valley-San Gabriel-Pomona Valley merger. \\"There are very few people who come out as the heroes. Personalities got involved when they shouldn't have. Things were said that caused bad feelings and couldn't be unsaid.\\" Iwasaki's merger with the smaller, 48-year-old Long Beach program was friendly and fast, and no one - not even Long Beach board members - lost a job. When it was over, Iwasaki had 1 million more in federal dollars and two new offices. Long Beach clients regained services they had lost years ago when federal budget cuts and dwindling grants reduced the staff of 15 lawyers to five and cut immigration and consumer law programs.

Background: Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell[1] and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils. Alkaline soils are basic, but not all basic soils are alkaline.  Paragraph: Two brothers have a piece of land each, situated 2 miles from each other. Jim's land is not very fertile because it has clay soil with a high pH, while Bob's land has very fertile soil and has a good productivity on it.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which of the two pieces of land has a high filtration capacity? A:","output":"Jim's land B: Bob's land Based on the provided information, Jim's land has clay soil with a high pH, which indicates that it is an alkali (or alkaline) soil.

Chris repeatedly tries to convince the bank's manager, Mr Tuttle, to allow him to apply for a teller job, to no avail. Chris soon comes under the scrutiny of a gang planning to rob the bank. Their leader, Gary, who knew Chris from high school and resented his wealth and popularity as a hockey star before his accident, befriends him and uses a young woman, Luvlee Lemons, to seduce him.

How do you do this: How to store some chips you've already opened?","output":"Storing opened chips properly is essential for keeping them fresh, crisp, and tasty for as long as possible. Here are several methods and tips for storing your opened chips: Method 1: Using a chip clip or a clothespin 1. Roll down the top: Once you have opened the bag of chips, consume the desired amount and shake any remaining crumbs down to the bottom. 2. Press the air out: Gently press the top of the bag to push out the excess air while being careful not to crush the chips. 3. Roll the top: Roll the top of the bag down tightly to create a good seal. It is essential to minimize contact with air to prevent the chips from going stale. 4. Secure the top: Use a chip clip or a clothespin to secure the top of the bag, ensuring that no air can enter. Method 2: Plastic storage container or zipper bags 1. Choose the right container: Select an airtight plastic container or a resealable zipper bag that can comfortably accommodate the quantity of chips you have remaining. A tight seal is vital to preserve freshness. 2. Transfer the chips: Carefully pour or place the chips into the chosen container. Seal the container or zipper bag. 3. Store the container: Place the container in a dry, cool place, such as a cupboard or pantry to preserve taste and protect from sunlight and heat. Method 3: Using a rubber band 1. Prepare the bag: After consuming the desired amount of chips and shaking the crumbs down, gently press the air out of the bag. 2. Roll and twist the top: Roll the top of the bag down a bit and then twist the top to create a makeshift seal. 3. Secure with a rubber band: Wrap a rubber band tightly around the twisted top of the bag, ensuring that it grips and holds the twist in place. Method 4: Using airtight glass jars 1. Choose an appropriately sized jar: Find a glass jar with an airtight seal and wide opening to accommodate the remaining chips. 2. Transfer the chips: Carefully place or pour the chips into the jar with minimal crushing. 3. Seal and store: Close the lid tightly to preserve the chips' freshness and store the jar in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Method 5: The water displacement method (great for camping) 1. Prepare a large zipper bag: Pour the remaining chips into a large resealable zipper bag. 2. Submerge the bag partially in water: With the bag's top open, submerge it gently into a container of water, just enough to displace the air inside but not allowing any water to enter the bag. 3. Seal the bag: As you reach the end of the submersion, seal the bag tightly to trap the air out of it. The water's pressure should have forced out the remaining air. Whichever method you choose, make sure to consume the opened chips within about 1-2 weeks to enjoy their freshness and taste fully. Remember not to expose the stored chips to direct sunlight, heat, or humid environments, as these factors will compromise their quality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kings, princes and, beginning in 1295, Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red costumes. When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper. Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light. Soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across France, England and Germany. In Medieval painting red was used to attract attention to the most important figures; both Christ and the Virgin Mary were commonly painted wearing red mantles.\\"? A:","output":"Question: Which figures in medieval paintings were often depicted wearing red mantles, and how does the use of red in these paintings and other historical contexts symbolize authority and importance? The passage highlights the significance of the color red throughout history, particularly in the context of authority figures and religious settings. In Western Europe, Emperor Charlemagne chose red for his palace and shoes during his coronation as a symbol of his authority. This association with royalty continued as kings, princes, and eventually Roman Catholic cardinals began wearing red costumes. Abbe Suger's rebuilding of Saint Denis Basilica introduced stained glass windows featuring red glass tinted with copper, which imbued the space with a mystical light. The incorporation of these windows extended to other cathedrals across France, England, and Germany.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was arrested for hurling a glass at The Damned that shattered and blinded a girl in one eye, and served time in a remand centre? from the following article ?  Pogoing aside, Vicious had been involved in a notorious incident during that memorable second night of the 100 Club Punk Special. Arrested for hurling a glass at The Damned that shattered and blinded a girl in one eye, he had served time in a remand centre—and contributed to the 100 Club banning all punk bands. At a previous 100 Club gig, he had assaulted Nick Kent with a bicycle chain. Indeed, McLaren's NME telegram said that Vicious's \\"best credential was he gave Nick Kent what he deserved many months ago at the Hundred Club\\". According to a later description by McLaren, \\"When Sid joined he couldn't play guitar but his craziness fit into the structure of the band. He was the knight in shining armour with a giant fist.\\" \\"Everyone agreed he had the look,\\" Lydon later recalled, but musical skill was another matter. \\"The first rehearsals...in March of 1977 with Sid were hellish.... Sid really tried hard and rehearsed a lot\\". Marco Pirroni, who had performed with Vicious in Siouxsie and the Banshees, has said, \\"After that, it was nothing to do with music anymore. It would just be for the sensationalism and scandal of it all. Then it became the Malcolm McLaren story\\".Membership in the Sex Pistols had a progressively destructive effect on Vicious. As Lydon later observed, \\"Up to that time, Sid was absolutely childlike. Everything was fun and giggly. Suddenly he was a big pop star. Pop star status meant press, a good chance to be spotted in all the right places, adoration.

Early in 1977, he met Nancy Spungen, an emotionally disturbed drug addict and sometime prostitute from New York.

FBI investigating 'suspicious' death aboard Royal Caribbean cruise BALTIMORE – An FBI spokesman said Tuesday the death of an American woman aboard a Royal Caribbean cruise ship has been classified as suspicious. The 64-year-old Virginia woman was found dead Sunday inside her cabin aboard the Enchantment of the Seas, The Baltimore Sun reported. The company said her husband found her dead. The FBI did not release the names of the woman or her husband Tuesday, citing their investigation into the cause of death, according to the Sun. The woman was on a six-night, seven-day cruise to Florida and the Bahamas that left Baltimore March 18. FBI Baltimore field office spokesman Rich Wolf said agents boarded the ship Monday after it returned to Baltimore as scheduled. He says an autopsy is being conducted to determine the cause and manner of death. \\"The ship was working with us the whole way,\\" Wolf told the paper, adding that agents are interviewing the unidentified woman's husband. He declined to say whether the woman suffered any trauma. Maryland Port Administration spokesman Richard Scher told the Sun that the FBI completed its interviews after the ship's 2,409 passengers disembarked in Baltimore on Monday. In a statement released to the paper, Royal Caribbean said a member of its \\"Care Team\\" was providing support and assistance to the woman's family. \\"We extend our most sincere and heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of the 64-year-old female guest from the United States who died while onboard Enchantment of the Seas,\\" the statement said.

Given the question: Information:  - The Amstrad CPC (short for \\"Colour Personal Computer\\") is a series of 8-bit home computers produced by Amstrad between 1984 and 1990. It was designed to compete in the mid-1980s home computer market dominated by the Commodore 64 and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, where it successfully established itself primarily in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and the German-speaking parts of Europe.  - The Sabreman series of games was released by Ultimate Play the Game for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum in the 1980s. Some of the installments were also released on other popular home microcomputers, namely the Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, Commodore 64 and MSX. The series stars Sabreman, who is depicted wearing khakis and a pith helmet.  - Knight Lore is a 1984 action - adventure game by Ultimate Play the Game known for popularising isometric graphics in video games . It was written by company founders Chris and Tim Stamper in their Sabreman series . In Knight Lore , the player - character Sabreman has forty days to collect objects throughout a castle and brew a cure to his werewolf curse . Each castle room is depicted in monochrome on its own screen and consists of blocks to climb , obstacles to avoid , and puzzles to solve . The game used a novel image masking technique , copyrighted as \`\` Filmation '' , in which images , such as the main character , could overlap other images without visual collision . This created the illusion of depth priority in on - screen images , which the computer hardware did not naturally support . Knight Lore was released third in the Sabreman series despite being the first completed . Ultimate anticipated Knight Lore to change the market and chose to withhold its release to protect the sales of its upcoming Sabre Wulf and to preempt Knight Lore clones by releasing a second Filmation game . Ultimate released Knight Lore shortly after its first two Sabreman titles in November 1984 for the ZX Spectrum . Ports followed for the BBC Micro , Amstrad CPC , MSX , and Famicom Disk System .

Is The mosaic was probably created in 565/6. a good answer to this question? Choose from: (A). yes (B). no","output":"(B). no The answer, \\"The mosaic was probably created in 565/6,\\" is not a good answer to the question, \\"Why have wall mosaics generally not survived in the region?\\" The reason it's not a good answer is because it doesn't address the factors that may have contributed to the poor preservation of wall mosaics in the region. A detailed explanation should be provided to answer the question thoroughly. Wall mosaics are an essential form of artistic expression that have been used in various architectural structures like churches, palaces, and public buildings since ancient times. Despite their historical significance and beauty, many wall mosaics have not survived in some regions. In order to provide a detailed answer to why wall mosaics generally have not survived in a certain region, it's essential to explore various factors that may have contributed to their deterioration or disappearance. These factors could include natural disasters, political conflicts, environmental factors, and socio-cultural influences. 1. Natural disasters: Earthquakes, floods, and fires may have caused the destruction of many wall mosaics. These natural disasters can compromise the structural integrity of the buildings, leading to the collapse of walls or the complete destruction of the structure, which would inevitably result in the loss of the mosaics. 2. Political conflicts: War and other political conflicts in the region may have led to the intentional or collateral damage to the buildings containing wall mosaics. In some cases, cultural artifacts like mosaics may have been intentionally destroyed as a symbolic act of victory or defiance during the conflict. 3. Environmental factors: Over time, environmental factors such as climate, humidity, and exposure to sunlight can contribute to the deterioration of wall mosaics. Materials used in the creation of these artworks, like stones, brick, and mortar, might become compromised due to continuous exposure to the elements. 4. Socio-cultural influences: Changes in societal values and beliefs may contribute to the neglect or destruction of wall mosaics. This could be due to an intentional rejection of the cultural or religious significance of the mosaics or simply due to a lack of appreciation for the art form. 5. Poor preservation efforts: In some cases, the local communities or authorities may not have had the necessary resources or knowledge to maintain the wall mosaics effectively. Poor preservation practices may lead to the degradation of these artworks over time. In conclusion, the survival of wall mosaics in a specific region can be influenced by several factors, including natural disasters, political conflicts, environmental factors, socio-cultural influences, and preservation efforts. To answer the question of why wall mosaics generally have not survived in a certain region, it is essential to assess these factors and provide a comprehensive explanation of their impact on the preservation of wall mosaics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For all that's been written about the show, there don't seem to be many stories from the set. Have a favorite anecdote?      Will Arnett: We were shooting Season 2, and Liza Minnelli had been sued by her bodyguard and/or driver for sexual harassment. He was suing her for 100 million. I have no idea what became of that. But we were shooting, and she was there for a wardrobe fitting or whatever. Nobody knew Liza was even on-set. We were rolling. And she walked through the kitchen door, took center stage, put her hands out, and said, \\"Am I really that bad?\\" Meaning, \\"Was sex with me that bad that you had to sue me for 100 million?\\" It was so disarming.      DETAILS: Your character, Gob, is famous for his ridiculous chicken dance. Do people ask you to do it?      Will Arnett: Nonstop. I've been asked on the subway in New York, I've been asked in England. I did it once publicly—at an auction benefiting a hospital. It was for a good cause. But I don't do it. If you're reading this, don't ask me on the street to do it.      DETAILS: You and Jason Bateman run a digital-marketing firm, Dumbdumb, that makes comedic shorts for brands like Subaru and Old Navy. Were you afraid people would say you sold out?      Will Arnett: I think people would have said that five or ten years ago. Now everyone understands the economics of it. I don't care if you're in the coolest movie or on the coolest TV show—guys who are way too cool for school aren't paying the rent. Guys like Jason and me, we have families.      DETAILS: You didn't become successful until you were in your thirties. Were you jealous of people whose careers had taken off earlier?      Will Arnett: I never really spent time being jealous. Maybe I should have. I'd handicapped myself. Back then I was partying. Maybe I would have gotten more jobs if I didn't look so hungover all the time. I lived in a string of shitty apartments in New York. I had a futon on the floor—not even a frame—that I'd roll up during the day. I had a lot of dreams—I wanted to be taken seriously, and I had something important to say. I said, \\"I'll never read for TV!\\" Those are the trappings of youth. As you get older, you take yourself less seriously. That, I think, is actually the freedom of age.      DETAILS: You're sober now. What was the turning point?      Will Arnett: Every day at 5 o'clock, I'd go to Peter McManus on 19th and 7th. It's a classic Irish bar. For six years, I was there six nights a week. In the fall of '99, I did The Mike O'Malley Show for NBC. After two episodes, it was panned and it was canceled. I took it a lot harder than I thought. I had a lot of stuff going on in my life. I'd broken up with my then-girlfriend of many years. I proceeded to spend the next six to nine months on an unprecedented run. And by run, I mean downward spiral. A friend called me up, and she said, \\"What are you doing?\\" It was almost as simple as that.      DETAILS: You were raised in Toronto. Your dad, a Harvard graduate, was the head of Molson for a time. What did you learn from him?      Will Arnett: I remember asking my dad, \\"Why didn't you ever move to the States? You probably could have made a lot more money.\\" My dad said, \\"Because I have an obligation to give back.\\" I always admired him for that.      DETAILS: When you were 12, your parents sent you to boarding school. Had you done something wrong?      Will Arnett: I probably suffered from ADHD, but they weren't so quick to diagnose it back then. For PE, they'd drop you in the woods with a compass and a pack of matches. It gave you confidence that you could rely on yourself. ||||| There's a new budding summer romance in Hollywood.      E!

Options: - exercise - dehydration - breathing hard - sweat - trip and fall  Explain why a human would choose \\"sweat\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"Humans would choose \\"sweat\\" as the answer to the question \\"Running is a great workout, it really works up a what?\\" for several reasons, which can be understood by analyzing the physical aspects of running, as well as the purpose and process of sweating. Running is a form of aerobic exercise that engages multiple muscle groups and demands a lot of energy from the body. When a person runs, their heart rate increases, and the body works harder in order to provide the necessary oxygen and nutrients to the working muscles. The muscles generate heat as they utilize energy to maintain the running motion. Sweating is a natural process that helps the body regulate its temperature. When the body's temperature rises, the sweat glands produce sweat, which is a fluid composed primarily of water, salt, and other minerals. As the sweat evaporates from the skin surface, it cools down the body and helps maintain an optimal internal temperature. In the context of running, the human body experiences an increase in temperature due to the intense physical activity and the heat generated by working muscles. As a result, the body starts sweating to prevent overheating and maintain homeostasis. This means that sweat is a direct outcome of the vigorous nature of running, and thus is the most relevant answer to the question posed. The other options have their own explanations as to why they might not be the best answer: - Exercise: While running is indeed an exercise, the question specifically asks what running \\"works up.\\" Running is already the exercise, so it doesn't \\"work up\\" exercise. - Dehydration: Although running can lead to dehydration if one does not stay properly hydrated, dehydration is not an inevitable outcome of running. It is a potential result of not properly replenishing fluids lost through sweat, but it's not the only possible outcome. - Breathing hard: Running can definitely result in heavy breathing due to the increased oxygen demands of the body. However, the primary focus of the question is what running \\"works up,\\" and sweating is a more direct and universal result of running than heavy breathing. - Trip and fall: This option is not an inherent aspect of running. It's a possible risk or accident that can happen during running, but it's not something that running inherently \\"works up.\\" In conclusion, a human would choose \\"sweat\\" as the answer to the question because it is the most accurate representation of a natural response the body has to the act of running. Sweating is a direct result of increased heat production during running and helps regulate body temperature, making it the most suitable answer among the given options."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His girlfriend Karen (Christina Moore) comes up to him and quickly tells him she's pregnant, and before she can stop him, he announces to everybody that she is pregnant and proposes to her. She then tells him that it is not his baby.Meanwhile, Bill Little (Bill Engvall) is talking about marriage with his neighbor (Michael Papajohn). The neighbor points out that most marriages end in divorce, and Bill says that it takes a lot to make a marriage work, such as incriminating photos of him with a girl who was just a good listener and eager to please at the local nightclub.Elsewhere, a man opens up a storage shed to see the leotard-and-leopard-skirt (with a porn-star mustache) clad Everett (DJ Qualls) watching TV. He reprimands Everett for living here when he just works here and berates him for having been a cop for only four days.Sometime later, the three are getting set for their Monthly trip up to their deserted army recruitment camp; turns out these three are also army reservists and picking on Everett about his tendency to be trigger-happy is their form of entertainment.Meanwhile, on an army base somewhere, a Colonel gets a request for more troops for Fallujah and he pulls up the name of the base where the boys are staying and sends Sgt. Kilgore (Keith David) to assess the situation at the reserve base.Kilgore arrives there to find Bill and Larry eating chips and Everett out on a beer run.

The day they leave, Everett and Bill are both making calls, Everett to his boss and Bill to his wife Connie (Lisa Lampinelli), but they are dragged off to a hangar by Kilgore. Once they're all gathered, Kilgore appoints Larry squad leader and marches them onto the plane.The plane is... A:","output":"The three friends, Larry, Bill, and Everett, are members of the Army Reserve. They are also acquaintances outside of their military service, as shown by their interactions and shared experiences in both their civilian and military lives. The movie \\"Delta Farce\\" is a comedy centered around these three unlikely and unprepared reservists who are unexpectedly called up for active duty and find themselves in a series of ridiculous and humorous situations throughout the course of the film. The plot introduces various elements that add layers to each character's background and personality, such as Larry working as a diner waiter, dealing with an unexpected pregnancy announcement from his girlfriend Karen, and ultimately proposing to her. Bill, on the other hand, discusses the challenges of marriage with his neighbor, revealing some flaws and indiscretions in his own relationship. Meanwhile, Everett is reprimanded for living in a storage shed at his workplace and exposed to ridicule for his brief experience as a cop before joining the reserves. Their dynamic as friends is further explored during their monthly trips to their deserted army recruitment camp, which serves as a bonding opportunity for the trio as well as an outlet for them to engage in lighthearted teasing, particularly towards the trigger-happy Everett. The story takes a turn when a Colonel, needing more troops for Fallujah, decides to send Sgt. Kilgore to assess the situation at the reserve base where the three friends are stationed. Upon arriving, Kilgore is unimpressed with their lack of discipline and puts them through a rigorous training regimen. This ultimately results in their deployment, adding an additional layer of confusion and comedy as they struggle to adapt to their new circumstances and face the reality of serving in a wartime situation. Through their shared experiences, both in their civilian lives and the unexpected military deployment, Larry, Bill, and Everett develop a bond that not only highlights the importance of friendship and camaraderie but also serves as a source of humor and lightheartedness amid the harsh realities they face. In deciding whether or not to invest in this film proposal, it is essential to consider the potential appeal of the characters and storyline, the strength of the comedic elements, and the overall marketability of the film. Since the movie features a mix of relatable life challenges, military experiences, and humor, it may resonate with a wide range of audiences. However, factors such as cast, production quality, and how effectively the comedy translates to screen should also be taken into account when making your decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, there are slight differences in the context of each sentence: - Sentence 1 specifically mentions Cleveland's school voucher program. - Sentence 2 discusses an Ohio case, which, while closely related, does not explicitly mention Cleveland. Step 3: Evaluate if the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true.

The project was organized by World Circuit executive Nick Gold, produced by American guitarist Ry Cooder and directed by Juan de Marcos Gonzalez. They named the group after the homonymous members' club in the Buenavista quarter of Havana, a popular music venue in the 1940s. To showcase the popular styles of the time, such as son, bolero and danzon, they recruited a dozen veteran musicians, many of whom had been retired for years. Shortly after the Cuban Revolution of 1959, newly elected Cuban President Manuel Urrutia Lleo, a devout Christian, began a program of closing gambling outlets, nightclubs, and other establishments associated with Havana's hedonistic lifestyle. This had an immediate impact on the livelihoods of local entertainers. As the Cuban government rapidly shifted towards the left in an effort to build a \\"classless and colourblind society\\", it struggled to define policy toward forms of cultural expression in the black community; expressions which had implicitly emphasized cultural differences. Consequently, the cultural and social centers were abolished, including the Afro-Cuban mutual aid Sociedades de Color in 1962, to make way for racially integrated societies. Private festivities were limited to weekend parties and organizers' funds were confiscated. The measures meant the closure of the Buena Vista Social Club. Although the Cuban government continued to support traditional music after the revolution, certain favor was given to the politically charged nueva trova, and poetic singer-songwriters such as Silvio Rodriguez and Pablo Milanes. The emergence of pop music and salsa, a style derived from Cuban music but developed in the United States, meant that son music became even less common.  Cuban music experienced quite a radical change in the 1960s, as National Geographic notes:  Cuban dance music also witnessed dramatic change beginning in the late 1960s, as groups explored the fusion of Cuban son with American rock, jazz and funk styles. Groups such as Los Van Van and Irakere established modern forms of Cuban music, paving the way for new rhythms and dances to emerge as well as fresh concepts in instrumentation. ... Cuba's dance music had already inspired a change from the older son-style dances, as younger Cubans broke free of step-oriented dances...  The occurrence of these closures and the change in traditions is the simplest explanation of why many musicians were out of work, and why their style of music had declined before the Buena Vista Social Club made it popular again.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was the program to close these establishments successful?","output":"The provided text does not contain any direct quote or information about the success of the program to close these establishments.

Victim in the family: Matt Sandusky was preparing to testify against his adopted father during the child sex abuse trial. Jerry Sandusky's own adopted son has dramatically accused him of abuse as a jury deliberates over scores of sex abuse charges against the former Penn State coach. A lawyer for Matt Sandusky said the man told authorities that the former Penn State assistant football coach abused him. Matt Sandusky is one of Jerry Sandusky's six adopted children. His lawyers, Andrew Shubin and Justine Andronici, issued a statement on Thursday naming Matt Sandusky and saying that the 33-year-old had been prepared to testify on behalf of prosecutors at his father's sex abuse trial. The statement says Matt Sandusky is 'a victim of Jerry Sandusky's abuse,' but doesn't go into specifics. NBC News reported that Matt Sandusky was to take the stand as a 'rebuttal witness' if Jerry Sandusky testified. Jerry Sandusky's defence team ultimately decided the 68-year-old former coach wouldn't speak in his own defence. Matt Sandusky's attorney's told the network: 'This has been an extremely painful experience for Matt and he has asked us to convey his request that the media respect his privacy,' they said. The statement came after jurors began deliberating 48 charges against the ex-coach. Prosecutors say Sandusky met the 10 sex-abuse victims through his charity, The Second Mile, which he established in 1977. Lawyers for Matt and Jerry Sandusky and. prosecutors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Matt. Sandusky's lawyer says his client met with investigators very recently. Scroll down for video. New allegation: One of Jerry Sandusky's six adopted sons, Matt, has come forward through an attorney, saying that the ex-coach abused him too. Spouse: Jerry Sandusky and his wife Dottie, pictured Thursday outside the courthouse, were married in 1966, and have no biological children, but they adopted six times. Matt Sandusky went to live with Sandusky and his wife, Dottie, as a foster child and was adopted by them as an adult. Shortly after Sandusky's arrest in November, Matt Sandusky's ex-wife Jill Jones successfully obtained a restraining order forbidding the children from sleeping at their grandparents' home. At about the same time, details emerged that Matt Sandusky had attempted suicide just four months after first going to live with Jerry and Dottie Sandusky in 1995. He had come into the home through The Second Mile charity, and was first a foster child before being legally adopted. His name also came up last week during the testimony of one of Sandusky's 10 accusers. The man, dubbed Victim 4 by prosecutors, said Matt Sandusky was living at the Sandusky home on an occasion when he had stayed there overnight. When asked by prosecutors whether Jerry Sandusky ever engaged him in a soap battle in the showers, he recounted a time when he and Matt Sandusky had been playing racket ball. When they were done, he said, they went back to a locker room. Matt got undressed and got into the shower and then Victim 4 and Sandusky followed him in there, he testified. 'Me and Jerry came in. He started pumping his hand full of soap,' he said. At that point, Matt shut off his shower and left and went to another locker room to shower, the witness said. Asked by prosecutors about Matt's facial expression when the soap battles started, he replied: 'Nervous.' Jerry and Dottie Sandusky married in 1966 and have no biological children together, but adopted six times and have served as foster parents. The news comes just hours after a 30-year-old Ohio man became the first alleged Sandusky victim to reveal himself to the public, saying in an interview that he was sexually abused by Jerry Sandusky more than 100 times, starting when he was just ten. Travis Weaver said Sandusky preyed on. him after he and his brother went to a summer camp for the Second Mile, a. charity the coach founded and through which he is accused of cultivating. most of his victims. In the jurors' hands: Sandusky is pictured leaving court on Thursday after closing arguments in his child sex abuse trial. Coming forward: Travis Weaver is the first alleged victim of Jerry Sandusky to go public with his story of abuse at the hands of the Penn State coach. The revelation comes on the same day as a jury begins to deliberate Mr Sandusky's fate on 48 counts of sexual abuse charges. In closing arguments, his attorney said the accusers were liars who were hoping to cash in on legal settlements from the university. Mr Weaver is not one of the eight accusers who testified at trial, but he did tell his story to the grand jury that handed down the Sandusky's indictment, NBC News reported. An exclusive interview with Mr Weaver will air at 10pm Thursday on Rock Center. When asked what he would do if he ever met Sandusky again, Mr Weaver doesn't hesitate. Silence: For 15 years, Mr Weaver says, he thought he was Sandusky's only victim. That all changed last fall when the former coach was indicted on charges he abused other eight boys. 'I'd punch him in his mouth,' he said. 'There would be no reason to say anything. He knows what he did.' During the sex abuse trial, Sandusky's. lawyer Joe Amendola said the former coach is being railroaded by. overzealous investigators and prosecutors. He strenuously denied that. accusations and Sandusky has maintained his innocence since his arrest. last fall. Jurors in Jerry Sandusky's child sexual abuse case began deliberations on Thursday after his lawyer and a state prosecutor made closing arguments that followed seven days of testimony. The former Penn State University coach's attorney claimed all eight of Jerry Sandusky's accusers are lying about their sex abuse allegations in the hopes of winning big settlements from the college. Joe Amendola quoted Mother Theresa as he said his client had been railroaded by overzealous investigators and greedy witnesses. He told the jury that prosecutors' case 'doesn't make sense. Sandusky is accused of molesting eight boys over the course of 15 years in a case that shocked the nation and led to the firing of Joe Paterno, one of the most respected head coaches in college football history. When Amendola cited Sandusky's decades of charity work, he referred to the Mother Theresa  'Anyway.' It includes the line: 'If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives; Be kind anyway.' Amendola laid the blame for the allegations at the feet of state police investigators who he said coached the alleged victims into giving accusatory statements. Amendola. said the accusers were greedy an they lied about the abuse in the hopes. of winning big payouts from Penn State University so they could drive. new cars and buy big houses. Mr Weaver has also filed a lawsuit and is being represented by a well-known attorney who has specialized in sex abuse cases against the Catholic church. The abuse began in 1992, Mr Weaver told NBC's Rock Center, when he met Sandusky at a swimming pool at a camp sponsored by the Second Miles, which Sandusky founded to help at-risk young boys. 'It was like meeting my hero,' Mr Weaver said of Sandusky, who was once the top pick to replace legendary Penn State football coach Joe Paterno. The individual attention Sandusky gave Mr Weaver began innocently, but gradually grew more and more sinister, he said. It began with a shower in the Penn State football team's locker room. 'After the shower was over... he'd dry me off with a towel. He'd say he was trying to wrestle with me... and then it progressed into oral sex,' Mr Weaver told NBC. He always assumed he was the only victim, he said. He never imagined there have been other boys until Sandusky was arrested last fall. Mr Weaver also blasted Sandusky's wife, Dottie, who testified that she never saw or heard anything that would have made her think her husband was molesting boys. He recalled on incident when Sandusky performed oral sex on him in a bedroom across the hall from Mrs Sandusky. 'How could she not know?' Mr Weaver said. He man said the abuse continued for four years until he moved away to Ohio to flee Sandusky. Watch video here. Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy.

Bring your record card to all medical appointments.\\"","output":"Title: The Importance of Using an Immunization Tracker and Maintaining Accurate Records Introduction Immunizations play a vital role in safeguarding our health by helping our bodies build resilience and immunity against infectious diseases. As new vaccines are developed and immunization schedules streamline, it is essential to keep a thorough record of the vaccines we have received. This is where an immunization tracker comes in handy, ensuring that our vaccinations are up-to-date and recorded accurately. This article will delve into the importance of getting an immunization tracker, making backups, including supporting documentation and the role played by carrying your record card to all medical appointments. The Value of an Immunization Tracker Immunization trackers offer several benefits for both individuals and healthcare providers. They are easy-to-use tools that can help monitor and organize all vaccination-related information at our fingertips: 1. Staying up-to-date: With an immunization tracker, you can easily keep track of your vaccination schedule. This ensures that you never miss any important vaccines, which could potentially expose you to preventable infectious diseases. 2. Travel requirements: Some countries require proof of vaccination as part of the entry process. Presenting an updated immunization record can prevent complications and potential delays when traveling.  3. Healthcare provider collaboration: By having a comprehensive immunization history, healthcare providers can accurately assess and guide your treatment if you have a disease that needs specific immunizations.  4. Personal health management: An immunization tracker can help you become proactive about your health, making informed decisions in consultation with medical professionals. The Importance of Backups and Supporting Documentation It's never wise to rely solely on the original immunization record card. Disasters, such as fires, floods, or theft, can lead to important documents being misplaced or destroyed. Here's why you need to create at least one backup of your immunization record card and include supporting documentation for all entries: 1. Proof of immunizations: If your original record card becomes lost or damaged, a backup will serve as a reliable record of the vaccines you've received. Keeping supporting documentation, such as receipts or medical reports, will make it easier to verify the entries and details on your card. 2. Insurance claims: In the event of an injury or illness related to your vaccinations, having accurate records can support your claims and ensure that insurance companies can process them without undue delays. 3. School or work regulations: Some schools and workplaces have immunization requirements to protect the institution's population against infectious diseases. Backing up your records and having supporting documentation allows you to easily prove that you meet these requirements. Bringing Your Record Card to Medical Appointments To achieve a holistic approach to healthcare, medical professionals need access to accurate and up-to-date information about your health, including immunization history. Here are a few reasons why carrying your immunization record card to all medical appointments is essential: 1. Continuity of care: By reviewing your immunization record card, your healthcare provider can make more informed decisions about any necessary immunizations or booster shots, as well as identify and address potential vaccine-related side effects. 2. Coordination of treatments: For specific medical conditions or treatments, your medical professional may need to know if you've received certain vaccinations. For instance, your vaccination status may impact the choice of medications or timing of surgeries. 3. Preventing avoidable complications: Uninformed booster shots or additional vaccinations could lead to adverse reactions or complications. By having your immunization record available, your healthcare provider can easily cross-reference the details and prevent any potential mishaps. Conclusion In conclusion, investing in an immunization tracker and maintaining accurate records is an essential process for not just individual healthcare management but also for the betterment of public health. Backing up your records and carrying your immunization record card to all medical appointments can save time, reduce the risk of adverse reactions, and contribute to more informed medical decisions. By doing so, you play an active role in maintaining your health and promoting the overall well-being of the community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In college, I decided to focus primarily on track and pursue my dream of going to the Paralympics. With the support of a great coach and team, I was selected as a member of Team USA and competed in track at the Paralympic Games in London in 2012. On Saturday, April 6, I embarked on the most challenging journey of my life. I left Los Angeles, heading toward New York City in my racing wheelchair -- a 71-day journey of 3,300 miles. While I didn't know what to expect or how my body would react to the demands of \\"pushing\\" the equivalent of two to three marathons a day, I knew one thing for sure -- I'd get it done. I committed to Push Across America as my way of giving back to Stay-Focused, an organization that has significantly impacted my life. During my Paralympic experience in London, where 80,000 fans cheered for me and my fellow Paralympians at each and every event, I was impressed with how the fans embraced us as athletes -- athletes first,","output":"disabled second. It was this positive attitude and embracing spirit that fueled my desire to give back to my community and inspire others through my journey. Push Across America was not just about the physical challenge but also about raising awareness and funding for Stay-Focused, a non-profit organization that serves disabled children and young adults by offering adaptable sports experiences and opportunities. In the weeks leading up to my departure, I trained rigorously and prepared by reviewing expert advice on techniques, nutrition, and gear to ensure my success. Day after day, I pushed through various terrains, battling unpredictable weather conditions, including high heat, strong winds, and even hailstorms. I tackled steep inclines, difficult descents, and countless miles of rough pavement. Along the way, I encountered the most amazing and supportive people who came out to cheer me on, provide me with shelter, food, and encouragement, and share their own inspiring stories with me. These interactions drove me to keep pushing forward and inspired me to work even harder. As I approached the East Coast, media outlets picked up on my story, and the visibility for Push Across America and Stay-Focused dramatically increased. More people started to join me on my journey, either by pushing alongside me for a portion or by sharing their own stories on social media and news outlets. This widespread support showed me the true power of community and the impact a single person's story could have on so many lives. After 71 days of intense physical and emotional challenges, I finally reached my destination: New York City. I crossed the finish line in Central Park, accompanied by friends, family, and supporters who had followed my journey. Though my body was exhausted and my hands were blistered from trembling along the wheelchair's wheels, my spirit soared with a sense of accomplishment and gratitude. As I rested and reflected on my journey, I realized that I had achieved my goal: people not only saw me as an athlete but as a testament to the power of perseverance and the strength of the human spirit. Push Across America raised over 150,000 for Stay-Focused, which enabled the organization to expand its programming and reach more young adults with disabilities. My story had inspired others to break through their own limitations and chase their dreams, regardless of the obstacles they faced. The story of Push Across America doesn't just end with the completion of my 3,300-mile journey. It serves as a reminder that we all possess untapped potential and that we can achieve extraordinary feats when we step out of our comfort zones. It's a testament to the power of community and the importance of supporting each other to create a more inclusive, understanding, and just world. As I continue to compete on an international level and work with Stay-Focused, I carry the lessons and experiences of Push Across America with me, using them to shape my future and the lives of those I aim to inspire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a detailed comparison: 1. The house was purchased by Sir David Dundas of Dunira in 1858 , who sold it on to George Dewhurst of Lymm , Cheshire , in 1864. In this sentence, Sir David Dundas is identified as being from Dunira and purchases the house in 1858. Subsequently, he sells the house to George Dewhurst, who is from Lymm, Cheshire, in 1864. 2. The house was bought in 1858 by Sir George Dewhurst of Dunira , who in 1864 sold it to David Dundas of Lymm , Cheshire. This sentence is slightly different. Here, Sir George Dewhurst is identified as being from Dunira, and he buys the house in 1858. He then sells it to David Dundas, who is from Lymm, Cheshire, in 1864. The differences in these sentences include the titles and locations attributed to the individuals involved. In the first sentence, Sir David Dundas is described as being from Dunira, while in the second sentence, he is portrayed as being from Lymm, Cheshire. Similarly, George Dewhurst's origin is switched in the two sentences. Additionally, the title 'Sir' is attributed to different people in the two statements. In the first, it is given to David Dundas, while in the second, it is assigned to George Dewhurst. Thus, the two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other but convey a similar sequence of events with discrepancies in the details of the individuals involved."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on the premise \\"An' seem' as how they was only one company hereabouts Howard's Rangers they didn't try.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"In other places, there are lots of companies.\\" is true?","output":"To evaluate the hypothesis \\"In other places, there are lots of companies\\" based on the premise \\"An' seem' as how they was only one company hereabouts Howard's Rangers they didn't try,\\" we need to analyze the context and information provided in the statement, as well as consider possible interpretations and connections between them.  First, let's break down the premise. It appears to be set in a colloquial, informal tone, implying a non-technical or casual conversation. There is mention of one company, Howard's Rangers, and the fact that there's only one in the immediate vicinity. The final part of the sentence, \\"they didn't try,\\" establishes a lack of substantial competition or motivation for Howard's Rangers, possibly due to the absence of other companies. However, there's not much information provided about other places or regions, so we cannot directly deduce that there are lots of companies in other places. The limited scope of this statement hinders our ability to infer anything concrete about other locations. To determine if the hypothesis is true, we need to examine some possible interpretations of the premise: 1. Interpretation 1: The premise implies that there is a lesser concentration of companies in the speaker's local area compared to other places. In this case, the hypothesis could be considered true. However, this is still an assumption, as the statement does not explicitly contain information about other locations.  2. Interpretation 2: The unique context of the speaker's local area has resulted in there only being one company. This implies that the situation is specific to this area and does not necessarily reflect the rest of the world. Therefore, the hypothesis may or may not be true, as there's no tangible claim regarding the company concentration in other places. 3. Interpretation 3: The existence of only one company in the area is purely coincidental and doesn't hold any relation to the presence of multiple companies in other locations. In this interpretation, the premise can neither confirm nor disprove the hypothesis. Ultimately, although the premise provides insight into the local presence of one company, Howard’s Rangers, and implies a lack of competition, there is not enough information to definitely support the hypothesis that \\"In other places, there are lots of companies.\\" It's essential to gather more comprehensive data about company distribution in various regions before drawing such a conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Idol Meter: The finals Performance order: Studies by WhatNotToSing.com and others have established that singing first on the show is a clear handicap, while singing last is a big plus and second-to-last a lesser but still significant plus. So show-closers get 10 points, the second-to-last contestant gets 5, the opener gets minus 5, the rest zero. Performance quality: Buzz, judges' verdict and (especially) song choice are vital to a contestant's survival, but none of that would mean a thing without what we watch Idol for: the performance itself. It's worth anywhere from minus 10 to plus 10 points. Exceptional circumstances: Idol is live, and the unpredictable can happen. When it does, we'll dole out anywhere from minus 10 to plus 10 points for incidents including, but not limited to, emotional shout-outs or breakdowns, sickbed performances, superstar stage lighting, forgetting lyrics, false starts, major vocal gaffes, tantrums, overt sullenness, sassing a judge, being adopted as perverse causes clbres or anything else that might influence voting. Judges' verdict: Respect them or not, the judges' opinions can't help but influence voters. So positive comments from Randy, Steven and Jennifer are worth up to 6 points each, while a negative comment scores as much as minus 6. If a performance receives a unanimous, three-judge, flat-out rave, 3 bonus points will be added for a total of 21. Dial Idol: DialIdol.com, which calculates phone-voting strength from busy signals, has had a strong record of predicting eliminations over the years, though its accuracy might suffer this year as online voting is being allowed for the first time. While we monitor the situation, contestants receiving green (or safe) ratings from Dial Idol get 5 points. The lowest-rated contestant gets minus 5; the remainder, in the yellow danger zone, score zero. Online buzz: Standout performances tend to generate high volumes of post-show online searches, so contestants who spike in Google Trends, Yahoo Buzz, Twitter's popular topics or other queries get 14, 10 or 5 points. Outcome: Nothing spells danger for an Idol contestant more than showing up in the dreaded bottom three the previous week. Contestants score minus 5 points if they were in the bottom three or plus 20 points if they escaped. Contestants who elude elimination on their first trip to the bottom three get a one-week bounce worth 5 points. Summary:","output":"This news article discusses the scoring system and factors that impact contestant rankings on the singing competition show, Idol. Factors include performance order, performance quality, exceptional circumstances, judges' verdicts, DialIdol.com predictions, online buzz, and outcome from the previous week. Contestants can gain or lose points depending on their performance in these categories, ultimately influencing their overall score and chances of advancing in the competition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Consequently, they are being forced to bear the financial responsibility for someone else's choices. This unjust imposition of obligation is frustrating and leads to profound disquiet. 3. Emotional violation: The whole situation has left the narrator feeling violated, as someone else's actions have interfered with their life and personal finances. This intrusion is far from a minor inconvenience; it carries emotional weight and generates a sense of vulnerability, further heightening the narrator's distress. 4. Long-lasting impact: The narrator emphasizes that the issue will have a \\"profound and long-lasting impact\\" on their life. This implies that the financial burden might affect their credit score, future opportunities, and overall stability for an extended period, significantly worsening their quality of life and causing considerable anxiety. 5. Absence of accountability: The narrator is upset because they are being forced to pay for someone else's poor choices, while the person responsible does not seem to face any consequences. This lack of accountability creates a feeling of injustice and further aggravates the narrator's discontent. In conclusion, the narrator is so upset about the bill because it represents a convergence of disrespect, emotional violation, and unfair imposition of responsibility, all stemming from another person's poor choices. This situation has caused considerable distress and is likely to have long-lasting negative consequences in the narrator's life, amplifying their sense of injustice and frustration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Money talks: December 19th 2011 This discussion demonstrates that the Economist at least still obsesses about the banks, and their Eurobonds. I know they are the ones that pay you, but as Mario Draghi of the ECB has realized, these bonds are not now the central issue. The banks have made bad and risky loans by lending to the Euro States instead of the private economy. Indeed they continue to do so. They must: 1. Be forced to realize that they are going to pay ALL the losses on the Euro bonds. 2. The banks must be forced to stop lending to the Euro states, that is stop buying (these high risk) Euro bonds, NOW. That is the ONLY way to stop these countries spending excessively. In fact the cure, the solution, to the Euro crisis is simple, and has one simple solution as all basic solutions have. It must be announced that ALL banks WILL NOT BE RECOMPENSED for their Euro bond losses, and if the continue buying Euro bonds (very foolishly) they must take these inevitable losses on the chin. Everybody, except a complete fool, can see that the EU is heading for a system wide bond DEFAULT. The banks are heading now for pretty well a 100% loss on their Euro bonds. These loopy discussions by the Economists economists (I know that they are paid to say these thing) that some organization (Father Christmas?) is going to refund the Banks' losses on the Eurobonds should cease. After all, these comments are being recorded and will be hauled back to blame you. No, not even Germany, the IMF, the ECB, combined, can repay these losses. FORGET IT. This mad house of Banks continuing to buy dodgy bonds, yet pressuring governments to repay their losses, must cease. And that includes the bank, whose name I won't mention, which owns the Economist magazine!

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation 0 = -8069*p + 8099*p + 150 for p, we shall first simplify the equation by combining like terms.  0 = (-8069*p + 8099*p) + 150 Since -8069*p and 8099*p are like terms (both have the variable p), we can add their coefficients: (-8069 + 8099) * p = 30 * p So, the simplified equation is: 0 = 30*p + 150 Now, we need to isolate the variable p. We can do this by moving all the terms involving p to one side of the equation and all the constants to the other side. In this case, we want to get rid of the constant term 150 on the right side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 150 from both sides: 0 - 150 = 30*p + 150 - 150 -150 = 30*p Now, we can solve for p by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of p, which is 30: -150 / 30 = 30*p / 30 -5 = p So, the solution to the equation 0 = -8069*p + 8099*p + 150 is p = -5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She wants to try something new and decides to make the room air tight, meaning no air can escape the room. After trialing this with a few customers she asks them for some feedback. The customers say they really like how there is never a draft in the room but they feel weird when they leave the room and their ears pop like when they are are on an airplane and the pressure is uneven.  Will the pressure of a sealed container increase or decrease when a gas inside it is heated?","output":"The pressure of a sealed container will increase when the gas inside it is heated. This can be explained by understanding the behavior of gases using the ideal gas law, which is represented by the equation: PV = nRT where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. In an airtight sauna room, the volume (V) is constant. When the gas (air) inside the room is heated, its temperature (T) increases. According to the ideal gas law, when the temperature increases and the volume remains constant, the pressure (P) must also increase to maintain the balance in the equation. This increased pressure in the airtight sauna room could be causing the customers' ears to pop when they leave the room. When they exit to a different environment, the ears need to adjust to the pressure difference between the sauna and the outside air, causing the sensation of ear-popping similar to being on an airplane."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: what does add my two cents mean I found the following answer on Google: However, it is also sometimes used with irony when expressing a strongly felt opinion. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct, but I will provide you with a more detailed and comprehensive explanation to help you understand the meaning of \\"add my two cents\\" better. \\"Add my two cents\\" is a common phrase used in conversation that signifies a person is sharing their opinion or thoughts on a particular matter. The phrase is derived from the original expression \\"put(or throw) in one's two cents,\\" which has evolved over time. The \\"two cents\\" in the phrase refers to a metaphorical and minimal amount of money, representing the idea that the speaker's contribution to the conversation might not be significant or valuable, but they still want to express their views. In American currency, two cents is a small value, so using this term emphasizes the humility or cautiousness with which the person is speaking. The phrase often carries a tone of humility as it suggests that the speaker is aware that their input might not be the most important or essential part of the discussion. They want to acknowledge that they are respectfully offering their perspective without dominating or overwhelming the conversation. As mentioned in your original answer, \\"add my two cents\\" can also be used with a touch of irony when someone has a strong opinion about something and wants to make their point emphatically. In these cases, the phrase is used to indicate feigned modesty as the speaker knows that their opinion may be more influential or important than they are making it out to be. Overall, \\"add my two cents\\" is a useful expression to communicate one's thoughts or opinions in a conversation without appearing overly assertive or opinionated, and sometimes with a sense of irony to make a strong point."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Yet, even through October, Bermuda isn't ready to stop for the winter. During this month, world-class festivals on teh island keep things lively and the weather remains comfortable enough for Bermuda shorts and bathing suits. In October, Bermuda hosts two major festivals--the Bermuda Music Festival and the Bermuda Culinary Arts  Festival. The 10thanniversary Bermuda Music Festival begins October 5 and features three days of performances at the Royal Naval Dockyard on Bermuda's West End. Featured main stage performers include Joss Stone, Pattie Labelle, and Al Green, and a second stage spotlights local Bermudian artists. General admission tickets start at 60 for on e day  or 160 for a three-day pass. Starting October 21, the Culinary Arts Festival brings some of North America's top chefs to the island for four days of food and wine tastings, conferences and cooking competitions. Participating chefs include Todd English and Michael Lomonaco, among others. Three-day festival passes start at 649 per person, but you can also buy separate tickets for individual events. Even if you don't attend one of the festivals, there's still plenty to do. With mostly sunny days and temperatures averaging aroung 79 degrees, the weather is just right for participating in Bermuda's two favorite pastimes--golf and tennis. With fewer visitors on the island than during the summer, you may have an easier time getting the best times or a spot on the courts. It's also still warm enough to enjoy the island's pink sand beaches and go swimming, because the water keeps the summer's heat longer than the air.

A:","output":"No, the answer you found on Google does not directly provide the crude death rate for 1990. While a life table does indeed give a more complete understanding of mortality rates by separating the data by age, it still doesn't answer your question about the specific crude death rate in 1990. The crude death rate (CDR) is a number that illustrates the number of deaths in a certain year for every 1,000 people in a population. It's an important demographic metric which helps assess the mortality situation of a region or a country. The crude death rate for 1990 varied depending on the country or region in question. For a more accurate answer, you would need a specific region or data source to find the rate you are looking for. For instance, in 1990, the crude death rate for the United States was approximately 8.6 deaths per 1,000 population. On the other hand, the global crude death rate in 1990 was estimated to be around 9.3 deaths per 1,000 population.

Question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What city in Pakistan is a global city? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the meaning of 'global city' A global city, also known as a world city or an alpha city, is a city that is considered to be an important node in the global economic system. These cities serve as key centers for global capital and trade, and possess a high level of influence in terms of culture, politics, and technology. Step 2: Research about cities in Pakistan Research various cities in Pakistan to determine which one(s) might fit the criteria for being a global city. Some of the major cities in Pakistan include Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and Peshawar. Step 3: Evaluate the cities in terms of global city criteria Evaluate the major cities based on their extent of influence in the global economy, as well as their cultural, political, and technological impact. a) Karachi: As Pakistan's largest city and economic hub, Karachi is home to the country's largest collection of businesses, industries, and financial institutions. The city also hosts the largest seaport in the country, Port of Karachi, making it an essential player in international trade. Karachi's diverse cultural scene and role as a key city in Pakistan's media industry further contribute to its status as a global city. b) Lahore: Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, is known for its rich cultural heritage, architectural landmarks, and educational institutions. While Lahore is an important city in Pakistan, its global influence may not be as extensive as that of Karachi. c) Islamabad: As the capital city of Pakistan, Islamabad holds significant political power and influence. The city is home to numerous government institutions, international organizations, and embassies. However, its impact on the global economy and culture is less pronounced than Karachi's. d) Peshawar: Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, has a strategic location near Afghanistan and serves as a significant trade center linking Central Asia to South Asia. Its role in regional trade and historical significance contribute to its global status, but its overall global impact may be less than that of Karachi. Step 4: Determine the most suitable city based on the evaluation Based on the evaluation, Karachi appears to have the strongest claim as a global city in Pakistan, given its crucial role in international trade, its economic clout, and its cultural influence. Answer: The city in Pakistan that can be considered a global city is Karachi, due to its significant contributions to the global economy, extensive international trade connections, and cultural impact."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Interviewer: Right then, Roger, what made you take off to the country in the first place?  Roger: Well, I suppose any one who moves to the country wants their life to be different in some way. I mean, if you have always lived in a city, as I had, then something must happen to make you want to move. In my case I was made redundant, and, when it came to looking around for a new job, I just couldn't face going back into an office again. So I sat down and thought about what I'd really like to do.  Interviewer: And that, I suppose, turned out to be something in the country?  Roger: No, initially I didn't think of moving, but just of getting a different kind of job, you know social work with kids or old people, that kind of tiring.  Interviewer: So what happened, why didn't you?  Roger: Well, I hadn't got any of the right qualifications, and it would have taken me two years to get qualified and I certainly didn't want to go back to formal education again.  Interviewer: Couldn't you have learned while on the job sort of picked it up as you went along?  Roger: No, you have to have a diploma. Anyway, after talking it over with friends who had moved out I thought I'd like to give it a try--after all, a change of scene...  Interviewer: Is better than.., yes, we all know that. So, where did you go when you did decide to move?  Roger: I went right out to Shropshire. After all I thought if you're going to go rural you might as well do it properly. The first problem though was how I was going to make a living. There are fewer jobs in the country, so I decided to start up on my own.  Interviewer: That's pretty ambitious, a townie moving off to the depths of the country and setting up his own business. How did you start, had you got any skills?  Roger: I'd always had a garden and grown some vegetables and flowers, you know, usual things, salad stuff, carrots, peas, beans, a bit of fruit, some roses.., so I thought of a small holding, a kind of small farm.

I got to see an early preview of this movie and I hope they have time to edit it in what ever way they can to improve on it before it comes out Aug 3rd. It stars Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live as 'Hot' Rod Kimble. He's plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stunt man like his late father. When we meet him, he's jumping a mail truck on his mo-ped, yes, a mo-ped, and almost makes it. This would be worthy of a 'Jackass' movie if he wasn't honestly trying to do this. Isla Fisher plays the slightly older and much more mature girl-next-door, Denise. She seems to like Rod enough to join his 'crew'. Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his half brother, Kevin, who documents the stunts with a camcorder. Sissy Spacek plays Rod's mom, Marie. She remarried Frank Powell, played by Ian McShane. Frank's a real tough guy who enjoys beating Rod in some real drag out brawls. It's clear that Rod's not going to earn Frank's respect till he can beat him. We find out Frank needs a 50,000. heart transplant and Rod is determined to raise the money just so he 'can beat his ass' once he's healed, and prove himself a man. A long fall down a mountain side convinces Rod to 'go big' on one stunt. Rod sets out to get seed money by charging for doing stunts that would make you cringe if you saw them in real life. Like the human torch- at a children's birthday party. There were those at the showing who managed to laugh at most of the stunts. Just when all hope and money is lost, along comes a sponsor who saves the day by getting the 15 school buses Rod wants to jump. He gets exclusive broadcast rights and sets up phone lines to get donations. Rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle. The whole town turns out and the world tunes in. Does he make the jump? Does he get the girl? Do they raise the 50k? Does Frank get his ass beat by Rod? Wait till this 90 minute movie comes out on video to find out.

A:","output":"No, that would not be a reasonable answer to the question. The question is asking about how many social classes existed in the Han Dynasty, and the answer you provided does not offer a specific number of classes.  For more clarity, the Han Dynasty society was mainly composed of four social classes. These were the emperor and his court, the scholars (also known as gentry), the farmers (or peasants), and the merchants. 1. Emperor and his court: The ruling class comprised the emperor and his extended family, his many courtiers and civil servants. 2. Scholars (Gentry): This was a literate class, often from noble families or were officials that passed civil service examinations. 3. Farmers (Peasants): They are common people and were considered the backbone of the empire because of the basic need of food. 4. Merchants: Despite being successful, wealthy, and contributing to the economy, merchants were generally considered to be at the bottom of the social hierarchy because they were thought to get rich from the works of others.  Apart from these four major classes, there was another class of people that one could say were outside the social classes, which the Chinese call the \\"mean people\\". These were people who did not own land, and it also included craftsmen and skillful artisans, making this situation more like a caste system than a rigid social stratification system.  People within each social class, particularly in the lower classes, had limited social mobility and were essentially stuck within their class. However, there were opportunities for individuals, especially those in the scholar class, to climb up; for instance, becoming a government official was a way to ascend socially."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In revenge, the captain exhumes the body of the wife to find her face has not decomposed; there is a suggestion of intended necrophilia.Cut to the present day where a nanny is reading the voice-over from a book whilst seated on a park bench. The children in her care are given some pictures by a strange man in the park; there are implications of child abduction or pedophilia. Cut to a close-up of a spider and the interior of a bourgeois apartment where a man is fed up with symmetry as he rearranges his mantelpiece. The children arrive home and show the pictures to their parents who are shocked that the girls have such images. The parents are disgusted and yet erotically stimulated by the images which we assume to be pornographic when we see the images, they are revealed as picture postcards of architecture (there is a satirical nod towards Freudian symbolism in the images of tunnels and columns).

However, there are slight differences in the context and connotations of the words \\"arrested\\" and \\"detained,\\" affecting the level of formality and the legal meaning of the two sentences. 1. \\"Kuroń, Modzelewski and Michnik were arrested again, and the majority of \\"Komandosi\\" members were imprisoned.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"arrested\\" typically implies that formal charges have been brought against the individuals, and they have been taken into custody by law enforcement. Arrests are part of the legal process that leads to a trial or some other form of judicial investigation. This generally includes being read their legal rights, being booked into a facility, and potentially having a bail amount set. The use of \\"arrested\\" highlights the severity of the situation and the involvement of the criminal justice system. 2. \\"Kuroń, Modzelewski and Michnik were detained again and a majority of the \\"Komandosi\\" members were imprisoned.\\" In this sentence, \\"detained\\" refers to the temporary restraining of the individuals' freedom of movement, typically by law enforcement, which can happen for various reasons. Detainment may happen due to suspicion, questioning, or for further investigation. Detainment is less formal than an arrest, and the individuals may or may not be formally charged with any crimes. It is also possible for them to be released without any legal consequences if it is determined that they have no connection with the ongoing investigation or have not committed any criminal actions. While both sentences imply the apprehension of Kuroń, Modzelewski, and Michnik, as well as the imprisonment of a majority of the \\"Komandosi\\" members, the key difference lies in the words \\"arrested\\" and \\"detained.\\" In essence, the first sentence suggests a more formal legal process, while the second sentence portrays a situation that might not necessarily lead to charges or trial.

Context: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. Question: Why did Manny slow down?

The film stars Allison Miller, Zach Gilford, and Sam Anderson. The film was released on January 17, 2014. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Devil's Due was filmed in America","output":"Based on the information given in the text, we cannot conclusively validate the sentence \\"Devil's Due was filmed in America.\\" Here is my rationale: 1. We learn that Devil's Due is an American film. This means it was largely produced by an American production house, featuring largely American crew and cast. This however doesn't necessarily imply that it was filmed in America. 2. We learn that it's a found footage psychological horror film, which indicates the style of the film but doesn't reveal anything about its filming location. 3. The directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, along with the writer Lindsay Devlin, are mentioned, as are the actors. However, their nationalities or usual places of work do not definitively say where the film was shot.

Context: During the 20th century Valencia remained the third most populous city of Spain as its population tripled, rising from 213,550 inhabitants in 1900 to 739,014 in 2000. Valencia was also third in industrial and economic development; notable milestones include urban expansion of the city in the latter 1800s, the creation of the Banco de Valencia in 1900, construction of the Central and Columbus markets, and the construction of the Gare du Nord railway station, completed in 1921. The new century was marked in Valencia with a major event, the Valencian regional exhibition of 1909 (La Exposición Regional Valenciana de 1909), which emulated the national and universal expositions held in other cities. This production was promoted by the Ateneo Mercantil de Valencia (Mercantile Athenaeum of Valencia), especially by its chairman, Tomás Trénor y Palavicino, and had the support of the Government and the Crown; it was officially inaugurated by King Alfonso XIII himself.","output":"The creation of the Banco de Valencia occurred second, after the urban expansion of the city in the latter 1800s."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed.

Maria had always been a shy person.; 2). Tanya had always been a shy person.;","output":"Maria had a lot less friends than Tanya because Maria had always been a shy person. This trait is often characterized by a lack of self-confidence, feelings of inadequacy, and a general reluctance to engage in social situations. This distinction between the two girls wasn't a judgment on their qualities, abilities, or values but rather, a distinct difference in their social dispositions that played a significant role in how their lives played out, specifically in terms of forming friendships. Growing up, Maria's shyness manifested in various ways. She tended to avoid eye contact, struggled to voice her opinions or join in group discussions, and often found herself hesitating to participate in activities for fear of being judged or criticized. Additionally, her introverted nature made it challenging for her to navigate school functions, extracurricular activities, and other settings where making new friends was a common expectation. Consequently, others may have perceived Maria as distant or aloof, which further diminished her ability to connect with her peers and establish meaningful relationships. On the other hand, Tanya's personality and social skills enabled her to form multiple connections with ease. As an outgoing, friendly, and warm person, she naturally drew others towards her. She wasn't afraid of stepping out of her comfort zone, and her open, approachable demeanor made it easy for her peers to feel at ease around her. This magnetism translated into a larger circle of friends and acquaintances for Tanya, helping her foster relationships that could range from surface-level connections to deep, lasting friendships. Despite their different social experiences, it is essential to recognize that Maria's and Tanya's individual traits are not inherently superior or inferior in any way. Shyness, introversion, extroversion, boldness – all have their unique strengths and challenges. What's important is understanding and embracing those differences and learning how to navigate social situations to form meaningful connections. For Maria, taking small steps to build her self-confidence, enhance her communication skills, and push herself to explore new experiences could help her expand her social circle. In turn, Tanya could continue leveraging her outgoing personality to uplift others, offering her support and friendship to those who may feel less comfortable in social situations. Ultimately, Maria had a lot less friends than Tanya because Maria had always been a shy person, but every person has their own unique journey when it comes to building and maintaining friendships. Acknowledging these individual differences and working together to support one another's growth can lead to stronger, more diverse, and meaningful relationships."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Beehives  -either recorded or real-may even prevent elephants from damaging farmer's crops. In 2002, scientist Lucy King and her team found that elephants avoid certain trees with bees living in them. Today,  Lucy wants to see if African honeybees might discourage elephants from eating crops. But before she asked farmer to go to the trouble of setting up beehives on their farms, she needed to find out if the bees would scare elephants away. Lucy found a wild beehive inside a tree in northern Kenya and set up a recorder. Then she threw a stone into the beehive, which burst into life. Lucy and her assistant hid in their car until the angry bees had calmed down. Next,Lucy searched out elephant families in Samburu National Reserve in northern Kenya and put a speaker in a close to each family. From a distance, Lucy switched on the pre-recorded sound of angry bees while at the same time recording the elephants with a video camera. Half the elephant groups left the area within ten seconds. Out of a total of 17 groups, only one group ignored the sound of the angry bees. Lucy reported that all the young elephants immediately ran to their mothers to hide under them. When Lucy Played the sound of a waterfall   instead of the angry bees to many of the same elephant families, the animals were undisturbed. Even after four minutes, most of the groups stayed in one place. Lucy is now studying whether the elephants will continue to avoid the sound of angry bees after hearing it several times.

This means they are accessible to all and have been designed not only for shopping purposes, but also to facilitate movement and gathering, just like a public street in a city. As such, these corridors are maintained by either the shopping center's ownership or its retailer tenants and would likely involve cleaning services, security measures, and other maintenance tasks to ensure the comfort, safety, and convenience of the shoppers and visitors. In terms of accessibility, these corridors are open 24 hours, serving as a public thoroughfare between Utrecht Centraal railway station and the city centre. This allows people to move between these locations at any time of day or night, providing a key convenience and accessibility feature for the residents, visitors, and workers in Utrecht.

Premise: One benefit is better meeting the diverse information needs of investors in evaluating funds, which has become more difficult as the number of funds has grown. Hypothesis: Investors all need the same information. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that a benefit of better meeting diverse information needs of investors is in evaluating funds, which becomes harder as the number of funds increases. This implies that different investors may have various information needs when it comes to evaluating funds. The diverse information needs also suggest that each investor may have unique preferences and priorities when assessing fund performance, investment risks, and potential opportunities. On the other hand, the hypothesis claims that \\"investors all need the same information,\\" which contradicts the premise. By suggesting that all investors have identical information needs, the hypothesis overlooks the fact that investors have different profiles, risk tolerance levels, and investment goals. These varying factors logically lead to diverse information requirements while evaluating funds. To gain a deeper understanding, let's examine the key differences between the premise and hypothesis in greater detail: 1. Diversity of information needs vs. uniform information needs: The premise emphasizes the requirement for diverse information to cater to the individual preferences of investors. This is based on the understanding that each investor may have specific details they value or require while making investment decisions. In contrast, the hypothesis assumes that all investors share identical information requirements, discarding the likelihood of any diversity in their preferences or decision-making criteria. 2. Challenges arising from an increasing number of funds: The premise acknowledges that as the number of funds grows, it becomes more challenging for investors to evaluate them properly based on their unique needs. The presence of a large number of funds also necessitates better-tailored information and greater customizability to cater to a vast range of investor preferences. However, the hypothesis contradicts this notion by asserting that all investors need the same information, regardless of the variety and complexity of the available funds. In conclusion, the premise and hypothesis represent opposing viewpoints, with the premise suggesting the significance of diverse information needs to cater to a variety of investors while the hypothesis argues that all investors require the same information. As such, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, and the two cannot be logically reconciled."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A 15-year-old schoolboy could save millions of lives after he invented a new, low-cost test that can detect the early stages of a deadly form of cancer. Jack Andraka from Crownsville, Maryland, developed a simple dip-stick test for levels of mesothelin, a biomarker for early stage pancreatic cancer found in blood and urine. It promises to revolutionise treatment of the disease, which currently kills 19 out of 20 sufferers after five years - largely because its so difficult to detect until its final stages. Prodigy: Jack Andraka speaks after receiving Smithsonian Magazine's first annual American Ingenuity Award for youth achievement in Washington, DC. last November. He has invented a new test for pancreatic cancer. Jack's invention, for which he was last month awarded the grand prize of  75,000 in scholarship funds at the 2012 Intel Science Fair, means that patients now have a simple method to detect pancreatic cancer before it becomes invasive. His novel patent-pending sensor has proved to be 28 times faster, 28 times less expensive, and over 100 times more sensitive than current tests. Thanks to the test, pancreatic cancer. patients could now get an early earning to seek medical help when it. still has a chance of working, which could, he claims, potentially bump. up survival rates to 'close to 100 per cent'. Deadly: Pancreatic cancer is the same form of the disease that caused late Apple CEO Steve Jobs' long decline and eventual death. The test works in a similar way to diabetic testing strips, with his paper strips using only a drop of blood to determine whether patients carry the mesothelin biomarker. It is said to be over 90 per cent accurate, practically instant - and costs only 3 cents. And what's more, his simple test can also be used to detect ovarian and lung cancer, and it could be easily altered to detect the biomarkers of a range of other conditions. 'What’s so cool about that is its applicability to other diseases…for example other forms of cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, environmental contaminants like E Coli, salmonella,' Jack told Take Part. 'All for three cents for a test that takes five minutes to run.' Jack was moved to come up with the. test after a family friend passed away from pancreatic cancer, but it. was as he surreptitiously read a journal article about carbon nanotubes. in a biology lesson that he had his 'epiphany'. But. that eureka moment was not enough; the persistent teenager was rejected. by 197 scientists he solicited for help with his research - with some. plainly telling him his idea simply would not work. A cluster of pancreatic cancer cells: The disease currently kills 19 out of 20 sufferers after five years - largely because its so difficult to detect until its final stages when patients are less likely to respond to treatment. To come up with his new pancreatic cancer test, Jack mixed human mesothelin-specific antibodies with conductive single walled carbon nanotubes. He used the mixture to coat strips of ordinary filter paper, making them conductive, and determined the optimal layering using a scanning election microscope. Cell media spiked with varying amounts of mesothelin was then tested against to the paper biosensor and any change in the electrical potential of the sensor strip (due to the changing conductivity of the nanotubes) was measured. Changes in conductivity occurred because the antibodies on the strips binded to the mesothelin and enlarge, spreading the nanotubes further apart and changing the electrical properties of the network. The more mesothelin applied, the more the antibodies would grow and the weaker the electrical signal would become. Andraka's sensor costs 3.00 and 10 tests can be performed per strip, taking 5 minutes each. The test is said to be 168 times faster, 26,667 times less expensive, and 400 times more sensitive than current testing methods. Finally Dr Anirban Maitra, a professor of pathology and oncology at Johns Hopkins University, agreed to give him space in the lab and mentored him through the process of developing the test. To create the test, Jack mixed human mesothelin-specific antibodies with single-walled carbon nanotubes used the product to coat strips of ordinary filter paper. The nanotubes make the paper conductive, but when mesothelin is applied the antibodies would bind to the biomarker and enlarge, spreading the nanotubes apart and changing the strips' electrical properties. The more mesothelin present, the more antibodies bind and grow, and the weaker the electrical signal becomes - allowing scientists to accurately measure the levels of the biomarker. Now the teenage prodigy has plans to mass-market the tests and make them widely available to the public, which he believes could alter the balance of power in medicine. 'Essentially what I’m envisioning here is that this could be on your shelf at your Walgreens, your Kmart,' he said. 'Let’s say you suspect you have a condition…you buy the test for that. And you can see immediately if you have it. 'Instead of your doctor being the doctor, you’re the doctor.'

Context: Formal membership varies between communities, but basic lay adherence is often defined in terms of a traditional formula in which the practitioner takes refuge in The Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings of the Buddha), and the Sangha (the Buddhist community). At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East it is regarded as familiar and traditional. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organized and well funded. In countries such as Cambodia and Bhutan, it is recognized as the state religion and receives government support. Modern influences increasingly lead to new forms of Buddhism that significantly depart from traditional beliefs and practices.

Saint Anthony Falls, the only waterfall of its height on the Mississippi, played an important part in the development of Minneapolis.  The power of the waterfall first fueled sawmills, but later it was tapped to serve flour mills.  In 1870, only a small number of flour mills were in the Minneapolis area, but by 1900 Minnesota mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain.  Advances in transportation, milling technology, and water power combined to give Minneapolis a dominance in the milling industry.  Spring wheat could be sown in the spring and harvested in late summer, but it posed special problems for milling.  To get around these problems, Minneapolis millers made use of new technology.  They invented the middlings purifier, a device that used jets of air to remove the husks from the flour early in the milling process.  They also started using roller mills, as opposed to grindstones.  A series of rollers gradually broke down the kernels and integrated the gluten with the starch.  These improvements led to the production of \\"patent\\" flour, which commanded almost double the price of \\"bakers\\" or \\"clear\\" flour, which it replaced. Pillsbury and the Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of General Mills) became the leaders in the Minneapolis milling industry.  This leadership in milling later declined as milling was no longer dependent on water power, but the dominance of the mills contributed greatly to the economy of Minneapolis and Minnesota, attracting people and money to the region. The answer to this question is:","output":"In Minnesota, flour mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

I find that the key to a successful conversation in any language is to speak to people not only in their spoken language but also with the body language they know best. Britain, along with much of Northern Europe, has a non-touch culture, so personal space is very important. In a formal  situation, we would usually greet each other with a handshake. Informally, but not so often, my British friends and I would greet with a hug. Hardly ever would we greet with a kiss on the cheek, let alone a hug and two kisses on the cheek![:||] Here in the south of Italy, and in many different parts of the world, both men and women greet with two kisses on the cheek, use a lot of hand signs and often touch each other. In other words, little personal space is left between people when communicating. At university, I have learnt to successfully communicate in spoken Italian. And since I moved to live with the local people, I have also started to pick up their body language. Sometimes, I find myself not knowing what hand signs to use when expressing myself. However, what I know for sure is that I would miss the opportunity to fully put myself in the Italian culture if I keep my personal space unbroken. Here are 5 body language tips in Italy; * Use different signs; head, arms and hands. * Use facial expressions. Always smile at people! It is said that smiling is the most powerful unspoken way to communicate friendliness. * Use eye contact , because \\"the eyes are the window to the soul.\\" * Don't worry about personal space. Italians are a people who like to use the sense of touch, so moving away or keeping your distance may be considered as being unfriendly. * Touch. When meeting and leaving, always shake hands.

He was a key figure in the country's history, playing an instrumental role in shaping its political landscape and implementing social and economic reforms during his tenures as president. His legacy is remembered fondly, and numerous places and institutions in Uruguay bear his name, including the Parque Batlle. His first term, which falls outside of the given range, took place from 1903 to 1907. Still, he assumed office again from 1911 to 1915, as specified in the statement. During his second term, he continued to advocate for progressive policies that would come to define Uruguay's welfare state and political system. Some of these reforms included the separation of church and state, the establishment of the eight-hour workday, the provision of free and compulsory primary education, and the nationalization of key industries. The fact that Parque Batlle is named after José Batlle y Ordóñez is a testament to his significant contributions to the Uruguayan society and the country's development. However, it is crucial to remember that his time in office was not limited to 1911-1915, as he also served a term from 1903-1907.

Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine.  Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana.  Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end...

Question: What is Haeckel unsuccessful in creating? Movie title: Haeckel's Tale Movie plot: Beginning[edit] The story, set in the late 19th century, begins with a young man named Edward Ralston (Steve Bacic), coming to an old woman, Miz Carnation, who lives in an old cabin deep in the woods of upstate New York. Ralston asks Miz Carnation, a necromancer, to revive his recently deceased wife; she refuses, but then decides to tell him the story of Ernst Haeckel, and says that, if he still wishes to revive his wife afterwards, she will do as he asks. Main story[edit] The story mainly concerns Ernst Haeckel (Derek Cecil), who is trying to follow in the footsteps of Victor Frankenstein, but is unsuccessful with his attempts to create life. He learns of Montesquino, a necromancer, but believes that the man is a charlatan. Learning of his father's ill condition, he travels and encounters Walter Wolfram (Tom McBeath) and his wife Elise (Leela Savasta). Haeckel is oddly drawn to Elise and vice versa. Wolfram seems undisturbed by the attraction but when unearthly shrieks echo outside, Elise is drawn to them. Haeckel also notices that Elise is caring for a baby. Elise finally goes outside and the despondent Wolfram notes that he can't satisfy his wife, although he has sold everything he has to take care of her. Haeckel goes after Elise and follows the shrieks to a nearby necropolis. There he discovers that Elise is having sexual consort with her dead husband and the other resurrected corpses. Wolfram has paid Montesquino to raise the dead so that they can satisfy Elise. When Wolfram tries to take her home, the corpses kill him. Haeckel confronts Montesquino and demands that he make it stop. The necromancer says that he cannot, and an angry Haeckel shoots him as he tries to escape. The dying Montesquino shoves Haeckel into a tombstone, knocking him out. The next morning, Haeckel wakes up and returns to the cabin, where he finds Elise nursing the baby: a corpse-child, the son of her \\"true\\" husband. The baby rips out Haeckel's throat. The next scene takes place again at the necropolis, except it is the dead...","output":"Haeckel is unsuccessful in creating life, as he tries to follow in the footsteps of Victor Frankenstein."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The most reasonable method to keep your pens organized on your desktop is to use a cup to place them in (option a). Having a dedicated container like a cup ensures that your pens are held together in an orderly manner, making it easier for you to find and use them as needed, as well as preventing their ink from staining your desk. Option b, laying them on your desktop and letting them roll around, is not an effective way to keep pens organized.

Which movie is the following review about? a very good movie with great acting, but it needed a bit of pizzazz to make it a movie you can't miss.","output":"With just the information in the review, it is impossible to identify the exact movie being discussed. However, we can analyze the review and understand what the reviewer feels about the movie. The review begins by stating that it's \\"a very good movie,\\" which indicates that the overall quality of the film met or exceeded the reviewer's expectations. This suggests a well-executed story with strong directing and possibly a compelling narrative. The next part of the review praises the acting as \\"great.\\" This is a key element in any film and can carry a lot of weight in determining a movie's success. Exceptional acting can make a good movie into a great one by elevating the story and creating a believable and engaging atmosphere for the viewer. However, the reviewer also mentions that the movie lacks \\"pizzazz\\" to make it truly unmissable. Pizzazz can refer to the energy, excitement, or unique qualities that set a film apart from others. This implies that while the movie was good overall, it might not have had the extra flair or had a striking effect on the viewer, which would differentiate it from similar films in its genre.

Hubert Horatio Humphrey Jr. (May 27, 1911 - January 13, 1978) was an American politician who served as the 38th Vice President of the United States from 1965 to 1969. He twice served in the United States Senate, representing Minnesota from 1949 to 1964 and 1971 to 1978. He was the Democratic Party's nominee in the 1968 presidential election, losing to Republican nominee Richard Nixon. Humphrey and his running mate, Ed Muskie, who had not entered any of the 13 state primary elections, went on to win the Democratic nomination at the party convention in Chicago, Illinois even though 80 percent of the primary voters had been for anti-war candidates, the delegates had defeated the peace plank by 1,567 3/4  to 1,041 1/4 . Unfortunately for Humphrey and his campaign, in Grant Park, just five miles south of International Amphitheater convention hall (closed 1999), and at other sites near downtown Chicago, there were gatherings and protests by the thousands of antiwar demonstrators, many of whom favored McCarthy, George McGovern, or other \\"anti-war\\" candidates. These protesters - most of them young college students - were attacked and beaten on live television by Chicago police, actions which merely amplified the growing feelings of unrest in the general public.  Humphrey's inaction during these activities along with President Johnson and Chicago Mayor Richard Daley's behind the scenes convention influencing, public backlash from securing the presidential nomination without entering a single primary, as well as Humphrey refusal to meet McCarthy half way on his demands, resulting in McCarthy's lack of full endorsement of Humphrey, highlighted turmoil in the Democratic party's base that proved to be too much for Humphrey to overcome in time for the general election. The combination of the unpopularity of Johnson, the Chicago demonstrations, and the discouragement of liberals and African-Americans when both Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. were assassinated during the election year, were all contributing factors that caused him to eventually lose the election to former Vice President Nixon.  Although he lost the election by less than 1% of the popular vote, 43.4% for Nixon (31,783,783 votes) to 42.7% (31,271,839 votes) for Humphrey, with 13.5% (9,901,118 votes) for George Wallace, Humphrey carried just 13 states with 191 electoral college votes. Richard Nixon carried 32 states and 301 electoral votes, and Wallace carried 5 states in the South and 46 electoral votes (270 were needed to win).

Now, bizarrely, a few drops of the first of these are coming up for sale at auction next month.      A phial containing traces of Churchill’s blood, drawn from the former prime minister as he recovered in hospital from a fractured hip, is being offered for sale to the highest bidder.      Churchill was treated in the Middlesex hospital in London in 1962 at the age of 87 after breaking his hip while in Monte Carlo, Monaco. It was feared that he would not survive but he soldiered on until the age of 90.            The blood taken at the Middlesex was about to be disposed of when a student nurse called Patricia Fitzgibbon asked if she could keep the tube, which was clearly labelled with Churchill’s name. She was given permission and kept it for the rest of her life. Now it is being put up for auction following her death.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Timothy Medhurst of Duke’s auction house with the phial of Winston Churchill’s blood. Photograph: Deep South Media      Timothy Medhurst, of Duke’s auction house in Dorset, said experts had estimated the lot at £300-£600. He said: “It is impossible to put an accurate estimate on this unique piece of history.            “It is probably the first time that such a personal piece of Churchill’s history has been offered on the open market. This year marks the 50-year anniversary of Churchill’s death. The blood is a poignant reminder of an injury which marked the beginning of the end for Churchill and, as such, we expect there to be great interest in it. It could sell for thousands.”      The blood will be sold together with a signed declaration by Fitzgibbon detailing the circumstances in which she acquired the phial.      In 2010 she recalled that, despite the severity of his injury, Churchill remained steadfast throughout his stay. She said: “I remember that he would never settle at night until after he had read the first edition of all the daily newspapers, which he had specially delivered.

The sample was collected in 1962 when the ‘blood, toil, tears and sweat’ orator was at The Middlesex Hospital being treated for a fractured hip.      Student nurse Patricia Fitzgibbon asked if she could keep the small glass tube that was labelled ‘Sir Winston S Churchill WWB9’, and her request was granted.      Following her death it is now being put up for sale at Duke’s of Dorchester in Dorset on March 12.      In 1962, Churchill, aged 87, was on holiday in Monte Carlo when he reportedly fell out of his bed, fracturing his hip.      He was flown back to London in an RAF VC10 jet at the request of the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.      He spent several weeks recovering in the Woolavington Wing for private patients at the hospita, when the phial of blood was taken.      His recovery was slow as he contracted bronchitis and pneumonia which in turn led to thrombosis.      It was widely anticipated that he would not survive the ordeal at his advanced age.      The blood was about to be thrown away when nurse Fitzgibbon was given permission to keep the 7cm-long tube.      In 2010 she remembered how, despite the severity of his injury, Churchill remained steadfast throughout his stay.      She said: “While the ward sister generally kept nurses out of his room, I did have occasional duties to carry out.      “I remember that he would never settle at night until after he had read the first edition of all the daily newspapers which he had specially delivered.      \\"He habitually smoked cigars in bed … [and] regularly mixed the first and second courses of his meal into one bowl before eating it!”      The blood – taken three years before Churchill’s death – is going under the hammer with an estimate of £300-600.      Timothy Medhurst from Duke’s said: “It is impossible to put an accurate estimate on this unique piece of history.      “There are just a couple of drops in the phial that is clearly labelled.      “At the time this blood was taken Churchill had already experienced a catalogue of injuries.      “So to have another devastating injury occur at such an old age was a threat to his stalwart ‘British Bulldog’ image.      “Though Churchill largely relied on his walking stick by the time this broken hip occurred, the operation to fix the fracture would have a caused a shortening in his leg and photographs following 1962 always show Churchill leaning on his iconic walking stick.      “This injury was also at a poignant moment in Churchill’s personal life – his beloved poodle Rufus II died whilst he was in hospital recovering.      “The blood will be sold together with a signed declaration by Patricia Fitzgibbon detailing the circumstances in which she acquired the phial.      “It is probably the first time that such a personal piece of Churchill’s history has been offered on the open market.      “This year marks the 50th anniversary of Churchill’s death. The blood is a poignant reminder of an injury which marked the beginning of the end for Churchill and as such, we expect there to be great interest in it. It could sell for thousands.”      On May 10, 1940, Churchill became Prime Minister and when he met his Cabinet on May 13 he told them: “I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.”      He repeated that phrase later in the day when he asked the House of Commons for a vote of confidence in his new all-party government that would stand up to the Nazi aggressors.      Also in the sale are a set of Churchill’s ‘The Second World War’ books, which he has inscribed as a gift for Mabel Johnson, who worked with Lady Spencer Churchill during the war.      These have an estimate of £4,000-8,000.

A couple accused of kidnapping of two Amish girls in upstate New York last month was indicted on federal sex exploitation charges Thursday. Nicole Vaisey, 25, and boyfriend Stephen Howells II, 39, were named in a five-count indictment in Syracuse. The charges included conspiracy to sexually exploit the two Amish girls along with a third female minor, according to a statement released by U.S. Attorney Richard Hartunian. Howells also was charged with possession of child pornography. The pair had previously been charged with the kidnapping of the two Amish girls -- ages 6 and 12 -- about 50 miles from the Canadian border on August 13. \\"This indictment charges Howells and Vaisey with enticing and coercing children to engage in sexual conduct and making a video recording of it,\\" Hartunian said in a statement. Vaisey and Howells both face a maximum of 30 years in prison on the sexual exploitation charges against children. Howells faces a maximum of 20 years on the child pornography charge. If convicted, both could be fined up to 250,000 on each count. The pair also faces criminal court charges of first-degree kidnapping after luring the young Amish girls into a car with a puppy, authorities in New York's St. Lawrence County said. Details about the abduction in Oswegatchie emerged during a preliminary hearing in St. Lawrence County in August. Detective Sgt. Brooks Bigwarfe detailed the couples' alleged plan and kidnapping of the girls, as related to him by Vaisey. Vaisey told investigators that she and Howells were on a \\"shopping trip\\" for \\"slaves\\" when they allegedly kidnapped the girls. \\"They had been planning this for several weeks,\\" Bigwarfe said. The girls were picked up at a vegetable stand outside a family farm. Howells and Vaisey pulled up to the stand in a location where they couldn't be seen, and waited for the girls to approach the car, Bigwarfe said. Howells allegedly scouted out the stand the previous week. Howells asked the girls whether they wanted to pet the dog, a Doberman pinscher-golden retriever mix named Kaleidoscope, police said. When the older child grew suspicious, Bigwarfe said, Howells pushed the girls into the back of the car. \\"When he started forcing them into the vehicle, they were both screaming and yelling,\\" Bigwarfe said. The girls were held captive for nearly 24 hours, during which they were handcuffed together, shackled to a bed and sexually abused, according to the sheriff's department. With widening media coverage, a large police response in the area and an Amber Alert, the couple began to worry and decided it was too risky to keep the girls, he said. Howells abandoned the two girls in an isolated area 12 miles from where they were being held, Bigwarfe said. Attorneys for Vaisey and Howell did not immediately return calls seeking comment. After her August arrest, Vaisey's attorney, Bradford Riendeau, told CNN that his client was allegedly in a master-slave relationship with Howells and that she was not the mastermind of the planned kidnapping.

(Financial Times) -- The Philippines would strongly support a rearmed Japan shorn of its pacifist constitution as a counterweight to the growing military assertiveness of China, according to the Philippine -foreign minister. \\"We would welcome that very much,\\" Albert del Rosario told the Financial Times in an interview. \\"We are looking for balancing factors in the region and Japan could be a significant balancing factor.\\" The unusual statement, which risks upsetting Beijing, reflects alarm in Manila at what it sees as Chinese provocation over the South China Sea, virtually all of which is claimed by Beijing. It also comes days before an election in Japan that could see the return as prime minister of Shinzo Abe, who is committed to revising Japan's pacifist constitution and to beefing up its military. The attitude towards Japanese rearmament in the Philippines, itself colonised by","output":"Japan during World War II, has shifted significantly in recent years. This change can be attributed to growing concerns over China's expansionist policies and military assertiveness in the region. As the Philippine foreign minister suggests, a stronger and more proactive Japan could serve as a stabilizing force and provide a much-needed balance to China's growing influence. The Philippine government's embrace of such a notion indicates its willingness to put aside historical grievances and prioritize regional peace and stability. This decision is likely driven by the desire to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity amidst ongoing disputes with China over the South China Sea. Moreover, the upcoming election in Japan and the potential return of Shinzo Abe to the position of prime minister adds another layer of complexity to the situation. With Abe's commitment to revise Japan's pacifist constitution and strengthen its military capabilities, the Philippines finds itself in a position where it must align its strategic interests with the evolving dynamics of the region. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete this passage is to highlight the shifting attitude of the Philippines towards Japanese rearmament due to concerns about China's military assertiveness, the necessity for a regional balance of power, and the changing political landscape in Japan. The Philippines is willing to support a rearmed Japan to ensure regional stability and safeguard its own interests, even if it means risking disagreements with China."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His NHL career began in 1987. McGeough was one of the last NHL officials to officiate NHL games without wearing a helmet when he was on the ice. In the 200607 NHL season, McGeough was forced by the NHL to wear a helmet on ice, as it was the first season that dictated that all on-ice officials had to do so. He now is helping the NHL bring up new recruits from the AHL. Entering the 200708 NHL season, McGeough had officiated 1,023 regular season and 63 post season games.  - James McGeough ( born April 13 , 1963 in Regina , Saskatchewan ) is a retired Canadian ice hockey player . He is the brother of former NHL referee Mick McGeough . Drafted in 1981 by the Washington Capitals , McGeough also played for the Pittsburgh Penguins .  - The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional ice hockey league currently composed of 31 member clubs. Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season.  - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team.  - Regina (is the capital city of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The city is the second-largest in the province, after Saskatoon, and a cultural and commercial centre for southern Saskatchewan. It is governed by Regina City Council. The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Sherwood No. 159.  - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.

Article: Should we be afraid of sharks ? Maybe not. New research into the reasons for shark attacks   suggests that sharks don't like the way humans taste! In fact, most people who are attacked by the shark are still alive after receiving only one bite  . Why is this? There are many opinions to explain why sharks sometimes attack people. One opinion is that sharks are just curious  . We know that sharks are the strongest animals in their environment, so they are not afraid of anything. Naturally, that means they are curious when they meet something unusual. Because they don't have hands or feet., the only way they can find out an object is to bite it! It is thought that sharks sometimes bite humans for this reason, and then swim away. Scientists also say that sharks would not waste energy trying to eat a human, as we have a lot of bones  . It is hard for a shark to eat us because sharks don't have hands, and they can't pull the meat off our bones. Maybe that's why they only bite us once. Unluckily, one bite from a large shark is serious enough to hurt people greatly! Another opinion is that sharks attack humans by mistake. Some sharks may sometimes mistake humans for a seal. An example of this is when a shark  attacks a surfer. A surfer lying on a surfboard looks like a seal when seen from below. Sharks like seals because they have thick fat. Whatever the reason for shark attacks on humans, sharks should be afraid of us. Sadly, we kill almost 40 million of them each year.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: It's not always possible to dispose of food immediately, such as if garbage collection is weekly. Leaving it in the garbage until then can generate smells, attract animals, and breed flies. Ideally it should be made of glass, such as a pickle or spaghetti sauce jar, with a tight-fitting lid.  Plastic jars can also be used, but may leak some odor. Sealable metal cans, such as coffee cans, can be used, but may create a rust ring if left in sink. Cardboard containers, like the cylinders oatmeal comes in, should be avoided.  They may leak when they get wet from decomposing food. Ideally the jar should be small enough for a single use.  Don't reopen it later, as this will let odor and potentially flies or fruit flies out, unless it has been kept frozen.  (It's also possible to dump the contents in the garbage and then rinse and reuse the slop jar, but this is messy, and should be done outside.) This will halt the decomposition process and kill any insects or larva.  This method can either be used in conjunction with a slop jar, or else large items, like a watermelon rind, can be placed in the freezer whole.  However, it's easy to forget these items on garbage day, so a Post-it note on the trash can is a good reminder.

To manage food waste, using a slop jar made of glass with a tight-fitting lid is ideal, as it prevents odors and pests. Plastic jars and sealable metal cans can be used, but they have their drawbacks, such as leaking odors or causing rust rings. Cardboard containers should be avoided as they can leak when wet. Slop jars should be small and used only once before disposal to prevent releasing odors and pests when reopened. An alternative method is freezing food waste, which halts decomposition and kills insects, either in a slop jar or by freezing large items. Remember to dispose of frozen waste on garbage day by using a reminder, such as a Post-it note on the trash can."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

On 4/29/14 in the late evening, I was dismayed to discover a scorpion on the back deck of the house we had just moved into days before.  I have a young daughter and a small dog and scorpions greatly concern me.  We had asked the landlord about scorpions prior to signing anything and it was claimed that there were no scorpions.  Of course, we live in the desert so I took this claim with a grain of salt.  On the morning of 4/30/14, I began my search for a reputable pest company that could help me with my problem.  I called a couple of places (surprisingly to me all went to voice-mails) and left messages for a few.  David with Arizona Pest Squad called me back relatively shortly after I left my message and we had a good conversation about my problem.  David was very friendly, extremely knowledgeable, and thoroughly explained things to me as far as the products they use and what is recommended for treatment of my scorpion problem.

David let me know that he would get with a technician and they would let me know when they could make it out.  A few hours later, I received a call from Rex stating that he was finishing up a job not too far away and that he could be at my house in 45 minutes if that was okay with me.  I knew that I would be home so agreed to the appointment.  Rex showed up on time and was extremely friendly.

Background: Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.  Paragraph: Two farms used AM fungi for the plants. Brown farm also decided to grow cover crops on those parcels of land to help mycorrhizal growth. Orange farm didn't grow cover crops.

In the year 1978, Gracie Bowen, a 15-year-old tomboy who lives in South Orange, New Jersey, is crazy about soccer, as are her three brothers and their former soccer star father. Although Gracie wants to join her brothers and neighbor Kyle in the nightly practices her father runs, she is discouraged by everyone except her older brother, Johnny. Johnny, Gracie and Kyle attend Columbia High School, where Johnny is the captain and star player for the varsity soccer team. After missing a shot at the end of a game, the despondent Johnny drives off with a friend's car and dies in a traffic accident. Struggling with grief, Gracie decides that she wants to replace her brother on the team. Her father does not believe that girls should play soccer, telling her she is neither tough nor talented enough. Her mother is a nurse who lacks the competitive drive of the rest of her family and fears for Gracie's safety. Her mother later tells Gracie that she would have liked to become a surgeon, but that option had not been available to her as a woman. Rejected and depressed, Gracie begins to rebel; she stops doing her schoolwork, is caught cheating on an exam, and experiments with wild and self-destructive behavior.

Write highlights for this article: Water with trace amounts of radioactivity may have leaked for months from a U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarine as it traveled around the Pacific to ports in Guam, Japan and Hawaii, Navy officials told CNN on Friday. The USS Houston arrives in Pearl Harbor for routine maintenance, during which the leak was found. The leak was found on the USS Houston, a Los Angeles-class fast attack submarine, after it went to Hawaii for routine maintenance last month, Navy officials said. Navy officials said the amount of radiation leaked into the water was virtually undetectable. But the Navy alerted the Japanese government because the submarine had been docked in Japan. The problem was discovered last month when a build-up of leaking water popped a covered valve and poured onto a sailor's leg while the submarine was in dry dock. An investigation found a valve was slowly dripping water from the sub's nuclear power plant. The water had not been in direct contact with the nuclear reactor, Navy officials said. Officials with knowledge of the incident could not quantify the amount of radiation leaked but insisted it was \\"negligible\\" and an \\"extremely low level.\\" The total amount leaked while the sub was in port in Guam, Japan and Hawaii was less than a half of a microcurie (0.0000005 curies), or less than what is found in a 50-pound bag of lawn and garden fertilizer, the officials said. The sailor who was doused, a Houston crew member, tested negative for radiation from the water, according to Navy officials. Since March, the Houston had crisscrossed the western Pacific, spending a week in Japan and several weeks in both Guam and Hawaii, Navy officials said.  See a timeline of the sub's movements ». The Navy on Friday notified the Japanese government of the leak, the officials said, and told them it was possible the ship had been leaking while in port in Sasebo, Japan, in March. While Japan has agreed to allow U.S. nuclear-powered ships in Japanese ports, the decision was a not popular in Japan. The Houston incident comes at a time when the Navy is trying to smooth over a problem with a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The USS George Washington was due to replace the aging, conventionally powered USS Kitty Hawk this summer as the United States' sole carrier based in Japan. While en route to Japan this May, a massive fire broke out on the George Washington, causing 70 million in damage. The fire was blamed on crew members smoking near improperly stored flammable materials. There was no damage or threat to the nuclear reactor, but the ship was diverted to San Diego, California, for repairs. It now is expected to arrive in Japan at the end of September. The Navy this week fired the captain and his deputy, saying an investigation into the fire led to a lack of confidence in the leadership of both men. Just two weeks ago, thousands of Japanese protested the pending arrival of the George Washington.","output":"A U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarine, the USS Houston, may have leaked water with trace amounts of radioactivity for months while traveling around the Pacific to ports in Guam, Japan, and Hawaii.

But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Thunderstorms form over the ocean - An area of low pressure causes rotation - Several thunderstorms come together around this area - The storm is fed by rising air from warm ocean water evaporating - When the wind speeds reach 74 mph the storm is considered a hurricane.  Question: suppose more water vapor is collected happens, how will it affect MORE POWERFUL hurricanes.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If more water vapor is collected in the atmosphere, it will likely lead to MORE POWERFUL hurricanes. The reason for this is that hurricanes draw their energy from the warm, moist air that rises from the ocean surface. Specifically, the heat energy from the evaporation of warm ocean water fuels the hurricane's development and intensification. In the process you described, several thunderstorms come together and form around an area of low pressure to create a tropical cyclone or hurricane. The energy from the continuous evaporation of warm ocean water fuels the storm and allows it to continue developing. As more water vapor is added to the atmosphere, the potential energy for hurricane formation and intensification increases. This additional water vapor can cause hurricanes to become more intense and powerful due to the increased energy available to them. Regarding the second effect you mentioned, which is the area of low pressure causing rotation, the increased presence of water vapor may not have a direct impact on the rotation process. The rotation of the storm is mainly influenced by the Earth's rotation and the Coriolis effect, which is not directly affected by the amount of water vapor present. However, the intensified storm due to more water vapor could lead to stronger winds, indirectly enhancing the rotation process. In summary, the presence of more water vapor in the atmosphere can lead to more powerful and intense hurricanes, but it may have no direct effect on the area of low pressure causing rotation. The perturbation's indirect influence on the second effect can lead to stronger winds, enhancing the rotation process but not directly affecting the low pressure itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Iron in a circular motion with a dry, hot iron for 5 seconds. Using a paper towel apply a small amount of olive oil to the white, cloudy spot just heated. Repeat both steps until the white, cloudy spot is completely removed from the wooden furniture. This method makes more sense for accomplishing the goal of removing cloudy, white spots from wooden furniture, as it involves using heat to break up the moisture trapped within the finish that causes the white, cloudy appearance, and then applying a small amount of olive oil for rejuvenating the wood. First, by placing a pressing cloth over the cloudy spot, you are providing a protective layer between the furniture's surface and the iron. This helps prevent any direct heat damage to the wood. Ironing in a circular motion for 5 seconds allows for even distribution of heat over the area, effectively raising the temperature throughout the spot. This will cause the moisture trapped inside the finish to evaporate, thus removing a significant part of the cloudy appearance. Once the area has been heated, applying a small amount of olive oil with a paper towel helps to recondition the wood and replenish any natural oils that may have been lost during the heating process. This step helps to restore the wood's natural luster and provide a protective layer, which can prevent future cloudy spots from forming. Repeating the process of heating and oiling will gradually help to remove the entire cloudy, white spot from the wooden furniture. It also allows you to monitor the progress and ensure that you're not causing any harm to the furniture. Consequently, this method is a sensible approach to removing cloudy spots from wooden furniture, ensuring a gentle yet effective treatment for the affected area."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? My friends and I visited Las Vegas for the first time the week of 6/30 through 7/7.  We decided that Saturday night we would enjoy a fine dining experience and then see what the nightlife had to offer.  We got dressed and headed out to the strip sometime around 7PM.  After debating on where to eat we settled on Giada (she is my partner and I's favorite chef after all!).  We were all dressed in appropriate attire, however at the reception desk we were treated as though we had walked in wearing flip-flops and tattered shorts.  We made our way up the escalator and I approached the desk.  A young dirty-blonde haired woman greeted me and I stated that I had a party of 6 and we wished to have dinner.  She started to say \\"Oh I\\"m sorry but we...\\"  At that moment another blonde haired woman (slightly older) literally nudged her with her elbow and said \\"be nice\\".  She then preceded to ask me if I would perhaps like to see the menu before we were seated.  Essentially she was insinuating that we obviously could not afford a meal there and looked the part to boot.  I was infuriated, however being the opposite of what hey assumed I was I played along and agreed to see the menu.  We were then whisked away on a tour of the kitchen area and finally seated.  The drink menu was very unique (based on Giada's father's favorite films), I had a Hannibal which was great and my partner had the Barbarella (his favorite film) which was equally refreshing.  We ordered Giada's favorites and calamari for the table as the antipasto, spaghetti and tortellini for the pasta and shared the porterhouse steak with a side of polenta.  The food was amazing just as we expected, however the treatment by the staff left a sour taste in our mouths.  There were other patrons sitting near us wearing shorts and t-shirts whom I am sure were not treated as we were.  The main reason in my opinion is because we mostly looked Hispanic unlike the fairer skinned individuals who were poorly dressed.  While the food was amazing, we will not be visiting Giada again.  I myself have experienced true Italian hospitality, unfortunately it was nowhere to be found at Giada....OPTIONS: 1. negative. 2. positive. I think the answer is","output":"1. negative. To justify my answer, let's examine the review step-by-step: 1. The user and their friends went to Las Vegas and wanted a fine dining experience. 2. They chose Giada's restaurant, as Giada is the user's favorite chef. 3. Despite being dressed appropriately, the user felt they were treated poorly at the reception desk. 4. The user mentioned the staff making insinuations about their financial status, which infuriated them. 5. The user enjoyed the unique drinks and the food at the restaurant. 6. However, the user suspected that they were treated poorly due to their Hispanic appearance, as other patrons with more casual attire did not seem to face the same treatment. 7. The user states they won't be visiting the restaurant again because the negative treatment by the staff overshadowed their experience. While there are positive aspects mentioned (the food and drinks), the overall sentiment of the review is negative, as the user expresses dissatisfaction with their treatment at the restaurant and a reluctance to return."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choices: [i] no; [ii] yes;","output":"[i] no; While both questions are related to the concept of improving intelligence, they are not paraphrases of each other. The first question inquires about the relationship between exercising (presumably physical exercise) and intelligence, while the second question focuses on mental math as a means to exercise the brain and improve general intelligence.  To address the first question, numerous scientific studies have shown that engaging in regular physical exercise can have a positive impact on cognitive function and overall intelligence. Some of the benefits of exercise are more immediate, such as improvements in memory, attention, and problem-solving skills, while others develop over time, such as increased neural connections and enhanced neuroplasticity (the brain's ability to form and reorganize synaptic connections). Physical exercise has been shown to increase the production of hormones such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which plays a critical role in the growth, maintenance, and survival of neurons. Additionally, exercise improves blood flow and oxygenation to the brain, contributing to better cognitive function. Furthermore, exercising also helps reduce stress and anxiety levels, which may lead to improved mental clarity and focus. Overall, a consistent exercise routine can positively influence brain health and cognitive abilities, thereby making a person \\"smarter\\" to some extent.  Regarding the second question, mental math can indeed help exercise the brain and improve cognitive skills. Mental math challenges the brain to make calculations and solve problems in one's head, without external tools such as paper or calculators. This process requires the brain to engage in various cognitive functions, such as working memory, attention, and concentration. Practicing mental math can improve one's numerical abilities, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Moreover, engaging in consistent mental math exercises can support the development of memory, attention, and reasoning abilities, leading to an overall improvement in general intelligence. However, it is important to note that mental math is just one aspect of cognitive training. Balance and variety in cognitive exercises help ensure overall mental development. As such, engaging in a range of brain activities, including the arts, puzzles, reading, and learning new skills, can contribute to a more well-rounded improvement in general intelligence. In conclusion, while both physical exercise and mental math can have positive effects on cognitive function and general intelligence, these two questions focus on different aspects of intelligence improvement and are not simply paraphrases of each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The citizens of both cities are voting on whether to continue their current method of electricity generation.  But I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out.

Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary.

In this statement, the speaker is clearly expressing their belief that the people of Libya hold a strong devotion to their religious beliefs, and that these beliefs form a central part of their cultural identity. This commitment to faith in God is so deep-rooted that nothing else besides God has the power to instill fear or inspire reverence in them. The phrase \\"only worships God\\" signifies that the people of Libya are devoted to their faith and would not indulge in worshipping other deities or symbolic figures. This unwavering loyalty to their religion can be seen as an essential aspect of the Libyan national identity, as well as an important guiding force within their society. The phrase \\"fears only God\\" further emphasizes the importance of religious faith in Libyan culture. In this context, fear should be interpreted as a form of respect or awe, rather than a negative, paralyzing emotion. It means that the people hold God in such high regard that they consider Him as the ultimate authority in their lives and the only being truly worthy of their fear or veneration. By extension, the statement also implies that the people of Libya are not easily intimidated by external forces and threats – because their devotion is to a higher power, they may remain true to their core values even in the face of adversity.

Once the butterfly has successfully pumped blood into its wings, gaining enough strength to enable flight, it takes off in search of several resources it needs for sustenance and reproduction. Some key activities that the butterfly engages in as part of its adult life include: 1. Feeding: Adult butterflies mainly feed on nectar from flowers, which serves as an essential energy source for activities such as flying, reproducing, and even thermoregulation. They may also consume other sources of nutrients like fruit juices, tree sap, or even dissolved nutrients from animal manure or carcasses. 2. Mating: One of the primary goals of the adult butterfly is to find a mate to continue the life cycle and ensure the survival of the species. Mating rituals can vary between different butterfly species. In many cases, males will use their vibrant wing color patterns to attract females, and the butterflies may engage in courtship dances or flights. After a successful mating, the female butterfly will carry fertilized eggs and start looking for suitable host plants to lay the eggs on. 3. Migration: Some species of butterflies, such as the Monarch butterfly, undertake a remarkable migration journey of thousands of miles, in search of ideal conditions to feed and reproduce. These migrations can span multiple generations as they fly to find their breeding grounds, spend the summer breeding, and then journey back to their overwintering sites. 4. Thermoregulation: Butterflies are ectothermic animals, which means that they rely on external sources to regulate their body temperature. Adult butterflies need to maintain an optimal internal temperature to fly and perform other essential activities. They may engage in basking, where they spread their wings and orient themselves towards the sun to absorb heat, or find shade to cool down when the temperatures are too high. 5. Predator avoidance: Butterflies face numerous dangers during their adult life, including predators like birds, spiders, and other insects. They have evolved various strategies to avoid becoming prey, such as toxic chemicals or warning coloration to deter predators or even mimicry to camouflage with their surroundings. Once the adult butterfly has accomplished its primary objectives of feeding, mating, and, in some cases, migration, the butterflies reach the end of their life cycle. The next generation of butterflies is born when the fertilized eggs hatch, entering the metamorphic process, ultimately resulting in a new lineage of adult butterflies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Eytan Fox, whilst generally leaning on the apologist side of Israeli politics, has made several quite interesting films in the past such as \\"Walk on Water\\" and the simply wonderful film, \\"Yossi & Jagger\\". In \\"The Bubble\\", however, he has taken this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme. Far from giving this film a standing ovation, the people at the screening I attended quietly got up and left. I also quietly left, fuming with anger at such a ridiculously one-sided film that translates self-preservation as racist bullying, and racist bullying (and terrorism) as outbursts of justified anger; which implies that Arabs are so wronged by the evil Israelis that they react in anger to a constant stream of one-sided Israeli aggression against them, and that they, therefore, should not be held responsible for their actions.

A forward, he played for several clubs including Liverpool and Hamburger SV. He went on to manage Newcastle United, Fulham and Manchester City, winning promotion as champions in his first full season at all three clubs. He also managed the England national team. After weeks of speculation, Keegan was named as the new England manager on 18 February 1999, succeeding Glenn Hoddle, who had been sacked two weeks earlier following a newspaper interview in which he suggested that disabled people were being punished for their sins in a previous life. He led the team to a winning start with 3-1 victory over Poland to reignite England's Euro 2000 qualifying campaign, and they entered the qualification playoff with Scotland. Two goals from Paul Scholes gave them a 2-0 win in the first leg, and despite a 1-0 defeat in the second leg, they qualified for the championships for the fourth tournament in succession (though on the third occasion, they had qualified automatically as hosts).  After an initial popular period as manager, he began to come under fire for his perceived tactical naivety. This came to a head during the unsuccessful Euro 2000 campaign, which began with a 3-2 defeat against Portugal, despite England having taken a 2-0 lead after 17 minutes. A 1-0 win in the next game over Germany, the first English victory over Germany in a competitive match since 1966, cost their opposition (the defending champions) progression to the quarter-finals, but in the final group game against Romania, England once again lost 3-2, this time after taking a 2-1 lead, and their hopes of reaching the quarter-finals were over.  Keegan resigned as England manager on 7 October 2000, after England lost to a Dietmar Hamann goal for Germany in their first 2002 World Cup qualifier, in the last game to be played at Wembley Stadium, before the old stadium was rebuilt. Keegan won only 38.9% of his games in charge, the lowest such percentage of any permanent England manager - although unlike Don Revie (1974-1977) or Steve McClaren (2006-2007), Keegan achieved qualification to a major tournament for England.  When Sven-Goran Eriksson became England manager, Eriksson appointed the 64-year-old Tord Grip as his assistant.

The Telegraph reports Idaho teen Erik Finman, after dropping out of high school, made a bet with his parents that if he made 1 million by the time he turned 18, he wouldn't have to go to college. \\"I won the million dollar bet,\\" Finman triumphantly tweeted Tuesday. Finman's journey to teenage millionaire started with 1,000 his grandma gave him when he was 12. He invested the money in bitcoin—which then cost 12 each—and by 2013, his bitcoins were worth 100,000, CNBC reports. Finman cashed out some of his bitcoins to start online teaching company Botangle, for which an investor gave him another 300 bitcoin. Flash forward to 2017, and Finman's 403 bitcoins have a value of 1.09 million. Finman left school because he thought it was a waste of time and his teachers were too negative. He says they made his poor academic performance \\"seem like a bad thing.\\" Since dropping out of high school, Finman has moved to San Francisco and interned at various start-ups. Now, with a million dollars to his name, he says he wouldn't advise a formal education. \\"It doesn't work for anyone,\\" he says. \\"I would recommend the internet, which is all free. You can learn a million times more off YouTube and Wikipedia.\\" Despite analysts saying bitcoin is nearing its peak value, Finman isn't cashing out. He says he thinks his bitcoins could one day be worth up to 403 million. (This man's 1,000 investment became 2 million. Then he gave it all away.)

He felt that it wasn't helping him learn the things he needed to know, and his teachers seemed unhappy about his grades. Erik had a big idea to make things change. He decided to make a bet with his parents. He told them that if he could make one million dollars before he turned 18 years old, he wouldn't have to go to college. His parents agreed to the bet. When Erik was 12, his grandma gave him a special gift of 1,000. Instead of spending the money on toys or games, Erik decided to use it for something really smart: he bought digital coins called \\"bitcoins\\". Back then, bitcoins were worth 12 each. By the time Erik was 15, the value of his bitcoins had gone up a lot! They were worth 100,000! Erik decided to use some of his bitcoins to start a new business called Botangle. It was a place where people could learn things online without going to school.  A kind person who liked Erik's idea gave him 300 more bitcoins to help his business grow. Time went by, and when Erik was 18, he had 403 bitcoins in total. Guess what? The value of those bitcoins was 1.09 million! Erik had won the bet with his parents! Even though Erik won his bet, he doesn't think everyone should stop going to school or college. He believes that the internet can help people learn more and that websites like YouTube and Wikipedia are great ways to learn for free. Erik has big dreams for his future. He thinks his bitcoins might be worth even more someday, maybe up to 403 million! So, he's not going to trade them for cash just yet.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the translation: 1. \\"And\\" can be translated in Czech as \\"A\\". Note that the capitalization is not necessary in this context, as the sentence translation assumes a conversational context. The capitalization of \\"A\\" in the translation is used for clarity purposes only. 2. \\"a saga\\" refers to a long narrative, usually a story about the history or the heroic achievements of a certain person or a group. The Czech word for \\"saga\\" is \\"sága\\". 3. \\"shield\\" can be translated to Czech as \\"štít\\". It refers to a protective piece of armor, traditionally carried by warriors, that serves to deflect or absorb the impact of blows, projectiles, or other forms of attack. 4.

However, the pocket watch can be more than just an exquisite accessory; it can also be an ingenious tool for keeping your essential notes close at hand. Don't believe us? Here's a simple hack that could change the way you view pocket watches forever. Step 1: Choose the Right Pocket Watch To maximize the functionality of this hack, you need to select a pocket watch that comes equipped with a lid. The lid serves as a protective cover that conceals your notes while ensuring that your timepiece remains a discreet and stylish accessory. Additionally, the lid enables you to retrieve your notes without drawing undue attention to yourself – an invaluable quality for those who might be accessing their notes in formal or social settings. Step 2: Prepare Your Notes Identify the information you want to have readily available and jot it down on a piece of paper. Given the compact size of a pocket watch, we recommend keeping your notes concise and to-the-point. Alternatively, you can use abbreviations, symbols, or even a unique code system to ensure that your notes will fit comfortably within the watch's dimensions. Step 3: Attach the Notes to Your Watch After you've prepared your notes, cut the paper to fit the inside of the pocket watch's lid. Using a small piece of clear tape, affix the note to the watch's interior surface, ensuring that it lies flat and unobtrusive. Remember to avoid obstructing the watch's hands or mechanism, as this could potentially damage your timepiece. Step 4: Become an Expert at Checking the Time – And Accessing Your Notes With your notes securely in place, you can now access them discreetly by pretending to check the time on your pocket watch. Hold the watch naturally, perhaps even slightly cupping it in your hand, and glance at your notes as if glancing at the time. By maintaining a calm and collected demeanor, you'll avoid arousing suspicion while simultaneously having your essential information at your fingertips. Conclusion The humble pocket watch may have lost some of its popularity and practicality with the advent of modern smartwatches, but it still stands as a symbol of elegance and refinement. By adding this simple hack, you can transform your pocket watch into a functional and clever tool that combines the best of old-world charm and modern innovation. So next time you're looking for a practical and stylish solution for keeping your notes close at hand, remember to turn to the pocket watch for that perfect balance of form and function."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Question: how the capital of brazil, brasilia was created I found the following answer on Google: However, as a metropolitan area , it ranks lower at sixth in population. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"No, that answer does not correctly describe how the capital of Brazil, Brasília, was created. Let me give you a detailed answer. The idea of building a new capital for Brazil had been considered since the country's independence in 1822, primarily to promote the development of the interior and to reduce the country's coastal concentration. In the late 1950s, Brazilian president Juscelino Kubitschek decided to move forward with constructing a new capital to achieve these goals. The location for Brasília was chosen through a wide national competition, with the winning proposal situated in the Central Plateau region of Brazil. The city was designed by renowned Brazilian architect and urban planner Lúcio Costa and prominent architect Oscar Niemeyer, who was responsible for designing many of the city's signature buildings. Construction of Brasília took place at a rapid pace, officially starting in 1956 and being completed by 1960, when it was inaugurated as the country's new capital. The city was designed in a modernist style with a unique layout resembling the shape of an airplane or bird, consisting of various \\"sectors\\" designated for specific purposes, such as residential, commercial, and government areas. As for the population, Brasília currently ranks as the fourth-largest city in Brazil. However, as you mentioned, it has a lower population ranking when considering the metropolitan area, placing sixth in the country. In summary, Brasília was created to promote the development of Brazil's interior and reduce coastal concentration by establishing a new and modern capital city, designed and built with efforts led by key figures like Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Definition: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Input: Step 1: For each row in Tryout table, find corresponding rows in College table and in Player table. Step 2: find the average HS in the results of step 1 whose state equals no Output:","output":"To accomplish this task, you can use the following SQL statement: \`\`\`sql SELECT AVG(Tryout.HS) AS average_HS FROM Tryout JOIN College ON Tryout.college_id = College.id JOIN Player ON Tryout.player_id = Player.id WHERE College.state = 'no'; \`\`\` Explanation of the SQL statement: 1. I used the \\"SELECT\\" statement followed by the aggregate function \\"AVG\\" to calculate the average of the \\"HS\\" column in the Tryout table. 2. I used the \\"FROM\\" statement to specify the main table, which is the Tryout table in this case. 3. I used the \\"JOIN\\" statement to join the Tryout table with the College table using the condition \\"Tryout.college_id = College.id\\". 4. I used another \\"JOIN\\" statement to join the Tryout table with the Player table using the condition \\"Tryout.player_id = Player.id\\". 5. I used the \\"WHERE\\" statement to filter the results based on the condition \\"College.state = 'no'\\".

(CNN) -- Guatemala's government has declared a state of siege and sent hundreds of troops to a northern province where officials say a Mexican drug gang is overtaking towns and threatening residents. President Alvaro Colom announced the 30-day emergency rule in Alta Verapaz on Sunday. The rule allows the military to order anyone suspected of conspiring against the government to be arrested and imprisoned without a warrant, the state-run AGN news agency said. \\"Starting today, combined forces will retake the streets of Alta Verapaz,\\" a government statement released Sunday morning said. Government data shows cells of the drug gang known as Los Zetas are in the area to protect drug trafficking paths between Honduras and Mexico, \\"intimidating the population with their heavy weapons and threatening farmers to give up their land for criminal activities,\\" AGN reported. The state of siege also allows the government to place greater restrictions on public gatherings, travel visas and gun licenses, among other things, according to AGN. \\"The population should be calm. What we are doing is not intended to persecute honest, working people,\\" Interior Minister Carlos Menocal told reporters. Menocal said operations in the coming days would aim to boost regional security, regain control of territory, identify criminal gangs and capture their members. In an interview with CNN en Espanol last month, Menocal said his country needed more help from the United States to combat cartels, which were increasingly carving out new drug transport paths. \\"In the end, the large majority of drugs travel through Central America, and the assignment of resources or the financial support of the United States government is not the same as Colombia and Mexico receive,\\" he said.

At a height of 1.94 meters, he is particularly tall, which is often advantageous for a player in his position, that is a goalkeeper. Valerio Olivera began his youth career at Real Madrid, one of the most successful football clubs in the world, which indicates he exhibited a talent for the sport from an early age. His professional career began in 1995, a career that would span over a decade. During this time, he moved between multiple clubs, starting with Real Poli Ejido in 2001. In 2002, he transitioned to Madrid Hércules and stayed there until 2003. Over the next four years, from 2003 to 2007, he played for Albacete Betis Elche. For the portion of the year 2007, the data doesn’t provide information on his involvement with any club. Moving to 2008, he had another stint with Elche, lasting until 2011. Furthermore, he had brief periods at Tenerife in 1996 and Almeria from 1996 to 1997. Proving his dedication to the defensive side of the game, the record shows he did not score any goals throughout his professional career. This is not surprising, though, as goalkeepers rarely had opportunities to score. In terms of caps, the data indicates Valerio Olivera played 56 times for Real Poli Ejido, then 16 times for Madrid Hércules. After that, he made 35 appearances for Albacete Betis Elche. During his period at Elche, he made 38 initial appearances, but following his return in 2008, he demonstrated a significant rise in appearances with 97 caps. He had only 4 appearances for Tenerife and made 69 for Almeria. Overall, the information suggests a seasoned goalkeeper who had a long career with various Spanish clubs. Through analysing this data, it is clear that the player in question is Joaquín Enrique Valerio Olivera."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two families had children that played together in the park. Jones family were anti-vaxxers, so they never vaccinated against any disease. Dean family did all the required vaccinations.  Hint: You don’t have to suffer through an infection to gain immunity to some diseases. Immunity can also come about by vaccination. Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to pathogens on purpose so the person will develop immunity to them. In vaccination, the pathogens are usually injected under the skin. Only part of the pathogens are injected, or else weakened or dead pathogens are used. This causes an immune response without causing the disease.

Background: Sir David Frederick Attenborough  (UK: ; born 8 May 1926) is an English broadcaster and naturalist. He is best known for writing and presenting, in conjunction with the BBC Natural History Unit, the nine natural history documentary series that form the Life collection, which form a comprehensive survey of animal and plant life on Earth. He is a former senior manager at the BBC, having served as controller of BBC Two and director of programming for BBC Television in the 1960s and 1970s. He is the only person to have won BAFTAs for programmes in each of black and white, colour, HD, 3D and 4K. Context: Attenborough was born in Isleworth, Middlesex (now part of west London), but grew up in College House on the campus of the University College, Leicester, where his father, Frederick, was principal. He is the middle of three sons (his elder brother, Richard, became an actor and director and his younger brother, John, was an executive at Italian car manufacturer Alfa Romeo), and the only surviving child among them. During World War II, through a British volunteer network known as the Refugee Children's Movement, his parents also fostered two Jewish refugee girls from Europe.  Attenborough spent his childhood collecting fossils, stones and other natural specimens. He received encouragement in this pursuit at age seven, when a young Jacquetta Hawkes admired his \\"museum\\". He also spent a considerable amount of his time in the grounds of the university, and, aged 11, he heard that the zoology department needed a large supply of newts, which he offered via his father to supply for 3d each. The source, which wasn't revealed at the time, was a pond less than five metres from the department. A few years later, one of his adoptive sisters gave him a piece of amber filled with prehistoric creatures; some 50 years later, it would be the focus of his programme The Amber Time Machine.  In 1936 David and his brother Richard attended a lecture by Grey Owl (Archibald Belaney) at De Montfort Hall, Leicester, and were influenced by his advocacy of conservation. According to Richard, David was \\"bowled over by the man's determination to save the beaver, by his profound knowledge of the flora and fauna of the Canadian wilderness and by his warnings of ecological disaster should the delicate balance between them be destroyed. The idea that mankind was endangering nature by recklessly despoiling and plundering its riches was unheard of at the time, but it is one that has remained part of Dave's own credo to this day.\\" In 1999, Richard directed a biopic of Belaney entitled Grey Owl.  Attenborough was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester and then won a scholarship to Clare College, Cambridge in 1945, where he studied geology and zoology and obtained a degree in natural sciences. In 1947 he was called up for national service in the Royal Navy and spent two years stationed in North Wales and the Firth of Forth.  In 1950 Attenborough married Jane Elizabeth Ebsworth Oriel; she died in 1997. The couple had two children, Robert and Susan. Robert is a senior lecturer in bioanthropology for the School of Archaeology and Anthropology at the Australian National University in Canberra. Susan is a former primary school headmistress.

Police believe the other bodies are the couple's son, Philip, 10, and housekeeper Veralicia Figueroa, 57.      The events that led to their deaths may have begun Wednesday, police said.

There is no sign of forced entry into the home, police said. The fire took about 30 minutes to extinguish. ||||| D.C. police and D.C. Fire officials comb the scene at the 3200 block of Woodland Drive NW, where four people were found dead at a house fire. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)      When Debra Masser spoke to her brother Savvas Savopoulos by phone Thursday morning, the chief executive and father of a prominent local family seemed to be untroubled and in good spirits.      But hours later, Savopoulos, his wife and two others authorities believe are the couple’s young son and their housekeeper were found dead by firefighters who battled a blaze at their Northwest Washington home.      Police on Friday continued to try to piece together what happened to the well-liked family, even as the mystery around the case deepened. D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier said that the fire at the stately home on Woodland Drive NW was intentionally set, that three of the victims inside had wounds, and that the family’s Porsche 911 was found torched in a church parking lot in Hyattsville, Md.      The deaths shocked family, friends and neighbors, who said they had seen nothing amiss with the five-member clan in the days and weeks before the fire. Some gathered to mourn at Washington National Cathedral, while investigators continued to pore over the charred red brick home.      “I can’t even express my sorrow,” Masser said. “I can’t even say anything.”      Savvas Savopoulos and Amy Savopoulos at the Starlight Children’s Foundation MidAtlantic’s Wine Dinner in 2008. (Tony Powell/Washington Life Magazine)      Lanier said police had positively identified two of the dead as Savvas Savopoulos, 46, and his wife, Amy, 47. They have tentatively identified the other victims as the couple’s 10-year-old son, Philip, and a 57-year-old housekeeper, Veralicia Figueroa, of Silver Spring, Md.      Lanier said that three victims suffered blunt-force or sharp-object wounds and that all four deaths in the upscale neighborhood near the vice president’s residence were being investigated as homicides.      “Evidence collection will go on for several days,” Lanier said. “There’s still a lot more we don’t know.”      Lanier renewed a call she originally made Thursday for information about the family’s blue 2008 Porsche 911, which disappeared from the home Thursday morning.      She asked the public to contact authorities if anyone had seen it between Wednesday and Thursday at 5 p.m. — a longer time frame than authorities had initially requested. Lanier declined to explain why investigators now wanted to know about the car’s whereabouts a day earlier.      The Porsche was found burning in Prince George’s County on Thursday evening, Lanier said. Prince George’s County Fire spokesman Mark Brady said firefighters extinguished the fire about 5:30 p.m. behind a church at 8201 Annapolis Rd. in Lanham, Md. Lanier said it was unclear who had been driving the vehicle.      Lanier said there was no evidence to suggest random or forced entry into the Savopouloses’ home but asked anyone who had seen anything suspicious in the area to call police. Asked whether the house had been ransacked, Lanier said it was “difficult to make that determination” because of the fire. Authorities have been going through the home to try to determine whether anything was stolen, according to two officials with knowledge of the case.      Police say three of the four victims found in a burning Northwest D.C. home on Thursday suffered blunt force or sharp object wounds. Their deaths are being investigated as homicides. (WUSA9)      The Savopouloses are survived by two teenage daughters, who friends said were at their boarding schools Thursday. Abigail Savopoulos is a senior at Mercersburg Academy, an elite private school in Pennsylvania, and is scheduled to graduate next week. Her younger sister, Katerina, is a junior at Peddie School near Princeton, N.J.      Philip was a student at St. Albans School in the District.      Neighbors said the family had lived on the block for more than a decade. They described the community as tightknit and said the Savopouloses were an integral part of it. They regularly held gatherings at their home for neighbors and friends. They attended church at the nearby St. Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral for about 10 years.      Coco Palomeque, a friend who lives in the neighborhood, said the Savopouloses were “a beautiful family.”      “The community where they lived really loved them,” she said.      Savvas Savopoulos was the president and chief executive of Hyattsville-based American Iron Works, which played a role in building Verizon Center and ­CityCenterDC. His Facebook page says he also worked for Sigma Investment Strategies in Puerto Rico. American Iron Works officials declined to comment.      Amy Savopoulos was widely known as a deeply involved mother who spent much of her time volunteering at her children’s schools or raising funds for them.      On her Facebook page, her daughter Abigail posted a tribute on Mother’s Day: “I am so grateful for everything you do. Thank you for always believing in me and supporting me. Thank you for the early morning crafts, upside down clowns on my birthday, gingerbread decorating parties, and for always showing up. . . . Thank you for the past 19 years and I look forward to the many more to come. I love you so much.”      About 180 people gathered to mourn the family Friday afternoon in a lower-level chapel at Washington National Cathedral. The 30-minute service included prayer, singing and periods of silence.      Many who had come were struggling not only with what happened, but also with how to discuss it with their children, said the Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, who helped lead the service.      “When people grieve, they want to be with other people,” Budde said. “Everyone is really sad, and really shocked.”      Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who has known the family for more than 20 years, said in a statement that he was saddened. Savvas Savopoulos raised money for Van Hollen’s campaigns.      “My heart goes out to the Savopoulos family at this time of unspeakable tragedy,” the statement read. “They were an important part of the community and will be deeply missed.”      As friends and relatives grieved, investigators wearing yellow hard hats walked in and out of the gutted Savopoulos home. Yellow police tape still blocked off sections of Woodland Drive and 32nd Street NW, and a large ATF explosives and fire investigation vehicle was parked out front.      Joe Carregal, a neighbor, said he saw the fire unfold Thursday. About 1:15 p.m., he said he saw smoke pouring from the upper-story windows of the home and a man knocking on the front door in an attempt to get the family out.      Soon after, fire trucks came roaring down the street. Firefighters broke windows on the house, deployed ladders and clambered onto the roof to extinguish flames. Carregal said he watched them pull three victims from the house.      Chris Vorobek, who lives in the neighborhood, said he would see Amy Savopoulos, walking her dog in the neighborhood, and her son racing around on his bicycle.      “He was a great kid,” Vorobek said.      Keith L. Alexander, Lynh Bui, Alice Crites, Abigail Hauslohner, Peter Hermann, Roxanne Roberts, Valerie Strauss, Julie Tate and Clarence Williams contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","output":"On Thursday, a fire broke out at the house owned by Savvas and Amy Savopoulos in the upscale Woodley Park neighborhood of NW Washington D.C., where four bodies were later discovered. The couple and two others, believed to be the couple's son Philip and their housekeeper Veralicia Figueroa, were all found dead, with at least one victim displaying signs of blunt-force trauma and the smell of gasoline. The Savopoulos' 2008 blue Porsche was spotted nearby earlier in the day, only to be found later, burnt and abandoned, in a church parking lot in Maryland. The fire and subsequent deaths are being treated as a homicide arson, with no clear signs of forced entry into the home. Authorities are gathering any available surveillance footage and are appealing to anyone with information concerning the car's movements between Wednesday and Thursday to come forward. The family was described as well-liked by those who knew them, and their deaths shocked the local community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Process: - Acid rain enters the atmosphere and lands - Makes water acidic - Kills fish - Kills the soils in trees - Leaves are also harmed.  Question: suppose a time of heavy daily rain happens, how will it affect fish will die faster.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"More Effect. To understand the impact of heavy daily rain on the acid rain process and its subsequent effects on fish and soils in trees, let us first break down the process mentioned. 1. Acid rain enters the atmosphere and lands: Acid rain is caused when pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), are released into the atmosphere from activities such as burning fossil fuels and industrial processes. These pollutants combine with water vapor and other atmospheric elements to form acidic compounds like sulfuric acid and nitric acid.  2. Makes water acidic: When these acidic compounds fall to the ground with precipitation, they lower the pH of surface waters, such as lakes, rivers, and streams. This causes the water to become more acidic. 3. Kills fish: As the pH of the water decreases, certain fish species begin to struggle to adapt to the changing environment. They may suffer from physiological stress or even die off, as their gills and other organs can be damaged by the acidity. Furthermore, the increase in acidity can lead to the release of toxic substances, such as aluminum, which can be lethal to fish. 4. Kills the soils in trees: Acid rain has a significant effect on soil chemistry as well. When it seeps into the soil, it removes essential nutrients such as calcium and magnesium and replaces them with hydrogen ions. This makes the soil more acidic and reduces its ability to support plant growth. As a result, trees may become weak and vulnerable to stress, disease, and pests. 5. Leaves are also harmed: The effect of acid rain on leaves is related to the damage done to the soil by acid rain. Nutrient deficiencies will affect the tree's ability to produce healthy leaves, which can then make the tree more susceptible to stressors such as harsh weather, disease, or pests. Now, if we introduce heavy daily rain into this scenario, it will have the following effects: 1. Increased acid rain deposition: With more rain, there is an increased probability of acid rain being deposited onto water bodies and soil. This could lead to a faster accumulation of acidic compounds in these environments. 2. Quicker change in water acidity: Heavy daily rain will make water bodies become acidic more quickly, as it introduces a higher concentration of acidic compounds in a shorter period. Greater volumes of acidic water will pose a higher risk to fish populations. 3. Accelerated impact on fish: As the water bodies become more acidic at a faster rate, fish mortality rates may also increase. As the pH levels drop, there will be less time for fish to adapt or seek out less acidic environments. Consequently, fish populations will experience increased stress and will likely die off more rapidly. 4. Perturbation influence on soil: Heavy daily rain will also result in more significant soil acidification, which will further damage tree health. Soil nutrient depletion will happen more quickly, thus affecting tree growth and resilience. In conclusion, heavy daily rain has a more significant effect on the second outcome mentioned in the initial process - fish death - as well as on the other outcomes, such as soil acidification. Therefore, the supposed perturbation will have a more detrimental impact on the entire ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article based on this \\"An independent review is being launched to examine why so many children in care in England and Wales end up in the criminal justice system.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Unraveling the Connections: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Youth in Care and Their Journey into the Criminal Justice System Introduction In England and Wales, it has become increasingly apparent that there is a concerning trend among children in care who later end up in the criminal justice system. As social workers, educators, and policymakers struggle to identify the root causes and implement necessary reforms, an independent review has been launched to examine the underlying reasons for this phenomenon. The review aims to shed light on why so many youths, who should be receiving support and care from the state, ultimately end up in the criminal justice system. The Importance of Understanding the Issue It is crucial to understand the factors involved in the link between children in care and their eventual involvement in criminal activities. Identifying and addressing these factors can help reduce the number of youths entering the criminal justice system and ensure that they receive the support they need to lead productive lives. The independent review will assess the mechanisms currently in place for children in care, such as foster care, residential care, and adoption services, to determine whether these strategies effectively prevent young people from turning to crime. Furthermore, the review will explore the effectiveness of current intervention and support strategies aimed at tackling the root causes of criminal behavior among these youths. Factors Contributing to the Problem Several factors potentially contribute to the increased risk of youths in care becoming involved in criminal activities. Some of these factors may include: 1. Trauma and mental health: Many children in care have experienced traumatic events that can lead to emotional and mental health challenges. These challenges may make them more vulnerable to involvement in crime. 2. Lack of stability: Frequent changes in living arrangements and support systems can disrupt a child's ability to form healthy relationships and develop stable routines. In turn, this lack of stability can lead to behavioral issues and an increased likelihood of criminal activity. 3. Limited support and resources: Many children in care lack the necessary support from social workers, educators, and other professionals who could help them overcome their challenges. The overall lack of resources and personalized support may exacerbate their problems. Review Process and Anticipated Outcomes The independent review team will comprise experts from a wide range of fields, including social work, psychology, education, and criminal justice. They will gather data through various sources, such as interviews, surveys, and case studies, to better understand the issue and formulate recommendations for improvement. The anticipated outcomes of this review include: 1. Identifying key areas of improvement: The review will pinpoint the gaps in the current care system and develop a clear understanding of which aspects should be improved to better support youths in care. 2. Formulating recommendations: Based on the findings, the review team will outline specific recommendations, including policy changes, funding priorities, and improvements in care practices, to help reduce the likelihood of children in care becoming involved in criminal activities. Conclusion As a society, it is our responsibility to ensure that all children are provided a safe, nurturing environment to grow and thrive. The independent review is a crucial step towards understanding the complex interplay between the care system and youth involvement in criminal activities. By identifying shortcomings and designing targeted interventions, we ultimately aim to break the cycle that leads so many youths in care to the criminal justice system."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the case of static functions, since they are not visible outside of the file they are defined in, black box testing may not be suitable for writing gtest (Google Test) cases for static functions. It is recommended to use white box testing, where the tester has knowledge of the internal workings of the system, when writing gtest cases for static functions. This will allow for more targeted and comprehensive testing of the static functions, ensuring that all code paths are covered and potential edge cases are considered. In summary, while black box testing may be useful for higher-level testing of the system as a whole, white box testing is usually more appropriate for writing gtest cases for static functions."},{"instruction":"does the line #define static /* */ is valid in c? and if yes what does it mean","output":"In C, using \`#define static /* */\` would not be considered valid syntax. This is because \`#define\` is used for defining preprocessor macros in C, and static is a keyword that is used to specify the storage class of a variable or function.

When used with variables, it specifies that the variable retains its value between function calls and is only accessible within the scope in which it is defined. When used with functions, it specifies that the function is only visible within the file in which it is defined. If you were to attempt to redefine the \`static\` keyword using \`#define\`, the compiler would likely flag it as an error or warning, as it is trying to redefine a reserved keyword.

Test fixtures allow you to share common setup and teardown code across multiple test cases, including accessing private or static members of a class. One way to make static functions visible to gtest files is to declare the gtest test fixture as a friend class in the class that contains the static functions. This will grant access to the static functions within the gtest test fixture. For example: \`\`\`cpp // MyClass.h class MyClass { private: static int staticFunction(int a, int b); friend class MyClassTest; }; \`\`\` \`\`\`cpp // MyClass.cpp #include \\"MyClass.h\\" int MyClass::staticFunction(int a, int b) { return a * b; } \`\`\` \`\`\`cpp // MyClassTest.cpp #include \\"gtest/gtest.h\\" #include \\"MyClass.h\\" // Declare the test fixture class class MyClassTest : public testing::Test { protected: // You can now access the static function in your test cases }; TEST_F(MyClassTest, StaticFunctionTest) { int result = MyClass::staticFunction(2, 3); ASSERT_EQ(result, 6); } \`\`\` By declaring the gtest test fixture class as a friend of the class containing the static functions, you can then access and test those static functions in your gtest test cases.

This is because each source file that includes the header file will create a separate copy of the functions, leading to conflicts when linking the object files. To make the functions accessible in multiple files without causing multiple definition errors, you can declare them as inline functions in the header file. Here is an example: a.h: \`\`\`cpp #ifndef A_H #define A_H inline int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; } inline int subtract(int a, int b) { return a - b; } #endif \`\`\` a.cpp: \`\`\`cpp #include \\"a.h\\" \`\`\` test_a.cpp: \`\`\`cpp #include \\"gtest/gtest.h\\" #include \\"a.h\\" TEST(AddTest, AddsTwoNumbers) { EXPECT_EQ(add(3, 2), 5); } TEST(SubtractTest, SubtractsTwoNumbers) { EXPECT_EQ(subtract(3, 2), 1); } \`\`\` By declaring the functions as \`inline\` in the header file, the compiler will insert a copy of the function code in each translation unit that includes the header file, eliminating the issue of multiple definitions.

We'll tackle them step by step. # Ancient Civilizations and the Cross Symbol The cross is an ancient symbol found in many cultures around the world, predating Christianity. Its interpretations and meanings vary significantly among different civilizations. - **In Sumerian civilization**, the cross symbol can be found, but its meanings might relate more to astronomical interpretations or religious iconography specific to their pantheon and beliefs rather than a direct correlation with the Christian concept of salvation. - **In Ancient Egypt**, the ankh is a well-known symbol, sometimes related to or visually similar to a cross. The ankh represents life and immortality, rebirth, and the universe. It was a key symbol in the Egyptian understanding of life and the afterlife, but it does not directly parallel the Christian notion of salvation through the cross. # Analogies to Christian Stories and Themes It's true that many ancient mythologies contain stories of gods dying and being reborn, which can loosely parallel the Christian narrative of Jesus' death and resurrection. These themes can be seen in narratives about figures like Osiris in Egyptian mythology or Inanna in Sumerian myths. However, critical academic analysis suggests these similarities are more reflective of common human concerns with death, the afterlife, and rebirth rather than evidence of a direct link or shared origin with Christian beliefs. # Periodic Catastrophes and Civilization Resets The idea that Earth experiences a catastrophic event every 5000 years that resets civilization is a speculation not supported by mainstream archaeological or historical evidence. While it's true that local or even regional catastrophic events (such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, floods) have caused significant disruptions to ancient societies, there's no scientific evidence to support a cycle of global catastrophes wiping out civilizations entirely every 5000 years. Archaeological records, historical documents, and geological evidence provide a much more continuous understanding of human development and civilization's progress over thousands of years, albeit with many rises and falls related to various factors (environmental changes, human migration, technological advances, social and political dynamics, etc.). # Conclusion While ancient civilizations had complex religious and mythological systems that sometimes included cross-like symbols and themes of death and rebirth, the parallels to Christian beliefs about the cross and salvation are more reflective of a broader human tendency to grapple with certain existential themes rather than evidence of direct cultural transmission or shared beliefs stemming from common prehistoric events. Likewise, theories of periodic global catastrophes resetting civilization are speculative and not supported by current archaeological and historical evidence."},{"instruction":"The Collatz Conjecture, can you solve this math problem","output":"The Collatz Conjecture, often referred to as the 3n + 1 conjecture, is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics, first proposed by Lothar Collatz in 1937. The conjecture is elegant in its simplicity but has defied proof despite extensive examination by mathematicians. # Conjecture Statement The Collatz Conjecture can be stated as follows: 1. Take any positive integer n. 2. If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2. 3. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1. 4. Repeat the process indefinitely for the number obtained, forming a sequence. The conjecture posits that no matter what initial value of n you start with, the sequence will always eventually reach the number 1. # Example Let's say we start with the number 6: 1. 6 is even, so we divide by 2: 6 / 2 = 3 2. 3 is odd, so we apply 3n+1: 3 * 3 + 1 = 10 3. 10 is even, so we divide by 2: 10 / 2 = 5 4. 5 is odd, so we apply 3n+1: 3 * 5 + 1 = 16 5. 16 is even, so we divide by 2: 16 / 2 = 8 6. 8 is even, so we divide by 2: 8 / 2 = 4 7. 4 is even, so we divide by 2: 4 / 2 = 2 8. 2 is even, so we divide by 2: 2 / 2 = 1 After reaching 1, the sequence will continue repeating the loop 1-4-2-1 indefinitely. # Attempts at Solving Despite the apparent simplicity, the problem is incredibly complex and a general proof (or disproof) eluding mathematicians. The conjecture has been checked for a wide range of numbers using computers, all of which comply with the conjecture, reaching 1 after a series of steps. However, verifying the conjecture for many numbers is not a proof that it holds for all positive integers. Mathematicians have approached the problem through various angles - analytic number theory, dynamic systems, and experimental mathematics, among others - yet, a general proof or a counterexample remains undiscovered. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, and there have not been any updates as of my last update in 2023, the Collatz Conjecture remains an open problem in mathematics. # Why It's Hard The difficulty in solving the Collatz Conjecture lies in the seemingly erratic behavior of the sequence generated by the simple rule. The sequence can soar to large values before plummeting down to 1, and the length of the sequence can vary dramatically with starting numbers that are close to each other. This unpredictability makes it hard to apply standard mathematical tools and techniques that work well with more orderly systems. # Conclusion As of now, solving the Collatz Conjecture remains beyond reach. It stands as a testament to the fascination and challenge of mathematics, where even the simplest-looking problems can hide deep complexities. The quest for its solution continues to attract both professional mathematicians and amateur number enthusiasts, hoping to make a breakthrough."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Given her current Spell Power of **90** and Performance of **85**, she successfully showcases a dazzling array of chromatic lights splashing against the arena's boundaries, scoring full points modified by her performance, earning **102 points** (120*0.85). - Lily counters with *Twinkling Twirl*. With a Spell Power of **70**, and a lower Performance of **60**, she tries her best and manages a score, adjusted for performance, of **51 points** (85*0.6). **Sapphire’s Age: 16 → 14, Lily’s Age: 6 → 8** **Round 2:** *Note*: Sapphire now feels a bit more giggly and less focused, her stats adjusted by the regression and multiplied. - Sapphire attempts *Starlight Symphony*. Her diminished powers and escalating childishness make it harder. Her Spell Power is now **72** and Performance **68**. The symphony is less harmonious, resulting in **61.2 points** after adjustment (90*0.68). - Lily, growing slightly in maturity and power, casts *Starfall Stream*. Her new stats enable a more confident display, achieving **72 points** after adjustment (100*0.72). **Childish Meter for Sapphire starts to fill, now at 15/100.** **Round 3:** *Note*: The magical influence accelerates. Sapphire feels her mind fogging with childlike wonder, struggling to remember her more complex spells. - Sapphire chooses *Dancing Flames* – her favorite. But now with **Spell Power: 48* and **Performance: 45**, it’s rather weak, barely conjuring playful sparks instead of the intended mesmerizing dance, earning her **49.5 points** (110*0.45). - Lily, sensing an advantage, boldly attempts to steal *Moonlit Mirage* from Sapphire’s list, boosting her points if successful. With enhanced abilities, **Spell Power: 84**, she performs it almost flawlessly, earning herself **114 points** (95+20% bonus for spell steal). **Sapphire’s Aggravating Childishness: 22.5/100.** **Round 4:** - Sapphire, now noticeably more childish and struggling with complex thoughts, opts for *Whispering Winds*, hoping its lower Spell Power requirement fits her current stat of **38.4**. Unfortunately, she barely manages a gentle breeze, scoring a mere **26.6 points** (85*0.45*0.7, further reduced for failing to match required SP). - Lily, now very confident, casts her own spell, *Luminous Lullaby*, with grandiosity. Given her stats are now significantly higher, she scores generously **92 points** after adjustment. **Sapphire’s Age: 14 → 12, Childishness overflowing: 33.75/100.** **Round 5 (Final Round):** *Note*: Sapphire, now extremely limited by her regressed state, picks *Radiant Rainfall*, aiming to at least complete her performance. Reduced to a mere child, her Spell Power **30.72** and Performance **22**, she barely manages a drizzle, scoring **16.5 points**. - Lily, nearly an adolescent now, finishes with *Mystical Mirage*, her spell casting mature and refined. She scores a staggering **108 points** after her continued stat growth. --- **End of Duel Stats:** - **Sapphire's Final Age**: 12 - **Lily's Final Age**: 10 - **Sapphire's Total Points**: Accumulative struggles culminate in a minimal score, greatly reduced by her childlike performance and failed spells. - **Lily's Total Points**: With consistent improvement and a strategic spell steal, she amasses a high score, showcasing her unexpected prowess. **Conclusion:** *The duel, a rollercoaster of emotions and magical phenomena, concludes with Lily standing much taller, both literally and metaphorically. Sapphire, though reduced to a younger version of herself, displays grace in defeat. The crowd, enchanted by the spectacle, cheers for the unexpected turnaround, marking the day with whispers of a duel that would be remembered for ages.* *And so, Sapphire's journey comes full circle, a prodigious mage finding herself at the beginning once more, filled with youthful wonder and an entire future of magic to re-explore.*"},{"instruction":"Using a numbered list and inspired by creative brainstorming, write different “Prompts Generators” suitable to be executable on an AI generated image, these should take the visual and prompt details in their context to create a hyper-realistic representation that is shows in first person a scene of a lucid dream of a serene old electrician beside the famed Nikola Tesla, as they work together in an otherworldly dimension where wires and circuits intertwine with the very fabric of space-time itself.","output":"1. **Dimensional Electricians Prompt Generator:** - Enter the eyes of an aged, wise electrician.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with an increasingly multiplying formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my original list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. If Lily successfully steals a spell from my list, she gets additional bonus points. Add a list of 3 epic spells that require super high stats. Keep an age tracker and a points tracker. In the narration, as the duel progresses change the regression happens, change the way you talk about Sapphire to be more kiddish and more mature when talking about Lily. Regardless of who wins, by the end of the duel Sapphire will be reduced to a 6-year-old novice who’ll have to start her magical journey anew.

Lily's new Stats: - Spell Power: 65 + (65*0.05) = 68.25 - Performance: 70 + (70*0.05) = 73.5 **Points Earned:** - Base Points for Whimsical Flares: 90 - Adjusted for Performance: 90 * (73.5/100) = 66.15 Lily’s Points: 66 # Scenario Progression: As the duel progresses, your guidance will dictate Sapphire's spell choices, the outcomes of which will heavily lean on the intricate balance between strategy and the whims of fate (interpreted through the established formulas). Lily, empowered by her unique spell, becomes increasingly formidable, challenging Sapphire’s reigning mastery. **Your role is to navigate Sapphire through this gauntlet of challenges, choosing spells judiciously while battling the creeping vestiges of childhood regression.

There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with an increasingly multiplying formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction.

Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points.

These efforts are not isolated incidents but part of a broader, coordinated campaign aimed at destabilizing the cohesion within and between Western countries. Russia, for instance, employs a variety of tactics including cyber-attacks, spreading disinformation, and utilizing its state-run media to influence political outcomes and sow discord within the electorate of various nations. This multifaceted approach to disinformation is designed to weaken trust in democratic institutions and processes, thereby eroding the fabric of democratic societies from within. China, on the other hand, is employing its own brand of disinformation techniques, though with a slightly different focus and endgame. The Chinese government's use of disinformation is primarily targeted at bolstering its global image and silencing criticism of its policies and governance style. Through sophisticated social media operations and the exertion of its economic influence, China aims to shape a favorable international narrative. Both nations see these disinformation campaigns as tools to challenge the current global order, dominated by the West, and to promote their respective visions for the future of international relations. Through these cunning tactics, Russia and China are not just spreading falsehoods; they are strategically working to undermine confidence in democratic institutions and foster geopolitical instability.

There are also pipes that allow Mario to visit different treasure rooms before returning via a small pipe to the level he left. Enemies Baby Goombas, Koopa Troopas, Bugs, Koopa Partroopers, Bullet Bulls, Hammer Bros. And there is a zipper that snaps. Mario can defeat all these enemies by jumping on them.

Here's how to approach solving this issue based on the provided output: # Understanding the Issue 1. **MP3 Decoder Library Missing:** The first part of the message highlights that the module \`format_mp3\` is set to be installed, but the necessary MP3 decoder library has not been incorporated into the source tree. This is a dependency required for the module to function properly, as it enables Asterisk to work with MP3 files. 2. **Installation Error:** The second part shows an error encountered during the installation process, where the system is unable to find the \`format_mp3.so\` file. This file is the binary module for the MP3 format in Asterisk, and the error suggests that either the file hasn't been compiled successfully, or the MP3 decoder support hasn’t been incorporated properly before compiling. # Steps to Resolve To address these issues, you'll need to follow the instructions provided in the message and then ensure the module is correctly compiled and installed. Here's a step-by-step guide: 1. **Download MP3 Decoder Library:** - Open a terminal on the server where Asterisk is being installed. - Navigate to the Asterisk source directory. Based on your message, it looks like you're working with Asterisk 16.15.1, so ensure you're in the correct directory (e.g., \`/usr/src/asterisk-16.15.1/\`). - Run the command provided in the message to download the necessary MP3 decoder source: \`\`\`shell contrib/scripts/get_mp3_source.sh \`\`\` - This script attempts to download and prepare the MP3 decoder library required by the \`format_mp3\` module. 2. **Recompile Asterisk (If Required):** - After successfully downloading and integrating the MP3 decoder library, you might need to recompile Asterisk to include the \`format_mp3\` module correctly. Depending on how your system is set up, this usually involves cleaning the previous compilation attempt, configuring, and making the project again: \`\`\`shell make clean ./configure make menuselect \`\`\` - During \`make menuselect\`, ensure \`format_mp3\` is selected. - Then continue with compilation and installation: \`\`\`shell make make install \`\`\` 3. **Verify Installation:** - After reinstalling, verify that the module is correctly installed and recognized by Asterisk: \`\`\`shell asterisk -rx \\"module show like format_mp3\\" \`\`\` - This command will list the module if it’s loaded or available to Asterisk. # Additional Notes - Ensure you have all necessary permissions (potentially requiring \`sudo\` for system-wide directories). - If you encounter further issues, reviewing the Asterisk and module documentation related to your specific version and checking any version-specific prerequisites would be prudent. By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully install the \`format_mp3\` module for your Asterisk setup."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The current laws of physics don't allow for time travel into the past, let alone to an \\"infinite\\" point in the past. The term \\"BCE\\" stands for \\"Before Common Era,\\" which is used in the Gregorian calendar to denote years before the year 1, effectively replacing the term \\"BC\\" (Before Christ). The idea of traveling to \\"infinite BCE\\" is theoretically problematic for several reasons: 1. **Infinite Time**: Infinity is a concept rather than a number you can reach. Time, as we understand it, had a beginning with the Big Bang, according to current cosmological theories. This event is estimated to have occurred around 13.8 billion years ago. So, in practical terms, there is no \\"infinite BCE\\" to travel to because time has a beginning. 2. **Beginning of Time**: Current scientific understanding, based on the Big Bang theory, posits that time, space, and matter all began with the Big Bang. There was no \\"before\\" the Big Bang in the conventional sense because time itself started with that event. 3. **Physics Limitations**: Our present understanding of physics does not support the concept of traveling backward in time. According to General Relativity, it is theoretically possible for forward time travel under specific conditions (such as near a black hole or at speeds approaching the speed of light), but backward time travel introduces paradoxes and is not supported by empirical evidence. 4. **Ontological Paradoxes**: Time travel to the past, especially to an \\"infinite\\" point, introduces logical and causal paradoxes. For example, the grandfather paradox questions what would happen if you went back in time and prevented your grandparents from meeting, thus preventing your birth and, consequently, your ability to travel back in time. Introducing the concept of traveling to an \\"infinite\\" point in time also confronts the philosophical questions about the nature of infinity, existence, and the origins of the universe. These are rich fields of discussion in both physics and philosophy but currently reside firmly in the realm of theoretical exploration without empirical method for practical experimentation or travel."},{"instruction":"If I travelled to 5 billion BCE, write about depiction","output":"Traveling back to 5 billion BCE would transport you to an era long before the Earth and the rest of the Solar System existed, according to current astronomical understanding. The Solar System, including the Earth, is believed to have formed about 4.6 billion years ago. Thus, landing in 5 billion BCE would place you in the primordial environment of the pre-Solar System nebula — a vast, swirling cloud of cosmic dust and gas. **Depiction of 5 Billion BCE: The Pre-solar Nebula** At this unimaginable period in cosmic history, you would find yourself in a setting that is profoundly alien to anything known to human experience. Picture an immense, diffuse cloud extending over many light years, dominated by hydrogen and helium, enriched with heavier elements from the supernova explosions of earlier generations of stars. These elements are critical because they would eventually give rise to planets, and on at least one of them, life. **Void and Formation:** In the cold reaches of space, there is no sunlight to illuminate the nebula, as the Sun itself has not yet coalesced from this cosmic cloud. The landscape—if one could call it that without a planet underfoot—would be a dark expanse sprinkled with the light of distant stars, some perhaps in their own process of birth or death, painting faint glows and shadows across the nebula. **The Birth of the Solar System:** Within this cloud, regions of slightly higher density under the inexorable pull of gravity begin to collapse, slowly at first, then more rapidly. These collapsing regions are the cradles where new stars, including what will become our Sun, are born. As the future Sun gathers mass, the material around it starts to flatten into a disk—the protoplanetary disk, within which the planets, moons, and other Solar System bodies will form. **Sensory Void:** In this epoch, there is no sound, as sound requires a medium through which to propagate, and the near-vacuum of space does not suffice. There is no air to breathe, no ground to stand on; there's profound cold interrupted occasionally by the heat of forming stars and the shock of colliding materials that are gradually clumping together to form larger bodies in the disk. **The Perspective of Time:** In this era, the concept of time as we experience it would be almost meaningless. The changes and evolutions in the nebula occur over millions to hundreds of millions of years—a blink of an eye in cosmic terms but an eternity from a human perspective. **Conclusion:** Visiting 5 billion BCE would offer a unique vantage point on the slow and majestic dance of cosmic evolution, providing direct witness to the earliest chapters in the story of our Solar System's birth. It's a period of transformation from chaos to order, setting the stage for everything from planets and asteroids to the emergence of life on Earth billions of years later. This journey into deep time underscores not only our origins but also the remarkable coincidence of conditions that allowed life to flourish on our pale blue dot in the vast cosmos."},{"instruction":"If I travelled to 10 billion BCE, write about depiction","output":"Traveling back to 10 billion BCE takes you to an era significantly before our Solar System's formation, even before the Milky Way, our galaxy, had fully taken shape. This epoch unfolds roughly 3.8 billion years after the Big Bang, which is estimated to have occurred around 13.8 billion years ago. The universe at this time is youthful, evolving from its initial states of extreme heat and density into a more recognizable cosmos filled with stars, galaxies, and nebulae. However, the structure and composition of the universe are vastly different from what we see today. **Depiction of 10 Billion BCE: A Young Universe** **Cosmic Landscape**: In this era, the universe is already expanding, cooling down from its initial hot, dense state. The cosmic microwave background radiation, a relic from the era of recombination that happened around 380,000 years post-Big Bang when protons and electrons combined to form neutral hydrogen, is much hotter and more intense than it is in our time. **Galaxy Formation**: The first galaxies are in the process of forming. These early galaxies are likely smaller and less organized than the massive, well-structured galaxies we see today. They are formed by the gravitational attraction of dark matter halos pulling together gas and dust, which eventually ignite to form the first generations of stars. **Population III Stars**: You would witness the life cycle of the first stars, known as Population III stars. These stars are made almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, with almost no heavier elements (since those are synthesized in the cores of stars and spread through supernova explosions). Population III stars are thought to be massive, much more so than most stars in the current universe, leading to short, brilliant lives culminating in supernova explosions. These explosions are crucial for seeding the universe with the heavier elements that will later be incorporated into planets and life forms. **A Different Sky**: Standing on any planet or any sizable body that might exist at this time (which in itself would be a remarkable occurrence given the early state of the universe), the sky would be a vastly different spectacle. There might be fewer stars, but those that are visible could be larger and brighter, with frequent supernovae illuminating the heavens. Nebulae, enriched over time by the remnants of these early stars, would begin to show the diversity of elements. The overall color of the universe might lean more towards blue, given the hotter, younger stars dominating the landscape. **Physics at Play**: The fundamental forces of the universe—gravity, electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces—operate as they do today, sculpting the cosmos through the attraction and repulsion of matter. You would see the universe in a state of transition, from smoothness to clumpiness, as structures grow under gravity's inexorable pull. **A Silent Opera**: As in any era of the cosmos, there is no sound in space; the dramatic events of star birth and death, galaxy formation, and the slow dance of gravitational attraction unfold in utter silence, a grand opera for the eyes alone, forever beyond the reach of our ears. **Conclusion:** Traveling to 10 billion BCE would present a view of a universe at once alien and familiar. On the one hand, you'd see the fundamental processes that shape the cosmos at work, the same processes that have led to the universe we observe today. On the other, everything would be younger, more violent, and less structured, a vivid testament to the universe's capacity for change and evolution. Witnessing such a time would underscore the dynamic nature of the cosmos and our own place within the vast tapestry of cosmic history."},{"instruction":"If I travelled to 13.8 billion BCE, write about depiction","output":"Traveling back to 13.8 billion BCE would place you at the very beginning of the universe, the moment of the Big Bang itself. This event marks the origin of time, space, matter, and energy as we understand it. Describing this moment and the immediate aftermath involves delving into theoretical physics and cosmology, as our conventional notions of \\"place\\" and \\"time\\" breakdown. **Depiction of 13.8 Billion BCE: The Big Bang and the Birth of the Universe** **Singularity**: At the very start, the universe was in an incredibly hot, dense state from which it began expanding. This expansion is not like an explosion in space but rather the rapid expansion of space itself. At the singularity, all the matter, energy, space, and time were condensed into an infinitesimal point. Describing this singularity with current physics is challenging because the laws of physics as we know them break down under such extreme conditions. **The First Moments**: In the first tiny fraction of a second, the universe expanded exponentially in a phase known as cosmic inflation. This rapid expansion smoothed out the fabric of space-time and set the stage for the universe as we know it. During these early moments, the universe was filled with a hot, dense plasma of quarks, electrons, and other fundamental particles. **Cooling Universe**: As the universe continued to expand, it also began to cool. This cooling allowed quarks to combine into protons and neutrons. Within the first few minutes, these particles came together in nuclear fusion reactions to form the first light nuclei, primarily hydrogen and helium, in a process known as nucleosynthesis. **Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation**: Roughly 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe had cooled enough for electrons to combine with nuclei to form neutral atoms. This event allowed light to travel freely through space for the first time, creating what we now observe as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. The CMB is a faint glow of light that fills the universe, a relic of its fiery infancy. **Dark Ages and Structure Formation**: Following the release of the CMB, the universe entered a period known as the cosmic dark ages. During this time, the first stars and galaxies began to form from slight density variations in the matter distribution. Gravity pulled matter together, leading to the formation of gas clouds that would eventually ignite to form the first stars, illuminating the universe once more. **A Perspective Beyond Human Experience**: Standing at the brink of creation, you would not find a \\"place\\" to observe in any traditional sense, as space itself is emerging and expanding from the singularity. Time, too, would not flow in a way we could perceive; it is literally beginning. Matter, in forms familiar to us—planets, stars, galaxies—has yet to form. You would be immersed in a sea of fundamental particles and energy, witnessing a universe unlike the vast, structured cosmos we see today. **Conclusion**: Traveling to 13.8 billion BCE, to the origins of our universe, presents an incomprehensible scene far removed from the structures and laws of physics that define our current understanding of the cosmos. It's a theoretical journey to a time where the fundamental aspects of our universe—time, space, matter, and energy—are emerging and evolving in ways that stretch the limits of human imagination and scientific understanding. This moment encapsulates the ultimate origins of everything we know, offering a profound perspective on the universe's evolution and our place within it."},{"instruction":"If I travelled to 14.46 billion BCE, write about depiction","output":"If you were to travel to 14.46 billion BCE, you'd be venturing into a conceptual realm that doesn't align with current scientific understanding. According to contemporary cosmological models, including observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and measurements of the expansion rate of the universe, the Big Bang occurred roughly 13.8 billion years ago. This means there isn't a \\"14.46 billion BCE\\" in the timeline of our universe as we understand it today. However, engaging with this thought experiment pushes us into fascinating speculative territories about what could \\"exist\\" or happen \\"before\\" the beginning of our universe, if such terms even apply. Let's explore a couple of theoretical possibilities that physicists and cosmologists have pondered: # Pre-Big Bang Scenarios **Quantum Gravity Era:** One of the frontiers in theoretical physics is the unification of general relativity, which describes the macroscopic world, and quantum mechanics, which governs the microscopic. In the era immediately preceding the Big Bang, a hypothetical period known as the Planck epoch might have existed, where the concepts of time and space as we understand them breakdown. The laws of physics as we know them may not apply, and phenomena such as quantum fluctuations could dominate. This realm, however, falls strictly within the realm of speculation and advanced theoretical models, such as loop quantum gravity or string theory, which might provide a glimpse into such an epoch. **Multiverse Theories:** Some theories suggest our universe is part of a larger multiverse, where multiple universes exist simultaneously or sequentially. In such a scenario, the period you're referencing, \\"14.46 billion BCE\\", could pertain to a pre-existing universe or cosmic cycle that preceded the birth of our own universe. These models often involve a cyclical process, such as the ekpyrotic model derived from string theory, where universes are born, expand, and might collapse, only to be reborn again. # Beyond Conventional Time **Before Time:** Discussing a time \\"before\\" the Big Bang challenges our understanding of time itself. Time, as we experience and measure it, is intrinsically linked to the space-time fabric of our universe. If there was a \\"before,\\" it would exist in a state or under laws of physics that are beyond our current comprehension. These conditions would be so fundamentally different from the universe post-Big Bang that terms like \\"before\\" might not even be meaningful. # Conclusion Traveling to \\"14.46 billion BCE\\" is a fascinating thought experiment that pushes the boundaries of our understanding and challenges the limitations of our knowledge. It invites us to imagine conditions and laws of physics that are radically different from our own universe's post-Big Bang environment. While current scientific knowledge based on observable data places the age of the universe at approximately 13.8 billion years, exploring theoretical scenarios like a multiverse or quantum gravity epochs allows us to ponder profound questions about the nature of existence, the origins of our universe, and even the fabric of reality itself."},{"instruction":"If I travelled to infinite BCE, write about depiction","output":"Traveling to \\"infinite BCE\\" presents a thought experiment that goes beyond the boundaries of our current scientific understanding and enters the realms of philosophy and theoretical physics. Since infinity is a concept rather than a specific point in time, discussing a journey to an \\"infinite BCE\\" requires us to delve into abstract and speculative territories. # The Concept of Infinity in Time Infinite BCE implies an endless progression backward in time, far beyond the formation of the Earth, the birth of our solar system, the inception of our universe, and even preceding any theoretical pre-Big Bang scenarios. It stretches into an abstract infinity where our conventional understanding of cosmology, physics, and time itself breakdown. # Nonlinear Time and Timelessness In many cosmological and philosophical views, time is a dimension that started with the Big Bang; there was no \\"before\\" because time itself didn't exist. In such a context, talking about an \\"infinite BCE\\" might not have meaning. However, if we entertain theories of the multiverse or cyclic universes (cosmological models suggesting universes arise, expand, and possibly collapse, only to be born anew), \\"infinite BCE\\" could imply an eternal sequence of such births, existences, and deaths of universes. # Quantum Gravity and the Planck Epoch Approaching the singularity that theoretical physicists associate with the Big Bang (or Big Bounce in some cyclic models), we reach the Planck epoch. This is the earliest known period following the creation of the universe, less than a Planck time (around (10^{-43}) seconds) after the Big Bang, where our understanding of gravity (general relativity) and quantum mechanics must merge but currently do not. An infinite regression into the past might necessitate understanding physics beyond this epoch, where current models no longer apply, and concepts like space and time may have no meaning as we know them. # Philosophy and Metaphysics The idea of an infinite regression in time also touches on metaphysical and philosophical discussions about the nature of existence, causality, and the universe. It challenges us to think about whether the universe could have an infinite past or whether an initial cause or event (like the Big Bang) is necessary. These discussions often intersect with arguments about the existence of a higher power, the multiverse, or the fundamental nature of reality itself. # Imagination Beyond Boundaries Venturing into an \\"infinite BCE\\" would be an exploration not of physical locations but of possibilities, concepts, and theoretical constructs that stretch the human mind to its limits. It's a journey not through space but through the potentialities of existence itself, where the rules of physics as we understand them might not apply, and where time might not exist in any recognizable form. # Conclusion A depiction of traveling to \\"infinite BCE\\" transcends science and enters the realm of speculative metaphysics and advanced theoretical physics. It's a profound contemplation on the nature of time, existence, and the universe—an infinite canvas that allows for endless possibilities, including those beyond our current comprehension or imagination. In this context, \\"infinite BCE\\" serves more as a profound philosophical query rather than a destination or a physical reality."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Это может произойти, если процесс загрузки был прерван или если были проблемы с соединением. 2. **Повреждение файла:** Файл архива может быть поврежден в результате ошибок при загрузке или если файл был неправильно передан/скопирован. # Шаги для решения: Перезагрузите файл - Первым делом, попробуйте еще раз скачать архив \`freepbx-15.0.17.17.tgz\`. Убедитесь, что загрузка завершена успешно и размер файла соответствует ожидаемому. Проверьте целостность файла (если это возможно) - Если у вас есть информация о контрольной сумме файла (например, MD5, SHA1, SHA256), проверьте контрольную сумму скачанного файла.

Неполная или неправильная установка может привести к отсутствию некоторых файлов, таких как \`safe_asterisk\`. 2. **Путь к исполняемым файлам Asterisk был изменен.** Возможно, путь к файлам Asterisk отличается от стандартного (\`/usr/sbin/\`). Вы можете проверить путь установки Asterisk, используя команды поиска, например: \`\`\` find / -name safe_asterisk 2>/dev/null \`\`\` Это поможет определить местоположение файла \`safe_asterisk\`, если он существует. 3. **Изменения в новых версиях Asterisk.** В некоторых новых версиях Asterisk могли быть изменения, связанные с управлением и запуском службы. Например, вместо использования скрипта \`safe_asterisk\`, Asterisk теперь запускается как системная служба с помощью \`systemd\` или другой системы управления службами в вашем дистрибутиве Linux. **Что делать:** - **Для старых версий:** Если вы работаете с версией Asterisk, в которой ожидается наличие \`safe_asterisk\`, и он отсутствует, возможно, потребуется повторно установить или пересобрать Asterisk. - **Для новых версий:** Если вы используете новую версию Asterisk, убедитесь, что используете рекомендуемый способ запуска. Как правило, это будет что-то вроде: \`\`\` systemctl start asterisk \`\`\` для запуска Asterisk как системной службы. - **Проверьте документацию Asterisk** относительно корректного способа запуска для вашей версии и дистрибутива. - **Убедитесь, что FreePBX установлен и настроен правильно.** Если вы используете FreePBX для управления Asterisk, убедитесь, что все компоненты были корректно установлены и настроены.

Он оказывает влияние не только на формирование восприятия окружающего мира, но и на общее развитие интеллектуальных и двигательных навыков. Рассмотрим несколько аспектов, обусловливающих значимость зрительного анализатора в детском развитии: 1. **Развитие зрительного восприятия.** С самого раннего возраста зрительное восприятие играет ведущую роль в освоении младенцем окружающего мира. Ребенок учится отличать формы, цвета, движения, что является основой для последующего познавательного развития. 2. **Социальное взаимодействие.** Зрительный контакт является одним из первых средств коммуникации между младенцем и взрослым. Через выражения лица, жесты и движения малыш учится понимать эмоции других людей, что способствует его социальной адаптации. 3. **Развитие мелкой моторики и координации.** Слежение глазами за объектами и реакция на зрительные стимулы стимулируют развитие мелкой моторики. Зрительный контроль необходим для координации движений рук, особенно при изучении таких занятий, как рисование, лепка, сборка конструкторов. 4. **Подготовка к освоению речи и чтения.** В процессе развития зрительные навыки лежат в основе способности к распознаванию букв, слов и предложений. Дошкольное изучение картинок, книг с яркими иллюстрациями способствует обогащению словарного запаса и улучшению понимания речевых оборотов. 5. **Формирование пространственного восприятия.** Способность адекватно воспринимать пространственные отношения и ориентироваться в пространстве во многом зависит от развития зрительного анализатора. Это касается и восприятия предметов в разных плоскостях, и способности оценивать расстояния, скорости. 6. **Стимуляция когнитивного развития.** Взаимодействие с зрительно привлекательными предметами и играми способствует развитию мышления, памяти и внимания. Эстетическое воспитание, опирающееся на зрительное восприятие, формирует чувство прекрасного. Учитывая вышеупомянутые аспекты, можно сделать вывод о том, что зрительный анализатор играет фундаментальную роль в психофизическом развитии ребенка, оказывая влияние на большинство аспектов его жизнедеятельности. Создание богатой зрительной среды, наполненной разнообразными стимулами, является ключевым фактором успешного развития ребенка."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It's unclear how the act of \\"visiting and touching them\\" directly relates to being \\"blessed by them.\\" It does not clearly establish a cause-and-effect relationship, making it harder for the reader to understand the intended meaning. 2. **Pronoun Clarity**: The use of \\"them\\" twice in close proximity without clear antecedents can confuse readers about who or what is being referred to. The context in which \\"them\\" is used—once for possibly visiting objects or beings and again for receiving blessings—is not clearly defined, making the pronoun reference vague. 3. **Verb Tense and Mood Confusion**: The phrase \\"We wish by visiting and touching them we are blessed\\" mixes a sort of present or immediate future action (\\"visiting and touching\\") with a desire or wish (\\"we wish...we are blessed\\"), which can be grammatically awkward. The construction does not straightforwardly convey if the blessing is a hoped-for outcome or a guaranteed result of visiting and touching. 4. **Lack of Explicit Connector**: The sentence does not include a clear connecting word or phrase (such as \\"that\\") to smoothly link the action to the expected outcome. This makes the sentence harder to follow because the reader must infer the connection between visiting/touching and receiving blessings. 5. **Wordiness and Unnecessary Complexity**: The sentence construction is more complicated than it needs to be, potentially leading to confusion.

This is Sabgan, the land of dreams!","output":"**Title: The Hilariously Feather-Phobic Dream Quest** *Scene opens with Mario, now known in his dream as MARIO, snug in bed, tossing and turning until he shoots upright, a wild look in his eyes.* Mario: \\"Whoa, another dream adventure! And this one's got evil climbers and a feather-hating entity? What's next, a universe where pasta is illegal?\\" *Cut to the dinner table, where MARIO is sharing his peculiar dream with LUIGI, PRINCESS TOADSTOOL, and their newest dream adventure companion, FROG - no ordinary amphibian, but a friend with surprisingly good table manners.* Mario: \\"So, there I was, entering this unknown land called Naskun—wait, no, Sabgan! And something about 'my mom hates feathers.' Seriously, I think my dream-writer is on strike.\\" Luigi: \\"Mario, you really need to eat less cheese before bed. But weirdly enough, I had the same dream. Except in my version, the mom was giving a TED Talk on the evils of down bedding.\\" Princess Toadstool: *Looking alarmed* \\"This is rather distressing. In my dream, Sabgan was being overrun by fashion designers outlawing feather boas. How dreadfully specific.\\" Frog: *Ribbits eloquently* \\"Indeed, quite the conundrum. And in my dream, 'mom' turned out to be a gargantuan chicken despising her feathers. A profound statement on poultry self-image, perhaps.\\" *After the group chuckles at the absurdity of it all, they head to a snack bar, only to discover a hidden area that perfectly matches their collective dream description.* Mario: \\"I'm beginning to think our snack choices lead directly to multidimensional portals.\\" *The group ascends the staircase, opens the door, and is once again shocked to find themselves in Sabgan, the land of their shared dream.* Luigi: \\"At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if we find a 'Welcome, Dreamers' sign up ahead. Remember, keep an eye out for evil climbers and feather-haters.\\" Princess Toadstool: \\"Let us proceed with caution and dignity. It's not every day one gets to confront a feather-phobia on a grand scale.\\" Frog: *Leaps gracefully* \\"I propose a diplomatic approach. Perhaps, we can negotiate peace between feathers and their detractors.\\" Mario: \\"Yeah, and watch out for mom, the feather-hating entity. Wouldn't wanna ruffle any feathers—pun totally intended.\\" *As they venture through Sabgan, they encounter bizarre challenges, like climbing contests against overly competitive villains and navigating areas filled with conspicuously placed feathers—clearly a no-go for 'mom.'* Luigi: \\"So, are these evil climbers just really into rock climbing, or did they misread the invite to the 'oppressively thematic dream world' club?\\" Princess Toadstool: \\"One must admire their dedication to theme. But really, who bases an entire world's oppression on climbing?\\" Frog: *Adjusting his tiny frog-sized hat* \\"Negotiations may be tougher than expected. Especially if we encounter any feather-based economies.\\" Mario: \\"I just hope 'mom' turns out to be a misunderstood feather-pillow magnate or something. Would make for an easier apology than battling some ultra-evil, down-hating despot.\\" *They explore Sabgan, cracking jokes about the these dream-world dynamics, facing every absurdity with a mix of bewilderment and hands-on-hips hero poses.* Luigi: \\"Next time we dream up a world, can we at least vote on the theme? I'm voting for 'beach vacation' vibes.\\" Princess Toadstool: \\"Agreed, though, this has been quite the feather in our caps. Figuratively speaking, that is.\\" Frog: \\"A hop in the right direction for interspecies understanding, dare I say.\\" Mario: \\"Let's just find mom, sort out this feather fiasco, and maybe lay off the dream adventures for a while. At least until we can guarantee a less... itch-inducing theme.\\" *They continue on, ready for whatever Sabgan—or their peculiar dreamscapes—have in store, armed with nothing but their wit, courage, and an odd assortment of dream logic.* **End Scene.**"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, many of the strategies for finding models for DeepFaceLab can also be applied to DeepFaceLive, with a few additional considerations given its real-time application. Here are several strategies and locations where you might find suitable models for DeepFaceLive: # GitHub and GitLab - **DeepFaceLab and DeepFaceLive Repositories**: The official GitHub repository for DeepFaceLab and any associated or derivative projects might contain links or references to models that can be used or adapted for DeepFaceLive. Similarly, explore any GitLab repositories that might have branched out from the original project. - **Individual Contributions**: Look out for individual developers or hobbyists who share their DFL models on their personal GitHub or GitLab repositories. These might come from projects, experiments, or tutorials they have done. # Online Forums and Communities - **DeepFake Subreddits**: Subreddits like r/SFWdeepfakes could have posts or comments linking to models compatible with DeepFaceLive. Engaging with those communities by asking for sources or swapping models can be helpful. - **AI and Machine Learning Forums**: Niche forums dedicated to AI, machine learning, or deepfake technology might occasionally host or link to model repositories. Forums on sites like Stack Exchange, specialized AI forums, or even broader tech forums like XDA Developers may have relevant threads. # Discord Servers and Telegram Groups - Dedicated servers or groups for DeepFaceLab, DeepFaceLive, or general AI might share models directly or offer leads on where to find them. These platforms allow for real-time discussion and exchange, making them ideal for finding up-to-date resources and getting tips from experienced users. # YouTube Tutorials and Demonstration Videos - Creators who post tutorials or demonstrations of DeepFaceLive might provide links to the models they use in their video descriptions. While not every video will offer downloadable resources, it's common for educators to share their materials to help viewers follow along with their guides. # Directly Training or Requesting Custom Models - **Training Your Own Models**: Depending on your requirements, it might be feasible to train your own models using DeepFaceLab, tailored specifically for use in DeepFaceLive. This ensures that you get a model perfectly suited to your needs, though it requires a significant investment of time and computational resources. - **Requesting Models in Communities**: If you have specific needs, consider directly asking within AI or deepfake communities if anyone can share or guide you to a DFL-compatible model. Many hobbyists and professionals enjoy collaborating and might be willing to share their work or point you to undiscovered resources. # Maintaining Ethical Practices When searching for, using, or sharing DFL models, always prioritize ethical considerations: - **Consent and Privacy**: Ensure any models you use do not violate the privacy or consent of the individuals whose likenesses are involved. - **Legal Compliance**: Stay informed about and comply with local and international laws regarding deepfake technology and digital content creation. As of my last update, the landscape of AI model sharing, especially for deepfake technologies, is constantly evolving. New platforms, repositories, and sharing methods emerge as the technology and its community develop. Keep abreast of the latest platforms and tools used by the community, and always exercise caution and respect for privacy and copyright when downloading or using models."},{"instruction":"can you find for me dfl models","output":"I understand you're looking for DeepFaceLab (DFL) models, specifically for projects like deepfakes or real-time face swapping with DeepFaceLive. As of my last update, here are general guidelines and suggestions on where you might find DFL models, keeping in mind the importance of ethical considerations and copyright laws. # Direct Sources - **GitHub and GitLab:** The most straightforward way to look for DeepFaceLab models is on platforms like GitHub or GitLab. Users and developers may share their models within project repositories or as part of collaborative projects. Searching for “DeepFaceLab models” or “DFL models” on these platforms might yield some results. Remember, the usage rights and limitations should always be respected. # Forums and Online Communities - **Reddit:** Subreddits related to machine learning, artificial intelligence, or deepfake technology (like /r/SFWdeepfakes) can be resources for finding communities dedicated to face swapping and deepfake creations. Community members often share tips, tricks, and sometimes links to models, though these are not always directly posted for legal and ethical reasons. - **AI and Deep Learning Forums:** Dedicated forums for AI, machine learning, and deepfake technology discussions might host threads or posts where users share models. Examples include the DeepFaceLab official forums (if available) or other technology forums where AI hobbyists and professionals gather. # YouTube and Educational Content - **Tutorial Videos:** Content creators who post tutorials or reviews of DeepFaceLab and DeepFaceLive techniques on platforms like YouTube may share models or provide leads on where to obtain them. While direct links in video descriptions might be rare, reaching out to creators through comments or provided contact information can be fruitful. # Training Your Own Models Given the challenges and potential legal issues with using someone else's models (especially with the persons’ likenesses involved), one of the most recommended paths is to train your own models. This approach requires: - **Gathering a dataset:** Collect images or videos of the target and source faces. Ensure you have the right to use these images and, if possible, consent from the individuals depicted. - **Using DeepFaceLab:** Follow tutorials and documentation on how to train a model with your dataset. This can be computing-intensive and time-consuming but guarantees a unique model tailored to your specific need. # Legal and Ethical Considerations When searching for, sharing, or using DFL models, always prioritize ethical considerations. This involves obtaining consent from individuals whose likenesses you're using and respecting copyright laws. Avoid using or sharing models that could violate someone's privacy or be used for deceptive purposes. # Note on Direct Links Directly sharing links to DFL models, especially those containing the likenesses of individuals without clear consent or copyright permissions, could be legally and ethically problematic. Hence, most community guidelines and platforms will shy away from such practices. Always ensure that your use of DFL models is responsible, ethical, and in compliance with relevant laws and regulations. --- Given the nature of your request, this response focuses on guiding you on where and how to find or create DFL models responsibly rather than direct links, emphasizing the importance of ethical and legal considerations in the process."},{"instruction":"help me translate to english: 当选择Avg Paid / Occur. / Visit / Claim Parameter的时候，百分比相加总和不等于100%","output":"When selecting the Avg Paid / Occur. / Visit / Claim Parameter, the sum of percentages does not equal 100%."},{"instruction":"correct eng - famous quorte you ane me people like use no matter we do the oyther people will alwys deslikes us so it sbetter for us to do whay we do best","output":"A corrected and more coherent version of the quote might be: \\"Famous quote: 'You and I, people like us, no matter what we do, there will always be others who dislike us.

This class, \`ServicesApiOcaPeekDataHelper\`, contains methods for various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, as well as other specific business logic related to handling visits and visitors, using an Entity Framework context (\`OCAPEEKEntities\`) for database operations. Here are some key components and functionalities provided by this class: 1. **Initialization and Cleanup**: The constructor initializes an \`OCAPEEKEntities\` instance, and the \`Dispose\` method cleans it up, adhering to the disposable pattern. 2. **Database Connection Check**: Methods like \`CheckConnectionBase()\` and \`CheckAccessTable()\` provide mechanisms to verify database availability and access to a specific table. 3. **Retrieving and Manipulating Visits**: Functions like \`ListeVisites()\`, \`GetVisite()\`, \`ModifierVisite()\`, and \`ArchiveVisite()\` are used to list, retrieve specific details, modify, and archive visits, respectively. 4. **Visitor Management**: Methods such as \`ListeVisiteur()\`, \`ModifierVisiteur()\`, \`CreerVisiteur()\`, and \`ConfirmationVisiteur()\` deal with listing, modifying, creating visitors, and handling visitor confirmation. 5. **Visit Responses and Presence**: Functions like \`EnvoieReponseVisite()\`, \`EnvoieRefusVisiteur()\`, and \`SignalerPresenceVisiteur()\` are designed to handle responses from visitors to visits, refusal of visits by visitors, and marking the presence of visitors. 6. **Visit and Visitor Creation**: The \`CreerVisite()\` method allows for creating a new visit along with details about visitors, leveraging entity relationships. Similarly, \`CreeHoraire()\` and \`CreerVisiteur()\` handle creating schedules and visitors. 7. **Utility Methods**: Include methods for internal checks and manipulation, such as checking if a visit is refused, programmed, initiated, or in progress based on visitor responses and presence. Throughout, the class leverages Entity Framework's LINQ capabilities for querying and manipulating data, with operations on entities like \`OP_VISITE\`, \`OP_VISITEUR\`, \`OP_DATE_HORAIRE\`, and others. Error handling is seen in some methods, throwing custom exceptions or logging errors using a utility presumably defined elsewhere (\`Utils.ElmahLogException()\`). This class thus centralizes data access logic concerning visits and visitors for the application, abstracting away the complexities of directly interacting with the database and providing a more manageable, high-level API for the rest of the application to interact with these entities."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Most jeans today are made from a combination of cotton and synthetic materials, like elastane (spandex), which can affect how much you can shrink them. Pure cotton jeans will shrink more than those with a blend of fabrics. Here's how you can try shrinking your jeans: # Washing Machine and Dryer Method 1. **Wash on Hot:** Place your jeans in the washing machine. Set it to the hottest water setting available. The heat from the water will cause the fibers in the jeans to contract, leading to shrinkage. 2. **Dry on High Heat:** After the wash cycle is complete, transfer your jeans to the dryer. Use the highest heat setting. The heat from the dryer will further shrink the jeans. Keep in mind that this method can be harsh on the fabric and may reduce the lifespan of your jeans. 3. **Repeat if Necessary:** Try the jeans on after they've cooled down. If they haven't shrunk enough, you can repeat the process. Sometimes, it takes a couple of cycles to achieve the desired fit. # Boiling Water Method 1. **Boil Water:** Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. 2. **Soak the Jeans:** Turn off the heat once the water is boiling. Using a wooden spoon or another utensil, carefully submerge your jeans in the boiling water. Let them sit in the hot water for about 20-30 minutes. 3. **Dry with Heat:** Carefully remove the jeans from the water (they will be very hot) and wring out excess water. Proceed to dry them on the highest heat setting in your dryer. # Hot Bath Method 1. **Wear Your Jeans:** Put on the jeans that you want to shrink. It's a good idea to wear a pair of shorts underneath for comfort. 2. **Fill a Bathtub with Hot Water:** Fill your bathtub with hot water, as hot as you can comfortably tolerate. 3. **Sit in the Bathtub:** Sit in the hot water with the jeans on for about 15-20 minutes. The fabric will start to shrink around you. 4. **Dry on Your Body or in the Dryer:** After you've soaked in the tub, you can either let the jeans dry on your body for a closer fit or take them off and put them in the dryer on a hot setting. # Note: - Be cautious with jeans that contain elastane or other synthetic fibers, as high heat can damage the stretchiness of the fabric over time. - Some loss of color can occur during these processes, especially in darker denim, so be mindful of that. - Always check the care label before attempting to shrink your jeans, as some finishes or treatments on the denim might react poorly to these methods. Remember, these methods can work to varying degrees and might not offer the tailored fit you would get from alterations. If your jeans are substantially too big, it might be more practical to have them altered by a professional tailor."},{"instruction":"Роль зрительного анализатора в психофизическом развитии ребенка.
