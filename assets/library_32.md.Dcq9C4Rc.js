I put the toy into the bucket as part of the process to clean it. The","output":"toy, which was covered in dirt and grime from being played with outdoors for hours, desperately needed thorough cleaning and disinfection to ensure its continued use would be safe and enjoyable for the children. The bucket, filled with warm soapy water, was the first step in a multi-stage cleaning procedure designed to thoroughly remove all contaminants and preserve the toy's durability and appearance. As I submerged the toy into the soapy water within the bucket, I gently agitated the toy, ensuring that the mixture reached every crevice, seam, and surface to effectively break up and dissolve the stubborn dirt. The inclusion of a mild detergent in the water not only facilitated the removal of dirt but also helped to penetrate and remove any accumulated grease, sweat, and grime from the toy's surface. For areas that were particularly difficult to reach, I utilized a soft-bristled brush to scrub gently without causing damage to the toy's material. Following the initial cleaning, I removed the toy from the soapy bucket and rinsed it thoroughly under lukewarm running water, taking care to eliminate any residual soap and dislodged dirt. This step was crucial to avoiding soap build-up, which could cause skin irritation or even compromise the materials and colors of the toy. Once thoroughly rinsed, the toy was carefully inspected for any remaining stubborn stains or deposits. If necessary, the process of soaking and scrubbing in the bucket would be repeated to ensure a completely clean and sanitized surface. Additionally, at this stage, an optional disinfecting step could be included using a mixture of diluted bleach or a non-toxic disinfectant specially formulated for children's toys. The final step in the cleaning process involved air-drying the toy, either by placing it in an area with good air circulation or on a clean, dry towel to absorb any excess moisture. Drying the toy with direct sunlight was discouraged, as it could cause some toys to fade or become brittle over time. By the time the toy was fully dried and ready to be handled again, I could be confident that it was not only visually clean but also safely sanitized, ensuring hours of continued play and enjoyment for the children. Moreover, with regular cleaning and proper care, the lifespan of the toy would be significantly extended, maintaining its appearance and functional integrity for many fun-filled days to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Act introduced the concepts of assured tenancy and assured shorthold tenancy. It also facilitated the transfer of council housing to not-for-profit housing associations. Is the following statement correct based on the text is the housing act 1988 still in force","output":"Yes, the Housing Act 1988 is still in force in the United Kingdom. However, it is essential to understand that various amendments have been made to the Act since its introduction, and some provisions have been replaced or updated by subsequent legislation. The Housing Act 1988 made significant changes to the private rented sector and the relationship between landlords and tenants in the UK. It aimed to encourage investment in the private rented sector by providing a new framework for tenancy agreements and greater protection for landlords through the introduction of assured tenancy and assured shorthold tenancy. Assured tenancies give tenants long-term security of tenure, and they can only be evicted based on specific grounds mentioned in the Act. Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) is a more common type of residential tenancy, which allows landlords to evict tenants without specifying a reason after the fixed term has ended (usually six months to one year) provided that proper notice is given. The Act also enabled the transfer of council housing to not-for-profit housing associations, which aimed to stimulate investment and promote housing diversification. This allowed housing associations to take on a more significant role in the provision of social and affordable housing. Since the Housing Act 1988, several other pieces of legislation and amendments have been introduced which impact the rented sector, including: 1. The Housing Act 1996, which adjusted the definition of homelessness and clarified priority need categories when applying for homelessness assistance. 2. The Housing Act 2004, which introduced the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS) and mandatory licensing for houses in multiple occupation (HMOs). 3. The Localism Act 2011, which amended the homelessness duty of local authorities, reduced the security of tenure for some new social housing tenants, and introduced the concept of \\"affordable rent\\" tenancies. 4. The Deregulation Act 2015, which reformed the requirements for serving a Section 21 notice to end an Assured Shorthold Tenancy. 5. The Tenant Fees Act 2019, which banned most letting fees charged to tenants and capped deposit amounts. Despite these subsequent legislations, the Housing Act 1988 remains in force and serves as the basis for modern private residential landlord and tenant law in the UK. However, it is crucial to consider the amendments and supplementary regulations when interpreting the current legal framework governing tenancies and landlord-tenant relationships in the United Kingdom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Yes, \\"know what their friend said\\" is a valid answer to the question, \\"Why did Addison do this?\\". Let me explain this in more detail. In the given scenario, Addison is holding the phone so that they can hear their friend talking. This action indicates that Addison wants to make sure they can clearly hear and understand the conversation taking place.

Fighting back: A group of prominent Hispanic women want an apology from ABC following remarks made by 'sources' on The View about Rosie Perez The View has come under attack from a group of prominent Hispanic women who say the recent treatment of reportedly ousted panel member Rosie Perez has been both racist and sexist. The actress is the center of much talk at the moment that she was fired as a present on The View after less than one season. She is currently on hiatus to perform in Broadway's Fish in the Dark, but insiders say she never adjusted to either the show's signature hard news/soft news chat format or reading a teleprompter. 'The brass at","output":"ABC has deeply disappointed and offended a significant group of prominent Hispanic women with their recent actions and comments regarding The View's Rosie Perez,' the women said in a statement released to the media. 'We believe that ABC has a responsibility to address the serious allegations that have been made by sources on the show, as well as make a formal apology to Ms. Perez and the Hispanic community for these numerous missteps.' In recent weeks, various sources close to The View have made inflammatory and derogatory remarks about Rosie Perez, which have left many feeling that the treatment of the actress and host has been both racist and sexist. The comments have included statements that cast doubt on her intellect, professionalism, and effectiveness as a co-host, despite her notable accomplishments in her career and her sizable fan base. The sources have also fueled rumors that the network was planning to fire Perez, reportedly due to alleged difficulties in adjusting to the show's format and reading a teleprompter. The fact that these negative comments and insinuations have become public, without any official statement from ABC or The View to clarify or counter them, is a major cause for concern. It leaves the impression that the network and the show are either endorsing these views or turning a blind eye to the blatant disrespect shown to Rosie Perez and, by extension, to Hispanic women in general. It further perpetuates harmful stereotypes, such as the notion that Hispanic women, no matter their accomplishments, are less capable and intelligent than their non-Hispanic peers. As a result, the group of prominent Hispanic women is demanding that ABC take decisive action in this matter, not only by issuing a formal apology to Rosie Perez, but also by demonstrating a genuine commitment to diversity and inclusiveness on its network. This means not only hiring more Hispanic women at all levels, from cast and crew to executives, but also actively promoting a culture of mutual respect and understanding within the organization. By doing so, ABC can send a powerful message that racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination have no place in the entertainment industry or in our society at large. Moreover, because The View is a talk show that regularly discusses social issues, including race and gender, it is especially important that its panel members and the way they are treated on the show reflect the diversity and dignity of the people and viewpoints being discussed. The View's producers should seize this opportunity to model better behavior and showcase genuine respect for all of their panel members, regardless of race, gender, or other differences. The View has a longstanding history of showcasing strong, intelligent, and dynamic women of various backgrounds. The show has celebrated its ability to bring together differing perspectives and engage in meaningful conversations on a wide range of topics. This is why it is especially disheartening to witness the disrespectful treatment of Rosie Perez, a woman who embodies all of these qualities. In conclusion, the group of prominent Hispanic women is urging ABC to take responsibility for the hurtful comments made by sources on The View by issuing a heartfelt apology to Rosie Perez and striving to create a more diverse and inclusive environment on the show and at the network. By doing so, ABC can demonstrate a genuine commitment to respecting the dignity and contributions of all individuals, regardless of their ethnicity, gender, or background, and can help to move our society closer to true equality and understanding."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Lizzie Morrison (Emily Mortimer) and nine-year-old deaf son Frankie (Jack McElhone) frequently relocate to keep one step ahead of her abusive ex-husband and his family. They are accompanied by her opinionated, chain-smoking mother Nell. Newly relocated in the Scottish town of Greenock, Lizzie accepts a job at the local fish and chips shop owned by a friendly woman named Marie, and enrolls Frankie in school. Through a Glasgow post office box, Frankie maintains a regular correspondence with someone he believes to be his father, Davey, who allegedly is a merchant seaman working on the HMS Accra. In reality, the letters he receives are written by his mother, who prefers maintaining this charade instead of telling the boy the reason she fled her marriage. When she learns that the Accra will soon be arriving at the docks at Greenock, Lizzie in a panic concocts a scheme to hire a man to impersonate Davey. When her effort to find someone at the local pub fails, she enlists Marie's assistance. Marie arranges for her to meet an acquaintance who coincidentally is passing through town at the same time the Accra will be in port. When Lizzie and the stranger (Gerard Butler) meet, he doesn't tell her his name. Lizzie explains the situation and gives him the letters to provide some background. He agrees to spend a day with Frankie in exchange for the meager payment Lizzie can offer him. When the stranger arrives at their home to pick up the boy, he brings with him a book about marine life (to Lizzie's surprise), one of Frankie's passions, and a bond is forged immediately. The two spend a day together (with Lizzie secretly following them), collecting on Frankie's bet at a soccer match from a school mate, ordering chips, and later in the evening setting up another half day visit. The second day is magical, ending with a nice evening at a dance, as Frankie wins another bet by getting Lizzie and the stranger to dance together.

Question: You are given a new situation: Bill and Larry did some research on fungi. Larry researched saprophytic fungi, while Bill researched parasitic fungi. They later exchanged findings.  and a hint : They feed on living hosts. As parasites , fungi live in or on other organisms and get their nutrients from their host. Parasitic fungi use enzymes to break down living tissue, which may causes illness in the host. Disease-causing fungi are parasitic. Recall that parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship between organisms of different species in which one, the parasite, benefits from a close association with the other, the host, which is harmed.  Please answer this question : Which researcher learned less about fungi that get their nutrients from their host? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's break down the information provided step by step: 1. Bill researched parasitic fungi. 2. Larry researched saprophytic fungi. 3. The hint provided states that parasitic fungi feed on living hosts and get their nutrients from their host.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Background: Sir Curtly Elconn Lynwall Ambrose, KCN (born 21 September 1963) is a former cricketer from Antigua who played 98 Test matches for the West Indies. A fast bowler, he took 405 Test wickets at an average of 20.99 and topped the ICC Player Rankings for much of his career to be rated the best bowler in the world. His great height--he is 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) tall--allowed him to make the ball bounce unusually high after he delivered it; allied to his pace and accuracy, it made him a difficult bowler for batsmen to face. A man of few words during his career, he was notoriously reluctant to speak to journalists. Context: During the 1991-92 season, West Indies played mainly one-day cricket, taking part in tournaments in Sharjah--where Ambrose took seven wickets, including an analysis of five for 53--and Australia, and took part in the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. In this tournament, Ambrose took seven wickets in seven games at an average of 33.57 and was the seventh most economical bowler among those who played more than one game. West Indies finished sixth in the qualifying table and failed to reach the semi-finals. Ambrose returned home to play twice for the Leeward Islands in January 1992.  In April 1992, South Africa toured West Indies for the first time, and played their first Test match for 22 years. Ambrose played in all three ODIs, all of which were won by West Indies. The Test match was the first time West Indies bowled under a new playing regulation which permitted only one bouncer per over; this seemed to affect the home bowlers, but Ambrose took two for 47 from 36 overs. South Africa began the final day of the match requiring 79 runs to win with just two batsmen out, but Ambrose and Courtney Walsh took the last eight wickets for 26 runs to bowl West Indies to a 52-run win. On a difficult pitch for batting, the ball bounced unevenly, and both bowlers concentrated on accuracy. Ambrose took six for 34 in the second innings, and was named joint man of the match; in just over 60 overs, he took eight for 81 in the match.  Returning to play for Northamptonshire, he was less effective. Hampered by a knee injury, which necessitated surgery after the English season, and suffering from many dropped catches, he took 50 first-class wickets at an average of 26.14, but his performance compared unfavourably with other bowlers on the team. He was more effective in the NatWest Trophy, a one-day competition that Northamptonshire won that season, in which he conceded fewer than two runs per over across five games. Question: What was the most significant event during this competition?. Whats the answer?","output":"The most significant event during this competition was the 1991-92 World Cup, in which Sir Curtly Ambrose took seven wickets in seven games at an average of 33.57 and was the seventh most economical bowler among those who played more than one game. Unfortunately, the West Indies finished sixth in the qualifying table and failed to reach the semi-finals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They enjoy living in their suburb quite a lot; Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Staying in our apartment on the North Shore of Vancouver, we were tucked into a sleepy, suburban idyll where once off the busy highway, kids played ball games in the street and cats strolled around their own home territories without a care in the world. It is also home to the famous Capilano Suspension Bridge, but warned that the crowds in mid-August would be overwhelming, we were given the tipoff that the Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge and the surrounding park is a lovely place to while away an afternoon. Smaller, free and with loads of walks and picnic areas, I sent my intrepid husband ahead to brave the canyon bridge whilst I sipped a much-needed coffee in the local cafe. It was beautiful. It’s mostly because the thought of hopping onto a swaying bridge above the ravine gives me the heebie-jeebies, whereas he will stride across panels of transparent glass suspended metres above busy streets (like Tower Bridge) or gondola rides that skim well above the treetops (like Japan lake or the Bavarian Alpine range.) Watching the shower of golden pine needles drift down from the redwoods whilst I typed out a blog post, I enjoyed seeing squirrels scamper and birds twitter their way around the boughs and branches. That blur below? A local black squirrel who was foraging amongst the cooing tourists for snacks… About 20 minutes later his grinning face floated back into view, and he brandished his phone with images of his quick wander through the trails. Lynn Canyon Park officially opened to the public in 1912; there are several trails throughout the park to choose from for a leisurely hike including the popular Baden Powell Trail and there are also many breathtaking waterfalls and popular swimming holes which are perfect during the summer months. Lynn Canyon Park covers 617 acres today and comprises of second growth forest with most of the trees aged approximately 80 to 100 years old. Question: How does the narrator and her husband probably feel about living in Vancouver? Answer: A:","output":"D). They enjoy living in their suburb quite a lot; Based on the context provided, it seems that the narrator and her husband enjoy living in their suburb in Vancouver. The text describes the North Shore of Vancouver as a \\"sleepy, suburban idyll,\\" which implies a quiet and pleasant living environment, away from the hustle and bustle of a busy city. The narrator also mentions how kids played ball games in the streets and cats roamed freely, adding to the calm and charming atmosphere of the suburb. In addition, the narrator shares her experience visiting a local attraction, the Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge, and its surrounding park. She describes the park as \\"a lovely place to while away an afternoon,\\" with its beautiful scenery and the opportunity to watch squirrels and birds go about their activities. This indicates that the couple appreciates the natural beauty and recreational offerings of their suburban location. Furthermore, the husband seems adventurous and unafraid of exploring new trails or crossing daring bridges, while the narrator finds solace in sipping coffee at a local cafe. These different activities and preferences highlight that there are various options available to them in their suburban neighborhood, which cater to their individual interests and enjoyment. In conclusion, the overall tone and content of the provided context suggest that the narrator and her husband enjoy living in their suburb in Vancouver quite a lot, as they are surrounded by nature, tranquility, and various recreational options that appeal to their personalities and preferences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Warning: This post contains graphic content      A demonstration billed as a march for \\"law and order\\" in the streets of Portland descended into chaos as rival political factions broke into bloody brawls downtown Saturday night.      Members of the right-wing group Patriot Prayer and their black-clad adversaries, known as antifa, used bear spray, bare fists and batons to thrash each other outside Kelly's Olympian, a popular bar on Southwest Washington Street.      The melee, which lasted more than a minute, ended when riot cops rushed in and fired pepper balls at the street fighters.      The Portland Police Bureau reported seeing protest and counter-protest participants outfitted with hard knuckle gloves, knives and firearms earlier in the evening. Police said they made no arrests Saturday night, but will continue to investigate.      The wild scene unfolded amid mounting tensions among both groups, fueled in part by a pair of national news stories.      A march in Portland against police brutality last week drew headlines after law enforcement's hands-off approach to the event was blamed for an encounter between protesters and an elderly driver, which outraged many, including Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson and his supporters.      On Friday, viral video surfaced showing members of the Proud Boys, a right-wing fraternal organization, beating two or three protesters in New York City after an event at the Republican Party headquarters.      It was against this backdrop that Gibson, who counts a number of Proud Boys among his ranks, organized the so-called \\"Flash march for Law and Order in PDX\\" — ostensibly to protest Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and his oversight of the city's police force.      Waving American flags and breaking into patriotic chants, Gibson and several dozen supporters set off to a street memorial for Patrick Kimmons, a 27-year-old black man shot and killed by police, an incident that prompted last week's march.      As they arrived at the vigil on Southwest Fourth Avenue and Harvey Milk Street, they were met by a large group of counter-demonstrators chanting \\"Black Lives Matter.\\"      The two sides exchanged taunts and threats as police stood by and warned against physical confrontation.      About 20 minutes later, the violence erupted a few blocks away among a smaller group of the participants.      Below is a detailed timeline of events from the evening.

Which farm didn't help stabilize the soil?  Two neighboring farms both had depleted soils due to intensive agricultural practices for decades. Apple far decided to start an agroforestry system and other methods to protect their depleted soils, while Pear farm did nothing and had big losses the following years.  Hint: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: Answer:","output":"Pear farm didn't help stabilize the soil."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: My mother’s first career was as a beautician. Growing up, she cut everyone in our family’s hair; she dyed mine whenever I wanted, and whatever crazy color I wanted, too. Until I was a senior in high school, I had never been to a salon. I don’t even remember why I went this time. Mom was going to have her hair done, and I had tagged along. She asked if I wanted a cut too and I said why not? So while Mom was getting her hair done I looked through the books and picked out a cute pageboy style that I liked. Finally it was my turn and after talking with the stylist and showing her what I wanted, she led me to the shampoo station. Now, as everybody who has ever been to a salon knows, you sit back in the chair with your neck in the indentation and they wash your hair. But I had never been to a salon. When mom washed my hair after dyeing it, I always leaned over the sink. So … I started to climb into the chair and lean over the sink here, too. My mom was mortified and the stylist couldn’t figure out what in the heck I was doing. Mom calls out, “No, Jennifer … you sit in the chair.” I look over my shoulder at her and then realize what I’ve done. Red-faced, I stand up and then turn around to sit and lean back in the chair. I honestly wanted to die right there. I’m pretty sure the stylist thought I was developmentally delayed or something because she talked to me for the rest of the time like one would talk to a three-year-old. Mom tried to explain that I’d never been to a salon before, but I think that just made the situation worse. Thankfully I’ve been to many salons now and understand how everything works, but I’ve never returned to THAT one. Question: How long did Jennifer probably spend at the beauty parlor? === The answer to the above question is The answer is:","output":"Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine the exact duration of Jennifer's visit to the beauty parlor. However, we can make an educated guess by considering the series of events: 1. Jennifer accompanied her mother to the salon. 2. She browsed through style books while her mother was getting her hair done. 3. Jennifer discussed the desired hairstyle with the stylist. 4. She experienced some confusion regarding the shampooing process. 5. The stylist completed Jennifer's haircut. Typically, a salon visit for a haircut may last anywhere from 30 minutes to 1.5 hours, depending on the complexity of the desired style and other factors like the place in the queue, the overall level of service, and potential wait times. Considering that Jennifer had to pick a hairstyle and experienced an awkward moment around the shampoo station, her visit might be on the longer side of those estimates. It is likely that she spent somewhere between 45 minutes to 1.5 hours at the beauty parlor.

Information:  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - John Wesley (or ; 2 March 1791) was an Anglican cleric and theologian who, with his brother Charles and fellow cleric George Whitefield, founded Methodism.  - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments.  - Martin Luther (10 November 1483  18 February 1546), O.S.A., was a German professor of theology, composer, priest, monk and a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation. Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God's punishment for sin could be purchased with money, proposing an academic discussion of the practice and efficacy of indulgences in his \\"Ninety-five Theses\\" of 1517. His refusal to renounce all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor.  - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".  - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.  - Pontius Pilate (or ; Latin: \\"Pontius Pltus\\", , \\"Pontios Pltos\\") was the fifth prefect of the Roman province of Judaea from AD 2636. He served under Emperor Tiberius, and is best known today for the trial and crucifixion of Jesus.  - Charles Wesley (or ; 18 December 1707  29 March 1788) was an English leader of the Methodist movement, most widely known for writing more than 6,000 hymns.  - Lutheranism is a major branch of Protestant Christianity which identifies with the theology of Martin Luther (1483-1546), a German friar, ecclesiastical reformer and theologian.  - George Whitefield (30 September 1770), also spelled George Whitfield, was an English Anglican cleric who was one of the founders of Methodism and the evangelical movement.  - Methodism, or the Methodist movement, is a group of historically related denominations of Protestant Christianity which derive their inspiration from the life and teachings of John Wesley. George Whitefield and John's brother Charles Wesley were also significant leaders in the movement. It originated as a revival within the 18th century Church of England and became a separate Church after Wesley's death. Because of vigorous missionary work, the movement spread throughout the British Empire, the United States and beyond, today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide.  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.  - Generically, a Galilean is an inhabitant of Galilee. Historically, a Galilean dialect of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic was spoken there. Later, the term was used to refer to the early Christians, among others by the Roman emperors Julian and Marcus Aurelius.  - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or   , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD. John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these traditions, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian traditions.  - Joseph ( Hebrew  , Yosef ; Greek :  , Ioseph ) is a figure in the Gospels , the husband of the Blessed Virgin Mary , the mother of Jesus , and is venerated as Saint Joseph in the Catholic Church , Eastern Orthodox Church , Oriental Orthodox Church , Anglican Communion , Lutheranism and Methodism . Christian tradition places Joseph as Jesus ' foster father . Some historians state that Joseph was Jesus 's father . Some differing views are due to theological interpretations versus historical views . The Pauline epistles make no reference to Jesus 's father ; nor does the Gospel of Mark . The first appearance of Joseph is in the gospels of Matthew and Luke . Each contains a genealogy of Jesus showing ancestry from king David , but through different sons ; Matthew follows the major royal line from Solomon , while Luke traces another line back to Nathan , another son of David and Bathsheba . Consequently , all the names between David and Joseph are different . According to Matthew 1:16 \`\` Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary '' , while according to Luke 3:23 , Joseph is said to be \`\` ( the son ) of Heli '' . Some scholars reconcile the genealogies by viewing the Solomonic lineage in Matthew as Joseph 's major royal line , and the Nathanic lineage in Luke to be Mary 's minor line . In Catholic and other traditions , Joseph is the patron saint of workers and has several feast days . He was also declared to be the patron saint and protector of the Catholic Church by Pope Pius IX in 1870 , and is the patron of several countries and regions . With the growth of Mariology , the theological field of Josephology has also grown and since the 1950s centers for studying it have been formed .  - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion.

Paraphrasing refers to expressing the same idea using different words and sentence structures without changing the meaning of the original statement. In this case, both sentences convey the same information—that St. Catherine of Sienna private elementary school closed down in June 2012.  The first sentence begins with \\"The private elementary school of St. Catherine of Sienna\\" while the second sentence starts with \\"The private St. Catherine of Sienna elementary school.\\" These two phrases represent the same entity, which is the private elementary school named St. Catherine of Sienna. The latter part of both sentences is nearly identical, with both stating that the closure occurred in June 2012. Therefore, despite small differences in their structure, the two sentences essentially communicate the same message and can be considered paraphrases of each other. It is important to note that paraphrasing is a valuable tool in writing and communication, as it allows individuals to share the same information or idea in varied ways. This can be particularly helpful when it comes to clarifying statements, summarizing complex ideas, or reiterating points for emphasis. Moreover, paraphrasing encourages writers and speakers to fully understand the information they are presenting, as it requires them to distill the core message of the original statement and reframe that message using different language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 3: Determine connection or influence between them - Considering the coal power generation process and pancake making process are two independent events, they don't influence each other. Step 4: Conclude the answer - Therefore, we can conclude that mixing pancake mix with the correct ratio of liquid will have no effect on more coal arriving at the power station."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which entity is this text about? Wilhelmus Simon Petrus Fortuijn, known as Pim Fortuyn (Dutch: ['pIm for'toeyn] ( listen); 19 February 1948 - 6 May 2002), was a Dutch politician, civil servant, sociologist, author and professor who formed his own party, Pim Fortuyn List (Lijst Pim Fortuyn or LPF) in 2002. Fortuyn was often regarded as controversial due to his outspoken views about multiculturalism, immigration and Islam in the Netherlands. He called Islam \\"a backward culture\\", and was quoted as saying that if it were legally possible, he would close the borders for Muslim immigrants. He was labelled a far-right populist by his opponents and in the media, but he fiercely rejected this label. On 6 May 2002, at age 54, Fortuyn was assassinated in Hilversum, North Holland, by Volkert van der Graaf. The attack took place in a parking lot outside a radio studio where Fortuyn had just given an interview. This was nine days before the general election, for which he was running. The attacker was pursued by Hans Smolders, Fortuyn's driver, and was arrested by the police shortly afterward, still in possession of a handgun. Months later, Van der Graaf confessed in court to the first notable political assassination in the Netherlands since 1672 (excluding World War II), and on 15 April 2003, he was convicted of assassinating Fortuyn and sentenced to 18 years in prison. He was released on parole in May 2014 after serving two thirds of his sentence, the standard procedure under the Dutch penal system.  The assassination shocked many residents of the Netherlands and highlighted the cultural clashes within the country. Various conspiracy theories arose after Pim Fortuyn's murder and deeply affected Dutch politics and society. Politicians from all parties suspended campaigning. After consultation with LPF, the government decided not to postpone the elections. As Dutch law did not permit modifying the ballots, Fortuyn became a posthumous candidate. The LPF made an unprecedented debut in the House of Representatives by winning 26 seats (17% of the 150 seats in the house). The LPF joined a cabinet with the Christian Democratic Appeal and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, but conflicts in the rudderless LPF quickly collapsed the cabinet, forcing new elections. By the following year, the party had lost support, winning only eight seats in the 2003 elections. It won no seats in the 2006 elections, by which time the Party for Freedom, led by Geert Wilders, had emerged as a successor.  During the last months of his life, Fortuyn had become closer to the Catholic Church. To the surprise of many commentators and Dutch TV hosts, Fortuyn insisted on Fr. Louis Berger, a parish priest from The Hague, accompanying him in some of his last TV appearances. According to the New York Times, Berger had become his \\"friend and confessor\\" during the last weeks of his life.  Fortuyn was initially buried in Driehuis in the Netherlands. He was re-interred on 20 July 2002, at San Giorgio della Richinvelda, in the province of Pordenone in Italy, where he had owned a house.

Q:Information:  - The Ozarks, also referred to as the Ozark Mountains, Ozarks Mountain Country, and the Ozark Plateau, is a physiographic and geologic highland region of the central United States, primarily in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. The Ozarks cover a significant portion of southern Missouri, extending as far northeast as the southwestern suburbs of St. Louis. In Arkansas, a large portion is contained within the northwestern and northcentral region. Much smaller pieces of the Ozarks extend westward into northeastern Oklahoma and extreme southeastern Kansas.  - The tallgrass prairie is an ecosystem native to central North America. Natural and anthropogenic fire, as well as grazing by large mammals (primarily bison), were historically agents of periodic disturbance, which regulates tree encroachment, recycles nutrients to the soil, and catalyzes some seed dispersal and germination processes. Prior to widespread use of the steel plow, which enabled conversion to agricultural land use, tallgrass prairies expanded throughout the American Midwest and smaller portions of southern central Canada, from the transitional ecotones out of eastern North American forests, west to a climatic threshold based on precipitation and soils, to the southern reaches of the Flint Hills in Oklahoma, to a transition into forest in Manitoba.   - Richard Hanson ( born February 20 , 1940 ) served as secretary of state of Missouri in 1994 following the removal from office of his predecessor , Judith Moriarty . A Democrat from Cole County , Hanson served on an interim basis in 1994 from the time of Moriarty 's removal from office by the Missouri Supreme Court following her impeachment by the Missouri House of Representatives until Governor Mel Carnahan appointed Bekki Cook to serve until the following scheduled election for the office .  - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.  - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel.  - St. Louis is an independent city and major U.S. port in the State of Missouri, built along the western bank of the Mississippi River, on the border with Illinois. The city has an estimated 2015 population of 315,685, and is the cultural and economic center of the Greater St. Louis area (home to 2,916,447 people), making it the largest metropolitan area in Missouri and the 19th-largest in the United States.  - Judith K. Moriarty (born February 2, 1942) is an American politician from Missouri, first with the Democratic Party, switching to the Libertarian Party in 2005. She was the first woman to serve as Missouri Secretary of State.  - The Missouri Bootheel is the southeasternmost part of the state of Missouri, extending south of 36°30 north latitude, so called because its shape in relation to the rest of the state resembles the heel of a boot. Strictly speaking, it is composed of the counties of Dunklin, New Madrid, and Pemiscot. However, the term is locally used to refer to the entire southeastern lowlands of Missouri located within the Mississippi Embayment, which includes parts of Butler, Mississippi, Ripley, Scott, Stoddard and extreme southern portions of Cape Girardeau and Bollinger counties. The largest city in the region is Kennett.    What entity does 'richard hanson ' has the relation 'occupation' with?

Question: Article: The financial crisis is reminding Americans of a lesson they first learned in childhood: Share and share alike. They are sharing or swapping tools and books, cars and handbags, time and talent. The renewed desire to share shows up in a variety of examples: A car-sharing service has had a 70 percent membership increase since the crisis occurred. Some companies encouraged his employees to take vanpooling. Governments are putting bikes on the street for public use. How-to-swap Web sites are increasing quickly. The economy reflects the way Americans have cut back, especially on daily items: Department store sales dropped 1.3 percent in June. People are not buying cars, and as a result, auto sales dropped 27.7 percent last month. They are not paying others to do what they can do themselves -- Home Depot reports increased attendance at in-store do-it-yourself clinics. And although paint sales are down in general, according to Sherwin-Williams, individual consumers are still buying. When Tom Burdett needed to cut some tiles at his home outside Annapolis, he refused to buy expensive tools. So he asked his neighbors and friends for help. Sure enough, someone had just what he needed. And when that friend needed help fixing a satellite dish, Burdett volunteered to help. The sharing mind-set is not new to the American culture, but many Americans give it up when the nation changed from an agricultural society to an industrial one, said Rosemary Hornak, a psychology professor at Meredith College in Raleigh, N.C. They moved farther from their families and did not have time to connect with new neighbors because they worked so much, she said. Neighborhood conversations tell more of the story as the movement grows organically   in communities across the Washington region and the nation. On one street in Arlington, for example, neighbors are collecting their separate money for mulch   and dividing it among themselves. Question: What is the text mainly about? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Sharing in the financial crisis.\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the text is mainly about \\"Sharing in the financial crisis.\\" It describes how Americans are resorting to sharing resources, swapping items, and helping one another during the financial crisis. Examples include increased membership in car-sharing services, shared commuting (vanpooling), public bike programs, and growth in how-to-swap websites. People are cutting back on spending by doing things themselves and turning to others for help instead of purchasing new items or services. This sharing mindset had diminished as society shifted from agricultural to industrial, but it's now seeing a resurgence during the financial crisis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.  - Slapstick is a style of humor involving exaggerated physical activity which exceeds the boundaries of normal physical comedy. The term arises from a device developed during the broad, physical comedy style known as Commedia dell'arte in 16th Century Italy. The 'slap stick' consists of two thin slats of wood made from splitting a single long stick, which make a 'slap' when striking another actor, with little force needed to make a loud - and comical - sound.  - A joke is a display of humour in which words are used within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people laugh. It takes the form of a story, usually with dialogue, and ends in a punch line. It is in the punch line that the audience becomes aware that the story contains a second, conflicting meaning. This can be done using a pun or other word play such as irony, a logical incompatibility, nonsense or other means.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period. After completing the study, how does the author feel about the results? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - They believe restricting eating at night did result in a small amount of weight lost - not enough information - They believe they have unhealthy dietary habits - They believe there were no changes The answer to this question is:","output":"The researchers believe that restricting eating at night did result in a small amount of weight loss. The participants ate about 1000 kilojoules (approximately 250 calories) less per day during the restricted night eating period compared to their normal eating pattern.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Born in Scotland on 15 June 1792, he was son of John Mitchell of Carron Works and was brought up from childhood by his uncle, Thomas Livingstone of Parkhall, Stirlingshire. On the death of his uncle, he joined the British army in Portugal as a volunteer, at the age of sixteen. On 24 June 1811, at the age of nineteen, he received his first commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st Battalion 95th Rifles (later the Rifle Brigade / Royal Green Jackets). Utilising his skills as a draughtsman of outstanding ability, he was occasionally employed in the Quartermaster-General's department under Sir George Murray. Context: Mitchell's fourth expedition was into Queensland in 1845-46. He was convinced that a significant river must flow north-west into the Gulf of Carpentaria, this being the main thrust of the endeavour.  On 15 December 1845 Mitchell started from Boree (Buree in Mitchell's journal) with a large party including Edmund Kennedy as second in command (later speared to death at Escape River near Cape York). He struck the Darling River above Fort Bourke then continued to the Narran River, the Balonne, and the Culgoa. On 12 April 1846 he came to a natural bridge of rocks on the main branch of the Balonne which he called St.George Bridge, now the site of the town of St George. Kennedy was left in charge of the main body here, and was instructed to follow on slowly while Mitchell pushed ahead with a few men. Mitchell followed the Balonne to the Maranoa, and the Cogoon (now called Muckadilla Creek, near Roma). This rivulet led him to a magnificent pastoral district in the midst of which stood a solitary hill that he named Mount Abundance. He then crossed a low watershed to the Maranoa and awaited Kennedy's arrival. Kennedy rejoined Mitchell on 1 June 1846.  Leaving Kennedy for a second time, he set out on an extensive excursion of more than four months. Mitchell traversed the country at the head of the Maranoa and discovered the Warrago River. Keeping north over the watershed, he traversed the Claude and Nogoa rivers, then reached the Belyando River, an upper reach of the Burdekin River. This had already been discovered by Ludwig Leichhardt on his expedition to Port Essington on 2 April 1845. Intensely mortified to find that he was on a tributary of the Burdekin River, and approaching the ground already trodden by Leichhardt, he returned to the head of the Nogoa and struck west, after dividing his party and forming a stationary camp. He continued west, making a new discovery which he was certain was the fabled north-west river. In honour of the sovereign of the time he decided to call it Victoria River. Having run out of time, he turned back towards the main party. It was here that Mitchell first noticed the well known grass that bears his name. On the homeward journey he trekked along the Maranoa River to St.George Bridge, arriving in Sydney 20 January 1847. Later that year, Kennedy proved beyond doubt that the Victoria did not continue north-west, but turned south-west and joined Cooper Creek. He renamed the watercourse the Barcoo River from a name mentioned by local Aborigines. Question: Did anything interesting happen during his exploration? Answer:","output":"Yes, sweetie, during his exploration, many interesting things happened. This man, Mr. Mitchell, went on a big, big journey to find a special river. He started his journey with a big group of friends, including a man named Mr. Kennedy. As they went along, they came across many rivers and found a beautiful area with lots of good land for farming and a hill that he named Mount Abundance.  They traveled to a lot of places, discovering new rivers, but the most exciting thing happened when he found a river that no one else had found before. He thought he had found the river he was looking for and decided to name it Victoria River, after the queen. Isn't that sweet? During this journey, he also discovered a special type of grass, which now carries his name - can you imagine having a grass named after you? Sadly, they found out later that the river he thought was flowing northwest was actually flowing southwest and it was renamed to Barcoo River.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Recommendation: Congressional oversight for intelligence-and counterterrorism-is now dysfunctional. Congress should address this problem. We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this. Congress needs to establish for the Department of Homeland Security the kind of clear authority and responsibility that exist to enable the Justice Department to deal with crime and the Defense Department to deal with threats to national security.

Ferris frequently breaks the fourth wall, giving the audience advice on how to skip school, and to narrate about his friends. His younger sister Jeannie is less-convinced, but goes to school anyway. Dean of Students Edward R. Rooney notes and suspects Ferris is being truant again and commits to catching him. However, Ferris uses a computer to alter the school's records to indicate his absences from 9 to 2. Ferris convinces his friend Cameron Frye, who is absent due to illness, to report that his girlfriend Sloane Peterson's grandmother has died. Rooney doubts this, but they succeed as planned.

Human sciences study the role of emotions in mental processes, disorders, and neural mechanisms. In psychiatry, emotions are examined as part of the discipline's study and treatment of mental disorders in humans. Nursing studies emotions as part of its approach to the provision of holistic health care to humans. Psychology examines emotions from a scientific perspective by treating them as mental processes and behavior and they explore the underlying physiological and neurological processes. In neuroscience sub-fields such as social neuroscience and affective neuroscience, scientists study the neural mechanisms of emotion by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality, emotion, and mood. In linguistics, the expression of emotion may change to the meaning of sounds. In education, the role of emotions in relation to learning is examined.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Personality, emotion, and mood are characteristics that help define an individual's mental and emotional state, with each playing a distinct role in shaping an individual's overall psychological framework. These characteristics not only influence one's thoughts, feelings, and behavior but also interact with each other to create a unique personal profile. They offer a window into understanding the individual's psychological well-being and response patterns in various situations. Personality refers to the unique and enduring patterns of thought, emotion, and behavior that make up an individual's character. It encompasses a collection of traits that manifest themselves consistently across various situations and time. Personality is believed to have genetic and environmental influences and is considered relatively stable throughout one's lifetime. The study of personality contributes to the understanding of individual differences and highlights the diverse ways in which people perceive, experience, and interact with the world around them. Emotion, on the other hand, represents a complex psychological state that involves a subjective experience, physiological response, and expressive behavior. Emotions emerge as reactions to specific events, stimuli, or thoughts, serving essential functions such as guiding cognition and decision-making, aiding in survival, and facilitating social interaction. Emotions vary in their intensity, duration, and expression and can range from basic emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, and fear, to more complex emotional experiences like love, envy, and guilt. Emotions are often fleeting, and their manifestation depends on various factors, including one's personality, mood, and environment. Mood refers to the pervasive and sustained emotional state that influences an individual's perception of the world and general disposition. Unlike emotions that are usually short-lived and situation-specific, mood states can last for hours, days, or even longer. Moods impact a person's thoughts, feelings, and actions and can be positive, negative, or neutral. They are influenced by various factors such as genetics, brain chemistry, stress, and even external circumstances like weather and social interactions. Moods may vary from one person to another and may not necessarily be an accurate reflection of one's objective reality. In the context of the broader study of emotions in various disciplines, these three characteristics intertwine, providing a comprehensive understanding of a person's mental and emotional functioning. Recognizing and understanding the roles and connections between personality, emotion, and mood is crucial for the effective delivery and understanding of psychological interventions, self-awareness, and personal growth in various fields, including psychiatry, psychology, neuroscience, and education. For instance, in psychiatry, evaluating the interplay between personality traits, emotions, and mood states can assist clinicians in diagnosing mental disorders, determining appropriate treatments, and predicting prognosis. In psychology, researchers investigate the underlying mechanisms behind these characteristics to better understand human behavior and mental processes. In neuroscience, studies of neural mechanisms associated with personality, emotion, and mood facilitate understanding of the brain's affective systems and cognitive processing. In education, educators seek insight into the role emotions play in students' learning experiences, enabling the development of more effective teaching methods and fostering student success. In conclusion, personality, emotion, and mood are crucial characteristics in understanding an individual's mental and emotional state. These features are interconnected, and their analysis across different disciplines contributes to a deeper comprehension of human behavior and thought processes. Ultimately, such an understanding aids healthcare professionals, scientists, and educators in designing interventions and strategies that enhance overall well-being and promote personal growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Conscription, or drafting, is the compulsory enlistment of people in a national service, most often a military service. Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names. The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the French Revolution in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful military. Most European nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 18 years on active duty and then transfer to the reserve force.  - A conscientious objector is an \\"individual who has claimed the right to refuse to perform military service\\" on the grounds of freedom of thought, conscience, or religion. In general, conscientious objector status is considered only in the context of military conscription and is not applicable to volunteer military forces.  - The Big Read was a survey on books carried out by the BBC in the United Kingdom in 2003, where over three quarters of a million votes were received from the British public to find the nation's best-loved novel of all time.

Following the assault, one of the tanks—commanded by ruthless commander Daskal (George Dzundza)—takes a wrong turn through a mountain pass and enters a blind valley. Taj returns to discover the village destroyed, his father killed, and his brother martyred by being crushed under Daskal's tank. As the new khan following his brother's death, Taj is spurred to seek revenge by his cousin Moustafa, an opportunistic scavenger. Together they lead a band of mujahideen fighters into the valley to pursue Daskal's tank (which they call \\"The Beast\\"), counting on their captured RPG-7 anti-tank weapon to destroy it. Lost, isolated, and with their radio damaged in the attack, the tank crew set out to find Kandahar Road and return to Soviet lines. While camping for the night, Afghan communist crewman Samad educates the reluctant tank driver, Konstantin Koverchenko, about the Pashtun people's code of honour, Pashtunwali; particularly nanawatai, which requires that an enemy is to be given sanctuary if he asks. contains an answer for the question: Who plays the commander of the tank that kills Taj's brother?, what is it ?

Summarize this article: The auto critic at The Detroit News has resigned after editors told him to delete online portions of a scathing review of the Chrysler 200, a car that was promoted in a popular Super Bowl TV ad starring rapper Eminem.      In the newspaper's March 10 print edition, Scott Burgess said the car is a \\"dog\\" that lacks \\"inspiration or soul.\\" But the online version at www.detnews.com later was missing some criticism, including the \\"dog\\" reference.      Burgess told The Associated Press on Thursday that he quit this week after meeting with editor and publisher Jon Wolman. The review was edited after complaints by a car dealer.      Wolman says the paper should have let the online review stand as written. The original is back online.      ___      Information from: The Detroit News, http://detnews.com/ ||||| Chrysler 200: Detroit News' auto critic's original review made it into the newspaper's March 10 print edition. But some of the most critical passages, including Burgess' calling the sedan a 'dog,' were removed from the paper's online version.      The Detroit News' auto critic said Thursday that he resigned because editors demanded that he delete sections of a scathing review of the Chrysler 200, a car promoted in a popular Super Bowl television ad starring rapper Eminem.      Scott Burgess' original review made it into the newspaper's March 10 print edition. But some of the most critical passages, including Burgess' calling the sedan a \\"dog,\\" were removed from the paper's online version.      Burgess, 43, said he resigned Wednesday after meeting with the paper's news editor and publisher, Jon Wolman.      \\"It's just a matter of principle,\\" Burgess told The Associated Press.      He said he was told March 11 what to take out of the online version.      \\"I regret not standing up and saying, 'no, we can't change this.' I felt I'm just as guilty letting it happen,\\" he said. \\"I kind of felt like a deer in the headlights. I didn't know what to do.\\"      Wolman acknowledged that the newspaper changed the online version after a car dealer complained about it. But he told the AP on Thursday that the paper's editors did not try to change the negative tone of the review.      \\"Our intent was to make an editing improvement, and we obviously handled it poorly,\\" Wolman said. \\"We should have let the online version of the review stand as written, as we did in the print version.\\"      Indeed, the changed version did not heap praise on the Chrysler 200, which competes with the Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Fusion, Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, among others. Detroit still is buzzing about the Super Bowl ad that showed Eminem driving a 200 through the city's downtown. The catchy slogan: \\"Imported from Detroit.\\"      Burgess' online review did not include this passage, which was in the print version: \\"If this car came in tortoise shell, the EPA would have to put it on the endangered sedan list to prevent trappers and automotive enthusiasts from rightfully shooting it into extinction.\\"      Both versions carried these lines: \\"The Chrysler 200 makes me angry. No one is prouder of the Motor City, and I want every carmaker, foreign and domestic, to produce world-class cars and trucks. When that happens, consumers win.\\"      Rich Harshbarger, a spokesman for Detroit Media Partnership, which runs the newspaper's business operations, said it's unfortunate that Burgess resigned.      \\"This organization still stands for the truth and telling the truth,\\" Harshbarger said. ||||| Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.

Zone defenses are common in international, college, and youth competition. In the National Basketball Association, zone defenses were prohibited until the 2001--2002 season, and most teams do not use them as a primary defensive strategy. The NBA has a defensive three-second violation rule, which makes it more difficult for teams to play zone, since such defenses usually position a player in the middle of the key to stop penetration. The Dallas Mavericks under coach Rick Carlisle are an example of an NBA team that have regularly used zone defenses. Is it true that can u play zone defense in the nba?","output":"Yes, it is true that you can play zone defense in the NBA. However, it is important to consider the following steps to comply with the NBA rules: Step 1: Know the history of the rule change Understand that zone defenses were prohibited in the NBA until the 2001-2002 season. Since then, teams have been allowed to use zone defenses, but there are restrictions in place to ensure fair play in the league. Step 2: Be aware of the defensive three-second violation rule To prevent teams from fully exploiting zone defenses, the NBA has implemented a defensive three-second violation rule. This rule states that a defensive player cannot stay in the lane (paint/key area) for more than three consecutive seconds without actively guarding an opponent. Step 3: Make strategic adjustments Considering the limitations brought by the defensive three-second violation rule, NBA teams must adjust their defensive strategies when using zone defenses. They must focus on quick rotations and communication to cover the key area without violating the three-second rule. Step 4: Look for successful examples Despite its limitations, some NBA teams like the Dallas Mavericks under coach Rick Carlisle have successfully used zone defenses as part of their defensive strategy. By studying their approach, one can learn how to effectively use zone defense within the NBA rules. Step 5: Combine zone defense with other defensive strategies Teams should not solely rely on zone defense but use it as a part of their overall defensive strategy. Mixing it with other defensive schemes like man-to-man can create strategic variety and complexity, making it harder for opponents to score. In conclusion, while playing zone defense in the NBA is allowed, it comes with certain rules and restrictions. Teams must adapt and follow these rules to make the most of the zone defense within their overall defensive strategy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A couple of months ago I got a job as a bartender abroad in Brisbane. When I first started I was told by the manager that interviewed me that my hourly rate would be 25aud. However when my first paycheck arrived I realized I'd actually gotten around 20aud per hour. Keep in mind that the job I took was cash in hand (not taxed) so there was no contract or anything like that. I realize that working cash in hand makes me somewhat of an asshole in and of itself but since I'm here very short term I'm not in a position to say no to work. I went to the owner (who handles everyone's paychecks) and confronted him about it. He told me that everyone in fact gets 20aud in the beginning but when he sees that they can carry parts of the bar themselves he would raise the salary to 25aud per hour. I wasn't happy being lied to but accepted it and figured I'll just put the hours in until he bumps up the salary. Now for a while I've been able to work easily on my own, taking care of the bar without help. So I sent a message to my boss a couple of weeks back asking when the rate would go up. It was left ignored so I went to talk to him about it and he scoffs and says he's busy (he is not a very pleasant guy) . I later heard from a workmate that actually everyone gets paid 20 an hour and the owner has no intention of paying anyone 25.  I felt like I had been misled from the beginning and have started to skim some cash from the register, just enough to cover what would have been my promised 25 per hour (literally, I don't take more than that) . The method I take the money is in a way that still makes the numbers add up, it just looks like the restaurant is making slightly less profit. I feel a little bit dirty taking money all the time but at the same time I feel it's fair. I'm only working at the place for another month, before I move back home so I don't exactly have time to find another job.  So, am I the asshole here? Or am I right to steal?

How is \\"Call me as soon as you hear from him.\\" said in Czech?","output":"In Czech, the phrase \\"Call me as soon as you hear from him.\\" can be translated as \\"Zavolej mi, jakmile o něm uslyšíš.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Zavolej mi\\" (Call me) - The verb \\"zavolej\\" comes from \\"zavolat\\" (to call) and is conjugated in the second person singular imperative mood. \\"Mi\\" is a pronoun in the dative case, meaning \\"to me\\" or \\"for me,\\" to indicate that the action should be done for the benefit of the speaker. 2. \\"jakmile\\" (as soon as) - This is a conjunction that expresses a temporal dependency between two clauses and means \\"as soon as\\" or \\"the moment that\\" in English. It connects the imperative clause \\"Zavolej mi\\" with the upcoming dependent clause. 3. \\"o něm\\" (from him, about him) - This is a locative prepositional phrase, where \\"o\\" means \\"about\\" or \\"from\\" and \\"něm\\" is a pronoun that means \\"him\\" or \\"it\\" and stands for the person from whom the information is expected. The preposition \\"o\\" requires the pronoun to be in the locative case, which is why \\"něm\\" is used instead of \\"on\\" (he). 4. \\"uslyšíš\\" (you hear) - Lastly, this verb is formed from the infinitive \\"uslyšet\\" (to hear). It is conjugated in the second person singular of the present tense (you + hear). The subject of this clause is implicit because Czech often omits subject pronouns when they are clear from the verb conjugation. Putting it all together, the expression \\"Zavolej mi, jakmile o něm uslyšíš\\" closely mirrors the meaning and structure of \\"Call me as soon as you hear from him\\" in English.

Write a question about the following article: There is a large exiled Cuban-American population living in the United States, especially in and around Miami, FL and Union City, NJ. Those who oppose the communist government are represented in part by the Cuban-American lobby, which supports the U.S. embargo against Cuba and presses the communist government for political change. Other Cuban-American groups, some of which are anti-Communist, advocate different policies, opposing the embargo and favoring more cultural and economic engagement. Most prominent of these groups are the Brigada Antonio Maceo, Alianza Martiana, Miami Coalition Against the Embargo of Cuba, Alianza de Trabajadores de la Comunidad Cubana, Cuban American Defense League and Rescate Cultural AfroCubano. The Cuban government accuses Miami-based exiles of organizing over 700 armed incursions against Cuba over the past 40 years such as  machine-gun attacks on the Guitart Cayo Coco Hotel by Alpha 66 in 1994 and 1995. The Cuban government has long contended that some South Florida Spanish-language journalists are paid by the U.S. government. On September 8, 2006, it was revealed that at least ten South Florida journalists,  veteran reporters and a freelancer including some associated with the El Nuevo Herald, received payments totaling thousands of dollars over several years from the U.S. government for programs on Radio Martí and TV Martí, broadcasts aimed at undermining the Cuban state. In November 2006, U.S. Congressional auditors accused the development agency USAID of failing properly to administer its program to promote democracy in Cuba. They said that USAID had channeled tens of millions of dollars through exile groups in Miami, which were sometimes wasteful or kept questionable accounts.

The two cities had a similar population and vehicle numbers.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which city had more problems with carbon monoxide?  Hint: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. The answer is:","output":"Berg city had more problems with carbon monoxide. The paragraph provided explains that gasoline-powered vehicles emit various harmful materials, including nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. Berg city uses gas-powered vehicles, while Hill city uses electric vehicles. The formation of nitrogen oxides occurs when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons, which typically occurs in gas-powered vehicles. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere, contributing to smog formation. Although the presence of catalytic converters in vehicles' exhaust systems helps convert these harmful materials into less harmful products, it does not eliminate the emissions completely. Since Berg city relies solely on gas-powered vehicles, it would inherently have more problems with carbon monoxide in comparison to Hill city, which uses electric vehicles. Electric vehicles do not use internal combustion engines, and as a result, they do not emit harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. Instead, electric vehicles draw their power from batteries. This means that electric vehicles themselves do not contribute to air pollution and have a much smaller carbon footprint than gasoline-powered vehicles in daily use. Consequently, Hill city's choice of using electric vehicles would lead to fewer issues with carbon monoxide and other pollutants compared to Berg city."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The rallies, which draw mostly teens, are one part concert, one part Christian revival.  \\"I had to stop listening to them for a while,\\" said Hutchins, who lives in Cumming, Georgia, and plays the piano, guitar and harmonica. He said the group's world view \\"had a negative effect on me,\\" and made him irritable and angry.  \\"God owns my life, not the Beatles,\\" he said simply. Although Hutchins said he enjoys a wide range of music -- from Pink Floyd and Arcade Fire to Christian bands such as Hillsong United -- he said he has to be careful of what music he listens to, for the same reason he temporarily turned off the Beatles.  Hutchins, a 16-year-old graced with poise and thoughtfulness, is one of many teenagers who say that some part of popular culture, with its ubiquitous references to sex, drugs and violence, has harmed him.  Last year, Hutchins and his Christian youth group attended an Acquire the Fire rally in Atlanta, Georgia, he said. Acquire the Fire -- regional rallies held across the country -- and BattleCry -- the larger rallies held this year in only three cities -- are the products of the evangelical Christian organization Teen Mania. Go behind-the-scenes with CNN's Christiane Amanpour at a BattleCry event »  One part concert, one part Christian revival, the rallies seek to \\"stage a reverse revolution\\" against secular popular culture.

The 2010 Commonwealth Games were held in New Delhi, and their organization was marred by various controversies and allegations of corruption. As a result, the government appeared to be cautious and hesitant to support another major sporting event, particularly in the wake of negative public opinion and concerns about potential financial mismanagement. Furthermore, hosting large-scale sporting events typically require substantial financial investments, including the construction and renovation of sporting venues, infrastructure improvements, and ensuring adequate security measures. The allegations of corruption in the 2010 Commonwealth Games raised questions about the effective use of public funds and the government's ability to manage and oversee such a significant project. In summary, the Indian government's decision to turn down New Delhi's bid for the 2019 Asian Games was primarily driven by concerns related to allegations of corruption during the organization of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, as well as potential financial mismanagement and risk factors.

When Jack Nowell was told by Stuart Lancaster and his medical staff he risked being exposed as a one-trick pony if he didn’t undergo surgery, the young Exeter Chief hardly had a leg to stand on. Following five years of playing with pain in his left knee because of a chronic condition developed as a teenager, things got so bad that muscle started to wither and opponents began to take note. The 21-year-old has enjoyed a new lease of life following surgery which has finally enabled him to deliver a pain-free performance on two legs instead of one. Exeter full-back Jack Nowell has undergone surgery on a knee injury that had been causing him problems. England coach Stuart Lancaster had warned Nowell that he could turn into a one-trick pony without treatment. ‘I’ve had a patellar tendinitis problem since I was 15,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘It was a big problem but I just cracked on hoping it would go away. It never did. ‘Being a youngster you think no-one will notice but with the amount of analysis that goes on now it was only a matter of time before I was sussed out.

Which language is this?","output":"The text \\"Je to většinou malárie?\\" is written in Czech, a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic. It is closely related to Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian languages. Czech uses a Latin-based alphabet enriched with diacritical marks, such as the háček (ˇ) and the kroužek (°), to distinguish similar sounding letters and denote specific pronunciations. Czech grammar is characterized by a rich inflectional system, with nouns, pronouns, adjectives, numerals, and verbs demonstrating various declension and conjugation paradigms. The Czech language has three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), seven cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental), and two numbers (singular and plural). In phonetics, Czech has a relatively large number of consonants (25) and a smaller number of vowels (10), and it is known for allowing complex consonant clusters, which can occur at the beginning, middle, or end of words. Apart from vocabulary and grammar, Czech also features a pitch accent system in which the position of tone can distinguish the meaning of words. The Czech language has a long and rich history, with the earliest written records dating back to the 9th and 10th centuries in the form of Old Church Slavonic texts, such as the Kiev Missal and the Gniezno Glosses. Czech literature and culture flourished particularly during the 14th to 16th centuries, with the emergence of important works such as the \\"Chronica Boemorum\\" by Cosmas of Prague, the \\"Bible of Kralice,\\" and the works of Jan Hus and Jan Amos Comenius. Nowadays, the Czech language is an official language of the Czech Republic and the European Union.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: glimpse a tiger sleeping in an enclosure","output":"The most important words in the sentence \\"glimpse a tiger sleeping in an enclosure\\" are: 1. Glimpse: \\"Glimpse\\" is the action taking place in this sentence. It describes a brief or partial view of something, a quick look at a scene. The sighting of the tiger is seen momentarily, making this an important word to understand the scenario the sentence is portraying. 2. Tiger: \\"Tiger\\" is the main subject of the sentence and the object of the action \\"glimpse.\\" A tiger is a large cat species native to Asia and is known for its stripe pattern on its orange coat and its strong, powerful physique. In this context, it tells us what is being glimpsed, which is essential for comprehension. 3. Sleeping: \\"Sleeping\\" describes the state or condition of the tiger. It is an adjective describing the action of resting with a temporary suspension of consciousness, which helps the reader understand the situation and visualize the scene more accurately. 4. Enclosure: Lastly, \\"enclosure\\" is important because it describes the setting where the tiger is found. It provides context on where this event is taking place, suggesting that they might be in a zoo or a wildlife sanctuary, which provides safety for both the observer and the animal. These four words - glimpse, tiger, sleeping, and enclosure - are crucial in constructing the sentence's imagery, message, and meaning.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation of a blight on trees leading to fewer nesting places for owls can be considered as an indirect impact on the process described. To understand this, let's break down the process and analyze the impacts: - An owl leaves his nest: The blight on trees could potentially reduce the number of suitable nesting places, making it harder for owls to find safe, secure locations to raise their young. - The owl flys out into the night: The availability of nesting places does not directly affect the owl's ability to fly at night, but it may negatively impact the presence of a suitable nesting environment. - The owl looks down at the ground: This step is not directly or indirectly affected by the blight on trees. - The owl’s keen eyesight allows him to see in the dark: This natural ability is not impacted by the availability of nesting sites.  - The owl’s sensitive hearing allows him to locate hidden prey: Similar to the owl's eyesight, its hearing ability is not affected by the blight on trees. - The owl swoops down: This action is also not directly or indirectly impacted by the blight on trees. - The owl catches a mouse in his talons: The availability of nesting places does not directly affect the owl's ability to catch prey. Thus, the blight on trees causes a decrease in nesting places for owls which can be considered as an indirect impact on the first step of the process. The rest of the steps are not impacted by the blight. The indirect impact on the first step could mean that the owls may have to search for alternative nesting sites, potentially leading to a more time-consuming and energy-intensive process for the owl, ultimately affecting its reproductive success and population growth. However, the actual hunting and feeding process stays unaffected."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Hold the glance for a second longer and you have made a different situation, there is a permissible time that you can hold a person's stare without being friendly, rude, or aggressive. If you are on a lift, what stare-time are you permitted? To answer this question, consider what you typically do. You very likely give other passengers a quick glance to size them up and to assure them that you mean no harm. Since being close to another person signals the possibility of interaction, you need to send out a signal telling others you want to be left alone. So you cut off eye contact----what sociologist Erving Goffiman calls \\"a dimming  of the lights\\". You look down at the floor, at the indicator  lights, anywhere but into another passenger's eyes. Should you break the rule against staring at a stranger on a lift, you will make the other person extremely uncomfortable, and you are likely to feel a bit strange yourself. If you hold eye contact for more than 3 seconds, what are you telling another person? Much depends on the person and the situation. For instance, a man and a woman communicate interest in this manner. They stare at each other for about 3 seconds at a time, and then drop their eyes down for 3 seconds, before letting their eyes meet again. But if one man gives another man a 3-second-plus stare, he signals, \\"I know you\\", \\"I am interested in you\\" or \\"You look peculiar  and I am curious about you\\".

Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.  - The Straits of Florida, Florida Straits, or Florida Strait is a strait located south-southeast of the North American mainland, generally accepted to be between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, and between the Florida Keys (U.S.) and Cuba. It is 150 km (93 mi) wide at the narrowest point between Key West and the Cuban shore, and has been sounded to a depth of 6,000 feet. The strait carries the Florida Current, the beginning of the Gulf Stream, from the Gulf of Mexico.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - Small businesses are privately owned corporations, partnerships, or sole proprietorships that have fewer employees and/or less annual revenue than a regular-sized business or corporation. What businesses are defined as \\"small\\" in terms of being able to apply for government support and qualify for preferential tax policy varies depending on the country and industry. Small businesses range from fifteen employees under the Australian \\"Fair Work Act 2009\\", fifty employees according to the definition used by the European Union, and fewer than five hundred employees, to qualify for many U.S. Small Business Administration programs. While small businesses can also be classified according to other methods, such as annual revenues, shipments, sales, assets, or by annual gross or net revenue or net profits, the number of employees is one of the most widely used measures.  - The Small Business Administration (SBA) is a United States government agency that provides support to entrepreneurs and small businesses. The mission of the Small Business Administration is \\"to maintain and strengthen the nation's economy by enabling the establishment and viability of small businesses and by assisting in the economic recovery of communities after disasters\\". The agency's activities are summarized as the \\"3 Cs\\" of capital, contracts and counseling.  - A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit. Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets. Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are highly regulated in most countries. Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th-most extensive and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. At nearly , Alabama has one of the nation's longest navigable inland waterways.  - The contiguous United States consists of the 48 adjoining U.S. states plus Washington, D.C.

Which entity is this text about? Anthony McPartlin, OBE (born 18 November 1975) and Declan Donnelly, OBE (born 25 September 1975), known collectively as Ant & Dec, are an English comedy TV presenting, television producing, acting and former music duo from Newcastle upon Tyne, England. The duo met as actors on the children's television show Byker Grove, during which and in their subsequent pop career they were respectively known as PJ & Duncan - the names of the characters they played on the show. They have had a successful career as television presenters, presenting shows such as SMTV Live, CD:UK, Friends Ant & Dec got their first presenting job in 1994, while they were still releasing music under the alias of PJ & Duncan. They co-presented a Saturday-morning children's show entitled Gimme 5, which was broadcast on CITV. The show only lasted two series before being dropped from the airwaves. In 1995, the duo were once again offered a job on CBBC, this time presenting their own series, entitled The Ant & Dec Show. The series was broadcast from 1995 to 1997, and in 1996, Ant & Dec won two BAFTA Awards, one for 'Best Children's Show' and one for 'Best Sketch Comedy Show'. In 1997, a VHS release, entitled The Ant & Dec Show - Confidential, was made available in shops, and featured an hour of the best bits from three years of the programme, as well as specially recorded sketches and music videos.  In 1998, the duo switched to Channel 4, presenting an early-evening children's show entitled Ant & Dec Unzipped. This show also won a BAFTA, but was dropped from the airwaves after just one series. ITV soon signed the duo in August 1998, and within weeks, were assigned to present ITV1's Saturday morning programmes SMTV Live and CD:UK, alongside old friend Cat Deeley. The duo presented the shows alongside Deeley for three years, becoming the most popular ITV Saturday morning show. The programme's success was the mix of games such as Eat My Goal, Wonkey Donkey and Challenge Ant, sketches such as \\"Dec Says\\" and the \\"Secret of My Success\\", and the chemistry between Ant, Dec and Cat. Two SMTV VHS releases, compiling the best bits from both shows, were released in 2000 and 2001 respectively. Ant & Dec also starred in the children's TV series Engie Benjy during their time on SMTV.  Ant & Dec made their permanent departure from children's television in 2001 after trying out formats like Friends Like These for BBC One in 2000 and Slap Bang with Ant & Dec for ITV in 2001 (which was basically SMTV in the evening even playing Challenge Ant against adults). They have since said that the main reason they left SMTV was because the Pop Idol live finals were due to begin on Saturday nights on ITV in December 2001.

Article: The formula used for calculating vapor pressure given a change in the vapor pressure over time is known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation (named for physicists Rudolf Clausius and Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron). This is the formula you'll use to solve the most common sorts of vapor pressure problems you'll find in physics and chemistry classes. The formula looks like this: ln(P1/P2) = (ΔHvap/R)((1/T2) - (1/T1)). In this formula, the variables refer to:   ΔHvap: The enthalpy of vaporization of the liquid. This can usually be found in a table at the back of chemistry textbooks.  R: The real gas constant, or 8.314 J/(K × Mol).  T1: The temperature at which the vapor pressure is known (or the starting temperature.)  T2: The temperature at which the vapor pressure is to be found (or the final temperature.)  P1 and P2: The vapor pressures at the temperatures T1 and T2, respectively. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation looks tricky because it has so many different variables, but it's actually not very difficult when you have the right information. The most basic vapor pressure problems will give you two temperature values and a pressure value or two pressure values and a temperature value — once you have these, solving is a piece of cake.  For example, let's say that we're told that we have a container full of liquid at 295 K whose vapor pressure is 1 atmosphere (atm). Our question is: What is the vapor pressure at 393 K? We have two temperature values and a pressure, so we can solve for the other pressure value with the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Plugging in our variables, we get ln(1/P2) = (ΔHvap/R)((1/393) - (1/295)). Note that, for Clausius-Clapeyron equations, you must always use Kelvin temperature values. You can use any pressure values as long as they are the same for both P1 and P2. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation contains two constants: R and ΔHvap. R is always equal to 8.314 J/(K × Mol). ΔHvap (the enthalpy of vaporization), however, depends on the substance whose vapor pressure you are examining. As noted above, you can usually find the ΔHvap values for a huge variety of substances in the back of chemistry or physics textbooks, or else online (like, for instance, here.)  In our example, let's say that our liquid is pure liquid water. If we look in a table of ΔHvap values, we can find that the ΔHvap is roughly 40.65 kJ/mol. Since our H value uses joules, rather than kilojoules, we can convert this to 40,650 J/mol.  Plugging our constants in to our equation, we get ln(1/P2) = (40,650/8.314)((1/393) - (1/295)). Once you have all of your variables in the equation plugged in except for the one you are solving for, proceed to solve the equation according to the rules of ordinary algebra.  The only difficult part of solving our equation (ln(1/P2) = (40,650/8.314)((1/393) - (1/295))) is dealing with the natural log (ln). To cancel out a natural log, simply use both sides of the equation as the exponent for the mathematical constant e. In other words, ln(x) = 2 → eln(x) = e2 → x = e2.  Now, let's solve our equation: ln(1/P2) = (40,650/8.314)((1/393) - (1/295)) ln(1/P2) = (4,889.34)(-0.00084) (1/P2) = e(-4.107)  1/P2 = 0.0165 P2 = 0.0165-1 = 60.76 atm. This makes sense — in a sealed container, increasing the temperature by almost 100 degrees (to almost 20 degrees over the boiling point of water) will create lots of vapor, increasing the pressure greatly What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article explains the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which is used to calculate vapor pressure given a change in temperature.

Javier Pedro Saviola Fernandez (Spanish pronunciation: [xa'bjer 'pedro sa'bjola fer'nandes]; born 11 December 1981) is a retired Argentine professional footballer who played as a forward. Known for his speed, dribbling and ability to score from almost any attacking position on the field, he represented both Barcelona and Real Madrid and was named as the youngest player on Pele's FIFA 100 list of the 125 greatest living footballers in 2004. Due to his ancestry he also holds Spanish nationality since 2004, and he amassed La Liga totals of 196 games and 70 goals over the course of eight seasons; he started and finished his career at River Plate. An Argentine international for seven years, Saviola represented his country at the 2006 World Cup and the 2004 Copa America, where his team reached the final. On 26 June 2009, S.L. Benfica and Real Madrid agreed on a EUR5 million deal that would see Saviola play in Portugal for the next three years, with an option for one more; a EUR30 million clause was added. He scored his first goal for the club on a penalty in a friendly match against FC Sion and, on 16 July, netted twice to send his team into the Guadiana Trophy finals.  On 22 October 2009, Saviola scored two goals for Benfica, guiding them to a 5-0 victory over Everton for the UEFA Europa League (he would also score in the club's 2-0 win in Liverpool in the second match), adding another brace four days later in a 6-1 routing of C.D. Nacional for the Primeira Liga.  On 6 December 2009, Saviola scored through a chip shot against Academica de Coimbra in a 4-0 home win. On 20 December he netted the game's only goal as Benfica defeated rivals FC Porto at home; during the victorious campaign, he formed a deadly offensive partnership with Paraguayan Oscar Cardozo, with the pair combining for more than 50 goals overall.  On 3 January 2010, after receiving the Portuguese Liga Player of the Month award, Saviola scored another winning goal against Nacional, again being the game's only scorer in an away defeat of Rio Ave FC, netting in the 46th minute. He netted his 19th goal overall in a 3-1 home triumph against F.C. Pacos de Ferreira on 7 March, and Benfica were eventually crowned league champions after a five-year wait. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he receive any awards?","output":"Yes, Javier Pedro Saviola Fernandez did receive an award during his football career. As stated in the text above, he was honored with the Portuguese Liga Player of the Month award on 3rd January 2010. This award was given recognizing his performances in the Primeira Liga, the top professional football division of the Portuguese football league system, where Saviola was playing for S.L. Benfica at that time. However, it's worth noting that this individual accolade was not the only recognition he received throughout his career.  For example, earlier in his career, he was recognized by Brazilian legend Pele, when he was included as the youngest player on Pele's FIFA 100 list of the 125 greatest living footballers in 2004. This prestigious list was created by Pele as a part of the celebration of the 100th anniversary of FIFA, soccer's governing body worldwide. Moreover, Saviola's performances in 2009 for Benfica contributed heavily to the team's success. He scored crucial and winning goals in numerous matches, and formed a potent offensive partnership with Oscar Cardozo, with the pair combining for more than 50 goals in total. This greatly helped Benfica to end a five-year wait and get crowned as the league champions. So, this Argentinian forward, celebrated for his speed, dribbling skills, and scoring prowess, was indeed acknowledged for his remarkable skill and contributions to the sport. His inclusion in the FIFA 100 list, the Portuguese Liga Player of the Month award, and ultimately his role in helping Benfica win the national league championship are clear testaments to his successful career in professional football."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Samsung Shows Off Galaxy S4 Mini, Two Windows Tablets LONDON—Samsung Electronics Co. on Thursday showed off an array of new devices with wide appeal, including a cheaper version of its flagship smartphone and two new tablets, in its bid to gain more market share in the highly competitive mobile-devices market. The product launches come amid mounting concerns that sales of the company's flagship Galaxy S4 smartphone may not be as strong as estimated. Samsung's Galaxy S4 Mini phone is designed for emerging markets. Shares in Samsung, South Korea's biggest company by market capitalization, have fallen sharply over the past two weeks, wiping out more than 27 billion off its market value. The decline in its stock price is reminiscent of the fall in rival Apple Inc. shares earlier this year that was sparked by concerns over demand for its latest iPhone 5. Morgan Stanley earlier this month cut Samsung's forecast for Galaxy S4 shipments to 61 million units this year from 71 million, noting a recent decline in component orders for the phone indicates a \\"normal, not super,\\" global rollout. See a side-by-side comparison of some popular phones. Explore features and specifications of smartphones. The brokerage estimates 310 million smartphone shipments for 2013, compared with an estimated 213 million units shipped in 2012, according to Strategy Analytics. Samsung doesn't disclose sales targets for its smartphones or provide a breakdown of mobile-phone sales. On Thursday, Samsung touted the Galaxy S4 Mini, a stripped down version of its high-end flagship smartphone, in hopes it will grab more consumers especially in emerging markets. Samsung didn't disclose how much the Galaxy S4 Mini would cost or when it would be available. In May, Samsung said it had shipped more than 10 million Galaxy S4s since the smartphone hit markets in late April. The company hasn't provided sales-figure updates since then. Plus, visit the Gadget Wars stream for the latest on the cutthroat action between Apple, Amazon, Google, Nokia and others. As smartphone prices continue to decline amid stiff competition and as manufacturers roll out cheaper smartphones, some analysts said Samsung's ability to deliver a wide portfolio of products across various price points is its survival strategy. Unlike Apple, which has only one line of smartphones, Samsung has been introducing hand-held and mobile devices in various sizes. But it remains to be seen whether there will be demand for all of the Samsung products. At Thursday's event, held at a cavernous exhibition hall in London, executives rattled off statistics for a bewildering array of products—some new, some previously announced—ranging from phones and tablets to laptops and cameras. Samsung appeared to be touting phones for every niche: large ones, small ones, those with zoom lenses, another that is dust and water-resistant, even a pink phone. \\"It's an 'all things to all people' strategy, covering every possible product size and type possible to capture as many customers as possible,\\" says Mark Newman, a senior analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. While Samsung is the largest smartphone maker, it still trails Apple in tablets. Apple had a 39.6% share in tablets in the first quarter, with 19.5 million units shipped, while Samsung was No. 2 with a 17.9% share, according market-research firm IDC. Gaining market share with tablets running on Windows may be difficult as well, as Microsoft Corp.'s latest Windows 8 operating system has so far failed to make much headway. Last year, Samsung unveiled its ATIV line of Windows-based tablets but it hasn't yet received wide acceptance by consumers. On Thursday, Samsung refreshed the product line by launching a 10.1-inch device called ATIV Tab 3 that is billed as \\"the world's thinnest Windows 8 tablet\\" at 8.2 millimeters thick. It also launched a 13.3-inch tablet called ATIV Q that can run both Windows and Google Inc.'s Android software. Samsung's Mobile Chief J.K. Shin said in an interview in March that smartphones and tablets based on Microsoft's Windows operating system aren't selling very well, adding that there is a preference in the market for Android. Along with the tablets and smartphones, Samsung introduced an upgraded version of its Web-connected camera called the Galaxy NX that comes with an interchangeable lens. The company is betting on the convergence of smartphones and cameras to grab more market share in the digital-camera industry, which remains a weakness for the company.

What is the difference between judicial activism and judicial restraint?","output":"To determine whether the two questions are the same, let's analyze the meanings of the terms and compare them. Step 1: Define the terms Judicial activism: A philosophy where judges interpret the Constitution and laws broadly, often resulting in decisions that expand individual rights and liberties. Judges following this philosophy might not hesitate to strike down or alter laws they believe to be unconstitutional or unjust. Judicial overreach: When the judiciary exceeds its authority or mandate by interfering in the functions of the other branches of government, for example, by making policy decisions that should be made by the legislative branch. Judicial restraint: The opposite of judicial activism. A philosophy where judges are more cautious about overruling legislative and executive decisions. Judges following this philosophy focus on precedent and tradition, and avoid making broad constitutional interpretations. Step 2: Evaluate the two questions 1. What is the difference between judicial activism and judicial overreach? This question asks for differences between two distinct concepts: the approach of broadly interpreting the Constitution and laws and going beyond the scope of the judiciary's authority. 2. What is the difference between judicial activism and judicial restraint? This question compares two different judicial philosophies: one that encourages broad interpretation (judicial activism) and another that values staying within the limits of existing precedents and traditions (judicial restraint). Step 3: Compare the questions The two questions differ, as they compare different sets of terms. The first question asks about the difference between judicial activism and overreach, whereas the second question focuses on the distinction between activism and restraint.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"To determine the truth of the second sentence based on the first sentence, let's analyze both sentences step by step: 1. Identify the context and key elements from the first sentence: The first sentence is about a boy offering assistance to Drew, with Drew being unaware of why the boy is helping. The key elements here are the boy, Drew, and an offer of assistance. 2. Identify the context and key elements from the second sentence: The second sentence is about Drew falling off his horse due to Apache attacks. The key elements here are Drew, his horse, and the Apaches shooting at him. 3. Compare the elements and context of both sentences: The common element in both sentences is Drew. However, the context involving the boy offering assistance and Drew falling off his horse due to Apache attacks is different. 4. Determine if the truth of the second sentence depends on the first: The first sentence doesn't provide any information related to Drew falling off his horse or getting shot by Apaches. The assistance being offered by the boy might or might not be related to the situation described in the second sentence. 5.

In 1579 the northern seven provinces signed the Union of Utrecht, in which they decided to join forces against Spanish rule. The Union of Utrecht is seen as the beginning of the Dutch Republic. In 1580 the new and predominantly Protestant state abolished the bishoprics, including the archbishopric of Utrecht. The stadtholders disapproved of the independent course of the Utrecht bourgeoisie and brought the city under much more direct control of the republic; which shifted the power towards its dominant province Holland. This was the start of a long period of stagnation of trade and development in Utrecht. Utrecht remained an atypical city in the new republic with about 40% Catholic in the mid-17th century, and even more among the elite groups, who included many rural nobility and gentry with town houses there.

Possible A: purring, four paws, four legs, two eyes, whiskers  Why is \\"whiskers\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"To answer the question \\"Cats always tickle me with their?\\", we should identify the option that is most likely to cause a tickling sensation and is commonly associated with cats. Here's a step-by-step justification of why \\"whiskers\\" is the answer aligned with human common sense: 1. Analyze the options:    a. Purring: Purring is a sound cats make, not a physical feature that could cause tickling.    b. Four paws: While cats do have paws, the paws themselves are not commonly associated with causing a tickling sensation.    c. Four legs: Similar to paws, legs could in theory cause tickling, but they are not specifically associated with tickling.    d. Two eyes: Eyes are not involved in tickling, so this option can be eliminated.    e. Whiskers: Whiskers are long, thin, flexible hair-like structures on a cat's face that are sensitive to touch and could easily cause a tickling sensation. 2. Evaluate common associations: Whiskers are often associated with cats and commonly come into contact with humans when a cat approaches them, rubs against them, or snuggles close to their face. This interaction can lead to a tickling sensation due to the soft and sensitive nature of the whiskers. 3. Choose the best option: Based on the analysis of the options and the associations with tickling, \\"whiskers\\" is the most appropriate answer aligned with human common sense, as it is a physical feature unique to cats that can easily cause a tickling sensation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the background: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony.  and the situation: Ants are one of the most interesting creatures on earth. David wants to study ants for his biology project. He is specifically interested in ant species Acromyrmex heyeri. This semester he studied this ant in Americas.

In the third  day of his study the air humidity was high. But in the fourth day of his study air humidity dropped. David wants to continue his study of this same ant species in Asia next semester.  Answer the following question: Which day David would see more openings in the nest thatch, first day or second day?","output":"David would see more openings in the nest thatch on the second day when the temperature rose to 25 degrees Centigrade. As mentioned in the background information, Acromyrmex heyeri workers create more openings in the nest thatch when the internal nest temperature goes up to regulate the temperature for the colony, which occurs in the temperature range of 20-30°C. Since the temperature on the first day was only 10 degrees Centigrade, it is below the range where workers would actively modify the nest thatch for temperature regulation. Therefore, the second day with a temperature of 25°C would lead to more openings in the nest thatch compared to the first day."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: Determine the weightage of 11th and 12th in NEET After examining the NEET syllabus and the exam pattern, I found that the weightage of topics from 11th and 12th standard varies. The NEET exam comprises Physics, Chemistry, and Biology (Botany + Zoology) subjects. The syllabus includes topics from both the 11th and 12th standards, thus covering important concepts from both grades. Step 3: Investigate whether 12th board marks are counted in NEET Upon further research, I found that the 12th board marks are not directly considered when calculating the NEET score. The NEET exam has its own marking scheme, and the students' performance in the test determines their ranking. However, 12th standard marks are important for eligibility criteria, as students must secure a minimum percentage in their boards to be eligible for the NEET exam. In conclusion, the first question asks about the weightage of 11th and 12th standard topics in the NEET exam, while the second question asks whether the students' 12th standard board marks are directly considered in the NEET score.

Doctors suggest that thousands of patients could benefit from taking the pill earlier in their treatment journey, potentially leading to improved outcomes and longer survival rates. However, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), the body responsible for rationing the UK's healthcare budget, has decided against approving the use of Aberiterone on the NHS. The high cost of the drug is a major factor influencing this decision. Conclusion: As a result of Nice's refusal to approve Aberiterone for use on the NHS, thousands of individuals like Kevin Hughes may be denied the chance to access this life-extending treatment. The decision highlights the ongoing struggle to balance the need for effective cancer treatments with the financial limitations of national healthcare systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What is the name of the person that created the Oviri ceramic?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Gauguin was foremost a painter; he came to ceramics around 1886, when he was taught by the French sculptor and ceramist Ernest Chaplet. They had been introduced by Félix Bracquemond who, inspired by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at Vaugirard, where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles. Gauguin first visited Tahiti in 1891 and, attracted by the beauty of Tahitian women, undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived. He completed Oviri in the winter of 1894, during his return from Tahiti, and submitted it to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts 1895 salon opening in April the following year. There are two versions of what ensued: Charles Morice claimed in 1920 that Gauguin was \\"literally expelled\\" from the exhibition; in 1937 Ambroise Vollard wrote that the piece was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw his own works in protest. According to Bengt Danielsson, Gauguin was keen to increase his public exposure and availed of this opportunity by writing an outraged letter to Le Soir, bemoaning the state of modern ceramics.At the outset of 1897, Vollard addressed a letter to Gauguin about the possibility of casting his sculptures in bronze. Gauguin's response centred on Oviri: I believe that my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse (\\"The Murderess\\"), is an exceptional piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina). In this way the buyer would not only have the ceramic piece itself, but also a bronze edition with which to make money. Art historian Christopher Gray mentions three...

Article: As soon as you meet, or even see, a person, you form an impression of him based on his posture, gesture and facial expressions. This is why it is important to make a good first impression on the person who will be interviewing you. Within the first 60 seconds of meeting you, the interviewer will have formed an impression about what type of person you are and what kind of employee you would become, and 55% of this will be based only on your body language. Here are some tips to make you that impression a good one. First of all, relax. Think positive thoughts and you are more likely to come across as a positive, confident person during the interview. Dress smartly, as your appearance is one of the first things an interviewer will notice you. Stand up straight, and walk in with your shoulders back and your head up. Try to avoid slowing down as you walk into the room because this suggests fear and uncertainty. Shake hands with the interviewer firmly. You should have a positive handshake and a warm smile. Open your coat or jacket as you sit down shows that you, too, are open. Posture is important. You should be sitting well back in your seat. Sit up straight and lean forward slightly, but not too much. Sitting at too much of an angel expresses discomfort and distrust. Two of the most common   signals are crossing your arms and legs, so try to avoid them. Another important issue is eye contact. Looking someone in the eye shows confidence in yourself and trust in the other person. However, don't overdo it, as too much eye contact or starring will make the other person uncomfortable. Use more eye contact when listening than when talking, and when you look away, look down. Looking up at the ceiling will make you seem bored and rude.

Question: what do mucous membranes secrete? Would \\"The secreted mucus traps the pathogens in the body, preventing any further activities of diseases.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"Yes, your answer is correct but it could be expanded upon for clarity. Mucous membranes, which line various cavities in the body and surround internal organs, do secrete mucus. This mucus contains enzymes and antibodies that help protect the body from the onslaught of pathogens like bacteria and viruses. One of the vital functions of the mucus is to trap these pathogens, which then prevents them from penetrating further into your body and potentially causing infections or diseases. The sentence \\"The secreted mucus traps the pathogens in the body, preventing any further activities of diseases\\" gives a general idea of the protective role that the trapped pathogens in the mucus can play, however, the precise function of trapping pathogens is to prevent them from entering deeper tissue layers, in addition to preventing \\"further activities of diseases\\". Thus, an elaborated answer with the given context could be \\"The mucus secreted by mucous membranes plays a protective role by trapping pathogens, preventing them from penetrating deeper into the body tissue and mitigating the potential for further disease activity.\\" This would render the answer more accurate in terms of the specific function of mucus in the body's immunity system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but  Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by  Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with  Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000,  Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to  Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri instructions to execute the attack on the next U.S.warship that entered the port of Aden.  Question: \\"Why did the team avert from attacking an oil tanker and attempt to attack a warship?\\" Answer: \\"The team was convinced by  Bin Laden to attack warship instead of an oil tanker\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Yes, the answer is correct.

The conniving State Attorney General Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) wants to force Rock Ridge's residents to abandon their town, thereby lowering land prices. After he sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky assistant Taggart (Slim Pickens), to shoot the sheriff and harass the townspeople, the townspeople demand that Governor William J.

With his quick wits and the assistance of recovering alcoholic gunslinger Jim, the Waco Kid (Gene Wilder), Bart works to overcome the townspeople's hostile reception.

To test how much dreams can help learning, Robert Stickgold had some students play a shape-fitting game called Tetris   for a few hours and then go to sleep. Soon they were dreaming of falling Tetris shapes. Interestingly, the worst Tetris players had the most Tetris dreams and improved their game the most. Similar tests have shown the same results for all kinds of skills. As we dream, many important tasks are getting done. The brain decides what to keep and what to forget. It is connecting new experiences to older learning. In fact, the brain is learning all night long. Another important task of dreams may be to help us deal with emotions . At night, emotions are in the driver's seat. People who have had an upsetting experience often dream about it afterward. Often the dream event changes somehow--another way the brain tries to make the memory less upset. So if your best friend moves away, you might dream that you're the one who's moving.

The three states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. A physical change involves the conversion of a substance from one state of matter to another, without changing its chemical composition. Most matter consists of mixtures of pure substances, which can behomogeneous (uniform in composition) or heterogeneous (different regions possess different compositions and properties). Pure substances can be either chemical compounds or elements. Compounds can be broken down into elements by chemical reactions, but elements cannot be separated into simpler substances by chemical means. The properties of substances can be classified as either physical or chemical. Scientists can observe physical properties without changing the composition of the substance, whereas chemical propertiesdescribe the tendency of a substance to undergo chemical changes (chemical reactions) that change its chemical composition. Physical properties can be intensive or extensive. Intensive properties are the same for all samples; do not depend on sample size; and include, for example, color, physical state, and melting and boiling points. Extensive properties depend on the amount of material and include mass and volume. The ratio of two extensive properties, mass and volume, is an important intensive property called density.

Article: By 2050, half of the world's population will live in the tropics--the  ly warm belt that circles the globe--according to State of the Tropics, a report released today. Rapid population growth, along with economic growth, means that the region's influence will grow in coming decades, the authors of the 500-page work predict. The project, first launched in 2011, aimed to answer one significant question: Is life in the tropics improving? To find out, the researchers analyzed environmental, social, and economic indicators collected over 6 decades. It finds that the region has made \\"extraordinary progress\\" in many areas. For example, more people have access to safe drinking water, and the number of protected areas is increasing. The tropics also have outperformed the rest of the world in economic growth over the past 30 years. However, some challenges remain. Investment in research and development, for example, has increased cautiously, but tropical nations still invest less than the rest of the world. \\"As a proportion of GDP the Rest of the World invests almost four times as much in research and development than the Tropics.\\" concludes the report. The report also includes a new analysis of how climate change will affect the region. Many plant and animal species are moving poleward in an attempt to stay within their preferred environmental conditions in the tropics, the authors write. However, some organisms may not be able to keep pace with the changing conditions, they predict. As a result, they can experience population declines or go extinct. In addition, an expanded tropical zone also threatens health and safety issues, the authors warn. As regions become more suitable to insects such as mosquitoes and ticks, the spread of insect-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, and Lyme disease could rise, causing a burden to human health and the economy.  Bruna, a researcher, says he sees a lot to be concerned about in the report. \\"While we've made incredible advances in some areas, I think the risks for the tropics...

We know that the traffic jam happens in many places, especially in big cities. What are reasons for the problem? On one hand, some people think that they should have a car when they have enough money, and then it's easy to go out and they can feel comfortable. On the other hand, a growing number of people hope to use their cars to show off  . What's more, years of research has shown that one of other reasons for the traffic jam is the driving habit. For example, many young people enjoy driving very fast, so they can feel excited. At last, most of them hardly care about the speed rules. Many governments are working at how to make the traffic better. In my opinion, firstly, the governments should educate those people who have cars or plan to buy cars. The governments must make them know that the traffic jam is very serious, and set up a much more perfect traffic system to solve the traffic pressure.

Both of these stories take place in modern-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.THE FACTS IN THE CASE OF MR. VALDEMARJessica Valdemar (Adrienne Barbeau), an attractive 40-year-old woman, rides in a taxi to the downtown Pittsburgh office of Steven Pike (E.G. Marshall), her husband's lawyer with some paperwork for Mr. Pike approval. Pike sees that Jessica's elderly 63-year-old husband, who is dying from an unnamed terminal illness, is liquidating a number of his assets for cash and suspects Jessica of having undue influence on him. Jessica denies the allegations that shes any negative influence over her husband, while Pike makes a phone call to the house to talk with Ernest Valdemar (Bingo O'Malley), who speaks over the phone in a weak but coherent voice explaining about his decision to let Jessica take control of his money and assets from his personal signature on the written documents. Pike reluctantly agrees to let Jessica have access to the money, but warns her that if anything were to happen to Mr. Valdemar within the next three weeks before the transfer of his estate over to Jessica is finalized, she will be investigated by the authorities.Jessica returns home to Ernest Valdemar's large suburban mansion where she meets with Dr. Robert Hoffman (Ramy Zada) where it's revealed that he and Jessica have been conspiring to cheat the terminally ill Mr. Valdemar out of his estate by hypnotizing him and having him do what they wish from his deathbed. Jessica doesnt like the procedure, but Robert wants it done because he used to have a romance with Jessica and wants to run off with her after they acquire his 3 million assets.

Answer:","output":"The most eastern point in the United States is West Quoddy Head, which is located in the state of Maine. West Quoddy Head extends into the Atlantic Ocean in the town of Lubec, which is part of Washington County. This location is well-known for its striking geographical features, such as rugged cliffs and crashing waves. These magnificent views draw many tourists and adventure-seekers to the area. West Quoddy Head is at a latitude of 44°48′45.3″ North and a longitude of 66°56′59.1″ West. This location makes it the easternmost point of land in the contiguous 48 states of the U.S., and it is known as the place where the sun first rises in the country. However, it is important to note that West Quoddy Head is not the easternmost point of the entire United States—that distinction goes to Point Udall in the U.S. Virgin Islands. One of the most notable landmarks at West Quoddy Head is the historic West Quoddy Head Light. This iconic lighthouse has been guiding mariners along the treacherous coastline of Maine since its construction in 1808. The current structure, which replaced an earlier wooden tower, was built in 1858 and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1980. Featuring a distinctive red-and-white striped design, the lighthouse remains a functioning navigational aid and a popular tourist attraction. Around the lighthouse, there is the West Quoddy Head State Park, which offers several hiking trails and breathtaking views of the surrounding area. Visitors can admire the rocky shoreline, look out across the waters to the Canadian coastline, or observe the diverse plant and animal life that call the park home. The park is also part of the Eastern Maine Coastal Current, which offers unique whale-watching opportunities in the summer months. In addition to its natural beauty, West Quoddy Head is adjacent to the border between the United States and Canada—specifically, it neighbors the Canadian province of New Brunswick. The close proximity between these two countries has led to a rich history of trade, fishing, and cultural exchange in the area, which continues to this day. In conclusion, West Quoddy Head in Maine is the easternmost point in the contiguous United States and offers breathtaking vistas, a historic lighthouse, and opportunities for outdoor activities. Considered one of the most stunning locations in the country, West Quoddy Head is an unforgettable destination that delights nature lovers, history buffs, and explorers alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Ministry of Justice said most were \\"relatively minor\\". Thameside Prison in London recorded the most fires last year - 101. The Ministry of Justice figures emerged after a Commons question from Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron. HMP Birmingham, the scene of a riot involving hundreds of inmates last December, recorded 82 fires, followed by Nottingham's 78, Doncaster's 75 and 73 in Sheppey and Swaleside. Ten prisons recorded one fire incident during the year, including Thorn Cross in Cheshire, Huntercombe in Oxfordshire and Full Sutton in Yorkshire. There was a spate of outbreaks of disorder in prisons in 2016, when inmates set fire to their own cells. In HMP Featherstone in the West Midlands, where there were 13 recorded fires in 2016, prisoners started multiple fires during a week-long outbreak of disorder last August. And in November, a fire outbreak during a riot at HMP Moorland in Doncaster left cells damaged and two inmates injured. The following January a prisoner at HMP Winchester in Hampshire needed medical treatment after a fire broke out in a prison cell. The prison recorded 47 fires last year. Fire outbreaks have started to become more common over the past two years. The number of prison fires between 2005 and 2013 remained steady at between 900 and 1,100 each year.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who questioned Kündinger about a music career for his son?  Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in present-day Udmurtia, formerly the Imperial Russian province of Vyatka. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant. Tchaikovsky remained there for the rest of his three-year civil service career.In 1861, Tchaikovsky... The answer is:","output":"Ilya.

Since September, one person has left more than 54,000 worth of gratuity at restaurants around the country—crazy tips, like 1,000 on a 152 tab. Who is this good Samaritan? All we know is that he or she goes by tipsforjesus on Instagram.      A few photos show people posing with their receipts.      The tipster, who resides somewhere in in Southern California, is serious about making sure the tips get to the right person.      About a week ago, a waiter from a restaurant in Notre Dame commented on a photo, claiming tipsforjesus’s 10,000 tip never went through.      “Notre Dame is stiffing you?” tipsforjesus wrote. “Hmmm, let me make sure the charges went through since they claim they did not. If they're lying to you, I can talk to AMEX about it, then you should get a lawyer, and call the local paper and ESPN.

Their exploits are detailed on the TipsForJesus Instagram account, including many photos of the lucky servers posing with their signed receipts. Tips include several in Ann Arbor, Michigan (3,000 at Tio's Mexican Cafe, 2,000 at the Alley Bar), a few in Chicago (3,000 at the Boundary, 5,000 at Paris Club), and a whole bunch in Los Angles (1,000 at Fig & Olive, 10,000 at the Hungry Cat, 500 at Jumbo's Clown Room). TipsForJesus is also taking credit for a spree of big tips left at Ogden, Utah area restaurants back in August, although those receipts were not labeled TipsForJesus.      It's unclear who is behind these tips, which the Daily Dot says amount to \\"more than 54,000\\" so far. It does seem to be possibly more than one person: the Instagram account uses the word \\"we\\" often, and before they recently switched to a TipsForJesus stamp for the receipts, the username was scrawled in more than one handwriting. TipsForJesus seems to be a college football fan, occasionally lining up with various football games (at Michigan and Notre Dame). A few also bear USC's slogan of \\"Fight On.\\"      That last trip actually proved somewhat controversial, as the server at a Notre Dame-area bar commented on the Instagram that she did not receive her tip payment.

One day she dresses up, asking the wife of her landlord to shine her high heeled shoes, and wanders through town. She arrives at the house of a farmer, The Man (George O'Brien) and his Wife (Janet Gaynor). The Man is about to sit down to dinner with his wife and notices the woman waiting for him. He seems guilty and nervous but he waves the City Woman to an area beyond the house, changes his coat, and leaves his house. His wife comes out from the kitchen, carrying dinner, and sadly notices that her husband has left. Two townswomen discuss how the young married couple used to be as happy as children. A flashback shows a happy farmer, wife, and child. The two old townswomen discuss how things have changed since the city woman arrived. They discuss how money lenders are stripping the farm while the wife sits alone. Another flashback shows two men leading a cow away as the Man watches. The wife leaves the empty dinner table to cry on her childs pillow. The farmer walks under the moon. He travels deeper into wooded brush, crossing fences and shadows, to meet the Woman from the City. She waits under the moon, fixing her makeup. They meet and kiss. The wife cries alone with her child as the Man embraces the Woman from the City.

As the story unfolds, the Man is tempted by the Woman from the City (Margaret Livingston) to kill his wife and run away with her to the city. However, while following through with the plan, the Man realizes he cannot go through with it and confesses to his wife what happened. His wife, frightened and upset, runs away from him and boards a trolley heading for the city. The Man follows his wife to the city, and they initially find themselves overwhelmed and lost in the city life. Over time, they rediscover their love for each other while spending time together and enjoying various city activities, eventually reconciling and starting to rebuild their relationship. As they continue to connect, they find themselves in front of a church, where a wedding ceremony is taking place. They enter the church and watch the ceremony, reflecting on their own vows and the deep love they have for each other. This serves as a reaffirmation of their commitment to each other and symbolizes their desire to start anew after the emotional turmoil they've experienced.

Review: \\"Shinobi\\" is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story. Unfortunately, for the audience to actually care about the people dying, you have to develop the characters, otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence. The problem is especially compounded when you have TONS of characters, all of whom die. OK, so if you can't be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way, you can at least make the REASONS for why they die plausible, right? Nope. Here we have a war between two ninja clans, with neither side really knowing WHY they are fighting each other. They kill each other because the emperor says so. Yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants ALL of them dead, they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions. That's not stubbornness... that's just plain dumb. Fine, fine! There is no character development, and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting. At least they die fighting in cool action scenes, right? Yet again, NO! In fact, many of the fights aren't even fights at all: super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly (and lamely, in my opinion). I'm talking about things like, \\"Lalala, I'm walking along and I- *neck gets slashed*.\\" THE END for that character.

When I was entering my Sophomore year in High School, we had just moved from a single 4-way stop-sign town, to a bigger city with actual city buses! In order to get to school, I had to ride a city bus for the 1st time, without information/assistance! I barely managed to squeeze in and had to stand on the step of the packed bus on the way to school. BTW, smoking was STILL happening on these buses! I noticed every time we went around a corner, it seemed a bell would ring. I falsely assumed it meant HANG ON! So, when it was time to return home, the bus was not as crowded, and I actually was able to sit down. Again, every time we turned the corner, a bell would ring. So I held on tight! As we neared my bus stop to get off, the bus whizzed past it, without stopping! Panic began to set in quickly. I already had a very strange, long day in a new 3 story school building, and I smelled like cigarette smoke! I quickly moved to the empty seat behind the driver, and told him he didn’t stop where I needed to get off. He asked me if I rang the bell. I admitted to him, I had no knowledge of riding on a city bus. He was kind, explained to pull the bell pull 1 block prior to my stop. He explained he would circle back around and I could get off at my stop on the return trip. I was SO relieved! However, now I was 1/2 hour late getting home, especially stressed and tired from the new school and bus fiasco, AND I smelled like cigarette smoke! When I walked into my house, I was immediately confronted on why was I late, why did I smell like smoke, etc.! I burst into tears, and had to tell about my horrible day, but I didn’t get into trouble! WHEW! According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Seamus didn't waste any time and quickly got up to search for his own meal.  By that time, the rest of the guests had joined them. The room was filled with a mix of amicable banter and the clanking of cutlery against plates. Delightful aromas wafted in the air as the spread for the evening meal was revealed—one of Mrs. Elf's culinary masterpieces, no doubt. Paddy joined Seamus and helped him to navigate through the smorgasbord of dishes in front of them. Delectable delights like roasted root vegetables glazed with honey, steaming pot pies filled with tender meats, and pies topped with whipped cream piled high on the table. Seamus beamed with anticipation as he filled his plate with an assortment of these mouthwatering dishes. He made his way back to his chair eagerly, giving Mody a playful wink as he passed by. He then proceeded to take a hearty bite from his plate. \\"Ah, yes! Now that's more like it! This is definitely the meal for a weary traveler like myself,\\" Seamus proclaimed with a chuckle. The company shared a good laugh around the table, and the hearty meal was followed by captivating stories from each of the guests. From tales of adventure and bravery to emotional accounts of loss and renewal, the stories flowed like fine wine, leaving a warm and inspiring feeling in their listeners' hearts. As the night deepened, it seemed as though the fire in the hearth infused every room with its golden glow, casting playful flickers of light on the walls as the shadows shrank away. Seamus could feel the weariness of his journey finally catching up to him. He realized that this simple gathering, filled with laughter, warmth, and contentment, was what he needed most after his travels. Mr. Elf, noticing the drowsiness that had spread over Seamus, suggested that perhaps it was time for everyone to retire to their rooms for a nightcap and some rest. \\"There's a guest room just down the hall,\\" he said in a fatherly tone, \\"I've prepared it for you, my friend.\\" \\"Thank you, Mr. Elf,\\" Seamus replied, his voice thick with gratitude and fatigue. \\"For the hospitality, the wonderful meal, and the chance to share with and meet such great company.\\" With heartfelt goodnights exchanged all around, Seamus sluggishly made his way down the hall to the guest room Mr. Elf had prepared. As he entered the warm, cozy sanctuary, the fatigue from his journey washed over him like a tidal wave. His eyes fluttered shut, and he sank into the soft embrace of the plush mattress. That night, Seamus dreamt of all the memories he had shared with his newfound friends at the table. He knew a new adventure awaited him when he awoke but, for now, his heart was full of gratitude, and his spirit was rekindled. And as the night continued on, everyone in Mr. Elf's house slept peacefully, knowing the magic of friendship and togetherness that bound them all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While on tour in the United-States, the group continued to record new material and released a new song, \\"Goodbye\\", before Christmas in 1998. The song was seen as a tribute to Geri Halliwell, and when it topped the UK Singles Chart it became their third consecutive Christmas number-one - equalling the record previously set by the Beatles. Later in 1998, Bunton and Chisholm appeared at the 1998 MTV Europe Music Awards without their other band members, and the group won two awards: \\"Best Pop Act\\" and \\"Best Group\\" for a second time. In late 1998, Brown and Adams announced they were both pregnant; Brown was married to dancer Jimmy Gulzer and became known as Mel G for a brief period. She gave birth to daughter Phoenix Chi in February 1999. One month later, Adams gave birth to son Brooklyn, whose father was then Manchester United footballer David Beckham. Later that year, she married Beckham in a highly publicised wedding in Ireland.  The Spice Girls returned to the studio in August 1999, after an eight-month recording break to start work on their third and last studio album. The album's sound was initially more pop-influenced, similar to their first two albums, and included production from Eliot Kennedy. The album's sound took a mature direction when American producers like Rodney Jerkins, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis came on to collaborate with the group. In December 1999 they performed live for a UK-only tour, Christmas in Spiceworld, in London and Manchester, also showcasing new songs from the third album. During 1999, the group recorded the character Amneris' song \\"My Strongest Suit\\" in Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida, a concept album which would later go on to fuel the musical version of Verdi's Aida. The band performed again at the 2000 Brit Awards, where they received a Lifetime Achievement Award. Despite being at the event, Halliwell did not join her former bandmates on stage. In November 2000, the group released Forever. Sporting a new edgier R&B sound, the album received a lukewarm response from critics.  In the US, the album peaked at number thirty-nine on the Billboard 200 albums chart. In the UK, the album was released the same week as Westlife's Coast to Coast album and the chart battle was widely reported by the media, where Westlife won the battle reaching number one in the UK, leaving the Spice Girls at number two. The lead single from Forever, the double A-side \\"Holler\\"/\\"Let Love Lead the Way\\", became the group's ninth number one single in the UK. However the song failed to break onto the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart stateside, instead peaking at number seven on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. \\"Holler\\" did peak at number thirty-one on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 2000. The only major performance of the lead single came at the MTV Europe Music Awards on 16 November 2000. In total, Forever achieved only a fraction of the success of its two best-selling predecessors, selling five million copies. In December 2000, the group unofficially announced that they were beginning an indefinite hiatus and would be concentrating on their solo careers in regards to their foreseeable future, although they pointed out that the group was not splitting.  The phrase \\"girl power\\" put a name to a social phenomenon, but the slogan was met with mixed reactions. The phrase was a label for the particular facet of post classical neo-feminist empowerment embraced by the band: that a sensual, feminine appearance and equality between the sexes need not be mutually exclusive. This concept was by no means original in the pop world: both Madonna and Bananarama had employed similar outlooks. The phrase itself had also appeared in a few songs by British girl groups and bands since at least 1987; most notably, it was the name of British pop duo Shampoo's 1996 single and album, later credited by Halliwell as the inspiration for the Spice Girls' mantra.  However, it was not until the emergence of the Spice Girls in 1996 with \\"Wannabe\\", that the concept of \\"girl power\\" exploded onto the common consciousness. The phrase was regularly uttered by all five members--although most closely associated with Halliwell--and was often delivered with a peace sign. The slogan also featured on official Spice Girls merchandise and on some of the outfits the group members wore. The Spice Girls' version was distinctive. Its message of empowerment appealed to young girls, adolescents and adult women, and it emphasised the importance of strong and loyal friendship among females.  In all, the focused, consistent presentation of \\"girl power\\" formed the centrepiece of their appeal as a band. Some commentators credit the Spice Girls with reinvigorating mainstream feminism--popularized as \\"girl power\\"--in the 1990s, with their mantra serving as a gateway to feminism for their young fans. On the other hand, some critics dismissed it as no more than a shallow marketing tactic, while others took issue with the emphasis on physical appearance, concerned about the potential impact on self-conscious and/or impressionable youngsters. Regardless, the phrase became a cultural phenomenon, adopted as the mantra for millions of girls and even making it into the Oxford English Dictionary. In summation of the concept, author Ryan Dawson said, \\"The Spice Girls changed British culture enough for Girl Power to now seem completely unremarkable.\\"  The Spice Girls' debut single \\"Wannabe\\" has been hailed as an \\"iconic girl power anthem\\". In 2016, the United Nations' Global Goals \\"#WhatIReallyReallyWant\\" campaign filmed a global remake of the original music video for \\"Wannabe\\" to highlight gender inequality issues faced by women across the world. The video, which was launched on YouTube and ran in movie theatres internationally, featured British girl group M.O, Canadian \\"viral sensation\\" Taylor Hatala, Nigerian-British singer Seyi Shay and Bollywood actress Jacqueline Fernandez lip-syncing to the song in various locations around the world. In response to the remake, Beckham said, \\"How fabulous is it that after 20 years the legacy of the Spice Girls' girl power is being used to encourage and empower a whole new generation?\\"  At the 43rd People's Choice Awards in January 2017, American actress Blake Lively dedicated her \\"Favorite Dramatic Movie Actress\\" award to \\"girl power\\" in her acceptance speech, and credited the Spice Girls, saying: \\"What was so neat about them was that they're all so distinctly different, and they were women, and they owned who they were, and that was my first introduction into girl power.\\"  At the height of \\"Spice mania\\", the group were involved in a prolific marketing phenomenon. They advertised for an unprecedented number of brands, becoming the most merchandised group in music history, and were a frequent feature of the global press.  According to Rolling Stone's David Sinclair, \\"So great was the daily bombardment of Spice images and Spice product that it quickly became oppressive even to people who were well disposed towards the group.\\" This was even parodied in the video for their song \\"Spice Up Your Life\\", which depicts the group going around a futuristic dystopian city in a space ship surrounded by billboards and adverts featuring them. Throughout the American leg of their 1998 Spiceworld world tour, commercials were played on large concert screens before the shows and during intermissions. It was the first time advertising had been used in pop concerts and was met with mixed reactions in the music industry. Nevertheless, it opened up a whole new concert revenue stream, with music industry pundits predicting more acts would follow the Spice Girls' lead.  In his analysis of the group's influence on 21st century popular culture two decades after their debut, John Mckie of the BBC noted that while other stars had used brand endorsements in the past, \\"the Spice brand was the first to propel the success of the band\\". The Guardian's Sylvia Patterson also wrote of what she called the Spice Girls' true legacy: \\"[T]hey were the original pioneers of the band as brand, of pop as a ruthless marketing ruse, of the merchandising and sponsorship deals that have dominated commercial pop ever since.\\"  The mainstream media embraced the Spice Girls at the peak of their success. The group received regular international press coverage and were constantly followed by paparazzi. Paul Gorman of Music Week said of the media interest in the Spice Girls in the late 1990s: \\"They inaugurated the era of cheesy celebrity obsession which pertains today. There is lineage from them to the Kardashianisation not only of the music industry, but the wider culture.\\" The Irish Independent's Tanya Sweeney agreed that \\"[t]he vapidity of paparazzi culture could probably be traced back to the Spice Girls' naked ambitions\\", while Mckie predicted that, \\"[f]or all that modern stars from Katy Perry to Lionel Messi exploit brand endorsements and attract tabloid coverage, the scale of the Spice Girls' breakthrough in 1996 is unlikely to be repeated--at least not by a music act.\\" Answer this question \\"Did they continue to be involved in the band?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Yes, they continued to be involved in the band.

He has previously served in multiple non-consecutive terms and in various other political capacities. In the passage, Putin is considering whether to declare his candidacy for re-election in the upcoming March elections, indicating his current role as the President. Vladimir Putin has been a significant figure in Russian politics since the late 1990s. His first term as president began in 2000, succeeding Boris Yeltsin, who had resigned in 1999. Putin was re-elected in 2004 for a second term, serving until 2008. At that time, the Russian constitution did not allow him to serve three consecutive terms, so he became the Prime Minister between 2008 to 2012 while Dmitry Medvedev held the office of the President. After the presidential term limits were extended to six years, Putin was elected president again in 2012 and re-elected in 2018. Throughout his leadership, Putin has made significant efforts in consolidating power, strengthening the economy, and asserting Russia's influence on the international stage. His policies and actions, such as the annexation of Crimea, military interventions in Ukraine and Syria, and alleged meddling in foreign elections, have often been met with both criticism and admiration, making him a controversial and polarizing figure in world politics. In conclusion, based on the information provided and his extensive history in Russian politics and government, we can confidently establish that Vladimir Putin is indeed the President of Russia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It has been generally described as avant-pop, indie pop, art pop, indie electronic, indie rock, post-rock, experimental rock, and experimental pop.The band have played on vintage electronic keyboards and synthesizers from brands such as Farfisa and Vox and Moog. Gane has praised the instruments for their versatility: \\"We use the older effects because they're more direct, more extreme, and they're more like plasticine: you can shape them into loads of things.\\" The 1994 album Mars Audiac Quintet prominently features Moog synthesizers. Lætitia Sadier's English and French vocals was a part of Stereolab's music since the beginning; and would occasionally sing wordlessly along with the music.  In reference to her laid-back delivery, Peter Shapiro wrote facetiously in Wire that Sadier \\"display[ed] all the emotional histrionics of Nico\\", while some critics have commented that her vocals were unintelligible. Sadier would often trade vocals with Mary Hansen back-and-forth in a sing-song manner that has been described as \\"eerie\\" and \\"hypnotic\\", as well as \\"sweet [and] slightly alien\\". After Hansen's death in 2002, critic Jim Harrington commented that her absence is noticeable on live performances of Stereolab's older tracks, and that their newer songs could have benefited from Hansen's backing vocals.In interviews, Gane and Sadier have discussed their musical philosophy.

Did both the Airedale Terrier and Cão Fila de São Miguel originate from England? A:","output":"To answer this complex question, we need to examine the origin and history of both the Airedale Terrier and the Cão Fila de São Miguel.  1. Airedale Terrier:  The Airedale Terrier, often referred to as the \\"King of Terriers,\\" originated in England, more specifically in the Aire Valley region of Yorkshire. The breed was developed in the 19th century by working-class people who wanted a versatile, intelligent, and hardworking dog. The Airedale Terrier is a result of crossbreeding various terriers, such as the Old English Black and Tan Terrier, now extinct, with the Otterhound, which led to a dog that was skilled in hunting, guarding, and retrieving across land and water. In the beginning, it was called Waterside and Bingley Terrier, but its name changed to Airedale Terrier after the valley of the River Aire. Over the years, the Airedale Terrier has been used for various purposes, from hunting game to military and police work. The breed gained popularity in the early 20th century, both in England and the United States, mostly for its loyalty, courage, and versatility. 2. Cão Fila de São Miguel: The Cão Fila de São Miguel, also known as the Azores Cattle Dog or the São Miguel Cattle Dog, originated in the Azores, an archipelago belonging to Portugal. It is believed that the breed has been present on the island of São Miguel for over 500 years. The origins of the Cão Fila de São Miguel remain uncertain, but several theories suggest that the breed likely descends from dogs brought to the Azores by the early settlers, mainly from Portugal and Spain. These dogs would have been large, powerful, and skilled in cattle herding. Bloodlines of breeds such as the English Mastiff, the Portuguese Rafeiro do Alentejo, and the Spanish Perro de Toro could have contributed to the development of the Cão Fila de São Miguel. Used primarily as a cattle-herding dog, the Cão Fila de São Miguel has a natural guarding instinct and is known for its loyalty and protectiveness towards its owners. Over time, this breed has maintained a low profile and is not well-known outside the Azores. However, the Cão Fila de São Miguel has started gaining recognition, and efforts are being made to promote and protect this rare breed. In conclusion, the Airedale Terrier did, in fact, originate in England, while the Cão Fila de São Miguel hails from the island of São Miguel in the Azores archipelago owned by Portugal. Thus, both breeds did not originate from England.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Genocide has become an official term used in international relations. The word genocide was not in use before 1944. Before this, in 1941, Winston Churchill described the mass killing of Russian prisoners of war and civilians as \\"a crime without a name\\". In that year, a Polish-Jewish lawyer named Raphael Lemkin, described the policies of systematic murder founded by the Nazis as genocide. The word genocide is the combination of the Greek prefix geno- (meaning tribe or race) and caedere (the Latin word for to kill). The word is defined as a specific set of violent crimes that are committed against a certain group with the attempt to remove the entire group from existence or to destroy them. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What is the etymological basis of the word \\"genocide?\\"","output":"The etymological basis of the word \\"genocide\\" can be traced back to its formation by combining elements from two distinct languages: Greek and Latin. The term can be broken down into two components: \\"geno-\\" and \\"-cide.\\" The first component, \\"geno-,\\" comes from the Greek word \\"genos\\" (γένος), which denotes a tribe, race, or a group of people who share a common lineage. By employing this prefix, it emphasizes the collective nature of the crime, referring to an entire community or population represented by the group being targeted. The second component of the word, \\"-cide,\\" is derived from the Latin verb \\"caedere,\\" which means \\"to kill\\" or \\"to cut down.\\" This suffix has been employed in various English words involving the act of killing, such as \\"homicide\\" (killing of a human being) or \\"suicide\\" (killing of oneself). When combined, \\"geno-\\" and \\"-cide\\" create the term \\"genocide,\\" which essentially means the intentional killing or destruction of a particular racial, ethnic, or national group. Raphael Lemkin, a Polish-Jewish lawyer, coined the term in 1944 to describe the horrific acts carried out by the Nazis and, since then, it has been used widely in international relations and legal contexts to define and address mass atrocities and crimes against humanity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This article: A show composed of a concert, circus acts, and broadway is taking place at a theater in the city. One of the stars of the show is a lady cat dancer whom Oswald suddenly has affection for upon seeing a poster. For admission, patrons have to pay 50 cents. Unfortunately for Oswald, his pockets are empty. Oswald notices a stage entrance where performers and certain officials can come in, and admission is unnecessary. Because of this, Oswald comes up with an idea of impersonating a performer by bulging his chest (possibly pretending to be a stuntman). The guard by the door isn't deceived and prevents the penniless rabbit from coming in. After a bit of a struggle, Oswald ties the guard to a lamp post and proceeds toward the inside of the theater. However, he is forced back outside by the glaring performers. While thinking of a way to get back in, Oswald sees a man in a thick fur coat coming out of a taxi and heading towards the theater entrance. Oswald hides under the man's shadow. As the man with the coat enters, the guard becomes suspicious upon noticing a lump on the shadow. Thinking he made it inside undetected, Oswald comes out but doesn't notice the guard approaching him. When he realizes the guard was right behind him, Oswald quickly makes his move. Oswald prevails in losing the guard by going inside a cage. However, he is met with more trouble when the cage contains a jaguar. The jaguar chases him into the stage where acrobats are doing a balancing act with a long pole.

Does the sentence \\"Its distinctive feature, exemplified in the founding example of modern federalism of the United States of America under the Constitution of 1789, is a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established.\\" answer the question \\"Federalism combines what two types of government?\\"","output":"The sentence provided, \\"Its distinctive feature, exemplified in the founding example of modern federalism of the United States of America under the Constitution of 1789, is a relationship of parity between the two levels of government established,\\" does not explicitly answer the question \\"Federalism combines what two types of government?\\" However, it does suggest the presence of two levels of government that are involved in the concept of federalism and mentions that these two levels operate in a relationship of parity. This indicates that federalism involves cooperation between these two levels of government, each having their own powers and responsibilities. To answer the question explicitly, we can discuss the concept of federalism and determine the two types of government that it combines. Federalism is a political system in which authority and powers are divided between a centralized government and individual, smaller political units such as states, provinces, or territories. These two levels of government are the central (also known as the federal or national) government and the constituent (also known as regional, state, or provincial) government. Federalism strikes a balance between the two and creates a system that enables them to work together to govern a nation. In a federal system, the central government is responsible for the matters that concern the entire nation and require the coordination and uniformity that only it can provide. These responsibilities usually include foreign policy, national defense, the economy, the establishment of national laws, and other broader issues that affect the entire country. In contrast, the constituent governments have authority over matters that are more local in nature and pertain to the needs and interests of the specific communities or regions they cover (e.g., education, local infrastructure, public health, and law enforcement). The specific division of powers varies depending on the constitutional structure of the country, but the federal system is designed to ensure that no single level of government is given absolute authority over all aspects of governance. In the context of the United States, which was mentioned in the initial sentence, the Constitution of 1789 established the foundational principles of federalism by defining the division of powers between the Federal government and the state governments. This federalism structure has evolved over time, with different interpretations and changes in the specific allocation of responsibilities, but the core concept of the relationship between the two levels of government remains essential to the American political system. To summarize, the sentence provided implies the presence of two levels of government that are involved in federalism. To answer the question explicitly, federalism combines two types of governments: the central (national or federal) government and the constituent (regional, state, or provincial) government. These two levels of government operate in a relationship of parity and share responsibility for governing a nation based on a division of powers that allows them to address different scopes of issues, from national concerns to more localized matters."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you are given two natural language statements with similar wording.

Assuming the Act mentioned is the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972, it is vital to recognize which section of the MMPA faced the most legal challenges or controversies. Let's consider Section 101 on the \\"Moratorium on Taking and Importing Marine Mammals and Marine Mammal Products” as the most challenged section, given its significant implications on the regulation of marine mammal management. The Marine Mammal Protection Act is a federal legislation passed in 1972 to protect marine mammals, such as whales, seals, dolphins, and manatees, from decline or depletion as a result of human activities. One of the essential features of the MMPA is the imposition of a moratorium on the taking (harassing, hunting, capturing, or killing) and importing of marine mammals and their products. The given statement highlights two individuals associated with the Act – a lawyer who joined the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in 1972 and Dr. Gerard A. \\"Jerry\\" Bertrand, a marine biologist who transferred to a new White House office. Both individuals were instrumental in the creation and implementation of the MMPA.

Article: Doctors fighting malaria---one of the deadliest diseases on the planet--- may soon have a new affordable weapon in their smart phones. Researchers have found a way to use the phone's camera to detect the microorganism in the patient's blood that causes the disease. According to the World Health Organization, almost 600,000 people died of malaria in 2013, making this mosquito-borne disease one of the deadliest in the world. The saddest aspect of this calamity  is that it affects mostly young children. Early detection of the infection is important for successful treatment. But since the first symptoms resemble ordinary flu, a microbiologist must look at a drop of a patient's blood under a microscope for a proper diagnosis. Scientists in Britain have now developed a smart phone attachment called Xrapid, that turns the phone into a 200-power microscope, while the attached app---based on facial recognition software - quickly detects the parasitic protozoa in the blood smear . Jean Viry-Babel is the CEO of IanXen, the company that developed the app. He says it is cheap and works on the spot. \\"So we take a high-definition picture of a sample of blood. We separate the red blood cells from the rest---the white blood cells, the platelets ---and we start looking at each of the red blood cells individually,\\" said Viry-Babel. Viry-Babel says the app is affordable, easy to use and provides reliability of up to 98 percent. The only additional equipment required is an ordinary glass lab slide - called a \\"slate.\\" \\"There's only one button, which is called \\"Diagnose\\". So you put it on the slate and you put it on the dried blood, and you press diagnose and it tells you yes or no,\\" he said.

For instance, in the United States, the FBI reported that 15.6% of hate crimes reported to police in 2004 were \\"because of a sexual-orientation bias\\". Under the UK Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003, as explained by Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service, \\"workers or job applicants must not be treated less favourably because of their sexual orientation, their perceived sexual orientation or because they associate with someone of a particular sexual orientation\\". Under this law what does this state that is required by employers?","output":"According to the text provided, the UK Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003 dictates several important requirements for employers.  Firstly, the law corroborates that workers or job applicants must not be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation. This means an employer cannot refuse to hire, fire, or treat an employee unfavorably in terms of promotions, pay, job assignments, or any other term or condition of employment just because the worker identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or is perceived to be so. Secondly, discrimination based on perceived sexual orientation is also prohibited. This refers to situations where an employer discriminates against an individual because they believe the individual to be of a specific sexual orientation, whether that perception is accurate or not. Therefore, any bias or disadvantage in the workplace that results from an employer's assumptions or judgments about an employee's sexual orientation is illegal. Thirdly, the law protects individuals from discrimination based on their association with someone of a particular sexual orientation. This means employers cannot discriminate against employees because they are linked with people who identify as LGBTQ+. For instance, this covers scenarios where an employee might be discriminated against for having a child who identifies as LGBTQ+, or for advocating for LGBTQ+ rights, or for simply being friends with individuals who identify as LGBTQ+. Importantly, the law implies that employers must cultivate and maintain a working environment that respects diversity and is free from any form of discrimination, including on the grounds of sexual orientation. Employers may need to implement fairness and ethics policies, deliver diversity training, and handle complaints properly to ensure that the law is being followed and that all employees are treated with fairness and respect.  In summary, under the UK Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003, employers are required to treat all employees and job applicants fairly and without discrimination, regardless of their sexual orientation, their perceived sexual orientation, or their association with someone of a particular sexual orientation. Violating these laws could potentially lead to legal repercussions for the employer."},{"instruction":"What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was replaced by Jon Coghill? from the following article ?  Fanning first met Powderfinger guitarist Ian Haug in a University of Queensland economics class in 1989. At the time of the meeting, Haug had recently formed Powderfinger with high school friends John Collins and Steven Bishop, who would become the band's foundational bass guitarist and drummer, respectively. Haug was the lead guitarist and lead singer. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman. Haug stated that \\"It was a big thing to convince the others that we needed a singer. They were like, 'You're OK,' and I was like, 'No I'm not. We can do better than that.'\\"In 1992, current guitarist Darren Middleton was invited to join Powderfinger by Fanning and Haug, after they were impressed by his work in Brisbane band Pirate. Middleton accepted the offer and became the fifth member, joining Jon Coghill who had replaced Bishop as drummer. The line-up of Fanning, Middleton, Haug, Collins, and Coghill then remained unchanged.Throughout the late 1990s, Powderfinger rose to prominence throughout Australia, receiving several accolades and achieving highly successful record and concert ticket sales. As the most vocal and prominent member of the band, the popularity for the group elevated Fanning as a powerful individual in the public view of the Australian music industry. Fanning was called upon by film-maker Gregor Jordan in 2003 to perform the folk song \\"Moreton Bay\\" (named after the bay of the same name in the Brisbane area) and his own original composition \\"Shelter for My Soul\\" in Jordan's film Ned Kelly.

Question: What is something that happens when you are learning about science? Options:  A. testing  B. experiment  C. sense of wonder  D. intimidation  E. increased knowledge Answer:","output":"While all of the options provided can happen when you are learning about science, the answer that is most in line with common sense is E. increased knowledge. When you learn about science, you are essentially gaining more information and understanding about the natural world and the underlying principles that govern it. This process enriches your knowledge and enables you to better comprehend and analyze various phenomena that you encounter in everyday life. Increased knowledge is a core component of the learning process, and it is through learning that one becomes more informed about any subject matter, including science. Option A, testing, is also generally associated with learning, especially in a classroom setting. Teachers use tests to evaluate your understanding of the subject matter and identify areas where you may need more help. However, it is the acquired knowledge that is tested, making E a more appropriate answer. Option B, the experiment, may be a method through which you learn and validate scientific concepts. Experiments are integral to the scientific process, allowing researchers to gather empirical data and test hypotheses. Though experiments are closely tied to scientific learning, they are not the only way to gain knowledge in this field. Option C, the sense of wonder, can be a strong motivation to learn about science. It refers to the awe and fascination people feel when exploring the mysteries of the universe and seeking answers to the questions that intrigue them. While the sense of wonder may be the driving force behind scientific curiosity, increased knowledge is still the primary outcome when learning about science. Option D, intimidation, might be felt by some learners when faced with a challenging subject or concept. However, this feeling does not automatically result from learning about science. Intimidation depends on various factors, such as personal background, learning environment, and prior experience in the field. In summary, while all these options may accompany the process of learning about science, increased knowledge (Option E) is the most in line with common sense, as it is the primary outcome and goal of education in any field, including science."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

I am talking refusing to pay or being even rumored to be not paying. I am not in the volunteer business for business owners. Only happened once… I thought I had a part timer gig being a waiter at an over-priced tourist trap restaurant in the New Orleans French Quarter. As typical for these type of jobs, you do not get to actually wait tables and get tips till a training period is over. Somehow, I did not get the memo that this place did not have “training” but “auditions”, meaning all that silverware I rolled and floors I mopped and food I ran to tables I was not getting paid for! Add to that, if somehow they did not like me, after a week I would not have a job! Now, I understand actors and actresses go to auditions and not get paid all the time. I’ve known a few amateur actors. But, those auditions do not include showing up for a week to work unpaid so maybe you might get hired from talking to them… And waiters don’t do auditions! I left immediately. I think they owed me 30 bucks for half a day’s work at the minimum wage. Tried to go back threatening labor board and all that, but they would not be intimidated.

Movie title: Five Easy Pieces Movie plot: Bobby Dupea (Jack Nicholson) works in a rural California oil field with his friend Elton (Billy 'Green' Bush), who has a wife and baby son. Most of Bobby's free time is spent hanging out at a local diner during his lunch and dinner breaks to see his waitress girlfriend, Rayette (Karen Black), who has dreams of singing country music. On weekends, Bobby hangs out in the company of Elton, with whom he bowls, gets drunk, and has sex with other women. Bobby has evidently not told anyone that he is a former classical pianist who comes from an eccentric family of musicians.When Rayette becomes pregnant and his friend Elton is arrested and sent to jail for having robbed a gas station a year earlier, Bobby quits his job and leaves for Los Angeles where his older sister, Partita (Lois Smith), also a pianist, is making a recording.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - fulfilling - elation - accomplished - feeling good - being satisfied A:","output":"If a person is neutral with regards to seeing an idea become reality, it might mean they do not have a strong emotional attachment to the outcome or are indifferent toward the idea's actualization. In such a case, it would be difficult to precisely define what they would most likely feel as the options provided primarily carry a positive connotation. However, given the options available, \\"being satisfied\\" can come closest to describing how they might feel. Upon seeing an idea become reality, a neutral individual might feel content observing the process and its fruition. They could experience a sense of satisfaction, not necessarily in the actualization itself but rather from the experience of witnessing or participating in the process. They would not experience intense emotions like elation or fulfillment since their attitude is neutral. Neither would they feel accomplished or solely focused on feeling good, as these reactions seem more inclined toward someone who has a positive or goal-oriented perspective on seeing an idea become reality. So, from among the options provided, \\"being satisfied\\" would be the most suitable answer to describe the emotion of a neutral person witnessing an idea becoming reality. Their reaction could be an acknowledgment of the occurrence, but their emotional response would likely be tempered and not as intense or involved as those who have a clear affinity or opposition to the idea."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The context suggests that their exemption from these taxes is the reason for their lack of representation. Here are the steps I took to arrive at this conclusion: First, I identified the information regarding the eighth province, which is Drenthe in this case.  The text says that Drenthe was so poor it was exempt from paying federal taxes, and as a consequence, it was denied representation in the States General. From this, I drew a cause-and-effect relationship between paying taxes and having representation based on the information given in the context.

President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why do the Democrats oppose the Trump tax plan? Options:  A. The tax plan shores up Trump's political base.  B. The plan rewards the rich at the expense of the middle class  C. The plan will end the Russia probe  D. not enough information A:","output":"B.

Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Redskins, the Panthers flew to Lincoln Financial Field for a Monday Night fight with the Philadelphia Eagles.  In the scrappy first quarter, Carolina struck first with QB Jake Delhomme completing a 9-yard TD pass to WR Steve Smith for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Eagles responded with QB Jeff Garcia completing an 8-yard TD pass to RB Brian Westbrook.  Fortunately, the Panthers would regain before the half with Delhomme completing a 1-yard TD pass to the back corner of the endzone, caught by WR Keyshawn Johnson.  In the third quarter, Philadelphia struck back with Garcia completing a 30-yard TD pass to WR Donte' Stallworth.  Yet again, Carolina regained the lead with Delhomme completing a 35-yard TD screen pass to rookie RB DeAngelo Williams, who rushed well after a shaky first quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Eagles crept closer with kicker David Akers getting a 28-yard field goal.  The Panthers responded with kicker John Kasay getting a 45-yard field goal.  Philadelphia would respond with Garcia completing a 40-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Brown.  Then, things got grim when Delhomme got intercepted by Free Safety Brian Dawkins under pressure in the pocket, which led to Akers kicking a 25-yard field goal.  Carolina tried to fight back as they marched deep into Philly territory, but came up short when Delhomme got intercepted again by cornerback Lito Sheppard in almost the same spot where Keyshawn Johnson made the earlier TD completion. Johnson claimed pass interference from Sheppard, but an official review decided this was not the case. With the loss, not only did the Panthers fall to 6-6, but it also marked the 5th time this season the Panthers had the lead going into the fourth quarter and lost.

Gordon was also wanted by New Hampshire State Probation and Parole for a parole violation, the Dunbarton Police Department for burglary and felony reckless conduct, and by the Merrimack County Sheriff's Office for failure to appear for burglary.      \\"This is a great example of how the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Forces coordinate nationwide to locate sex offenders who no longer wish to comply with state sex offender registries,\\" U.S. Marshal David Cargill, Jr. said in a statement. \\"The cooperative effort of these fugitive task forces made up of Federal, State and Local partners allows the agency to locate sex offenders and fugitives who may be otherwise unnoticed in their communities throughout the United States.\\"      Gordon is currently being held by the Volusia County Sheriff's Office on pending charges for failing to register as a sex offender in Florida, Deputy U.S. Marshal Jamie Berry said.

You are able to do a lot of things. When you dont have a lot of energy, you may sit around and do very little. A similar thing happens to particles of matter as energy is added. The more energy there is, the faster the particles of matter move. Energy is also the reason you are able to move around. In fact, matter is always in motion. It can even change from one form to another. For example, electrical energy can be converted into heat energy. You see this every time you use the toaster. Energy causes a change in matter when you lift your arm. Energy can be used to move matter. You use energy to take a step to move forward. Thanks to energy, your body moves.

Jennifer's skates are much newer and more expensive than Natalie's because","output":"Jennifer's skates are much newer and more expensive than Natalie's because Jennifer recently decided to invest in a premium pair of skates after realizing her passion and dedication for the sport. Since Jennifer is a competitive figure skater, she understands the importance of having the best quality equipment to support her in training and performances. On the other hand, Natalie is more of a recreational skater and primarily skates for enjoyment and leisure activities. Although Natalie does appreciate having a reasonably good pair of skates, the difference in requirements between the two skaters explains the disparity in the quality and cost of their skates. While shopping for her new skates, Jennifer focused on several key features that are important for a high-performance skater. For example, the blade quality and material are crucial, as top-quality blades made of stainless steel or carbon fiber provide better grip on the ice and are more resistant to corrosion and wear over time. Additionally, more experienced skaters like Jennifer benefit from a stiffer, more robust boot that offers increased ankle support and stronger control during intricate jumps, spins, and footwork sequences. This level of quality is often seen in expensive, professionally-designed skates. The brand and reputation of skate manufacturers also contribute to the higher cost of Jennifer's skates. Renowned brands such as Riedell, Jackson, and Edea invest in extensive research, technology, and innovation to create skates that cater specifically to the needs of elite figure skaters. These top-tier figure skate brands often collaborate with professional athletes to develop state-of-the-art designs that promise the highest levels of comfort, performance, and durability. In contrast, Natalie's skates may be purchased from a more budget-friendly brand since her skating activities are less demanding. Recreational skates may have lesser-quality blades and softer boots, which are more comfortable for beginner or casual skaters and come at a lower price point. While these skates still provide sufficient support for basic skating skills, they may not have the same long-lasting features and cutting-edge technology found in Jennifer's skates. Moreover, Jennifer's skates are newer, indicating that she may have replaced her old pair as she advanced in her sport and outgrew the capabilities of her previous skates. As a competitive skater continues to improve and develop, their skates need to keep up with their skill level and match their specific requirements on the ice. In Jennifer's case, investing in a high-quality, expensive pair of skates was a calculated decision to help her reach her maximum potential in figure skating. Natalie may still have her older pair due to the reduced wear and tear on her skates from her less frequent and less intense skating sessions. For her recreational purposes, there may be no pressing need to replace her current skates with a more expensive pair. In conclusion, the difference in the age and cost of Jennifer's and Natalie's skates can be attributed to their differing objectives and aspirations in the sport of figure skating. A dedicated, high-level athlete like Jennifer has more demanding equipment needs and is more likely to invest in newer, more expensive skates for better performance and longevity. In contrast, a skater like Natalie, who primarily enjoys ice skating for fun and leisure, might find that their needs are met with a less-expensive, older pair of skates that will suffice without breaking the bank."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Pumpkin king Jack Skellington (speaking voice Chris Sarandon, singing Danny Elfman), an elegantly attenuated skeleton, has delivered another scary Halloween. But he receives the adulation of Halloweentown with no enthusiasm -- something is missing from Jack's life and he's tired of doing the same old Halloween thing year after year. The missing something might well be Sally (Catherine O'Hara), an animated rag doll who yearns for Jack, but he doesn't notice. (Sally was created by Halloweentown's evil scientist (William Hickey), who keeps her locked up except when she knocks him out by slipping deadly nightshade in his soup.)After pondering his ennui in a cemetery (disturbing Sally, who's replenishing her supply of deadly nightshade), Jack takes his ghostly dog Zero for a walk in the woods. They come upon a strange circle of trees, each with a door representing a holiday. Jack opens the Christmas door and they're sucked in, landing in Christmastown. Jack is curious about everything he sees there, but finds it all delightful and wants to be part of it.Back in Halloweentown Jack calls a town meeting, where he describes what he saw in Christmastown. His people don't seem very impressed, so to draw them in, he makes some elements of Christmas -- including \\"Sandy Claws\\" (Edward Ivory) -- sound scary. Then he announces that they're taking over Christmas and starts assigning jobs.

I love it!  How would the sentiment of this tweet be described? Available options: A). negative. B). positive.","output":"B). Positive The sentiment of this tweet can be described as positive. The text appears to be a quote from a song or a poem and conveys a sense of admiration and intrigue. The mention of \\"I love it!\\" further supports the notion that the sentiment is positive, as it expresses the author's enjoyment and enthusiasm. The tweet starts by seemingly criticizing the subject, describing them as \\"a nurse without a job\\" and \\"another uptown slob.\\" However, as the message progresses, the author questions their initial perception, with the phrase \\"but have I got you all wrong.\\" This implies that the author might be realizing that their initial judgment was incorrect or unfair, partly contributing to the positive turn in the sentiment. The phrase \\"one look and you weeerrrre gone\\" suggests that the subject of the tweet left an unforgettable impression on the author. The elongation of the word \\"were\\" adds emphasis and excitement to the statement. Such a statement generally signals a positive sentiment as it indicates the author's admiration, curiosity, or fascination with the subject, and it shows a change in perception. Overall, the tweet's sentiment leans more towards the positive side, considering the self-reflection on the initial judgment and enthusiasm expressed through the words \\"I love it!\\" and the alluring nature of the subject. The tweet invokes a sense of ongoing admiration while acknowledging the potential for misjudging people."},{"instruction":"What is the final step of the following process: -  Adult mushrooms produce spores - Release them into the air by process of sporulation - Spores are carried by the wind - Land in a hospitable growing environment - The spores germinate into the soil - The mushroom starts growing A:","output":"A: The final step is the fully-grown mushroom reaching maturity, ready to produce and release spores, completing the life cycle."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Standard bocce sets contain 8 colored balls-4 balls each to a color, typically green and red-and one smaller ball, called the jack or pallino.  Different skill levels are often associated with different sizes of bocce balls. Select from:  a). If you include a smaller ball in your set, you don't have to buy sets for each type of ball. Simplifying sets by plans is better than trying to vary them up too much in terms of size.;  b). Smaller balls tend to be used by beginners and kids, while the larger ones are used by professionals. Regulation-sized bocce balls have a standard diameter of 107 mm (4.2 inches) and a standard weight of 920 g (~ 2 lbs).;  c). Consult with a tailor or play a few halves of a size game over a yard before you buy a bocce ball set. Place your box a few feet from the net.;  d). If you hold an incorrectly sized basketball, you may drop out. For beginners, picking out a short \\" bocce ball \\" is helpful.;","output":"b). Smaller balls tend to be used by beginners and kids, while the larger ones are used by professionals. Regulation-sized bocce balls have a standard diameter of 107 mm (4.2 inches) and a standard weight of 920 g (~ 2 lbs).; Once you have gathered your bocce ball set and chosen the appropriate size for your skill level, you can proceed with the following steps to play the game: 1. Find a suitable playing area: Bocce can be played on a variety of surfaces, such as grass, sand, or a dedicated bocce court with a smooth, flat surface. The standard dimensions for a bocce court are 27.5 meters (90 feet) long and 4 meters (13 feet) wide, but you can adjust this to accommodate your available space. 2. Divide the players into two teams: Bocce can be played with 2-8 players, divided into two teams. Each team can have 1-4 players. If there are an odd number of players, one team can have an additional player who takes turns throwing the balls. 3. Determine the order of play: Flip a coin or use another method to decide which team will throw the pallino (the smaller ball) first. This team is called Team A, and the other team is called Team B. 4. Begin the game: A player from Team A throws the pallino into the playing area, ensuring it lands at least halfway down the court and not closer than 30 cm (about 12 inches) from the side boundaries or back end of the court. 5. Throw the bocce balls: A player from Team A throws one of their colored balls, attempting to get it as close as possible to the pallino. Then, a player from Team B throws one of their balls, also trying to get closer to the pallino than Team A's ball.  6. Alternate turns and keep score: The teams continue to alternate turns until all 8 balls have been thrown. Each team earns one point for every ball closer to the pallino than the closest ball of the opposing team.  7. Start the next round: The team that scored in the previous round gets to throw the pallino in the next round. If a round ended in a tie, the team that threw the pallino in the previous round throws it again. 8. Continue playing and declare a winner: The game continues with multiple rounds until one team reaches a predetermined number of points, typically 12 or 16. Throughout the game, there are a few additional rules to follow, such as no stepping over the foul line while throwing and balls that land out of bounds are removed from play. Additionally, if a ball hits the back wall without touching the pallino or another ball first, it is also considered out of bounds. Remember to practice good sportsmanship and have fun while playing bocce ball!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In a fiercely competitive match held at Exeter's home grounds, both Northampton Town and Exeter City fought valiantly but failed to break the goalless deadlock. The game saw a string of missed opportunities and superb goaltending on both sides, leading to a standstill that kept fans on the edge of their seats until the final whistle. As the first step to writing the article, it's important to introduce the key event - Northampton Town being crowned champions. The surprising element is the goalless draw that gives a twist to the expected triumphant victory.  Even though Northampton Town was unable to score, their season-long hard work and commitment came to fruition as they were crowned League Two champions. The team's consistent performance throughout the season, resilient defense line, and fearless offensive strategies have been foundational to their success in this championship race. At this stage in the article, I am emphasizing on Northampton Town's championship win, highlighting their performance throughout the season that led to their ultimate success, regardless of the scoreless draw in the final match.  On the other side of the field, Exeter City showcased their defensive prowess by successfully keeping the explosive Northampton Town's attack in check, leading to the goalless stalemate. Add an acknowledgement for the Exeter team reinforces them as worthy opponents and speaks on their strong defensive play during the match.  Despite being the underdog in the contest, Exeter City's impressive resistance underpins their potential to be serious contenders in the next season's championship race. The goalless match against the champions demonstrated their ability to rise to challenging occasions and defy expectations. This point highlights the promising future of Exeter City, making the article balanced and not completely focusing on the champions. The goalless draw at Exeter did little to dampen Northampton Town's celebration. Even amidst the absence of traditional victory cheers, the team vividly celebrated their hard-earned championship, signaling a triumphant end to an exciting League Two season. Next, returning the focus to Northampton Town, it's important to reflect on the culmination of the season and their championship win.  This unique championship win by Northampton Town despite a goalless draw fosters anticipation for the twists and turns of the upcoming season, igniting excitement in the fans of League Two football. Concluding the article by hinting at future possibilities helps bridge the gap between this season and the next while maintaining the reader's interest.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A stunt performer, often referred to as a stuntman, stuntwoman, or daredevil, is someone who performs dangerous stunts, often as a career.  - Traditional heavy metal, also known as classic metal, or traditional metal, is the seminal genre of heavy metal music before the genre \\"evolved and splintered into many different styles and subgenres.\\"  - Reality television is a genre of television programming that documents supposedly unscripted real-life situations, and often features an otherwise unknown cast of individuals who are typically not professional actors, although in some shows celebrities may participate. It differs from documentary television in that the focus tends to be on drama, personal conflict, and entertainment rather than educating viewers. The genre has various standard tropes, including \\"confessionals\\" (also called \\"talking heads\\" or \\"interview segments\\") used by cast members to express their thoughts, which often double as the shows' narration. In competition-based reality shows, a notable subset, there are other common elements such as one participant being eliminated per episode, a panel of judges, and the concept of \\"immunity from elimination.\\"  - Blooddrunk is the sixth album by Finnish melodic death metal band Children of Bodom, released on April 7, 2008, through Spinefarm Records. The album includes a re-recorded version single for \\"Tie My Rope\\". Various editions feature one or two cover songs as bonus tracks. The limited edition digipak version of the album includes a bonus DVD with 5.1 surround mixes of all songs and the video and making-of for \\"Blooddrunk\\". It sold 20,000 copies during its first week of release.  - Viva La Bam is an American reality television series that starred Bam Margera and his friends and family. The show was a spin-off from MTV's \\"Jackass\\", in which Margera and most of the main cast had appeared. Each episode had a specific theme, mission, or challenge which was normally accomplished by performing pranks, skateboarding, and enlisting the help of friends, relations and experts. Although partly improvised, the show was supported by a greater degree of planning and organization.  - Children of Bodom is a melodic death metal band from Espoo, Finland. Formed in 1993, the group currently consists of Alexi Laiho (vocals, lead guitar), Janne Wirman (keyboards), Henkka Seppälä (bass), Jaska Raatikainen (drums) and Daniel Freyberg (rhythm guitar). In total they have released nine studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, two compilation albums and one DVD.  - Melodic death metal (also referred to as melodeath or MDM) is a subgenre death metal that employs highly melodic guitar riffs, often borrowing from traditional heavy metal. The style originated and developed in Sweden (pioneered by At the Gates, Dark Tranquillity and In Flames) and the United Kingdom (pioneered by Carcass) during the early and mid-1990s. The Swedish death metal scene did much to popularize the style, soon centering in the \\"Gothenburg metal\\" scene.  - \`\` Tie My Rope '' is a 2007 song from the Finnish melodic death metal band Children of Bodom . The song is from Children of Bodom 's sixth studio album , Blooddrunk . The song was also included on Viva La Bands , Vol. 2 , a compilation album from the program Viva La Bam and the tracks on the album were selected by star Bam Margera . Musically , \`\` Tie My Rope '' bears a resemblance to songs from Children of Bodom 's album Are You Dead Yet ? , and was a product of the band 's exploration of their 1980s metal influences . In contrast to all of their past material , the keyboards have a much darker sound that blend in with the overall song . In addition , the overall usage of keyboards in the songs seem to be much more present than songs in Are You Dead Yet ? . The song was re-recorded for the actual album .  - Swedish death metal is a death metal music scene developed in Sweden. Many Swedish death metal bands are associated with the melodic death metal movement, thus giving Swedish death metal a different sound from other variations of death metal. Unlike American death metal groups, the first Swedish bands were rooted in punk rock. Although Norway is known for its quantity of black metal, Gothenburg in Sweden has a large melodic death metal scene, while Stockholm is known for its more raw death metal scene.  - Lead guitar is a guitar part which plays melody lines, instrumental fill passages, guitar solos, and occasionally, some riffs within a song structure. The lead is the featured guitar, which usually plays single-note-based lines or double-stops. In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz, punk, fusion, some pop, and other music styles, lead guitar lines are usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar, which consists of accompaniment chords and riffs.  - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.  - MTV (originally an initialism of Music Television) is an American cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Media Networks (a division of Viacom) and headquartered in New York City. Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as \\"video jockeys\\" (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years.  - Brandon Cole \\"Bam\\" Margera (or ; born September 28, 1979) is an American professional skateboarder, stunt performer, and television personality. He came to prominence after appearing in MTV's \\"Jackass\\" crew.

They were both very surprised with they findings.  But I can use this background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

Yinsen Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Infinite Rebirth\\" Genre: Action, Science-Fiction, Adventure, Drama Plot Overview: \\"Infinite Rebirth\\" follows the story of Yinsen, a brilliant scientist who helps Tony Stark build the arc reactor and escape captivity in a cave, and combines elements of action, sci-fi, adventure, and drama. Set in a world being torn apart by powerful corporations and their technological advancements, the film will explore the ethical consequences and broader implications of the revolutionary arc reactor technology. ACT I: The movie begins with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), a genius inventor, and billionaire entrepreneur attending a global summit on renewable energy. As Stark presents his plans to build the arc reactor - a safe, clean, and virtually limitless energy source - he catches the attention of Dr. Yinsen (Shaun Toub), a world-renowned scientist from an unstable and war-torn region. Yinsen, impressed by Stark's ideas, sees the potential for the arc reactor to transform his homeland and save millions of lives. However, as Stark leaves the summit, he is kidnapped by a group of mercenaries led by a mysterious man known as Raza. ACT II: Stark awakens in a cave, his captors demanding that he builds a weapon using his arc reactor technology. Realizing that they might be in the same situation, Yinsen, who was also captured by Raza, quickly befriends Stark. Having already seen the potential of the arc reactor, Yinsen insists that Stark builds one for good instead of evil. Stark agrees, and together, they secretly work on building a miniature arc reactor to both keep Stark's heart functioning and power an armored suit they hope will help them escape. As they work together under increasing pressure, Stark and Yinsen share their personal stories and develop a deep friendship. Yinsen reveals his past as a scientist who invented various life-saving technologies, but which were seized by Raza and misused to instigate war and oppression in his homeland. He believes the arc reactor can offer people a bright future and be the key to ending the suffering caused by the conflict. ACT III: As Stark completes the armored suit, he and Yinsen prepare their escape plan, knowing that Raza will kill them once he realizes they didn't comply with his orders. Just as they are about to make their break, Raza discovers their secret and orders his men to attack them, resulting in a dramatic and intense battle. Stark, wearing the armored suit, uses the arc reactor's power to hold off their assailants, while Yinsen saves the reactor's blueprint onto a flash drive. In a harrowing sequence, Yinsen sacrifices his life so that Stark can escape the cave and return to civilization with the critical information on the arc reactor. Stark is eternally grateful for Yinsen's help and honors his memory by vowing to use the arc reactor technology responsibly, eventually becoming Iron Man. The movie concludes with Stark starting the \\"Yinsen Foundation\\" as a tribute to his friend's legacy, with the mission to provide safe, clean energy to countries in need. The final scene shows a city powered by an arc reactor, standing as a testament to the sacrifices of Yinsen and Stark's commitment to using technology for good. In \\"Infinite Rebirth,\\" the collaboration and friendship between Stark and Yinsen demonstrate that when individuals work together for the betterment of humanity, they can overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges. The film serves as a reminder that although technology can be used for both good and evil, it's ultimately up to those who wield it to use it responsibly."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

U.S. Navy handed over control of a seized oil freighter to Libyan forces while in international waters Saturday,. The saga of the North Korea-flagged tanker Morning Glory, which authorities now say is bound for the capital Tripoli, has illustrated the extreme weakness of Libya's government, vying with rebels for dominance since the 2011 ouster and death of Moammar Gadhafi. Officials also said that they had interrogated the captain and learned that it belonged to a Saudi company. Homecoming: North Korean-flagged tanker the Morning Glory, pictured here on March 8 docked at the Es Sider export terminal in Ras Lanuf, was returned to Libya Saturday by the U.S. Navy, which had seized it last week. Entourage: USS Elrod escorted the tanker on its way to Libya, with its 34 sailors staying about the Morning Glory. The main force behind the tanker is a well-known militia commander in east Libya who was planning to sell oil in defiance of Tripoli. But Ibrahim Jedran's international partners have until now remained unknown. North Korean officials say they have canceled the ship's registration after the incident. Last week, U.S. Navy SEALs seized the ship off the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, stopping an attempt by a Libyan militia to sell its shipload of crude in defiance of Tripoli. Under cover of darkness, the elite team of commandos swooped onto the The Morning Glory from a helicopter after tracking it down to a bolt hole some 18 miles southwest of the island nation. A Pentagon spokesman said they were met with next to no resistance as they swept silently through the vessel's corridors and cabins, arresting all inside. Nobody was injured in the operation. Jedran, whose fighters control the terminal where the tanker took on its load, is part of a movement demanding autonomy for the east of the country. He has warned the U.S. against handing over the tanker and three of his fighters, reportedly including one of his brothers, who are on board. Libyan authorities at first planned to. bring the tanker Morning Glory to dock at the port of Zawiya refinery,. 25 miles west of the capital Tripoli, according to Ayoub Qassem,. spokesman for the Libyan navy. However,. just as it came into sight of Zawiya, the country's top prosecutor. ordered that it head to Tripoli port for further investigation, Abdullah. Rashed, supervisor of operations at Zawiya port, told The Associated. Press. Rashid said the vessel would arrive late at night at Tripoli port and then continue on Sunday or Monday to Zawiya, though a navy spokesman declined to confirm this. Members of Libya's naval coastguard man speed boats as they wait for the arrival of the Morning Glory at Zawiya port, Libya. Qassem had earlier told the official news agency LANA that three Libyan navy ships escorted the vessel into national waters. Hours before the handover, at least 16 people were wounded when Libyan rebels occupying three eastern oil ports clashed with troops and attacked an army base, where pro-government forces had been preparing to break the rebel blockade. Anti-aircraft gunfire and explosions were heard overnight and after dawn on Saturday in Ajdabiya, the hometown of rebel leader Ibrahim Jedran, whose fighters seized the ports last summer to demand a greater share in Libya's oil resources. Last summer, Jedran's militia took over Libya's oil facilities in the east. As a result, the country's exports of its biggest revenue earner have slowed to a trickle. This month, the militia loaded the Morning Glory with 30million worth of oil. It set sail and evaded a Libyan blockade to escape to the Mediterranean, and the militia said they would sell the oil on behalf of a council that claims to be a government in the east, challenging the central authority. Qassem said three Libyans and 21 crew. members who were on board were detained by the Libyans after the U.S. Navy handed the ship over. A. Libyan security official confirmed that one of Jedran's brothers was on. board. He said a boat of the Libyan navy forces had taken the Libyans. and the crew aboard to Tripoli. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters. A. spokesman for the guards of the oil terminals, Walid al-Tarhouni, said. Saturday that officials had learned that the ship belonged to a Saudi. company following interrogation of the vessel's captain, and after. reviewing the ownership documents. Change of plans: Just as the tanker came into sight of Zawiya (pictured), the country's top prosecutor ordered that it head to Tripoli port. Rogue militiamen: Rebels under commander Ibrahim Jedran unload ammunition from a boat at Es Sider port in Ras Lanuf; Jedran was planning to sell oil in defiance of Tripoli. Al-Tarhouni said Jedran's threats are ‘media talk’ that have no effect and that the army in the eastern area is working to regain control of the oil terminals. Jon Ki Chol, deputy director-general of North Korea's Maritime Administration, has previously said that although North Korea had provided a flag for the tanker Morning Glory, it canceled registration of the ship after being notified of the incident. When the ship docks into the harbor, it's expected to take 10 to 15 hours to unload 350,000 barrels of oil, Abdel Satar el-Terbel, coordinator of the naval operations in Zawiya Refinery Company, said. The attempted oil sale fueled political crisis in Libya and led to the parliament's removal of Ali Zidan from his post as prime minister, saying it had underlined his weakness. Libya's three rebel-held ports account for around 700,000 barrels per day of Libya's oil export capacity, or around half of its total petroleum shipments. Ransom: The vessel was stolen from the port of As Sidra last month by Libyan anti-Government insurgents, who are demanding a greater share of oil wealth and autonomy from the country's fledgling administration. They were tracked down near Cyprus.

Background: Point of Grace is an all-female Contemporary Christian music vocal group. The trio consists of Shelley Breen, Denise Jones, and Leigh Cappillino. The group started out as a quartet in 1991, with original members Breen and Jones, as well as Terry Jones and Heather Payne. In November 2003, Terry Jones decided to spend more time with her family after giving birth to her third child, and left the group, with Cappillino joining in March 2004 for their 2004 release Context: After a hiatus, the girls regrouped in early 2001 to begin work on the follow-up to Steady On. They worked with six producers: Bannister, David Tyson, Nathan Nockels who played keyboards for them in the Steady On Tour, Tom Laune, Glenn Garrett, and Wayne Tester. Each producer brought a different sound, which is what they were aiming for when they started work on this project. The lead single, \\"Blue Skies\\" was an instant radio hit, and soon went No. 1.  The album, entitled Free to Fly was released on May 1, 2001, and that same week they opened the Dove Awards telecast. The girls promoted the album during the summer of 2001, performing at the major Christian festivals and doing their own concerts, while preparing for The Free To Fly Tour. There were rumors that the tour might be canceled due to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, but Heather cleared this up, stating that, more than ever, people needed to hear the message of hope. In honor of the ones who lost their lives in the attacks. They closed each show with a cappella rendition of \\"America The Beautiful\\".  In early 2002, Point of Grace began work on a new project. The Girls of Grace project slowly became a reality. They worked with the Tennessee Choral Academy, and female artists such as Rachael Lampa, Joy Williams, Out of Eden and Jaci Velasquez contributed to the project with their talents. Point of Grace previewed the Girls of Grace devotional book, workbook, journal and album during the 2002 GMA Week and premiered one of their songs from the project, \\"All I'll Ever Need\\", on the 2002 Dove Awards telecast. The girls continued performing concerts until the summer of 2002, when they took a few months off. Shelley and Heather gave birth to their first children in September, and in the same month, Terry gave birth to her third child.  The Girls of Grace album was released on August 20, 2002, and the first conference took place in October in Lakeland, Florida. To start things up on Friday night, the girls would give a high-energy concert. On Saturday, there were many speakers, such as Susie Shellenberger of BRIO Magazine, Nancy Alcorn of Mercy Ministries of America. They addressed topics such as self-esteem, sex, family issues, friendships and relationships with God. There were also musical guests.

Farmer, a handsome 26-year-old singer, seemed like a lock for the Idol crown. He had a strong audition, scoring points by bringing in his cute daughter, Cadence, and telling a compelling story of military service and receiving a life-threatening injury in Kuwait.      For extra heartstrings, he claimed to host Ryan Seacrest that the medicine he was taking to heal the brain injury made him sterile, thus his daughter's birth was a miracle. He went even further, telling judges Randy Jackson, Mariah Carey, Nicki Minaj, and Keith Urban that he was dedicating his audition to his friends in service.      STORY: 'American Idol' Recap: Battle of the Sob Stories      Fox News reports he now says that he will no longer compete on the show after it was discovered he completely made up the story about sustaining a brain injury in an IED explosion in Iraq.      \\"It was ALL lies,\\" Farmer wrote in a statement to Guradianofvalor.com \\"I in fact HAVE lied since a younger age and had a problem with it. I am coming out and making a statement (even though I was instructed not to) because I DO want to come clean.\\"      Farmer first denied making the claim at all, stating that Idol producers created the tall-tale through creative editing in his video package. He also said that the photos of himself in the military were stock photos that he did not provide.      \\"I'm FIRM in the fact that I know I had talked about it over 6 hours of interviews that I discussed certain missions and stuff that we did on a day to day basis,\\" he stated on the website. \\"Then I mentioned to a producer in an interview that I had an accident while in country and remember 'waking up in Kuwait.' This is where this was all pieced together. I am sure you have watched the clip and can realize that it is chopped up.\\"      However, fellow soldiers that served with Farmer took to another website, StolenValor.com, to call him out on his facts. The \\"brain injury\\" in question was not from combat, they said, but from an overdose of acne medication and alcohol, which is forbidden in the military.      PHOTOS: 'American Idol' Season 12: Will It Work?      “I was a sniper section leader attached to his company and lived in the same room with him until he was medevaced from Ramadi because he got drunk while he was taking Accutane,” wrote a soldier who claimed to be his roommate. “He was never involved in one single direct fire engagement, was never wounded, and made up this whole lie to try and make his story sound good to American Idol.\\"      Although Farmer is denying claims that he was kicked out of the army and Iraq, he said he is now going to tell the truth from now on.      \\"I was told to keep quiet and not talk to anyone, and I have decided that what’s best for me and my family is to come out and end the insanity,\\" Farmer wrote. \\"I indeed have many many things to work with and need to get a lot of help doing it. Again I apologize to everyone that I have come across and hurt or lied too.\\"      Watch Farmer's entire audition below:      Twitter: idol_worship      Michele Amabile ||||| Anderson keeps his dark hair trimmed short on the sides, and on the day I visited him, he wore blue jeans and a black T‑shirt emblazoned with u.s. veteran. He comes across as steady and unexcitable, his thick eyebrows framing a calm gaze. Doug Sterner, who served as a combat engineer in Vietnam and mentored Anderson in imposter investigation, describes him as circumspect. “He has a levelheaded approach,” Sterner told me. “It’s not a game, you’re not a cop, and it’s not about bagging a phony. It’s about getting to the bottom of the facts.”      Sterner first discovered military fakers by accident, after launching a website devoted to cataloging the recipients of the nation’s top valor awards (the Pentagon only recently began compiling a master list). So far, he says he has compiled names and battle narratives for some 270,000 award recipients—though, as he has discovered, plenty of people claim to have received awards who never did. Sorry, Sterner learned to say when someone complained that a family member was missing from his list. Dad’s not a war hero. He finds these cases depressing, a distraction from his work “preserving the lives of real heroes,” so when Anderson reached out with a question about military records several years ago, Sterner welcomed his interest in investigating fakers; today, Sterner frequently sends stolen-valor tips Anderson’s way.      If a lead seems legit, like the one about the Special Operations soldier turned police trainer, Anderson will poke around online to learn more about the person and hopefully find a date of birth or, better yet, a Social Security number. With those, he can access military personnel records, which will show, at the very least, where and when a person served. Freedom of Information Act requests can yield more-detailed documents, like those included with discharge papers, which show war-zone duty and special awards and recognitions. Many records are stored at the National Personnel Records Center, in St. Louis, but not all. Some military branches now keep their own records, so the search process can take months. “I build the case just like I’m taking it to trial,” Anderson says. “If a jury wouldn’t look at it and decide that person’s guilty, I won’t post it.”      For as long as soldiers have gone off to war, they’ve exaggerated and lied about it, in ways big and small. When George Washington established the U.S. military’s first badges of honor, in 1782, he understood that soldiers deserved recognition, but also that they couldn’t be trusted not to embellish their exploits: “Should any who are not entitled to these honors have the insolence to assume the badges of them they shall be severely punished,” he wrote.      So it continues today. In this thank-you-for-your-service era of adulation for the military, some can’t resist the ego-stroking pull of handshakes and discounts. Others get a thrill out of putting one over on everyone else. Anderson likes to tell the story of William James Clark, whose case preceded his own investigations. In 2002, after a barge slammed into a bridge spanning the Arkansas River, killing 14 people, Clark showed up wearing an Army uniform, told authorities that he was a Special Forces captain just back from overseas, and for two days asserted that he was in charge of rescue and recovery efforts—despite the fact that he was a civilian and had never served a day. “He took over,” Anderson said, giggling and shaking his head, “because he was in uniform and they allowed him to.” |||||","output":"The article recounts the story of American Idol season 12 participant Matthew Farmer who admitted that he fabricated his story about suffering from a traumatic war injury. Initially, Farmer seemed poised for success on the show due to his strong audition, the compelling story of his military service, and the dramatic tale of surviving a life-threatening injury in Kuwait. He told the host, Ryan Seacrest, that the medication he was taking after his brain injury caused him to become sterile, making his daughter's birth a miracle.  However, Farmer's lie unraveled when it was revealed that his brain injury was not due to an IED explosion in Iraq, but from an overdose of acne medication and alcohol, which is prohibited in the military. This revelation came to light after servicemen who had served with Farmer expressed their objections to his falsehoods on the website StolenValor.com. Furthermore, they stated that Farmer had never been involved in any direct fire engagement or sustained any injuries.  Upon realizing the extent of his deception, Farmer withdrew from the American Idol competition and issued a public apology, explaining that he had been lying since he was young and had made a decision to stop. Initially, Farmer blamed the American Idol producers for constructing his exaggerated story through selective editing and claimed the military photos were stock photos. Still, he eventually admitted to his lies, saying he intends to be truthful from now on.  The second part of the article further explores the issue of military imposters, highlighted by Doug Sterner, a combat engineer in Vietnam and military faker investigator. He mentioned that people often exaggerate or lie about their military exploits for various reasons, such as ego-boosting public recognition or the thrill of deceiving others.  Sterner, who devoted his work to cataloging the recipients of the nation's top valor awards, admitted that uncovering military fakers is somewhat depressing for him. However, he often collaborates with another investigator, Anderson, in uncovering these military impersonation cases. Anderson’s method is meticulous and involves extensive online research, including access to military personnel records, freedom of information requests for detailed documents, and multi-source verification, to ensure the case is solid before exposing anyone. The article emphasizes that such fabrications around military service are age-old phenomenons and can be deeply harmful and disrespectful to actual veterans and servicemen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is known that Birger grew up and spent his adolescence in Bjälbo, Östergötland but the exact date of his birth remains uncertain and available historical sources are contradictory. Examinations of his mortal remains indicate that he was probably about 50 upon his death in 1266 which would indicate a birth around 1216. However, his father Magnus Minnesköld is assumed to have died no later than 1210, which would lead to an assumed birth a few years earlier. Under any circumstance, he was the son of Ingrid Ylva, who according to Olaus Petri was a daughter of Sune Sik and granddaughter of King Sverker I of Sweden, which would make Birger a matrilineal member of the House of Sverker. His brothers or half-brothers  Eskil, Karl, and Bengt  were all born long before 1200, and it can therefore be assumed that they had another mother. He was also a nephew of the jarl Birger Brosa from the House of Bjelbo. The combination of this background proved to be of vital importance.  - The Baltic Sea (  ; ) is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean, enclosed by Scandinavia, Finland, the Baltic countries, and the North European Plain.

The screen got scratched when John was cleaning it with a cloth because the  Available choices: (1). screen is smooth.; (2). cloth is smooth.;","output":"Based on the context provided in the given sentence, it appears that the correct ending to the sentence would be the one that provides a plausible explanation as to why the screen got scratched while John was cleaning it with a cloth. Therefore, the appropriate completion of the sentence would be: The screen got scratched when John was cleaning it with a cloth because the cloth was not smooth. The reason behind choosing this ending is that if the screen or cloth was smooth, it would be less likely for the screen to get scratched during the cleaning process. A smooth surface is generally less abrasive, which means that it wouldn't cause damage to the screen when rubbed against it. However, if the cloth is not smooth, there is a higher chance of the screen getting scratched. This is because a cloth with an uneven or textured surface may carry small particles or debris that can act as an abrasive material when the cloth is moved across the screen's surface. These particles can rub against the screen, causing the scratch. Thus, an extended version of the sentence can be: The screen got scratched when John was cleaning it with a cloth because the cloth was not smooth, which created friction between the cloth's surface and the screen, causing abrasive particles to scratch the screen's surface. To avoid such situations, it is crucial to use a soft, lint-free, and non-abrasive cloth when cleaning delicate surfaces like screens. Additionally, cleaning solutions specifically designed for screens should also be used to prevent any damage to the surface. Investing in screen protectors can also mitigate the risk of scratching the screen during cleaning or regular use."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Second question: Which is the best nude beach in the world and why? Are these two questions asking the same thing? OPT: A). no; B). yes;","output":"Answer: A). No Justification: Each of the two questions asks for different information.  1) The first question asks for the country where girls are seen in public without clothes. This demands knowledge of different societal norms, laws, and cultural practices related to nudity in public among various countries. 2) The second question asks for the best nude beach in the world and why it is considered the best. This implies a ranking of nude beaches based on factors such as safety, location, amenities, cleanliness, scenic beauty, and possibly patron reviews. Therefore, this question doesn't necessarily care about the laws and societal norms – it's focused on beach quality. In essence, these two questions are not identical because different types of data would be used to answer each one.

Gustavo Dudamel is a Venezuelan conductor known for his dynamic and vibrant conducting style. His connection with the Los Angeles Philharmonic began in 2009 when he became the orchestra's Music Director, a position he still holds. Being a contemporary music enthusiast, Dudamel has worked closely with many present-day composers, such as John Adams, whose works he frequently includes in his programs. \\"The Gospel According to the Other Mary\\" is a substantial piece by John Adams, who is one of America’s leading composers, known for his minimalist style combined with a desire to comment on social and political issues. The work is a modern passion oratorio, and Adams himself described it as \\"a Passion Oratorio in Two Acts\\". The libretto, crafted by Peter Sellars, incorporates Bibilical texts, poetry, and other writings. The title character, Mary, refers to Mary Magdalene, and the narrative is partly drawn from her point of view.  The piece was presented by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, one of the leading orchestras in the United States and world-renowned for its adventurous programming and commitment to playing modern and contemporary music. The world premiere event took place at Los Angeles' esteemed Walt Disney Concert Hall, known for its fantastic acoustics and striking architecture.

The river begins as the Agra Oya , in the Horton Plains . The Central Plains have an annual rainfall of between 125 and 200 inches a year . The river is approximately 70 km ( 43 mi ) long and drains a basin of about 58,534 ha ( 226 square miles ) . The river flows through a traditional area of ancient villages and tea plantations . King Dutugemunu spent his youth here . The Kotmale Oya flows into the Mahaweli shortly at Pallegama . Tributaries of the Kotmale Oya include the Nanu Oya , the Pundal Oya , the Puna Oya , and the Dambagastalawa Oya . The river was dammed between 1979 and 1985 as part of a hydro - electric project within the Accelerated Mahaweli Ganga scheme . The opening ceremony took place in August 1985 . Some 3,000 families had to be relocated top higher ground . The area has a history of geological instability .  - The Bay of Bengal, the largest bay in the world, forms the northeastern part of the Indian Ocean. Roughly triangular, it is bordered mostly by India and Sri Lanka to the west, Bangladesh to the north, and Myanmar (Burma) and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (India) to the east.  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - Hydroelectricity is electricity produced from hydropower. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity, and was expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years.  - The Mahaweli River (Mahawaluka nadee, literally \\"Great Sandy River\\"; [\\"mahawali gangai\\"]), is a long river, ranking as the longest river in Sri Lanka. Its drainage basin is the largest in the country, and covers almost one-fifth of the total area of the island. The real creation of Mahaweli ganga starts at Polwathura(at Mahawila area), a remote village of Nuwara-Eliya District in bank Nawalapitiya of Kandy District by further joining of Hatton oya and Kotmale oya.The river reaches the Bay of Bengal on the southwestern side of Trincomalee Bay. The bay includes the first of a number submarine canyons, making Trincomalee one of the finest deep-sea harbors in the world. The river and its tributaries are dammed at several locations to allow irrigation in the dry zone, with almost of land irrigated. Production of hydroelectricity from six dams of the Mahaweli system supplies more than 40% of Sri Lanka's electricity needs. One of the many sources of the river is the Kotmale Oya.    What is the relationship between 'kotmale oya' and 'sri lanka'?","output":"The Kotmale Oya has a significant relationship with Sri Lanka in various aspects, including geographical, historical, cultural, and economic dimensions.  Geographically, the Kotmale Oya, as the longest tributary of the Mahaweli River, plays an essential role in Sri Lanka's water system. It originates in the Horton Plains and covers a broad expanse of 58,534 hectares, passing through several ancient villages and tea plantations. As one of the major contributors to the Mahaweli River, it contributes to the largest drainage basin in Sri Lanka, which covers almost one-fifth of the country's total land area. Historically, the Kotmale Oya has been an integral part of Sri Lankan history and its people. King Dutugemunu, a notable historical figure in the country, spent his youth in the region surrounding the Kotmale Oya. The river also played a significant role in the development of ancient villages and settlements in the area, with communities relying on it for water supply and cultivation purposes. Culturally, the river has been at the heart of traditional Sri Lankan customs and practices. The local people have long depended on the Kotmale Oya for irrigating their crops, fishing, and other day-to-day activities. This close connection with the river has fostered a deep appreciation for water resources, as well as the need for effective water management among the Sri Lankan communities. Economically, the Kotmale Oya has contributed to Sri Lanka's energy sector and agricultural development through the Kotmale Dam, which was constructed between 1979 and 1985 as part of a hydro-electric project within the Accelerated Mahaweli Ganga scheme. By tapping into the hydropower potential of the Kotmale Oya, the dam helps generate a significant portion of Sri Lanka's electricity, addressing the country's energy needs. The dam also plays an essential role in the country's irrigation and flood control, ensuring a reliable water supply for agricultural activities in the dry zone. In conclusion, the relationship between the Kotmale Oya and Sri Lanka is multifaceted, encompassing geographical, historical, cultural, and economic aspects. As a vital water resource, the Kotmale Oya has significantly contributed to the country's development and shaped the lives of the Sri Lankan people throughout the history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tchaikovsky had already promised his Characteristic Dances (then called Dances of the Hay Maidens) from his opera The Voyevoda to the society. In submitting the manuscript (and perhaps mindful of Cui's review of the cantata), Tchaikovsky included a note to Balakirev that ended with a request for a word of encouragement should the Dances not be performed.At this point The Five as a unit was dispersing. Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov wanted to remove themselves from Balakirev's influence, which they now found stifling, and go in their individual directions as composers. Balakirev might have sensed a potential new disciple in Tchaikovsky. He explained in his reply from Saint Petersburg that while he preferred to give his opinions in person and at length to press his points home, he was couching his reply \\"with complete frankness\\", adding, with a deft touch of flattery, that he felt that Tchaikovsky was \\"a fully fledged artist\\" and that he looked forward to discussing the piece with him on an upcoming trip to Moscow.These letters set the tone for Tchaikovsky's relationship with Balakirev over the next two years. At the end of this period, in 1869, Tchaikovsky was a 28-year-old professor at the Moscow Conservatory. Having written his first symphony and an opera, he next composed a symphonic poem entitled Fatum. Initially pleased with the piece when Nikolai Rubinstein conducted it in Moscow, Tchaikovsky dedicated it to Balakirev and sent it to him to conduct in Saint Petersburg. Fatum received only a lukewarm reception there. Balakirev wrote a detailed letter to Tchaikovsky in which he explained what he felt were defects in Fatum but also gave some encouragement. He added that he considered the dedication of the music to him as \\"precious to me as a sign of your sympathy towards me—and I feel a great weakness for you\\".... Answer:","output":"Tchaikovsky's opera, The Voyevoda, contained a piece that had been promised to the Russian Music Society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Hack and slash or hack and slay, abbreviated H&S or HnS, refers to a type of gameplay that emphasizes combat. The term \\"hack and slash\\" was originally used to describe a play style in tabletop role-playing games, carrying over from there to MUDs, MMORPGs, and role-playing video games. In console- and arcade-style video games, the usage specifically implies a focus on combat with hand-to-hand weapons as opposed to guns. The term is often written in hyphenated form and with the conjunction contracted, e.g. hack-and-slash, hack 'n' slay.  - Redwood City is a city on the San Francisco Peninsula in Northern California's Bay Area, approximately south of San Francisco, and north of San Jose. Redwood City's history spans its earliest inhabitation by the Ohlone people to being a port for lumber and other goods. The county seat of San Mateo County, it is the home of several technology companies such as Box, Oracle, Evernote, Wealthfront, and Electronic Arts. At the 2010 census, the city had a population of 76,815. The Port of Redwood City is the only deepwater port on San Francisco Bay south of San Francisco. Redwood City is the location of the San Mateo County Jail, for both women and men. The Malibu Grand Prix long time landmark was recently demolished along with the city's only Mini Golf, Go-Kart, Video Game Arcade, and Batting Cages. Malibu Grand Prix's previous location is currently the construction site of a new additional Jail and Inmate housing facility. The city has a motto \\"Climate Best By Government Test\\" which is a reference to it being one of the top German scouted scientific climates and the city was one of the locations mapped by them during their testing and data collection. The Hetch Hetchy water pipeline runs through Redwood City and supplies a vast majority of the surrounding area with low grain (+/ 3 grains) rated water.  - Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile.  - Ensemble Studios was a video game developer initially established in 1995 as an independent company by Tony Goodman, Rick Goodman and John Boog-Scott, but was acquired by Microsoft in 2001 and operated as an internal studio until 2009, when it was officially disbanded. Ensemble developed many real-time strategy games, including the \\"Age of Empires\\" game series, \\"Age of Mythology\\", and \\"Halo Wars\\". In addition to game development, Ensemble Studios also made the Genie Game Engine used in \\"Age of Empires\\", \\"\\", and \\"\\". The studio sold 20 million games and was worth an estimated 500 million.  - Diablo II : Lord of Destruction is an expansion pack for the hack and slash action role - playing game Diablo II. Unlike the original Diablo '  s expansion pack , Diablo : Hellfire , it is a first - party expansion developed by Blizzard North . More than a standard expansion , Lord of Destruction not only added content in the form of two new character classes , new weapons and an addition of a fifth act , but also dramatically revamped the gameplay of the existing Diablo II for solo and especially multiplayer .  - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country.  - Blizzard North was the Bay Area division of Blizzard Entertainment, known for its \\"Diablo\\" series. The studio was originally based in Redwood City, California, before moving a short distance away to San Mateo, with Blizzard proper being based in Irvine, southern California.  - Big Huge Games is a video game developer located in Timonium, Maryland. The company was founded in February 2000 by four veteran game industry developers: Tim Train, David Inscore, Jason Coleman and Brian Reynolds (lead designer of \\"Alpha Centauri\\", et al.). Their first game, \\"Rise of Nations\\", was a critical and commercial hit. The original studio became defunct in May 2012, but the name \\"Big Huge Games\\" was later reacquired by Reynolds and Train for their new venture (previously known as SecretNewCo). The revived studio released the mobile game \\"DomiNations\\" on Android and iOS in April 2015.  - In , Falcom released \\"Sorcerian Forever\\" for Microsoft Windows-based PCs. In , Falcom released \\"Sorcerian Original\\", a remake of Sorcerian for Microsoft Windows-based PCs. In addition, console versions of Sorcerian with somewhat differing content from their PC counterparts were developed: A version for the Mega Drive was developed by Sega, a version for the PC Engine CD was developed by Victor Musical Industries, and a version for the Dreamcast was developed by Victor Interactive Software.  - Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. is an American video game developer and publisher based in Irvine, California, and is currently a subsidiary of American company Activision Blizzard. The company was founded on February 8, 1991, under the name Silicon & Synapse by three graduates of the University of California, Los Angeles: Michael Morhaime, Frank Pearce, and Allen Adham. The company originally concentrated primarily on the creation of game ports for other studios before beginning development of their own software in 1993 with the development of games like \\"Rock n' Roll Racing\\" and \\"The Lost Vikings\\". In 1994 the company became Chaos Studios, then Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. after being acquired by distributor Davidson & Associates.  - An expansion pack, expansion set, supplement, or simply expansion is an addition to an existing role-playing game, tabletop game or video game. These add-ons usually add new game areas, weapons, objects, characters and/or an extended storyline to complete an already released game. While board game expansions are typically designed by the original creator, video game developers sometimes contract out development of the expansion pack to a third-party company, (see \\"\\" for \\"Diablo\\"), it may choose to develop the expansion itself or it may do both (Ensemble Studios developed the real-time strategy game Age of Empires III and the first expansion called itself, but contracted Big Huge Games for the second expansion pack, the Asian Dynasties). Board games and tabletop RPGs may have been marketing expansions since the 1970s, and video games have been releasing expansion packs since the 1980s, early examples being the \\"Dragon Slayer\\" games \\"\\" and \\"Sorcerian\\".  - Age of Empires III is a real-time strategy video game developed by Microsoft Corporation's Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft Game Studios. The Mac version was ported over and developed and published by Destineer's MacSoft Games. The PC version was released on October 18, 2005 in North America and November 4, 2005 in Europe, while the Mac version was released on November 21, 2006 in North America and September 29, 2006 in Europe. An N-Gage version of the game developed by Glu Mobile was released on April 28, 2009.

Fact 2: Like a mushroom, it lacks chlorophyll and is nonphotosynthetic.  Given the two facts above, mushrooms are nonphotosynthetic and cannot what? The answer is:","output":"Given Fact 1 and Fact 2, mushrooms, being a type of fungi, are nonphotosynthetic and cannot perform the process of photosynthesis to produce their own food like plants can. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose (sugar) and oxygen, which serves as a primary source of energy for their growth and metabolic processes. Since mushrooms lack chlorophyll, which is the green pigment present in plants that plays a critical role in capturing light energy for photosynthesis, they are unable to produce their own food through this process. Instead, mushrooms and other fungi obtain their nutrients through other means, primarily by decomposing organic matter present in their environment, such as dead plant and animal material. Fungi secrete enzymes that break down complex organic compounds in their surroundings into simpler compounds, which can then be easily absorbed by the fungal cells, providing them the essential nutrients required for their growth and reproduction. This nutritional adaptation is known as saprophytism, and it is an essential ecological role that fungi play in recycling nutrients and maintaining the balance in various ecosystems. Some fungi also form mutualistic relationships with plants, such as mycorrhizal fungi, which form a symbiotic association with plant roots and assist in nutrient exchange. The fungi take up nutrients from the soil and provide them to the plant, while the plant supplies the fungi with carbohydrates and other organic compounds. In summary, given the two facts above, mushrooms are nonphotosynthetic and cannot perform the process of photosynthesis to produce their own food as plants can. Instead, they acquire nutrients through decomposing organic matter or mutualistic relationships with other organisms, contributing to nutrient cycling and ecosystem stability."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It kept me reading it which is usually a challenge. I however did not enjoy it. Reading about a girl who gets hooked on drugs and is dumb about it all is not interesting to me. I did cry though once while reading it. I also wonder what she thinks about people reading her diary. I know i would never want people to read my diary after i die even if it is to inform the public about how things really are. Overall i didnt like the book and i wouldnt recommend it to anyone unless they like to read a drug addicts diary when you can sum it up by saying she does drugs, has sex, tries to clean her life up but fails every time and ends up overdosing and dieing. Answer:","output":"The given review would most likely decrease the chances of buying the product for several reasons. While the review does mention a few positive aspects, such as the book being engaging enough to keep the reader reading, the majority of the feedback is negative, which would likely dissuade a potential buyer. Firstly, the reviewer highlights that they did not enjoy the book, which is a strong statement that could negatively influence a prospective buyer's opinion. The fact that they found the book's subject matter uninteresting and the protagonist's choices frustrating could lead the reader to question whether they would find the book enjoyable as well. Secondly, the reviewer mentions that the book made them cry only \\"once,\\" which could be interpreted as the book lacking emotional depth or not being as impactful as the potential buyer might hope. This may decrease the likelihood of purchasing the book, as some readers might prefer emotionally compelling stories. Additionally, the reviewer questions the ethics of sharing the protagonist's diary and whether they would be comfortable with it if they were in the same situation. This could make potential buyers consider whether they should support the publication of such material, undermining the motive for purchasing the book. Lastly, the reviewer's overall recommendation is negative, as they explicitly state that they would not recommend the book to anyone except those who specifically enjoy reading about drug addicts' experiences. This straightforward and negative recommendation from the reviewer would likely be a deciding factor in decreasing the chances of buying the product. In summary, while there are a few positive aspects mentioned in the review, such as the engaging nature of the book, the overall negative feedback and the reviewer's reluctancy to recommend it would likely decrease the likelihood of a potential buyer purchasing the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who composed seven operas in three years at Brunswick? , can you please find it?   Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\". Answer:","output":"The last name of the person who composed seven operas in three years at Brunswick is Keiser. Reinhard Keiser was a German composer, born in 1674, and became the musical director at the Gänsemarkt opera house in Hamburg."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Step 2: Identifying the main characteristics of a biscuit and a chocolate bar A biscuit is typically a small baked good that can have a variety of textures, such as soft or crisp, and can contain additional ingredients such as dried fruit or nuts. A chocolate bar, on the other hand, is typically a solid confectionery made primarily from cocoa solids, cocoa butter, and sugar, which may also include additional ingredients such as nuts, fruit, or caramel. Step 3: Comparing the properties of a Club to the characteristics of a biscuit and a chocolate bar A Club has a biscuit base, which aligns with the definition of a biscuit. However, the chocolate coating could suggest that it's also a chocolate bar. So, based on the properties of a Club and the characteristics of biscuits and chocolate bars, I would classify a Club as primarily a biscuit due to its biscuit base, but with elements of a chocolate bar, as it is coated in chocolate.

Write a title for this article: CERRETO, Italy — Think of an Italian summer and you think of azure seas, sun-splashed beaches, cool mountains cupping dark lakes and overheated crowds of tourists investigating every museum and ancient church. Things are different in Tuscany as well as in Umbria, where I live, for part of the year. Every local community, no matter how small, puts on its own summer festa, or festival. Some are based on religion: Each village has its own patron saint to celebrate with a day of services and parades followed by a night of feasting, dancing and, of course, fireworks. Then there are sagras, festivals dedicated to food. Each community chooses a specialty food and organizes its festivities around it. There is the sagra del cinghiale (feast of roast boar), the sagra dell'oca (goose), della lepre (hare), degli umbrichelli (fat local spaghetti), della castagna (chestnut) and della lumaca (snail). There's even a sagra dedicated to bombolone, a custard-filled doughnut. Last summer, I decided it was time to get out and party like an Italian. I wanted to see how much fun I could have without spending much money or fighting my way down the clogged autostrada to sweltering beaches in the annual rush al mare (to the sea). I started at Cerreto, the hamlet I see from my kitchen window. Cerreto has a single street, no shop, no church and a school that closed decades ago. But for seven nights every August, it stages its Sagra della Focaccia (bread) that brings together more than 7,000 visitors to eat, drink, dance and make merry. That would be a challenge for a large professional catering operation, never mind a community with a population of 200. My friend Bernardo Barberani stopped by the first night. He is a third-generation award-winning local winemaker. He was carrying a chilled bottle of his Orvieto Classico and poured some into my plastic cup. He said that when he was young, his mother never let him go to sagras, \\"because the hygiene was a bit lax — people cooked outdoors around open fires.\\" Now, Barberani said regulations have been tightened and sagras are safe places to eat. Like other Italian dishes that now fetch premium prices in Manhattan and L.A., focaccia was once the poorest food of the poorest people; it's just bread made with flour and water. It used to be baked on the hearth in the evening under the ashes of the dying fire. Traditionally, when half-cooked, the bread was split open and stuffed with leftovers before being put back into the fire to get gooey. The Sagra della Focaccia re-creates this by offering a variety of fillings. I tried the sausage with arugula (about 6). The sausage juices soaked into the bread, which my husband, Mike, and I washed down with a bottle of Barberani's wine (another 6). Mike had the caprese, but there were plenty of other choices, including tuna or Nutella. By now, cars were driving slowly up the hill to park in a field set aside for the purpose, and the piazza was filling. Any fears I'd had that we would feel out of place soon evaporated. Italians are brilliant at making everyone feel welcome, and the communal tables mean you can mingle or not as you choose. There were British and American accents to be heard too, belonging to local expats and others. Typically, festas and sagras are run by committees. Giacomo Bonaccorsi, the local geometra, a cross between an architect and a surveyor, is a stalwart of Cerreto's core group. Guided by Bonaccorsi, I stepped behind the scenes to watch. Women made the dough, forming circles the size of dinner plates that they passed on to be baked in one of six wood-burning ovens. Franco, the retired village postman, was melting in the heat as he baked focaccia after focaccia. Small boys collected the freshly baked bread and took it to old men in red hats who sliced and quartered the loaves. Young women, giggling in their white hairnets and latex gloves, stood around a huge square table. They snatched up the fresh bread and stuffed the triangles for girls to stack on paper trays and take out to the waiting line. Threading in and out, children in Focaccia festival T-shirts tossed rubbish into black trash bags, their squad marshaled by Big Steve, formerly of Morgan Stanley in New York and now a Cerreto resident. \\"There's nothing like this in the States. It's so community,\\" he said, swiping another crumpled paper plate into his sack. No one gets paid except with food and drinks. All the profits are plowed back into the festival, which is how organizers built the huge piazza and six wood-burning ovens. With the feeding of the 1,000 that evening well underway it was time for the evening's second half — music and dancing. There's a different band every night of the festival, all of them professional touring groups. The bands draw the crowds and are the biggest item in the budget — 1,000 to 3,500 a night for a lineup of saxophones, dueling guitars, accordion, drums and two or three female singers in skimpy sequins. And Italians can dance. Everyone from tiny tots to anziani (senior citizens) knows his or her cha-cha from his two-step, and many are truly expert. As soon as the night's group, Vitamin Dance, struck up in a blast of synthesizers, guitars and flashing lights, the older couples dashed onto the dance floor, the grandchildren jiggled around the edges and the teenagers slunk off to their own alternative-rock disco set up in a lower part of the piazza. We retreated home to watch the closing fireworks, a brilliant, banging display, from our terrace. For the next few weeks, I dragged Mike to every nearby festa and sagra. They were easy to find, inexpensive, welcoming and a lot of fun. Although few were on the scale of Cerreto's, some had twists such as the village that staged a festa Aug. 10 for the night of San Lorenzo, traditionally when you see shooting stars. The festa started at 10 p.m. when the village policeman turned off the street lights. Flaming torches lighted on the rough stone walls returned the village to the Middle Ages. Scientists from Perugia set up two powerful telescopes for everyone to try. We ended by eating free pasta and drinking red wine. By then, no one minded that the shooting stars had been conspicuously absent. Ferragosto, on Aug. 15, is the Italian midsummer, with festas everywhere on that day. My village of Civitella del Lago stages an annual dinner in the street outside the church (15 a head for three courses plus wine), followed by dancing to an accordion trio. Finally, everyone troops to the belvedere overlooking the valley to watch a truly spectacular fireworks display, better than I've seen in London and New York on New Year's Eve. Enrico Montoni, who has been organizing festas in Civitella for years, said: \\"People will only give money if they know there are going to be fireworks.\\" Italians understand that fireworks are a show that starts slowly and builds to a crescendo so loud that you can't tell where the noise starts and your body ends. As I watched the display, I found myself next to Tobias Oberer, originally from Switzerland but now living locally. We talked about France, where you can buy cheap, handsome properties but where the villages are deserted, the populace long decamped to the cities. \\"Then you come here and just look around you,\\" Tobias said, gesturing at the buzzing crowd on the belvedere. \\"These are living communities. Old, young, rich, poor, fat, thin, everyone is here together with no barriers. This is the heart and soul of Italy.\\"","output":"Discovering Italy's Summer Festivals and Celebrations In this article, we get to explore the wonderful summer festivals and celebrations held in small towns and villages in Italy.

It was too hot too cook in the kitchen, so Mom decided we’d grill hot dogs & stuff outside. But we needed some things so Dad was elected to go to the grocery store. This turned out to be a big production; Dad was trying remember what all was needed without writing a list, and Mom kept adding things even as he was trying to leave. Finally, he got in the car and drove off. Mom & I had just turned around and sat down at our picnic table when all of sudden here was Dad pulling back into the driveway. He’d apparently just driven around the block & came right back. Mom & I looked at each other and smirked- she was thinking the same thing I was: “what’d he forget this time?” But then Dad got out of the car.. and on his face was the look. In my young life, I’d never seen that look before, but it chilled me to the core and I just knew something bad was coming. Mom knew it too; the smirk quickly left her face as Dad came over and said.. “Mom.. I hope I heard this wrong.. but on the radio they said a woman drowned at the lake.. I hope I’m wrong, I barely caught the name, but I think they said it was your sister..” The cookout was forgotten; we went inside & started making phone calls, and unfortunately it was indeed my aunt. She & her family had gone swimming to cool off; apparently she’d gotten a cramp or something and gone under while nobody was looking, and by the time she was missed it was too late. To this day, my Mom is miffed at some family members that we had to find out that way (she was pretty close to this sister so she feels someone should’ve called before it got on the news) but as for me, I will never forget that look on my Dad’s face. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the aunt drowned, how does dad feel?

The phrase was translated verbatim while keeping the correct grammatical structure of Finnish. Then, \\"and we hope\\" was translated as \\"ja toivomme,\\". Here, the conjunction and simple phrase were translated directly into Finnish without any changes. Next, \\"that issues such as Transnistria and Georgia\\" was translated into \\"että asioista, kuten Transnistriasta ja Georgiasta\\". In Finnish, the word for 'issues' often gets translated as 'asioista', which more directly translates back to English as 'about issues'. Note that the construction 'kuten' was used to mean 'such as'. Finally, \\"will also be discussed at this summit.\\" was translated as \\"keskustellaan myös tällä huippukokouksessa.\\" 'Will be discussed' was translated as 'keskustellaan', which is an expression used to convey a future passive action in Finnish.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What piece did Bizet play the piano version of for a select audience?, using the article: As life in Paris returned to normal, in June 1871, Bizet's appointment as chorus-master at The Opéra was seemingly confirmed by its director, Émile Perrin. Bizet was due to begin his duties in October, but on 1 November, the post was assumed by Hector Salomon. In her biography of Bizet, Mina Curtiss surmises that he either resigned or refused to take up the position as a protest against what he thought was the director's unjustified closing of Ernest Reyer's opera Erostrate after only two performances. Bizet resumed work on Clarissa Harlowe and Grisélidis, but plans for the latter to be staged at the Opéra-Comique fell through, and neither work was finished; only fragments of their music survive. Bizet's other completed works in 1871 were the piano duet entitled Jeux d'enfants, and a one-act opera, Djamileh, which opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. It was poorly staged and incompetently sung; at one point the leading singer missed 32 bars of music. It closed after 11 performances, not to be heard again until 1938. On 10 July Geneviève gave birth to the couple's only child, a son, Jacques. Bizet's next major assignment came from Carvalho, who was now managing Paris' Vaudeville theatre and wanted incidental music for Alphonse Daudet's play L'Arlésienne. When the play opened on 1 October, the music was dismissed by critics as too complex for popular taste. However, encouraged by Reyer and Massenet, Bizet fashioned a four-movement suite from the music, which was performed under Pasdeloup on 10 November to an enthusiastic reception. In the winter of 1872–73, Bizet supervised preparations for a revival of the still-absent Gounod's Roméo et Juliette at the Opéra-Comique. Relations between the two had been cool for some years, but Bizet responded positively to his former mentor's request for help, writing: \\"You were the beginning of my life as an artist. I spring from you\\".In June 1872, Bizet informed Galabert: \\"I have just been ordered to compose three acts for the Opéra-Comique. [Henri] Meilhac and [Ludovic]..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The answer to the question, \\"What piece did Bizet play the piano version of for a select audience?\\" is not present in the given article.

A: Choices: (i). 40 %; (ii). 60 %; (iii). 100%; (iv). 50%; A:","output":"To determine how much unpolarized light a polarized filter blocks, we need to understand the properties of both unpolarized light and a polarizing filter. Step 1: Understand the properties of unpolarized light. Unpolarized light consists of light waves that vibrate in all directions perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Essentially, there is no specific direction of the electric field vector in unpolarized light. Step 2: Understand the properties of a polarizing filter. A polarizing filter is designed to only allow light waves with a certain orientation to pass through. It blocks other light waves that have different orientations. Specifically, it only allows light waves vibrating in one specific direction to pass through. Step 3: Determine how much light passes through the filter. When unpolarized light passes through a polarizing filter, half of the light waves are allowed to pass through, and the other half is blocked. This is because, on average, 50% of the light waves will have the correct orientation to pass through the filter, and 50% will not. Based on this information, we can now answer the question: How much unpolarized light does a polarized filter block?

The earliest origins of the sport date back to the Middle Ages in England, Scotland, France and the Netherlands. The game can be played on a grass field or a turf field as well as an indoor board surface. Each team plays with eleven players, including the goalie. Players use sticks made out of wood, carbon fibre, fibre glass or a combination of carbon fibre and fibre glass in different quantities (with the higher carbon fibre stick being more expensive and less likely to break) to hit a round, hard, plastic ball. The length of the stick depends on the player's individual height. Only one end of the stick is allowed to be used. Goalies often have a different kind of stick, however they can also use an ordinary field hockey stick. The specific goal-keeping sticks have another curve at the end of the stick, this is to give them more surface area to save the ball. The uniform consists of shin guards, shoes, shorts, a mouth guard and a jersey. Today, the game is played globally, with particular popularity throughout Western Europe, the Indian subcontinent, Southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and parts of the United States (such as Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania). Field Hockey is the national sport of India and Pakistan. The term \\"field hockey\\" is used primarily in Canada and the United States where ice hockey is more popular.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: Place items you don’t use often inside your cabinets or store them outside your kitchen if you’re short on space. Only store items you frequently use on the countertop. This makes it easier for you to work in your kitchen every day.  For example, you might keep your microwave on the counter if you use it daily, but put away your toaster if you only use it once a week. If you’re short on cabinet space, place any decorative items you’d like to display in your kitchen in an out-of-the-way location, such as on top of your cabinets. Don’t clutter your cabinets and countertops with decorations. Designate which areas need to remain empty, such as your food prep area. Then, find a spot for items you use daily, such as your microwave, coffee pot, dish rack, and cutting board. Make sure you know where your power sockets are before you decide where to place your items. You’ll need to put your appliances in a place where they can be plugged in. This includes items like your stirring spoon, spatula, spaghetti server, and slotted spoon. Only place items you use often in your utensil jar. Store items you rarely use but want to keep in a utensil drawer. A large jar or canister works great for storing your utensils. As another option, you can use a clean vase. Keep only the knives you actually use, such as your chopping and paring knives. Let go of your extra knives and knife block, which can take up too much space on your countertop.  If you have knives you use occasionally, store them in a drawer. Donate your unused knives and knife block. A tray gives you more space around your sink. Place your soap, dish sponge, and towel on the tray. Then, place your sink stopper and bottle scrubber below the shelf. You can find an over the sink shelf for your kitchen. Alternatively, get creative and use a cake stand as a shelf! It's normal for your oil or honey to drip, making your bottle sticky. This can gum up your cabinet or countertop and make your other items sticky! Place your oil on a small dish or tray that you can wash often. It's common to store un-refrigerated produce on your countertop. Keep your produce together by placing it in a stylish bowl or basket. Then, set it on the counter where you can easily access it. Put your fruit where you can easily grab them for a snack. If space is an issue, you might place your vegetables farther back on the counter until you need them to prepare your meals.","output":"In order to maintain an organized and functional kitchen, it is crucial to store items appropriately and strategically. Prioritize placing frequently used items on countertops, while reserving cabinet or off-kitchen space for items used less often. It is important to designate certain areas for specific purposes, such as a food preparation area, and to arrange your appliances near power sockets for practicality. Careful consideration should be given to the storage of utensils, as only those regularly used should be kept in a utensil jar or canister for easy access, while others can be stored in a drawer. When it comes to knives, only keep those you use, such as chopping and paring knives, and donate unused knives and knife blocks to save countertop space. To further optimize your kitchen organization, use a tray to store items around your sink, including soap, dish sponges, and towels. Consider investing in an over-the-sink shelf or repurposing a cake stand as a shelf for added space. Frequent cleaning of surfaces and containers can help avoid messes from sticky substances, such as oil or honey, and using a small dish or tray under sticky bottles can prevent residue from accumulating. Storing produce in a stylish bowl or basket on the countertop can make it easily accessible and add visual appeal. Ensure that frequently consumed fruits are within easy reach, and if space is limited, move vegetables to the back of the counter until they are needed for meal preparation. Ultimately, thoughtful organization and storage practices can greatly improve the efficiency and appearance of your kitchen."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A funeral for Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and a noted foreign policy expert and thinker, will be held Friday at St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Brzezinski died May 26 in Virginia. He was 86. In a statement, Carter called Brzezinski “a superb public servant” as well as “brilliant, dedicated and loyal.” Along with Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski helped shape U.S. foreign policy with a lasting impact, while also serving as an adviser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy. One of his most well-known accomplishments came in 1978, when Brzezinski helped President Carter reach an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to secure the Camp David peace accords between the two countries. He also was involved in making other major U.S. foreign policy decisions during the Carter administration, including negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty, arming mujahedin in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet invaders and planning a failed mission to rescue 52 American hostages held in Iran. Alexander Vershbow, a former deputy secretary general of NATO and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told VOA Brzezinski's wisdom also guided U.S. and NATO policy in the post-Cold War period. “On one hand, listening to the appeals of countries like Poland, like Czechoslovakia, like Hungary, to become part of the Western family, which they were denied 70 years ago ... but also reaching out to Russia, and trying to help Russia become an integral part of the European family, the common European house, as [former Soviet leader Mikhail] Gorbachev described it,” Vershbow said. Following his work in the White House, Brzezinski continued to be an influential voice on foreign policy matters. He served as a counselor and trustee at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a professor at Johns Hopkins University.

Wilson believes that the island holds vast untapped deposits of oil, a potential fortune which he is determined to secure for Petrox. Unknown to Wilson or the crew, Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges), a primate paleontologist who wants to see the island for himself, has stowed away on the expedition's vessel, the Petrox Explorer. Prescott reveals himself when he warns the crew that the cloud bank may be caused by some unknown, and potentially dangerous, phenomenon. Wilson orders Prescott locked up, believing him to be a corporate spy from a rival oil company. While being escorted to lock-up, Prescott spots a life raft which, upon inspection, is found to be carrying the beautiful and unconscious Dwan (Jessica Lange). After conducting a thorough background check on the 'spy', Wilson realizes that he is telling the truth and appoints Prescott as the expedition's official photographer, requesting that, due to his medical training, he be present when Dwan revives. When she does regain consciousness, Dwan states that she is an aspiring actress who was aboard a director's yacht, which suddenly and inexplicably exploded. When the Petrox Explorer finally arrives at the island, the team discovers a primitive tribe of natives who live within the confines of a gigantic wall, apparently built to protect them from a mysterious god-like creature known as Kong. The tribal chief shows an immediate interest in the blonde Dwan, offering to trade several of the native women for her, an offer firmly rejected by Jack. The team then learn that while the island does indeed contain large deposits of oil, it is of such low quality that it is unusable. Later that night, the natives secretly board the ship and kidnap Dwan, drugging her and offering her as a sacrifice to Kong. Appearing from the jungle, Kong, an enormous ape, grabs Dwan...

The Choke starts as a rock band known as The Choke prepare for a gig at a nightclub called 'Club 905' owned & run by Guy Johnson (Andrew Parker). Lead singer Dylan (Sean Cook) & guitar player Mike (Jason McKee) plan to tell the other band members, bass player London (Brooke Bailey) & drummer Nancy (Tom Olson), that they are both going solo & their services won't be needed any longer. Once at the club Dylan prepares but Mike doesn't show up & the gig turns into a disaster. Then just as the band think things couldn't get any worse they find a dead body in the cellar, that all the doors have been locked so they can't get out & that they can't trust anyone as a mysterious killer begins picking them off one-by-one... Produced & directed by Juan A. Mas The Choke is a standard by-the-numbers teen slasher that really doesn't have anything going for it. The script by Jessica Dolan & Susannah Lowber (not too many horror films out there penned by ladies...) has some surprisingly good character's in it & some nifty dialogue but while it's much better than a lot of modern shot on a camcorder type horror in that respect it's so slow & boring that even a few interesting character's can't come anywhere close to saving it. As one would expect all the usual teen slasher clichés are used, from the isolated location the victims can't escape from, the cast of good looking teenagers who keep splitting up, a few murders & a really poor twist ending that tries to mimic something like Scream (1996) & be surprising but doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you think about it logically (they couldn't have done some of the things they were supposed to) & to make matters even worse I guessed who the killer was fairly early on & even though I don't want to boast I was spot on. Then there's the fact that the makers of The Choke felt that it's audience would be entertained by showing endless (well it feels endless while watching it) scenes of teenagers walking around dark corridors doing nothing in particular, I am sorry but there is only so many scenes like this that I can take before it starts to become tedious. The kill count is low, at first they all decide to stick together (good idea) but then they all just randomly decide to split up & go their separate ways (bad idea when there's a killer on the loose), the pace is lethargic, the kill scenes are unimaginative & to top it all off the twist ending is poor. Director Mas does alright, the film looks OK for the most part although there are the odd occasions where he uses some annoying post production editing technique like slow motion or frame skipping. The gore levels aren't really up to scratch, there's some blood splatter, a guy with a hole in his chest, a few dead bodies & someone impaled on some metal poles. Most of the kills happen off screen with the axe kill at the end a good example of the film not actually showing anything. Since the film is about a rock band there's quite a rock orientated soundtrack with some truly horrible, horrible rock songs used on it. I am sorry rock fans but to my ears this crap is just noise pollution. It's not scary, there's no real atmosphere & the lack of blood & gore is just inexcusable when the rest of the film is so bad. With a supposed budget of about 1,000,000 The Choke is well made with reasonable production values, it looks cheap to be sure but not as cheap as many low budget horror films look. Shot in a place called Spokane in Washington apparently. The acting is one of the films strongest points as it's generally pretty good all round, I mean no-one is going to win an Oscar but it ain't half bad. The Choke is a throughly routine Scream style teen slasher that has one of the weakest twist endings ever & a criminal lack of blood, gore, violence, nudity & dead bodies.

A: Possible answers: A. biologists. B. geologists. C. anthropologist. D. paleontologists. Answer:","output":"D. paleontologists. Scientists who find and study fossils are called paleontologists. Paleontology is a branch of science that deals with the study of prehistoric life, particularly through the examination of plant and animal fossils. Fossils provide valuable insights into the past and serve as critical evidence to understand the evolutionary history of various organisms. By studying fossils, paleontologists can learn a great deal about the characteristics and features of extinct species, as well as how these species changed and evolved over time. This information is useful for constructing a timeline of the Earth's biological history and helps us understand how different species have adapted to changing environments. In the case of the horse mentioned in the paragraph, the fossil record provides a comprehensive overview of the evolutionary history of the horse. Through the study of various horse fossils, paleontologists have been able to observe changes in the horse's size, limb structure, and dentition (teeth) that occurred over millions of years. These changes reveal the process of adaptation and natural selection that took place as the horse evolved to better survive in its environment. This understanding of the horse's evolution contributes to our knowledge of the broader history of life on Earth. In summary, paleontologists play a crucial role in uncovering the past by finding and studying fossils.

Answer:","output":"If cheaper coal prices occur, it would likely lead to the purchase and use of more coal for the energy production process. However, the amount of coal mixed with hot air in the boiler would still depend on the operational settings and efficiency of the system. The direct process of coal particles mixing with hot air will not be directly affected by the cheaper coal prices, as the immediate reaction and proportion of coal and air mixture remain the same. That said, the perturbation might have an indirect effect on the process. Cheaper coal prices could incentivize power plant operators to produce more energy, leading to increased coal consumption and, potentially, an increase in the rate at which the coal-air mixture is processed to meet higher demands for energy production. This could potentially lead to adjustments in the operational settings, which may affect the coal-air mixture indirectly."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Manchester United made a formal complaint to FIFA about Real Madrid's interest in Ronaldo last month. Questioned about the protracted wrangle over the 23-year-old's future, Blatter told Sky News that the practice of binding players to lengthy contracts amounts to \\"modern slavery\\". Ronaldo himself later agreed with Blatter's assessment of his transfer standoff with Manchester United. United have vowed not to sell their star winger to Real Madrid, but Ronaldo has spoken of his desire to join the Spanish champions -- although he is yet to submit a transfer request.

Whoever beats Brazil wins the World Cup this summer. It’s that simple for me, for reasons I’ll explain in a moment, and Argentina and Portugal — with one massive caveat — are the two biggest challengers to the hosts. The caveat is whether Cristiano Ronaldo, the world’s best footballer, is fully fit and playing at his peak. If he is, and it’s a big if, then I think the Portuguese are capable of being the cat among the pigeons.Can you imagine a final that pits  Ronaldo on one side against the world’s second-best player, Lionel Messi, on the other? It would be a fantasy showdown. I for one would absolutely love to see that happen. Influence: Cristiano Ronaldo could lead Portugal to World Cup glory in Brazil this summer. Crucial: With Ronaldo in their team, Portugal could go all the way to the final in Rio De Janeiro. Tough: Portugal have been drawn in group G alongside Germany, Ghana and the USA. If you think Cristiano has an  enormous ego already, imagine what it would be like if he reached the World Cup final! As a big fan of his, as well as his friend, I relish the prospect of that spectacle. He’s a showman and this is the biggest show. People see his ego — and don’t get me wrong, Cristiano’s ego is gargantuan! — but that is his fuel. It’s his inspiration. He reads all the articles written comparing him with Messi. ‘How can they say Messi is better than me?’ he’ll ask. ‘I’ll prove that writer wrong.’ That’s his mindset. Driven. Self-obsessed in the most positive way. Always looking to improve. That’s why he has become what he is, through effort and determination. It didn’t all come naturally. He worked hard at technique and hitting the ball. He’s the hardest worker I’ve had the privilege to play alongside. He’s a great team-mate, a companionable man, always involved in the changing room. But when it’s time to work he’s passionate about what he does and his emotion comes out. Support: Hosts Brazil are among the favourites to be crowned world champions this summer. Heavyweights: Lionel Messi's Argentina team have been tipped to win the World Cup. Predictions: Rio Ferdinand is tipping Brazil to be victorious in the World Cup on home soil. People say he stole Gareth Bale’s thunder in the Champions League final. Eh? He took his shirt off. He’s got an unbelievable physique and his girlfriend is a supermodel, and someone’s criticising him for taking his shirt off? The exhibitionist is part of who he is. But away from the field of play he’s one of the nicest kids you could meet. He makes time for fans, he’ll sit around a table late into the night talking. He’s no lone wolf. He first came to our attention at Manchester United when we played Sporting Lisbon in 2003. By half-time he’d razzle-dazzled us and we were all in the dressing room asking: ‘Who the hell is this kid? We MUST sign him!’ And Sir Alex did. He arrived at Old Trafford with his tricks and his stepovers and his attitude. What a young showpony he was, wanting to look good, then be good, in that order. The wrong order. Fergie had a word or three over time, and so did Ronnie’s hugely influential compatriot, Carlos Queiroz, and we as team-mates let him know there needed to be an end product to his skills. Side by side: Rio Ferdinand and Ronaldo together in their Manchester United days. Upstaged? Cristiano Ronaldo took his shirt off after scoring a penalty in the Champions League final. Change:  Ronaldo left Sporting Lisbon in 2003 to join Manchester United, where he became a star. To his enormous credit, the penny dropped, and he took it all on board and started on his journey to become the world’s best. There are players who maybe have more natural talent and the penny never drops for them. You will have guessed by now that I’m a fan of CR7’s work! I hope for him that he has a standout World Cup. With him on fire, Portugal can make huge waves. Without him, they’re half a team or less. With my pragmatist’s hat on, and fearing that seven games could be a few too far for Portugal if Ronaldo isn’t 100 per cent physically well, I believe we’ll see a Brazil-Argentina final. And I think that Brazil, inspired by the maverick genius of Neymar, will be triumphant on home soil.I see Brazil overcoming Germany (if not Portugal) in one semi-final, and Argentina beating Spain in the other. I think Holland might struggle to get out of Group B, that Spain should win, because Chile are a fine team, although Robin van Persie is a match-winner. Colombia and Ivory Coast should come through Group C and England’s group are dealt with elsewhere: Italy plus one, basically. France win Group E for me, and Argentina take F, with Germany and  Portugal coming out of G and probably Belgium winning H. Pressure: Neymar is the poster boy of the World Cup and is expected to fire Brazil to glory. Tricky: 2010 finalists Spain and Netherlands have been drawn in the same group this time. Shining light: With Messi leading the line, Argentina have an number of attacking options. The Belgians should win their group, but they are a peculiar prospect in some ways. They could be the team everyone believes they are capable of being and reach the last eight or further. Or they could be the biggest burster of expectations because their youth and inexperience may tell at this level. Argentina have a strength in depth that means they could cope without Messi if they had to. It tells you something when a player of Carlos Tevez’s qualities didn’t even make the cut. Aside from Messi, they have Gonzalo Higuain, Sergio Aguero — the world’s best natural goalscorer in my book — as well as Angel Di Maria, one of the stars of the Champions League last season, and Ezequiel Lavezzi, and on and on. The one area of caution is defence, but it’s hardly shabby. As big an admirer of Spain as I have been in recent times, I do think this could be a tournament too far as age starts to tell. But they’ll still go far. But not as far as Brazil. The Confederations Cup victory last summer was a fillip that cannot be understated. They know now they can perform and win under that enormous home pressure. Sunning up: Juventus forward Carlos Tevez missed out on Argentina's World Cup squad. Dark horse: Chelsea playmaker Eden Hazard will lead Belgium's quest at the World Cup. In Neymar they have a player who bucks a common trend of great performances for club and indifferent games for country. He pulls on his Brazil shirt and shines. He is Brazil’s go-to guy for inspiration, and backing him up he has a cast awash with talent and no small amount of toughness, exemplified by Fernandinho, who is a top player. Ramires is a great athlete, so too Willian. Oscar will score and Hulk is a danger. Brazil’s Achilles heel for me is a lack of a traditional No 9 but they have enough elsewhere to compensate.

News article: A JANUARY GUIDE TO GALLERY HOPPING 57TH STREET BIRTHDAYS should be fun, and double birthdays doubly so. It so happens that both the Grace Borgenicht Gallery, now at 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, and the Terry Dintenfass Gallery, now at 50 West 57th Street, this year celebrate their 20th anniversaries. What better plan, they thought, than to mark the occasion jointly, by showing work by artists who had been with them throughout the 20 years of their existence? From there, the project ballooned. What if the figure 20 were accorded a decisive role, and not two but 20 galleries in all were to contribute to the birthday celebration at Borgenicht and Dintenfass? The criterion for admission would remain the same, and the shows would constitute an honor roll of mutual fidelity. The galleries in question represent almost every known tendency in art, and some of them have long passed the 20 years' minimum age. The Graham Gallery dates from 1857, for instance, the Kraushaar Gallery from 1885, the Pierre Matisse Gallery from 1931, the Midtown Gallery from 1931-32, the Willard Gallery from 1940, the Betty Parsons Gallery from 1946, the Janis Gallery from 1948 and so on. Each artist gets to show one early work and one late work. (The early ones are at Dintenfass, the later ones at Borgenicht, and both shows can be seen through Feb. 4.) Elayne H. Varian acted as guest curator, and the result certainly says something about fidelity in a context where fidelity is often thought to be in short supply. In particular the catalogue is one long love-in, with tributes heaped on all concerned. Those tributes are well deserved, as it happens, but do not guarantee a coherent exhibition. Loyalty proves nothing, in esthetic terms. Some of our best artists shop around among the dealers. Some of our best dealers have their piratical side. So there is simply no rationale whatever to these two shows, beyond the wish to give pleasure to a lot of good people, some of whom are distinctly more gifted than others. The exhibitions could be said to make most sense when the difference between early and late has something specific to tell us. Alice Neel's two portraits are an example of this. The ''Michael Auder'' of 1980 has a look of classical serenity, balance and refinement. The ''Robert Smithson'' of 1962 is almost identical in its pose, but a world away in all else. This could be a political prisoner awaiting interrogation, with a matching urgency in the brushwork and a pervading uneasiness in the drawing of shoulder and wrist. There is a striking difference, likewise, between Robert Gwathmey's straightforward botanical painting of 1966 and his ''Two Tables With Fruit'' of 1975, which could be labeled ''School of Helion'' without insult. Isabel Bishop manifests a less dramatic but no less significant evolution. Her ''Lunch Hour'' of 1939 is full of the niceties of social detail, whereas the students in her ''Variations on the Theme of Walking'' (1979) stride out like young gods who will never need to have a Social Security number. Many another conjunction of this kind can be made. Take the shows one piece at a time and feel free to skip, and you'll have a good time. Other 57th Street shows of interest: Anthony Caro (Andre Emmerich Gallery, 41 East 57th Street): Sculpture is like conducting an orchestra, in that the only way to learn it is to do it. There are sculptors like the short-lived Gaston Duchamp-Villon who have found favor with posterity on the basis of just five or six works, but they are the exception. The true professional sculptor is the sculptor who produces every day and, if possible, every hour of every day. Anthony Caro did not begin like that kind of sculptor. Many of the early metal works with which he made his name were laconic, fineboned structures, often large in scale, that took a big subject and said all that needed to be said about it. Definitive stat ements of that kind cannot be made every day. No one who is rethinking not only the aims of sculpture but also the mater ials of sculpture can produce on an industrial scale. But Caro has come a long way in the last 20 years. Completely at home in an idiom that is far from having exhausted its possibilities, he now feels able - or so it seems - to take a chance with materials that would once have seemed either taboo or irrelevant. Bronze is one of these. Caro got to be Caro by abandoning bronze and working with ready-made industrial material - material, as he once said, that had no art history in it. And now, more than 1,000 carefully catalogued sculptures later, he is back with bronze in his show of ''Bronze Screens and Table Sculptures,'' just as he was back with it not long ago at the Acquavella Galleries. Bronze is, of course, one of the most assertive of materials. To stop it from giving off a reek of art history is in itself an achievement. There is the further problem that whereas in 1962 a Caro looked like nothing that we had seen before, a Caro in 1982 is likely to look like another Caro, whether or not we see that as a compliment. So it is a considerable achievement that several of the smaller, lower, more ground-hugging new pieces in his show astonish us all over again by the energy and fertility of their invention.

Question: What is the capital of kentucky known for its bluegrass? Answer:","output":"The capital of Kentucky is Frankfort. It is famously known for its bluegrass, a type of grass common in many American lawns but especially associated with Kentucky due to its rich, fertile soil that is particularly ideal for this plant.  \\"Bluegrass\\" is also synonymous with a genre of music that originated in the region. The name for bluegrass music came from a band known as \\"Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys\\", who named themselves after Monroe's native state of Kentucky, the \\"Bluegrass State\\". The genre is known for its mix of old-time country, gospel, jug band, blues, and jazz and is characterized by quick tempos, high-pitched vocals, and vibrant narratives. In another context, Kentucky is known for its Bluegrass Region, where you'll find some of the most picturesque landscapes of the state, rolling acres of pastureland, and some of the world's finest horse farms. The region's limestone-rich soil has produced superior pasture land that has made it a center for breeding quality livestock, particularly thoroughbred horses. Furthermore, the Kentucky State Capitol located in Frankfort is a historical and architectural attraction. Other notable attractions include the Salato Wildlife Education Center, Daniel Boone's gravesite, Buffalo Trace Distillery, and Rebecca Ruth Candy Tours & Museum."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Allowing a few drops of insulin to drop from the needle tip ensures there are no air bubbles and nothing is obstructing the flow of insulin.  Once your pen is ready to use, dial the dose you need to administer.  Using a fresh needle, a primed device, and the correct dose dialed on the pen device, you are ready to administer the injection.  Follow your doctor's instructions on pinching the skin and the angle of entry in order to more effectively administer the insulin. Once you have pushed the thumb button completely in, count slowly to ten before withdrawing the needle.  If you are administering a larger dose, your doctor or diabetic healthcare provider may instruct you to count beyond ten to ensure the dose is properly delivered.  Counting to ten or beyond ensures that you get the full dose intended and helps to prevent leakage from the injection site when you withdraw the needle. Insulin pens and cartridges should not be shared. Even with fresh needles, there is still a significant risk of transferring skin cells, disease, or infection from one person to another. Summary:","output":"1. Prepare your insulin pen: Ensure that there are no air bubbles or any obstructions in the flow of insulin by allowing a few drops from the needle tip. This ensures the smooth flow of insulin when it is being administered. 2. Dial the correct dose: Set the pen to the correct dose as per the doctor's instructions. This is critical to ensuring that you receive the right amount of insulin. 3. Use a fresh needle: Each time an insulin injection is taken, a new needle should be used. Reusing needles can lead to infection or disease transmission.  4.

Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  Paragraph: Geologists have been contemplating on the question - why some places are more susceptible to earthquakes.

Still in Deadlock On Secretary General UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Nov. 4— The United States and China continued to veto each other's candidates tonight, prolonging the Security Council's effort to choose a Secretary General. The Council held two more ballots and they differed little from the six of last week. On the first round, Salim A. Salim of Tanzania won the nine votes needed for election but the American veto stopped him. Kurt Waldheim, the incumbent, collected 10 votes on both ballots but his ambitions for an unprecedented third term were frustrated by China. Jeane J. Kirkpatrick of the United States said she wanted the Council to ''end the impasse by inviting other candidates in.'' Olara Otunnu of Uganda, Mr. Salim's unofficial manager, said: ''We are happy with the results. He could have been elected if the U.S. had not vetoed. We are going ahead full steam.'' Many diplomats think that the longer the stalemate lasts, the more Mr. Waldheim's chances improve, however damaged his prestige may be by the repeated rounds of rejection. Tonight's vote, held in secret but quickly announced, went like this: Mr. Waldheim received 10 ayes, 4 nays and an abstention on both rounds. Mr. Salim first collected 9 ayes, 2 nays and four abstentions. He then got 8 ayes, 3 nays and four abstentions. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"This article discusses the ongoing deadlock at the United Nations over the choice of Secretary General.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Given the background: Scientists think that the earliest flowers attracted insects and other animals, which spread pollen from flower to flower. This greatly increased the efficiency of fertilization over wind-spread pollen, which might or might not actually land on another flower. To take better advantage of this “animal labor,” plants evolved traits such as brightly colored petals to attract pollinators. In exchange for pollination, flowers gave the pollinators nectar.  and the situation: Joy had a field full of flowering plants , that he used for medicinal and honey making purposes. Her friend Jill also had a piece of land where she cultivated plants that fertilize over wind spread pollen.  Answer the following question: Which friend had a field that attracted fewer insects? Answer:","output":"Given the background information, it is evident that plants with wind-dispersed pollen typically have fewer traits that are specifically designed to attract insects, while flowering plants have features like brightly colored petals to entice pollinators. In the situation described, Joy has a field full of flowering plants that provide nectar for pollinators like insects, and it is implied that these plants have evolved traits to attract these pollinators. This symbiotic partnership between flowers and insects allows the plants to take advantage of \\"animal labor\\" during pollination, ensuring a higher rate of fertilization overall. On the other hand, Jill's field consists of plants that rely on wind for pollination. This means that these plants would not need the same adaptations and mechanisms to attract insects for carrying pollen from one plant to another. Wind-pollinated plants usually produce a substantial amount of pollen that gets carried away by the wind, with the hope that some might land on compatible flowers. These plants are not dependent on insects or other animal pollinators, so they typically lack brightly colored petals or nectar rewards to lure them in. Based on this information, it can be concluded that Jill's field of wind-pollinated plants would likely attract fewer insects compared to Joy's field of flowering plants specifically adapted to entice pollinators with color and nectar. Joy's field creates a mutually beneficial relationship between the flowering plants and insects, whereas Jill's field relies on a more random and passive method of pollination through wind dispersal that doesn't warrant active insect attraction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I live in walking distance and wanted for months to stop in. I finally walked in yesterday (Sunday) at around 4:00pm. Sat outside on the patio overlooking the parking lot and road. Ever since My Big Fat Greek Restaurant closed near by, I've been desperate for a consistent \\"go to\\" for noshing and drinks. Perfect Pear is a faux bistro with no bar, no charm and zero ambience. The restaurant smelled like smelly cheese - maybe cheap grated romano - so the patio was the escape. The menu offers typical easy-to-make, low risk, but high profit dishes. The drink menu is pedestrian and boring. No buttery chards and warm room temp reds. The waitress thought Pinot Gris was a misprint and apologized !?! So, the foodie in me already knows the pasta selections are embarrassingly ill conceived, so think American corporate like Chili's or Carraba's. So, what to do? Well, order something that few restaurants can screw up --- bruschetta!!  Trendy, high profit, easy with fresh ingredients. The Classic came on soggy focaccia, hardly toasted, with tasteless, off-red tomatoes with red onion and julienne'd basil (not torn). Then, (get this) topped with cheap-of-the-cheap romano cheese (see above). Any shot at being edible was ruined by the grated romano. The Chef must have zero culinary instincts or just doesn't care because there is no real competition in the area. Unforgiveable. The Lolita was actually worse. Please don't say \\"avocado\\" when you really mean a brown guac spread. We ordered the olives and pesto goat cheese. Why ruin pesto with goat cheese? The crostini with the olives was the best part of the meal. My partner reconstructed the bruschetta using the crostini and the edible parts of what was served. I marvel at new owners who seemingly don't avail themselves of the basic \\"how to's\\" and \\"do's and dont's\\" of culinary.

The red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide. It also causes the red color of the planet Mars. The red sky at sunset and sunrise is caused by an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering, which, when the sun is low or below the horizon, increases the red-wavelength light that reaches the eye. The color of autumn leaves is caused by pigments called anthocyanins, which are produced towards the end of summer, when the green chlorophyll is no longer produced. One to two percent of the human population has red hair; the color is produced by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin (which also accounts for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Hematite is a form of iron oxide that contributes to the red color of various geological features, such as the Grand Canyon, and the red color of the planet Mars."},{"instruction":"Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: Nick Hendricks (Bateman) and Dale Arbus (Day) are friends who despise their bosses.

Question: \\"What term refers to people with authority to judge disputes, that comes from a Roman title tribunus?\\"  Context: \\"International tribunals and arbiters are often called upon to resolve substantial disputes over treaty interpretations. To establish the meaning in context, these judicial bodies may review the preparatory work from the negotiation and drafting of the treaty as well as the final, signed treaty itself.\\"  Answer:","output":"The term that refers to people with authority to judge disputes, originating from the Roman title tribunus, is \\"tribunal.\\" In the context of international law and arbitration, tribunals and arbiters are those judicial bodies and individuals responsible for presiding over disputes and rendering decisions to resolve conflicts, often involving treaty interpretations and enforcement. During the Roman Republic, tribunus was a title granted to various officials with different roles. The most renowned were the Tribuni Plebis, who served as elected representatives to protect the rights and interests of the plebeians (common people) from the patricians (nobility). As time passed, the functions and authority of the Tribuni Plebis evolved, and they gained the power to veto legislation and actions by other officials. In modern legal contexts, international tribunals, such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and International Criminal Court (ICC), work to settle disputes between nations or prosecute individuals for crimes against humanity, war crimes, and other severe offenses. These judicial bodies use various sources of evidence, like preparatory work from treaty negotiations, the final signed treaty, and customary principles of international law, to determine the proper interpretation and application of the treaties in question. In summary, the term \\"tribunal\\" has its roots in the Roman title \\"tribunus.\\" Today, it refers to judicial bodies and individuals with the authority to judge disputes, particularly within the sphere of international law and arbitration. They play a crucial role in maintaining global peace, ensuring adherence to international agreements, and promoting justice within the international community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - fresher - healthier - i'm hungry - eat bread - tastes better than storebought  Explain why a human would choose \\"fresher\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"fresher\\" as the answer to the question because making their own bread allows them to have more control over the entire process from start to finish. This leads to better taste and increased freshness compared to store-bought bread. There are several reasons behind this choice: 1. Quality of ingredients: When a person makes their own bread at home, they have complete control over the quality of ingredients they use. This means they can opt for high-quality, organic, and locally-sourced ingredients which can contribute to the overall freshness of the bread. In contrast, store-bought bread might have been made with lower-quality ingredients or preservatives to increase its shelf life, potentially compromising the freshness. 2. Immediate consumption: Homemade bread can be consumed shortly after it has been baked. This ensures peak freshness, as it doesn't have to go through the process of being transported, stocked on the shelves, and waiting to be purchased. On the other hand, store-bought bread may have been sitting on the shelf for some time before it is consumed, causing it to lose some of its initial freshness. 3. Absence of preservatives: Homemade bread typically lacks the preservatives found in store-bought bread. Preservatives are often used to extend the shelf life of commercially-made bread products, which can end up compromising their texture and flavor. By making bread at home, one can avoid these additives and experience a fresher loaf of bread. 4. Control over the baking process: Making bread at home allows for control over the entire baking process, including the fermentation time, dough handling, and baking conditions. This ensures that the bread is cooked to one's personal preference, further enhancing the freshness and overall eating experience. In the case of store-bought bread, the baking process has been standardized, and the end product may not be as close to one's personal preference. 5. Aromatic experience: The process of making bread at home fills the space with the enticing aroma of freshly baked bread, further enhancing the perception of freshness. This sensory experience is often lost when purchasing store-bought bread, as it is typically pre-packaged and the aroma is not as pronounced. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"fresher\\" as the answer because making bread at home gives them greater control over the ingredients, process, and timing. This results in a higher quality, fresher loaf of bread with more enticing flavors and aromas compared to store-bought options."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Digestion: Digestion begins in the mouth with the secretion of saliva and its digestive enzymes. Food is formed into a bolus by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage the walls of the stomach and mucus is secreted for protection. In the stomach further release of enzymes break down the food further and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach. The partially digested food enters the duodenum as a thick semi-liquid chyme. In the small intestine, the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal juice. The intestinal walls are lined with villi, and their epithelial cells is covered with numerous microvilli to improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing the surface area of the intestine.

By April 1900, the Boer War was so unpopular in mainland Europe that her annual trip to France seemed inadvisable. Instead, the Queen went to Ireland for the first time since 1861, in part to acknowledge the contribution of Irish regiments to the South African war. In July, her second son Alfred (\\"Affie\\") died; \\"Oh, God!

They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi.

These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.  Now, I have a new situation: Greg was studying behavior of different organisms.

(CNN) -- Clay Duke sat quietly through the first portion of the Bay District Schools, Florida, school board meeting Tuesday afternoon as local children were honored for their achievements.      When it came time for citizens to bring up issues, the 56-year-old resident calmly approached the front.      He spray painted a red \\"V\\" with a circle around it on the wall, brandished a small-caliber handgun and ordered the room cleared at a Panama City schools building.      \\"Six men stay. Everyone else leave,\\" the burly gunman said.      Moments later, Ginger Littleton, a board member, returned to the room and swung a purse at him. She ended up on the ground after the two struggled. The gunman cursed her, but did not open fire and he let her leave the room.      Someone was going to die, he said.      At that point, Duke, as seen on the dramatic live internet feed provided by CNN affiliates WJHG and WMBB, began a rambling discourse that included the apparent firing of his wife and sales taxes.      The confrontation ended in the gunman identified as Duke calmly firing at the school officials, being wounded and, according to police, taking his own life.      At first, school board members and Superintendent Bill Husfelt tried to reason with Duke, who had a criminal record. They talked about possibly finding a job for Duke's wife or looking into the case.      Husfelt told the gunman that he likely signed the termination papers, but didn't recall the circumstances.      \\"I'm the one who signed the papers,\\" Husfelt. \\"Let them go,\\" he said referring to the school board members.      At one point, Husfelt said, \\"I don't want anybody to get hurt. I've got a feeling that what you want, is you want the cops to come in and kill you because you are mad. Because you said you are going to die.\\"      \\"But why? This isn't worth it,\\" the superintendent told him. \\"This is a problem.\\"      The gunman then pointed the pistol at the official.      \\"Please don't. Please don't. Please,\\" Husfelt said.      The gunman opened fire at Husfelt and school board members. He missed them all, even though he was at close range, said Lee Stafford, director of student services of Bay District Schools. Duke said, \\"I'm going to kill [unintelligible],\\" while he fired.      Mike Jones, chief of security for the school system and a retired police officer, exchanged fire with Duke, who was wounded and rolled to the ground. Duke turned his gun on himself, dying of a fatal gunshot to the head, authorities said. Husfelt called Jones a \\"hero.\\"      The gunman was declared dead at a local hospital. An autopsy is expected Wednesday.      Police and school officials were left to piece together what happened.      \\"I'm sure they never expected this kind of event to occur,\\" Sgt. Jeffrey Becker of the Panama City Police Department.      The superintendent later related the event as being \\"surreal,\\" Becker said.      Husfelt told reporters that Duke had almost a smile on his face. \\"He made up his mind. You could tell he was going to die.\\"      The superintendent said he believes the gunman used a combination of live bullets and blanks. But police said live bullets were used.      Husfelt told \\"AC360\\" Tuesday night that the gunman was \\"just mixed up\\" and that he tried to calm him down. \\"I knew the police were on their way.\\"      \\"You knew he had something in mind he was going to do and it would not end well,\\" Husfelt said.      The superintendent said he wanted to protect the school board members, but Duke did not want to talk.      \\"The good Lord was standing in front of me,\\" said the school chief, adding authorities found two bullet holes behind his desk.      Police have a solid lead on Duke's motive, Becker said, but were not prepared Tuesday night to release it.      The investigation includes Duke's assertions that his wife had been terminated by the school district. Police were talking with Duke's wife, Becker said.      School officials said they were unaware of the significance of the spray painting.      But a Facebook page belonging to a Clay Duke has a profile photo of a \\"V\\" in a red circle, a logo that is used in the movie \\"V for Vendetta.\\"      According to the Internet Movie Database, the 2006 film is about \\"a shadowy freedom fighter known only as \\"V\\" uses terrorist tactics to fight against his totalitarian society. Upon rescuing a girl from the secret police, he also finds his best chance at having an ally.\\"      CNN could not verify if the Facebook page belonged to the gunman, but it does list Duke, 56, as living in Panama City, Florida.      A biography on Duke's Facebook page reads: \\"My Testament: Some people (the government sponsored media) will say I was evil, a monster (V)... no... I was just born poor in a country where the Wealthy manipulate, use, abuse, and economically enslave 95% of the population. Rich Republicans, Rich Democrats... same-same... rich... they take turns fleecing us... our few dollars... pyramiding the wealth for themselves. The 95%... the us, in US of A, are the neo slaves of the Global South. Our Masters, the Wealthy, do, as they like to us...\\"      Under \\"political views,\\" Duke labels himself a \\"Freedom Fighter.\\" Under religious views, he wrote, \\"Humanism.\\"      Duke, who lived in Lynn Haven, a suburb of Panama City, has a previous record, Becker told CNN.      According to the website of the Florida Department of Corrections, Duke was sentenced in 2000 for aggravated stalking, obstructing justice and throwing or shooting into a vehicle.      According to the Panama City News Herald, after six months of stalking a former girlfriend, Duke confronted the woman outside her home on Oct. 20, 1999. He was wearing the mask and vest and holding two .22-caliber guns. He threatened to kill her, then kill several others and then himself, the newspaper said. When the woman tried to drive away, Duke shot out a rear tire.      The photo of Duke on the corrections page matches the Facebook page.      The News Herald reported that the gunman was taken out of the building on a stretcher. According to Panama City Police Chief John Van Etten, no one other than the suspect was injured, affiliate WJHG said.      School board spokeswoman Karen Tucker said the man \\"was a large guy\\" she had seen sitting in the back of the boardroom earlier, according to the News Herald.      Superintendent Husfelt will hold a press conference at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday at the administration building in Panama City, police said.      CNN affiliate WMBB reported children and parents were at the meeting to be recognized for achievements, but were gone before the incident began.      \\"We are absolutely in state of shock,\\" said Stafford. \\"I was in the third floor and we were watching the live feed, and first we thought it was a drill. But the more that you watched it, we realized this was an actual incident and emergency situation.\\"      Duke's Facebook page listed him as a 1972 graduate of King High School in Tampa.      His favorite quotation: \\"You want the truth? You can't handle the truth,\\" from the movie \\"A Few Good Men.\\"      From CNN's Vivian Kuo. ||||| A gunman who fired point-blank at school board members before fatally shooting himself had for much of the meeting sat with the rest of the audience, listening to routine business.      This photo provided by the Florida Dept. of Corrections shows Clay Duke. (AP Photo/Florida Dept of Corrections) (Associated Press)      As the board was in the midst of a discussion Tuesday, Clay A. Duke walked to the front of the room, spray painted a red \\"V\\" with a circle around it on the white wall, then turned and waved a handgun. He calmly ordered everyone to \\"hit the road\\" except the men on the board sitting behind a long beige desk.      Despite his shock, Bay City Schools Superintendent Bill Hasfelt mustered a calm voice and tried to persuade Duke to drop the gun, but the 56-year-old ex-convict just shook his head, blaming officials for his wife being fired. Video showed him slowly raising the gun and leveling it at Husfelt, who pleaded \\"Please don't, please don't.\\"      \\"We could tell by the look in his eyes that this wasn't going to end well,\\" Husfelt later told The Associated Press.      Duke shot twice at Husfelt from about 8 feet away and squeezed off several more rounds before security guard Mike Jones bolted in and, after exchanging gunfire with Duke, wounded him in the leg or side. Duke then fatally shot himself, police Sgt. Jeff Becker said. Somehow, no one else who remained in the small board room was injured in the clash that lasted several minutes, and Husfelt said at least two rounds lodged in the wall behind him.      \\"It was so surreal. You couldn't believe it was going on,\\" he said.      Before the shooting started, the only woman on the five-member board _ who had left the room as ordered _ came back, sneaked up behind Duke and whacked his gun arm with her large, brown purse.      \\"In my mind, that was the last attempt or opportunity to divert him,\\" Ginger Littleton told AP.      Duke, a large, heavyset man dressed in a dark pullover coat, got angry, turned around, and she fell to the floor, as board members pleaded with her to stop. Duke pointed the gun at her head and said, \\"You stupid b----\\" but he didn't shoot her, she said. She's not sure why.      \\"He had every opportunity to take me out,\\" she said.      In his brief exchange with the board, Duke said his wife had been fired from the northern Florida district, but never told Husfelt or the board who she was or her job. Members promised to help her find a new job, but Duke just shook his head. Husfelt told Duke he would be responsible for her dismissal, so the board members should be allowed to leave.      \\"He said his wife was fired, but we really don't know what he was talking about,\\" Husfelt told the AP at his Panama City home. \\"I don't think he knew what he was talking about.\\"      Husfelt in the exchange on video tells Duke: \\"I've got a feeling you want the cops to come in and kill you because you said you are going to die today.\\" Later, the head of more than 30 district schools said he was sure someone was going to be killed.      Tommye Lou Richardson, the school district's personnel director, who was at the meeting, called district security chief and former police officer Jones a hero. In the video, as Duke lay on the floor, colleagues comforted a shaken Jones, who said he had never shot anyone before.      SWAT officers then storm the room and order everyone onto the ground. School officials tell them that Duke is shot and appears dead. His feet can be seen near the board's seats. The district said Jones would not be available for an interview.      Minutes before Duke rose from his seat, the room had been filled with students receiving awards, Husfelt said.      \\"It could have been a monumental tragedy.\\"      Husfelt spoke to the AP wearing a sweat shirt and pajama bottoms, surrounded by his family. With a Christmas tree as backdrop, he said his faith anchored him during the ordeal and that he thought, \\"I don't want to die today but I'm prepared if I do.      \\"God was standing in front of me and I will go to my grave believing that,\\" he said.      As for the V inside a circle that Duke painted, it's the same symbol used in the graphic novel series and movie \\"V for Vendetta,\\" though police didn't talk about his motive.      After everything stopped, some board members speculated that the bullets Duke was firing were fake or caps. But police say the gun was real _ and the video shows papers flying up on Husfelt's desk.      Duke was charged in October 1999 with aggravated stalking, shooting or throwing a missile into a building or vehicle and obstructing justice, according to state records. He was convicted and sentenced in January 2000 to five years in prison and was released in January 2004. Records show Duke was a licensed massage therapist before his arrest but it wasn't clear if he was employed.      Attorney Ben Bollinger, who represented Duke during his trial, told The News Herald of Panama City that Duke was waiting in the woods for his wife with a rifle, wearing a mask and a bulletproof vest. She confronted him and then tried to leave in a vehicle, and Duke shot the tires. He said that as part of his sentence, Duke was required to complete psychological counseling. Bollinger did not immediately return a phone message from the AP.      \\"The guy obviously had a death wish,\\" district spokeswoman Karen Tucker said of Duke. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A gunman, Clay Duke, attended a Bay District Schools board meeting in Florida, where he spray-painted a red \\"V\\" on the wall and brandished a handgun. He ordered the room to be cleared except for six men. School board members and Superintendent Bill Husfelt attempted to reason with Duke, who had a criminal record, mentioning the possibility of finding a job for Duke's wife or looking into her case. However, Duke began firing at school officials but missed them all. Mike Jones, chief of security, exchanged fire with Duke, who was wounded and subsequently took his own life. The entire confrontation was captured on a dramatic live internet feed provided by CNN affiliates. Authorities later found a possible motive related to Duke's wife being fired from the school district but did not disclose details."},{"instruction":"Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what animal can regrow middle segments when broken?\\" is \\"geckos\\", given that  earthworms have the ability to regrow segments that break off?

After a few cars pass him by, Crump's brother recognizes and yells at a long-haired teen in an old Ford pickup who screeches to a stop to pick him up. Crump's brother is obviously a tough guy. He tells the driver about two girls he knows about in Torrance Beach that he's planning to spend the night with. Later that day at Petro Park, a hangout in Orange County, the driver of the pickup tells some other dudes (known as \\"the guzzlers\\"), about the two girls. Tack, one of the guzzlers, walks away from the others, obviously on some sort of mission. We can only wonder what he's up to as the opening credits roll.During the title sequence we meet Joe (Michael Kopelow) and Hubbs (Bradford Tatum), two typical long-haired teens who are bombing around in their 1960s Volkswagen Type II Squareback, The \\"Blue Torpedo\\". They're looking to party, but there isn't much going on. As if to emphasize the point, Joe's 8-track copy of \\"Hocus Pocus\\" by Focus is eaten by the tape deck. He then puts on \\"Don't Fear The Reaper\\" by Blue Öyster Cult, but Hubbs calls it a \\"pussy song\\" and orders him to take it out.

Mama came over and sat down beside Alice . Gently she stroked *her* hair and let the child weep.   - no  - yes","output":"Yes, in the given sentence, \\"Mama\\" and \\"her\\" point to the same thing. To provide a more detailed explanation, let's break down the sentence and analyze the pronouns and their respective antecedents. The sentence is: \\"Mama came over and sat down beside Alice. Gently she stroked *her* hair and let the child weep.\\" In this sentence, \\"Mama\\" is the subject and is performing the actions described. \\"Came over,\\" \\"sat down beside Alice,\\" \\"stroked,\\" and \\"let\\" are the verbs that describe the actions taken by the subject. Now, let's look at the pronouns used in the sentence. There are two pronouns: \\"she\\" and \\"her.\\" Pronouns are words that replace nouns in a sentence to avoid repetition and enhance clarity. 1. \\"she\\" - This pronoun is used in the second sentence, \\"Gently she stroked *her* hair and let the child weep.\\" Here, \\"she\\" refers to the person who is performing the action of stroking the hair and letting the child weep. Since \\"Mama\\" is the one who came over and sat down beside Alice, it is apparent that \\"she\\" refers to \\"Mama.\\" 2. \\"her\\" - This pronoun is also used in the second sentence as a possessive pronoun to indicate ownership or association. In this context, \\"her\\" is used to describe the hair that is being stroked. Since \\"Mama\\" is the one performing the action and \\"she\\" has already been established as referring to \\"Mama,\\" it is reasonable to conclude that \\"her\\" also points to \\"Mama\\" in this sentence. Thus, based on the sentence structure and the understanding of pronouns, we can confirm that both \\"Mama\\" and \\"her\\" point to the same thing, which is the mother or the female caregiver of Alice in this context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One missile landed in an uninhabited area while at least one more is thought to have landed in the sea off the city. Meanwhile, Israel's defence minister has authorised the call-up of 30,000 reservists. The BBC's Richard Galpin, in Jerusalem, says speculation is mounting that the Israeli army is preparing to launch a ground offensive into the Gaza Strip. Eighteen Palestinians have been killed in Israeli operations against militants in Gaza since Wednesday afternoon, when an Israeli air strike killed the military leader of Hamas, the militant group that controls the territory, in his car in Gaza City. Three Israelis have died during a barrage of hundreds of missiles fired from Gaza, mostly into southern Israel, some of which have been intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system. The rocket fired at Tel Aviv that came down on dry land hit a field in the suburb of Rishon Lezion, south of the city. The armed wing of Islamic Jihad said it had fired an Iranian-built, Fajr-5 rocket at Tel Aviv. By Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor The danger of the kind of operation Israel has started is that rising casualties on both sides cause a violent escalation that neither side can control.  If that happens it could cause a much bigger crisis across the Middle East. By Wyre DaviesBBC News, Gaza The overwhelming mood in Gaza is sombre but vengeful. Sombre because few here want another war with Israel - another war in which civilians would undoubtedly suffer as much as the fighters. By Yolande KnellBBC News, Kiryat Malachi There is a gaping hole on the top floor of an old four-storey apartment building where two Israeli families were  living. A resident Yerumichael Simon told me: \\"I live across the street and I used to live inside that building.\\" BBC reporters on Israel-Gaza violence \\"We have widened the range of the battle to reach Tel Aviv and what is coming will be greater,\\" the group said in a statement. This is the first time Tel Aviv has been threatened by missiles since the first Gulf War, when missiles fired by Saddam Hussein's Iraq landed in the city. Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said: \\"This escalation will exact a price that the other side will have to pay.\\" The Hamas Prime Minister in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, condemned what he called Israel's \\"ferocious assault\\" against the territory. \\"We here in Gaza will remain steadfast and unshaken,\\" he said in a televised statement. \\"We will fend off the aggression. \\"We are all confident in our intrepid resistance fighters who are now deployed on the front.\\" Late on Thursday, BBC correspondents in Gaza reported several massive explosions and missile fire in and around Gaza City as Israeli strikes continued. Many of the Palestinians killed in Gaza during the last two days by the Israeli aerial and naval bombardment were members of militant groups, but civilians - including at least four children - were also among the dead. They included 11-month-old Omar, the son of Jihad Misharawi, a BBC Arabic picture editor. The three Israeli civilians who died - two women and a man - were killed on the top floor of a block of flats in the southern town of Kiryat Malachi that suffered a direct hit by a rocket. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will do \\"everything in its power\\" to avoid civilian casualties in the conflict with Hamas. But he said Hamas was deliberately placing its rockets and missiles in civilian areas prior to launching them at Israel. \\"There is no moral symmetry between Israel and the terrorists in Gaza,\\" he said during a televised news conference in Tel Aviv. \\"Hamas deliberately targets our children and they deliberately place their rockets next to their children. Now despite this reality - and it's a difficult reality - Israel will continue to do everything in its power to avoid civilian casualties.\\" Egypt's new Islamist President Mohammed Mursi called the Israeli bombardment \\"unacceptable aggression\\". Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Qandil is to travel to Gaza on Friday in a show of support for the people of the territory. The United States, Israel's key ally, has called on countries that have contact with Hamas to urge it to stop rocket attacks from Gaza. \\"We've... urged those that have a degree of influence with Hamas such as Turkey, and Egypt and some of our European partners to use that influence to urge Hamas to de-escalate,\\" said Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser, in a conference call with reporters. Asked if the US was concerned that Israeli ground forces would enter Gaza, Mr Rhodes said: \\"Ultimately it's up to the Israeli government to make determinations about how they're going to carry out their military objectives.\\" Arab League foreign ministers plan to meet in emergency session on Friday to discuss the escalating violence. Israel's aerial and naval bombardment of the Gaza Strip, which began after a recent wave of rocket attacks from there, is its most intense assault on the Palestinian territory since it launched a full-scale invasion four years ago, also in response to rocket fire. Summary:","output":"The summarized report discusses the events following air raid sirens alarming the residents of a missile threat, the first since 1991. One missile landed in an unpopulated area and some more are speculated to have fallen into the sea near the city. Israel's Defence Minister authorized the draft of 30,000 reservists amidst escalating tensions between Israel and Gaza Strip. Post the killing of Hamas's military leader in an Israeli air strike, 18 Palestinians have been reported dead in subsequent operations against the Gaza militants. Three Israelis have also lost their lives due to the hundreds of missiles fired from Gaza.  Commenting on the situation, Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen highlighted the danger of this escalated operation, suggesting it could induce a violent escalation leading to a wider crisis across the Middle East. The residents of Gaza are described as somber yet revengeful due to these developments. A significant impact was the destruction of a four-storey building in Kiryat Malachi where two Israeli families residing were affected. Correspondingly, Tel Aviv experienced a missile threat for the first time since the first Gulf War.  Israel's Defence Minister Ehud Barak indicated further escalation would extract a high price that the opposing side would have to pay. The Hamas Prime Minister, Ismail Haniyeh, criticized Israel's aggressive assault on their territory, assuring they will combat the aggression with resilience. Reports of massive explosions around Gaza were reported, and Israeli aerial and naval strikes have continued. Despite most casualties being militants, civilians, and children, are also victims.  Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel would put its best efforts to avoid civilian casualties, accusing Hamas of intentionally placing rockets in civilian locations. Responding to this crisis, Egypt's President Mohammed Mursi declared Israel's actions as \\"unacceptable aggression\\" and is sending his Prime Minister, Hisham Qandil, to show support to the people of Gaza. The United States urged nations having contacts with Hamas to convince it to stop rocket attacks from Gaza.  The Arab League foreign ministers are planning an emergency meet to talk over the escalating violence. The ongoing events are the most intense Israeli assault on Gaza since their full-scale invasion four years ago, also in reply to rocket fire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The general removes a red spire from the table and destroys it; the thunderclap as the piece is shattered resonates through the city and sets off a trap that ensnares the three brigands. The red spire's destruction is clearly an act of treason, and for this and other crimes they are sentenced by Jor-El for banishment into the Phantom Zone.Many years after traveling through the galaxy, the Phantom Zone is shattered near Earth by the shockwave from the harmless detonation of a hydrogen bomb launched into space by Superman. The three criminals are freed, finding themselves with super powers granted by the yellow light of Earth's sun. After attacking human astronauts on the moon and the small town of East Houston, Idaho, the three travel to the White House and force the President of the United States to surrender to Zod (on behalf of the entire planet) during an international television broadcast. When the President warns Zod that Superman will stop them, Zod announces his demand for Superman to come and \\"kneel before Zod!\\"Prior to Zod's arrival, Clark Kent and Lois Lane are sent on assignment for the Daily Planet to Niagara Falls. Lois becomes suspicious that Clark is Superman and tries to lure him into revealing his identity by throwing herself into the Falls, but Clark manages to save her with subtle use of his powers. That night, Clark accidentally reaches into the room's fireplace to recover his glasses after he trips; when Lois discovers his hand is not even burnt, Clark is forced to admit he is Superman. He takes her to his Fortress of Solitude near the North Pole and shows her the traces of his past stored in the energy crystals of the Fortress, one of which is the green crystal that created the Fortress and opened Superman's contact with his long-deceased parents. Lois misplaces the green crystal under her purse. Superman decides to undergo a transformation to make himself... My question: What does the destruction of the red spire represent","output":"The destruction of the red spire represents an act of treason committed by General Zod, Ursa, and Non against their home planet, Krypton. By removing and destroying the red spire from the crystalline matrix table, the criminals disrupt the functioning of this essential part of Krypton's security or energy system, which subsequently sets off a trap that captures them. This act of defiance and destruction showcases their rebellion and power-hungry nature, leading to their trial and banishment to the Phantom Zone by Jor-El, Superman's father. The event serves as a catalyst for the movie's plot, as it sets up the circumstances through which the three criminals eventually arrive on Earth and pose a significant threat to Superman and humanity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In a recent interview with Buzzfeed on \\"CBS This Morning\\" the comedian was asked about the fact that most of the guests on his Web series \\"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\\" have been white males. Seinfeld's initial response was \\"It really pisses me off.\\" \\"People think [comedy] is the census or something, it's gotta represent the actual pie chart of America,\\" he said. \\"Who cares?\\" With his Super Bowl commercial, Seinfeld is back on the radar, but his comments come at the same time as debate about diversity in comedy. \\"Saturday Night Live\\" hired its first black female cast member in years after an outcry over the show's lack of diversity. Gawker writer Kyle Chayka writes that by Seinfeld saying, \\"I have no interest in gender or race or anything like that,\\" the comic \\"seems to suggest that any comedian who is not a white male is also not funny, though he's also likely fed up with the amount of bad comedy he's been forced to sit through in his (waning) career.\\" \\"Which is too bad, because Seinfeld is downplaying the work of everyone from Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby to Aziz Ansari, Mindy Kaling, and Eddie Huang, who are all in various stages of their own sitcoms that just might turn out to be the next 'Seinfeld,' \\" Chayka writes. It's not the first time Seinfeld has faced criticism regarding racial issues. When his hit NBC series \\"Seinfeld\\" ended in 1998, the Los Angeles Times had a feature about how it was a \\"nonevent\\" for many in the black community because it had never seemed to capture the black audience because of a perceived lack of diversity. \\"Observers said that the lack of 'Seinfeld' fever among blacks is mainly attributable to the almost total absence of minority characters on the New York-based sitcom,\\" reported Los Angeles Times writer Greg Braxton. \\"Some supporting characters -- including an attorney modeled after defense lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. -- have been featured in the last few seasons, but many said the show is still seen as a program that excludes minorities.\\" What are highlight points for this article?","output":"In an interview, people noticed that most guests on Jerry Seinfeld's show were white men. Jerry Seinfeld felt upset when people asked him about it. He thinks it shouldn't matter what race or gender someone is. Some people think Jerry is not supporting comedians who aren't white men. There have been debates about having more variety in comedy shows.

Context: Cancer is one of the devastating neovascular diseases that incapacitate so many people the world over. Recent reports from the National Cancer Institute indicate some significant gain therapy and cancer management as seen in the increase in the 5-year survival rate over the past two decades. Although near-perfect cure rate have been reported in the early-stage disease, these data reveal high recurrence rate and serious side effects including second malignancies and fatalities. Most of the currently used anticancer agents are only effective against proliferating cancer cells. Thus attention has been focused on potential anti-cancer agents capable of killing cancer cells independent of the cell cycle state, to ensure effective elimination of most cancer cells. The objective of this study was to test the chemosensitivity and potential mechanism of action of a novel cancer drug, CytoregR, in a panel of human cancer cells.', 'the study was performed using a series of bioassays including Trypan blue exclusion, MTS Growth inhibition, LDH-cytotoxicity, TUNEL-Terminal DNA fragmentation Apoptosis Assay, and the Caspase protease CPP32 activity assays.', 'CytoregR induced significant dose- and time-dependent inhibition of growth in all the cells; with significant differences in chemosensitivity (P < 0.05) between the target cells becoming more apparent at 48 hr exposure. CytoregR showed no significant effect on normal cells relative to the tumor cells. Growth inhibition in all the cells was due to induction of apoptosis at lower concentrations of cytoregR (> 1:300). CytoregR-induced caspase protease-3 (CPP32) activation significantly and positively correlated with apoptosis induction and growth inhibition; thus implicating CPP32 as the principal death pathway in cytoregR-induced apoptosis. Answer: CytoregR exerted a dose-and time-dependent growth inhibitory effect in all the target cells through induction of apoptosis via the CPP32 death pathway, independent of hormonal sensitivity of the cells. The present data indicate that not only could CPP32 provide a potential target for regulation of cytoregR-induced apoptosis but also that cytoregR could play a significant role in chemotherapeutic regimen in many human malignant tumors.

Wasim Akram (Urdu: wsym khrm; born 3 June 1966) is a former Pakistani first-class cricketer, cricket commentator and television personality. He is acknowledged as one of the greatest bowlers of all time. A left-arm fast bowler who could bowl with significant pace, he represented the Pakistan cricket team in Test cricket and One Day International (ODI) matches. In October 2013, Wasim Akram was the only Pakistani cricketer to be named in an all-time Test World XI to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. During his professional career he bowled with genuine speed and hostility. Akram was a man possessed of accurate control of line and length, accompanied by seam and swing bowling skills, extended to both inswingers and outswingers. With a very quick bowling action, he could bowl equally well from both sides of the wicket. His mastery of reverse swing with the cricket ball meant he was at his most dangerous towards a bowling innings, and earned him the nickname of one of the \\"Sultans of Swing\\", the other one being Waqar Younis.  As well as often being able to find the edge of the bat, Akram would also focus his bowling attack on the stumps and had a particularly lethal inswinging yorker. Of his 414 Test wickets, 193 were taken caught, 119 were taken leg before wicket and 102 were bowled. In partnership with Waqar Younis, he intimidated international batsmen in the 1990s. Together Wasim and Waqar, known as \\"the two Ws\\" of the Pakistani team, were one of the most successful bowling partnerships in cricket.  With the bat he was especially effective against spin bowlers. However, he liked to slog and was criticised for his lack of high scores and giving away his wicket too cheaply. In October 1996 he scored 257 runs not out, of the team's total of 553 against lowly Zimbabwe on a typical flat South Asian pitch at Sheikhupura. He also achieved good scores for the Pakistan team such as his scores of 123 and 45* against Australia to take Pakistan to victory in a low scoring match. His batting was also valuable sometimes to the Pakistan ODI side, such as in the Nehru Cup in 1989, when needing six runs and two balls to win the match, he hit the first delivery he faced, from part-time off-spinner and batting legend, Viv Richards, for a six and secured the cup.  In December 2012 after Ricky Ponting announced his retirement he said that Wasim Akram and Curtly Ambrose were the toughest bowlers he had faced \\"Akram for the exact opposite, you could get a few runs off him, but you just knew there was an unplayable ball around the corner, be it with an old ball or with a new ball,\\" - Ricky Ponting.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: How did he get the nickname \\"sultans of swing\\"","output":"The nickname \\"Sultans of Swing\\" for Wasim Akram (and also his bowling partner Waqar Younis) was derived from his mastery of swing bowling. In cricket, swing bowling is a technique where the ball curves in its trajectory, making it challenging for the batsman to play. Akram's prowess didn't just revolve around traditional swing, but he also had a handle on reverse swing - a more complex and challenging type of swing that involves the ball swinging in the opposite direction to what is expected, often confounding batsmen. The enormous level of dexterity this required was not common among bowlers, making Akram and Younis stand out. With his fast-paced, left-arm style, he was able to generate significant swing on each delivery, either in-swingers (moving the ball towards a right-handed batsman) or out-swingers (moving the ball away from a right-handed batsman). This ability to generate swing both ways, and his speed and accuracy, resulted in Akram being highly effective in his bowling, and it became a hallmark of his play. The nickname \\"Sultans of Swing\\" can also be traced back to the dominance of Akram and Younis in the 1990s, where their ability to swing the ball, both with the old and new ball, left batsmen struggling and altered the outcomes of many matches. Together Akram and Younis were known as the \\"two Ws\\" and their lethal partnership became symbolic of Pakistan cricket. To summarize, Wasim Akram got the nickname \\"Sultans of Swing\\" due to his incredible control over swing bowling, his ability to swing the ball both ways at high speed, and his intimidating partnership with Waqar Younis that dominated the cricket scene in the 1990s. His ability to command the cricket ball and make it swing adeptly earned him this befitting nickname."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They liked to explore the beautiful world of nature that was all around them - from the tall, tall trees to the swimming fish in the rivers. These wonderful women enjoyed doing fun things like going for walks, seeing pretty flowers, and visiting animals in their homes. They especially loved learning about all the different creatures they could find, like birds singing in the trees or little crawly bugs under rocks. One of their favorite activities was \\"reeling\\" or fishing in the sparkling rivers and lakes. They would take a long, bendy stick called a fishing rod, which had a string attached to it, and they would throw the string into the water. At the end of the string, there was a little hook with some bait. As they waited patiently, they would sometimes see a fish swim by and take a little nibble of the bait, and then they would reel in their catch, which means they would carefully pull back the string so the fish would come out of the water. This was so exciting for them! After they caught some fish, these lovely ladies would let them go back into the water so they could continue swimming and playing with their fish friends. They believed in taking care of the animals and nature they loved so much. When they weren't fishing, these women liked to sit around a cozy campfire, telling stories while roasting marshmallows and making s'mores. They would giggle and share memories of their fantastic outdoor adventures. These wonderful women had lots of fun exploring the outdoors, being kind to nature, and spending time together.

Q: If I tell you that Temperature mostly influences plant growth, biodiversity, and adaptations of land organisms, and ask you the question \\"what mostly influences plant growth, biodiversity, and adaptations of land organism?\\", is the correct answer \\"summer\\"? Possible answers: (1). Yes; (2). No; A:","output":"(2). No; The correct answer is not \\"summer\\". The primary factor that mostly influences plant growth, biodiversity, and adaptations of land organisms is temperature, as mentioned earlier in your statement. While summer may indeed bring warmer temperatures that can affect these aspects of plant and animal life, it is not the overall determining factor. Temperature fluctuations occur throughout the year in different seasons and have specific impacts on the living organisms in an area. Temperature significantly influences plant growth by impacting photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration, and overall metabolism rates. In general, higher temperatures often lead to increased growth rates, while lower temperatures can slow down or even halt growth. However, different species of plants have evolved to be optimally adapted to the temperatures in their native environments. Biodiversity is also affected by temperature in that it determines the range of species that can live and thrive in a given ecosystem. Higher temperatures support a wider variety of species, which often results in increased biodiversity. However, this relationship can be quite complex as other factors like precipitation, altitude, and habitat availability can also influence biodiversity. In terms of adaptations, land organisms have evolved various strategies to survive and thrive in the temperatures found in their native ecosystems. Some adaptations include: 1. Morphological adaptations: Land organisms may develop specific physical traits to help them cope with temperature variations. Examples include fur thickness in animals, leaf size and shape in plants, and unique body structures that enable thermoregulation. 2. Behavioral adaptations: Organisms might change their behaviors to respond to temperature changes, such as seeking shade, migrating to cooler locations, or altering their daily activity patterns to adapt to the heat or cold. 3. Physiological adaptations: Some organisms possess internal mechanisms to withstand temperature fluctuations. These adaptations can include increased metabolic rates to generate heat in cold environments, cooling mechanisms (e.g., sweating or panting) in warm environments, or producing antifreeze proteins to prevent tissue damage in freezing temperatures. In conclusion, while summer may have an impact on plant growth, biodiversity, and adaptations of land organisms, it is not the primary factor influencing these aspects. Temperature primarily drives these changes, and it is essential to understand the complex relationships between temperature, plant growth, biodiversity, and adaptations of land organisms in various ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999.

He continued that offshore flow products such as index options and equity swaps for the Korean market totaled about USD100 million this year. Chiang added that with the new regulations enacted, the Korean OTC market is set to grow, likely expanding by over 50% in the first year and substantially higher after that. \\"We've been waiting for this for a long time,\\" noted one equity derivatives regional head at a global firm in Hong Kong. \\"This is good news,\\" he continued, \\"this will in effect open up the onshore market for international players.\\" Currently, international firms trade primarily in the offshore market. Condensed default swap confirmation launched IFR - November 24, 2001  IP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley last week introduced a credit default swap master agreement to the European market, which reduces documentation to a one-page confirmation form. The master agreement is based on the 1999 International Swaps and Derivatives Association credit derivatives definitions, but 22 of the 30 clauses that are typically subject to agreement are standardised under the shorter master agreement, leaving only eight clauses to be agreed for each trade. The two banks said that use of the new master agreement would allow quicker trade confirmation, reduce operational risk and should eventually improve market liquidity. They did their first trade using the new master agreement last Tuesday and had closed a total of six deals using the new form by Friday. The two banks' London offices typically trade credit derivatives with one another five to 10 times a week. The new agreement had not been adopted by any other dealers by the end of last week, and traders expressed some surprise that the two US banks had launched the document on their own, without consultation under the aegis of trade group ISDA. \\"That would have taken quite a long time, and at the end of the day these are bilateral contracts,\\" said Guy America, European head of credit derivatives trading at JP Morgan Chase. Both banks intend to use the agreement in their default swap trades with other dealers and expect it eventually to prove popular throughout the market. \\"I don't see any reason going forward why it would not be rolled out to end users of the product,\\" said Annabel Littlewood, European head of credit derivatives trading at Morgan Stanley. She added that JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have agreed to use the new master document in trades between their New York dealing desks, with amendments to be made for local market practice. US dealers typically use the modified definition of restructuring as a credit event, and two weeks ago they dropped the use of the obligation acceleration clause as a standard feature of default swaps. Banks move to boost credit derivatives liquidity  Risk News - November 23, 2001  By John Ferry  JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have agreed to standardise most of the items on their European credit swap master agreements, in a move designed to increase liquidity in the credit derivatives market. By cutting the widely used International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation down from several pages to just one, the banks aim to minimise the time taken to execute and confirm a trade while reducing documentation risk. \\"Frequent credit swap traders will be able to increase the volume of confirmed trades, thereby increasing market liquidity and growth of the credit derivatives business,\\" said the banks in a joint statement. Standard ISDA master agreements for credit swaps have 30 negotiable items. JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley's shortened version leaves only eight items open to discussion. The banks said the one-page confirmation form contains only the \\"key commercial terms\\", including the name of the underlying company, the notional involved and the price and duration of the trade. The banks claim this will eliminate the risk of a party missing a modified term or adding terms that were not previously agreed. Guy America, head of European credit derivatives trading at JP Morgan Chase in London, said the development of the credit derivatives market will receive a boost as a result of the agreement. \\"The new agreement now looks very similar to an interest rate swap contract,\\" he said. Annabel Littlewood, head of European credit derivatives trading at Morgan Stanley in London, said it took around a year to finalise the agreement. \\"It's been quite a struggle getting to the point where dealers agree on the major terms in the contracts.\\" Fitch Plans Credit Hiring Spree Derivatives Week - November 26, 2001  Fitch plans to hire six or seven collateralized debt obligation professionals for its London-based CDO rating team because of the increase in the number of deals coming to the market. Mitchell Lench, senior director in London, said it has about 15 CDOs in the pipeline this month in comparison to five or six this time last year, approximately one-third of these are synthetic or balance sheet transactions. Lench expects the new recruits to start in the first half of next year and to come from structuring houses, investment firms or competitors. The hires will include a lawyer familiar with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association's documentation. There are currently 10 professionals in the CDO team in London. Lench said it is becoming easier for rating agencies to hire top personnel because the wage differential between the agencies and the sellside firms has decreased. He added recruits also join rating agencies for job security and to get a bird's eye view of the market. Cross-Border Security Transactions Costing More Than Domestic Ones, EC Says  BNA - November 26, 2001  Despite an increase in the demand for securities by foreign investors because of the euro, there is a highly fragmented system in the European Union when it comes to cross-border clearing and settlement, concluded a new report published Nov. 23 on behalf of the European Commission. Moreover, the cost of clearing and settling a foreign security transaction can be 10 times as much as a domestic sale. \\"There is no European financial market right now and one has to wake up to this reality,\\" said Alberto Giovannini, the chairman of a group that wrote the report. Legislative Proposal Planned  As a result of the report, the EU executive body said it will begin a legislative process in 2002 to reverse the inefficiencies in the EU system. At the same time, the commission urged financial markets to find market-based solutions within the framework of the EU competition law. \\"The additional cost and risk associated with a fragmented clearing and settlement infrastructure represents a significant limitation on the scope for cross-border securities trading in the EU,\\" said EU Economics Commissioner Pedro Solbes. \\"By extension it also represents an important limitation on exploiting the economic benefits of the internal market and the euro.\\" Three Main Problems Cited  The three main problems highlighted in the report are as follows:   \\t*\\tnational differences in technical requirements and market practice;  \\t*\\tnational differences in tax procedures;  \\t*\\tissues relating to legal certainty. While the report says financial markets could do much when it comes to convergence and ensuring inter-operability as regards technical requirements and market practices across national systems, it is up to governments and the European Commission to deal with matters related to taxation and legal certainty. Enter the FSA  Financial Times - November 26, 2001  Midnight on Friday will be a historic moment for Britain's financial services industry. At that hour its new system of regulation under the Financial Services Authority will come fully into effect, more than four years after it was first proposed by the Labour government. How the FSA handles its new powers, such as personal fines for wrongdoing by directors, will have a profound impact on the City of London and its place as a global financial centre. It will be closely watched by countries considering a similar move. The legislation that created the FSA - rightly amended to curb its powers to punish - is broadly sensible. The authority replaces 10 self-governing industry bodies that have not always regulated consistently or with sufficient bite. The aim is to make regulation more efficient and more alert to the scandals that have regularly plagued the City. The legislation leaves wide discretion to the authority. But Sir Howard Davies, its chairman, has promised a new and sensible risk-based approach: resources will be focused on preventing problems where failure is most likely rather than on routine visits to well run companies. Better businesses should enjoy a lighter regulatory touch. That is fine in principle but the City awaits the new policeman with apprehension. There are three main worries. First, that it will prove heavy-handed. There are widespread complaints that while senior FSA staff are excellent, more junior ones still suffer from a box-ticking mentality. Compliance costs, it is said, have been rising - a particular worry for small companies. Second, there is concern that the authority may stretch itself too thinly. A recent report on Equit-able Life criticised the FSA's role, including its poor internal co- ordination. Third, there is a fear the FSA will adopt an excessively aggressive approach in its pursuit of wrong-doing, particularly for the newly created offence of \\"market abuse\\", and might go for some early high-profile scalps. The authority denies this, as well it might. A reputation for inquisitions would serve it ill. Some of the City's concerns stem from natural tensions between regulator and regulated. But the FSA, which can sometimes appear overly sensitive to criticism, needs to be alert to these anxieties if it is to start on the right note. The main test will be to produce a flexible, low-cost regime that is firm yet fair, while encouraging innovation and London's growth as a global centre. This will be a difficult balance - but the FSA's short life so far offers hope that it will get it broadly right. FSA to open securitised derivatives to retail sector  Risk News - November 21, 2001    The UK's financial watchdog, Financial Services Authority (FSA), plans to allow retail investors to invest directly in securitised derivatives for the first time by initiating a flexible listing regime. The proposals, which will be relevant to issuers of listed securities and derivatives, have been released in a consultation paper, 'Proposed Listing and Conduct of Business Rules for Securitised Derivatives', after discussions with market participants and international regulators. The idea to list retail covered warrants was first raised by the FSA in January this year. The new proposals offer a wider and more flexible regime that includes other types of derivatives. The paper details the determination of who can issue securitised derivatives and the information about these products that must be disclosed. The FSA's proposals focus on establishing the suitability of retail investors to purchase securitised derivatives and the qualification of IFAs (independent financial advisers) and brokers to advise on derivatives. The listing of securitised derivatives will also include a risk warning with full disclosure of the risks associated with these products, alongside details of the product, how it works and how the investor's return is calculated. Issuers of securitised derivatives will also need to be regulated by the FSA and permitted to conduct business in derivatives. Ken Rushton, director of listings at the FSA, said: \\"Market participants believe there will be a demand for these products, which are very popular in some European countries. The FSA believes there is the potential for the market in the UK for these products to be substantial if UK investors show a similar appetite for these products as they have for other products such as spread betting and options.\\" Dealers hope for clarity on swap books IFR - November 24, 2001  Some clarification is expected this week on how the US courts may rule on the Internal Revenue Service's challenge to dealers' methods for valuing income from swaps. Closing arguments in Bank One Corporation v Commissioner are set to begin on Wednesday. Although no decision is expected before March or April next year, the nature of the questions asked by the judge during the closing arguments may be telling, industry executives believe. The IRS's case is that the method for valuing First Chicago's swaps portfolio between 1991 and 1993 included inappropriate downward adjustments for credit risk and administrative costs. This, the IRS alleges; led the dealer to underestimate the value of its income from derivatives, and thereby reduced its taxable income base. Bank One acquired First Chicago more than three years ago. Bank One claims that the method used was common practice at the time. In a brief filed this summer the bank also said that its numbers were more accurate with the adjustments than without. It is proposing to use an adjusted mid-market approach to valuing income from swaps. To the annoyance of some in the derivatives industry, the IRS's 600-page brief submitted in September did not tell dealers what recipe they should use for valuing income from swaps. \\"They only put forward a brief saying that the way Bank One did it was wrong,\\" one firm's lawyer said. \\"[The government's position] can't be applied somewhere else. And it doesn't tell an IRS agent how to audit [another dealer].\\" The IRS was not under any obligation to come up with a better method, though this would have been helpful, the lawyer said. The problem with an across-the board use of a mid-market approach of the type used by Bank One is that banks using this approach rarely mark up their valuations because of their own credit risk, said Darrell Duffie, a professor of finance at Stanford University's business school who is one of two court-appointed experts for the case. One partial way to address this would be to disallow mark-downs from mid-market value when a counterparty has the same or higher credit quality, said Duffie. Under a slightly more refined guideline, banks would mark down swaps based on the credit quality of its counterparty relative to its own quality. \\"For example, if an A rated bank issuing debt at 20bp over Libor signs a swap with an A- counterparty issuing at 50bp over Libor, then the swap could be marked down based on a mean (relative) loss rate of 50-20=30bp per year, per dollar of expected exposure,\\" said Duffie. \\"This is not text-book perfect, but would capture the majority of the effect of relative quality. [Also] it would not require new software, just a shift in model inputs for mean loss rates.\\" **End of ISDA Press Report for November 26, 2001**  THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF, ISDA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SPECIFIED CONSULTANTS TO ISDA ONLY.

Who won the Golden Ball Award for best player at the 2006 FIFA World Cup?","output":"The Golden Ball award, which recognizes the best player in the FIFA World Cup, is one of the most prestigious individual accolades in the world of football. At the conclusion of the tournament, journalists from around the globe cast their votes to determine the recipient of the award, which ultimately represents the top athlete's outstanding contribution towards their team's success. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, held in Germany, France's legendary midfielder, Zinedine Zidane, won the Golden Ball Award. This tournament was Zidane's final World Cup appearance, as he had announced his plan to retire from professional football following the conclusion of the championship. The award emphasized the impact Zidane made on the field throughout the tournament, as his performance was nothing short of exceptional. At age 34, Zidane demonstrated his mastery of the game by dictating the tempo of matches and skillfully orchestrating his team's offensive and defensive plays. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, France reached the final to face Italy, and Zidane played a pivotal role in guiding his team to this accomplishment. He scored three crucial goals over the course of the tournament, including a memorable penalty during the semi-final shootout against Portugal and an inch-perfect Panenka-style penalty in the final against Italy. However, the final also played host to Zidane's infamous headbutt incident involving Italian defender Marco Materazzi, which led to his dismissal from the game. In a controversial and career-defining moment, Zidane was sent off for violent conduct, leaving his team with one player short during the final moments of extra time. Ultimately, Italy triumphed in the penalty shootout, subsequently securing their fourth World Cup title. Despite the infamous end to his career, Zidane's performances leading up to that point earned him the Golden Ball, making him the third French player to claim the award. Though his actions in the final somewhat marred his triumph, few can dispute the incredible skill, vision, and sheer brilliance that marked his overall play in the 2006 FIFA World Cup."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, her grandmother took away all the money and put it in a bank account. Many students experienced the same thing as Chen. They got their gift money, only to immediately have it taken away. Xiong Shengyue, 14, from Nanjing, doesn't agree with the practice. \\"I think the money should be the children's, \\" she said. \\" We should take care of it by ourselves.\\" It is not that simple, said Chu Chaohui, a researcher at national Institute of Education Sciences. Giving gift money is used to show social status  and develop relationships, he told Beijing Legal Evening News. Gift money has lost its traditional meaning of good will and has \\"little to do with the children\\". What's more, children don't earn the money through work. So he thought that parents should still play a big part in dealing with the money. But Yan Honglan, a mother of a 14-year-old boy in Beijing, has let her son be responsible  for his gift money since the age of 8. \\"I want to develop his financial  skills, ' Yan said. She also added:\\"No matter how you deal with the money, the most important thing is to make the children feel they're respected  and trusted. Chen supported Yan's idea.

Chen Jie, a 14-year-old girl from Ningbo, Zhejiang, received 3600 yuan as gift money during the Spring Festival. However, her grandmother took away all the money and put it in a bank account, a situation that many students experience as well. Xiong Shengyue, another 14-year-old from Nanjing, believes that the money should belong to the children, and they should have the responsibility to manage it. Chu Chaohui, a researcher at the National Institute of Education Sciences, explains that the traditional concept of gift money has evolved over time. It now serves to demonstrate social status and nurture relationships, distancing itself from the original symbolism of good will and having \\"little to do with the children.\\" Additionally, since children don't earn the money through work, Chu believes that parents should play a significant role in managing the funds. On the other hand, Yan Honglan, a mother of a 14-year-old boy in Beijing, has allowed her son to handle his gift money since he was 8 years old. Yan aims to develop her son's financial skills and emphasizes the importance of making children feel respected and trusted while dealing with their gift money. Chen Jie underscores Yan's perspective by noting that she would feel happier knowing how her money is being spent, which would also evoke a sense of maturity. In conclusion, managing gift money is a complex issue impacted by cultural and social factors. Parents, guardians, and educators have differing opinions on the matter, as evident from the beliefs of Xiong Shengyue, Chu Chaohui, and Yan Honglan.

Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed - The final product is turned into urine. Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the process is the blood entering the kidneys for filtration. Here is the revised and detailed step-by-step process of kidney function: 1. Blood Enters the Kidneys: The first step in the process is the delivery of blood to the kidneys for filtration. Blood from the body, containing waste and excess substances, is transported to the kidneys via renal arteries. The renal arteries branch off from the aorta, which is the body's main blood vessel, and are responsible for supplying the kidneys with oxygenated blood. 2. Waste Enters the Kidneys: As blood flows into the kidneys, it carries various waste products and excess substances that the body needs to eliminate in order to maintain a proper balance. 3. A Processing Moment in the Kidneys Lets Waste and Fluid Pass: Inside each kidney, there are about a million tiny filtration units known as nephrons. Each nephron is composed of a glomerulus and a tubule. As blood flows through the glomerulus, a network of tiny blood capillaries, the waste and excess substances in the blood are forced out of the bloodstream by hydrostatic pressure and into the tubule due to the small size of the capillaries and the surrounding walls of the Bowman's capsule. 4. Prevents Larger Molecules to Pass: The filtration process in the kidneys is selective and only allows certain substances to pass through. Larger molecules like proteins and blood cells are generally prevented from passing through the capillary walls into the tubule. These larger molecules remain in the bloodstream and are not subject to the filtration process. 5. Fluid Goes Back to the Bloodstream: As the fluid and waste products pass through the tubule, important nutrients, water, and electrolytes are selectively reabsorbed back into the bloodstream through the walls of the tubule. This process helps to maintain the body's hydration levels and overall balance of electrolytes. 6. Bad Waste is Removed: Once the vital components are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream, the remaining waste products and excess substances continue to flow through the tubules and are further processed and concentrated into a liquid waste called urine. 7. The Final Product is Turned into Urine: After the waste products have been processed and concentrated in the tubules, the final liquid waste, or urine, is transported from the kidneys to the urinary bladder via the ureters. From the bladder, the urine is then eliminated from the body through the urethra during urination. In summary, the missing first step in the process is the delivery of blood containing waste and excess substances to the kidneys for filtration. This initiates the kidney's crucial function of filtering and processing the body's waste, ensuring the body maintains proper balance and overall health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea.

What is the best company you have worked for?","output":"No, the two questions are not the same, and they hold different implications. Let's break down each question to better understand the difference. 1. \\"What is the best thing about the company you work for?\\" This question aims to understand the specific aspects of the company that an individual currently works for. The focus is on the positive characteristics or benefits that the company offers. This question can be interpreted as asking about the company culture, employee benefits, opportunities for growth, or any other factors that make the company a great place to work in the perspective of the employee. It encourages the employee to reflect on their current experience at the company, highlighting a particular feature that they find most appealing or satisfactory. Possible answers to this question may include: - \\"The company culture is very supportive and encourages collaboration.\\" - \\"I love that the company offers excellent employee benefits, such as generous healthcare coverage and flexible working hours.\\" - \\"The company provides ample opportunities for professional growth and learning, keeping me motivated and engaged in my job.\\" 2. \\"What is the best company you have worked for?\\" This question focuses on the individual's work history and is asking them to compare their experiences at different companies. It requires the responder to consider their entire career and evaluate which organization stands out as the best one they have worked for in their perspective. The question does not imply that their current company is the best one; it's an open question that allows the respondent to consider all their previous employers. Possible answers to this question might be: - \\"The best company I've worked for is XYZ Corporation because of their amazing employee benefits and a supportive work environment.\\" - \\"Throughout my career, I enjoyed working for ABC Industries the most, as it offered great opportunities for growth and a rewarding professional experience.\\" In summary, the first question asks for the best thing about an individual's current company, prompting them to evaluate their experiences particular to that company. The second question, on the other hand, asks for the best company from the employee's entire work history, prompting a comparison between multiple employers. Both questions ultimately revolve around the positive experiences and aspects of a company, but they are distinctly different in terms of their focus and the type of evaluation they require from the individual responding."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What's the full name of the man who suggested the Chili Peppers record in Houdini's former mansion?, using the article: Now settled into Warner Bros. Records, the Chili Peppers began looking for a suitable producer. One in particular, Rick Rubin, stood out, as he was more broadminded than people the band had worked with in the past, even though Rubin had turned down the chance to produce their 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan due to the drug problems of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak (who would die of a heroin overdose a year later). Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone the band felt confident in to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.The band sought to record the album in an unconventional setting, believing it would enhance their creative output. Rubin suggested the mansion magician Harry Houdini once lived in, to which they agreed. A crew was hired to set up a recording studio and other equipment required for production in the house in Los Angeles. The Peppers decided they would remain inside the mansion for the duration of recording, though according to Kiedis, Smith was convinced the location was haunted, and refused to stay. He would, instead, come each day by motorcycle. Smith himself disputes this account, and instead claims the real reason he did not stay at The Mansion was because he wanted to be with his wife. Frusciante, however, disagreed with Smith, and said \\"There are definitely ghosts in the house,\\" and Frusciante felt they were \\"very friendly. We [the band] have nothing but warm vibes and happiness everywhere we go in this house.\\"Frusciante, Kiedis, and Flea each had their own rooms in the house. When not recording with the band, Frusciante would spend his time painting, listening to music, reading and recording songs he'd written. Due to the seclusion, Kiedis ended up recording all his vocals in his room, as it was large enough to accommodate the recording equipment.

I was pleasantly surprised with my recent stay at the Mirage and would gladly stay at this hotel again.  LOVES: 1) LOCATION: Located on the strip, closer to the North end. As any of you regular Vegas goers know, location is everything!  For this particular Vegas trip the majority of our plans had us at the North end of the strip which made it convenient for us to get around by foot or taxi.    2) FRONT DESK/LOBBY AREA:  I love love love the pretty (and huge) aquarium situated right behind the front desk. It runs the length of the front desk area, so as you're waiting in the long line to check in or check out at least you've got a lovely view of the pretty aquarium to keep you entertained.    3) ROOM RATES: I usually book MGM or the Gold Coast for Vegas trips because of their bargain rates, but when fellow Yelper Ingrid R told me about the good rates at the Mirage I checked it out. Our room rates for our stay were as follows:  Fri 12/21   72 Sat 12/22  72 Sun 12/23 56 However, keep in mind as with any other hotel in Vegas the above room rates did not include the daily 25 resort fee nor the 12% room tax.  So including all the fees and taxes the entire stay came to 309.   4) ROOMS: Although me and my boyfriend's room was all the way at the end of the hall, we scored a corner room that was slightly larger than our other friends' rooms and had better views because of the semi wraparound windows. My favorite part about the room was the abundance of mirrors they had, aside from the mirror in the bathroom. As soon as we walked in, I noticed a full length mirror to my left (absolute must have in any Vegas hotel room); the mirrored closet; and a rather large hanging mirror on the wall next to the bathroom door.  Regardless of who was in the bathroom and how long the bathroom was in use, the mirrors came in handy for the other one to still get ready.  Enough about the mirrors lol, the rest of the room was nice: simple modern decor; comfy bed; large flat screen tv; etc. Although the bathroom was pretty small compared to other hotels I've stayed at.   5) BLT: You'll have to read my BLT review for more details, but what a great find and soooooo convenient!!! Good food & awesome shakes!!!  The group of us ended up eating here multiple times during our Vegas trip.

Choose from: a. yes b. it is not possible to tell c. no","output":"Based on the premise, \\"but they need to pay for it too because they couldn't do that somewhere else,\\" it is not possible to tell whether the hypothesis \\"They need to pay for the international debt too\\" is true. So, the correct answer is: b. it is not possible to tell Explanation: The premise provided is rather ambiguous, offering limited information about the context, the parties involved, the nature of \\"it\\" they need to pay for, and the relationship between the obligation to pay for \\"it\\" and the inability to do so elsewhere. Without a clear understanding of these key aspects, it is not possible to determine if the hypothesis regarding international debt obligations is accurate or relevant. For example, the term \\"international debt\\" usually refers to the money owed by one country to another, typically in the form of government bonds, financial instruments, or loans from international financial institutions such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund. However, the wording of the premise does not provide any indication that the parties involved are countries or governments, which makes drawing a connection to international debt uncertain. Moreover, the phrase \\"they couldn't do that somewhere else\\" implies that there may be unique circumstances or reasons why the obligation to pay for \\"it\\" is necessary, but the lack of specificity about what \\"it\\" represents or what those circumstances are further complicates the matter. For instance, \\"it\\" could refer to a specific service, resource, or asset, which may or may not have a relationship to international debt.  On the other hand, the word \\"too\\" in the hypothesis could be interpreted as confirming that there are additional obligations or responsibilities aside from those noted in the premise. However, the absence of context regarding the obligations discussed in the premise prevents us from conclusively determining whether the international debt hypothesis fits within that framework. In summary, because of the ambiguities and missing information present in the premise, it is not possible to ascertain the truthfulness of the hypothesis concerning international debt obligations. More information would be needed to offer a more definitive answer on the matter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What are steroid hormones made of?\\" with the following options:  - bacteria  - fats  - sugar  - muscle  - H 2 O  - sunlight  - the Sun  - SO2 A:","output":"Given Fact 1 and Fact 2 provided, steroid hormones are made of lipids, such as phospholipids and cholesterol, and fats are known as lipids. Therefore, the answer to the question \\"What are steroid hormones made of?\\" is - fats. Steroid hormones are a class of hormones that are derived from cholesterol and are essential for several vital functions in the body, such as regulating metabolism, inflammation, immune function, salt and water balance, and development of sexual characteristics. These hormones are synthesized primarily in the adrenal glands and the gonads (i.e., ovaries and testes). Some examples of steroid hormones include cortisol, aldosterone, testosterone, and estrogen. Cholesterol acts as the starting material for the synthesis of steroid hormones. Enzymes in the cells of the adrenal and gonadal glands modify the cholesterol molecule to produce different steroid hormones, each with specific biological functions. While cholesterol is a type of lipid, it is essential to note that not all lipids are cholesterol. Lipids are a broad class of organic molecules that include fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids, and cholesterol. They are all characterized by being insoluble in water and soluble in organic solvents like ether, chloroform, and acetone. Lipids are an essential component in living organisms, providing energy storage, cellular signaling, and maintaining the structural integrity of cell membranes. In conclusion, based on the facts provided and the clarification of the relationship between lipids and fats, we can confirm that the answer to the given question is that steroid hormones are made of fats (a subgroup of lipids)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the difference between scripting language, programming language and network protocol? Do those questions have the same meaning? Pick your answer from:  (A). no  (B). yes","output":"(A). No. These questions do not have the same meaning. Although they are related to the fields of programming and computer systems, they tackle different areas and concepts. Let me explain the differences between the terms mentioned in the questions. 1. Difference between a programming language and a scripting language: A programming language is a formal language that provides a set of instructions that a computer can understand and use to execute specific tasks. It consists of various components such as syntax, semantics, and pragmatics which allow developers to define, structure, and produce various types of software applications. Examples of programming languages are C, C++, Java, and Python. A scripting language, on the other hand, is a specific type of programming language often used for automating tasks, modifying data, or processing text within software applications. Scripting languages are typically interpreted rather than compiled. This means that the code doesn't need to be translated into lower-level code before executing, which makes it generally easier and quicker to write and modify. Some examples of scripting languages are JavaScript, Perl, and Ruby. While both programming languages and scripting languages are types of languages designed for controlling computer systems, they have different use cases, execution methods, and complexity. 2. Difference between a scripting language, programming language, and network protocol: As mentioned earlier, a scripting language is a type of programming language used for automating tasks and processing data within software applications. A network protocol, on the other hand, is a set of rules and conventions that allow computers to communicate with each other over a network. These rules define the format, data transmission, and error correction methodologies to ensure reliable and efficient communication between devices. Examples of network protocols include HTTP, FTP, and TCP/IP. Thus, coding with a scripting or programming language helps to create software applications, while network protocols facilitate communication between those applications over networks. To summarize, the questions address distinct but related concepts: - The first question asks about the difference between programming languages and scripting languages. - The second question asks about the differences between scripting languages, programming languages, and network protocols. These are different questions, and their meanings are not the same; therefore, the correct answer is (A). No."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you are given inputs i and A, where i is an integer and A is a list.

Is Citizens in each of the nine districts elect one council representative each to serve a four-year term. a good answer to this question?   +yes.  +no.","output":"No, the answer \\"Citizens in each of the nine districts elect one council representative each to serve a four-year term.\\" is not a good answer to the question, \\"On what day of the week does the city council meet?\\" A good answer should provide information about the specific meeting schedule of the city council. Since the original question asks for the day of the week, an appropriate answer would mention a particular weekday that the city council meets. It is important to note that the meeting schedule for city councils can vary greatly depending on the city or municipality in question. Therefore, gathering accurate information by visiting the city or municipality's official website or contacting their administrative offices might be necessary. For example, a good answer could be: \\"The city council meets every second and fourth Tuesday of each month at 7:00 PM.\\" In this answer, not only is the day of the week provided (Tuesday), but it also specifies the frequency of the meetings (every second and fourth Tuesday of each month) and the time at which they take place (7:00 PM). This provides a much clearer and relevant response to the initial question, as opposed to the original answer that only describes how city council representatives are elected and their term length."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - the lungs  - the heart  - the kidneys  - the brain stem  A: A:","output":"The brain stem monitors the level of carbon dioxide in the blood. The respiratory centers are located within the medulla oblongata and the pons, which are part of the brain stem. These centers are responsible for controlling the rate and depth of breathing by monitoring levels of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and hydrogen ions in the blood. The process of monitoring carbon dioxide levels in the blood is essential for maintaining proper acid-base balance within the body and ensuring efficient gas exchange in the lungs. The body continuously produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct of cellular respiration. Consequently, the blood transports carbon dioxide away from the cells and towards the lungs, where it is removed from the body during exhalation. Chemoreceptors, specialized sensory receptors within the medullary respiratory centers, as well as peripheral chemoreceptors in the aortic and carotid bodies, are responsible for detecting changes in blood carbon dioxide levels. When levels of carbon dioxide rise above a specific threshold, these receptors send signals to the respiratory centers, which then initiate a response to increase the rate and depth of breathing. This allows for the removal of excess carbon dioxide, restoring the levels to within the normal range. If, on the other hand, the levels of carbon dioxide are low, the respiratory centers receive the opposite signal from chemoreceptors, leading to decreased respiration rate, shallow breathing, or, eventually, temporary cessation of breathing known as apnea. This allows the level of carbon dioxide in the blood to return to a normal range, maintaining balance. In summary, the brain stem, particularly the medulla oblongata and the pons, monitors the level of carbon dioxide in the blood. Chemoreceptors within the respiratory centers, as well as peripheral chemoreceptors, detect changes in carbon dioxide levels and relay this information to the brain stem. In response, the brain stem adjusts the rate and depth of breathing to maintain blood carbon dioxide levels within a proper range, ensuring overall acid-base balance and efficient gas exchange within the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here, it is said that \\"Now the former Nathan's Folly is known as the Golden Mile.\\" From this sentence alone, several key pieces of information can be gleaned. First, the use of the word \\"Now\\" indicates a change in time, suggesting that a situation has shifted and is no longer the same. This tells us that a shift has occurred at some point between the past and the present. Second, the reference to \\"the former Nathan's Folly\\" reveals that Nathan's Folly is no longer the name used to describe this particular location, and that it has become something else instead. This suggests a transformation or renaming has taken place. Lastly, the name \\"Golden Mile\\" is stated as the new moniker for this location, meaning that it has replaced the title \\"Nathan's Folly.\\" Putting these pieces of information together—namely, the reference to a change in time, the indication that Nathan's Folly is no longer the current name for this location, and the introduction of Golden Mile as the replacement name—it is possible to make the conclusion that \\"The Golden Mile was previously called the Nathan's Folly.\\" This conclusion supports the idea that at some point in the past, the area currently known as the Golden Mile was recognized as Nathan's Folly. Over time, as the circumstances changed and the area transformed, it has taken on a new name: the Golden Mile.

Article: When the swim season began, my 11-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, and I cut a deal. She would go to practice three times a week and try really hard, and I wouldn't make her compete in the swim meets because on the day of a meet, she would be nervous all day. Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down. Recently, they had a T-shirt relay, which works like this: one person from each relay team puts on a T-shirt and a pair of socks, swims 50 meters, and gets out of the pool. She takes off the clothes and puts them on the next person, who then swims 50 meters. This continues until everyone on the team has completed a lap. By the last leg, Elizabeth's team had built up a moderate lead. Then it was Elizabeth's turn to swim. She seemed to swim faster in the T-shirt and socks than when she wasn't wearing them. Approaching the halfway mark, she was still in the lead. Then one of Elizabeth's socks fell off and was floating in the pool. \\"She has to get that sock on before the end of the race,\\" a swimming official told her team, \\"or you will be disqualified.\\" Everybody on her team started screaming, \\"Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Stop! Get the sock!\\" But she couldn't hear them. As she started her last 25 meters, a girl in Lane 2 was gaining on Elizabeth. It was time for desperate measures. A girl on my daughter's team jumped in the pool, grabbed the sock, and swam after Elizabeth. She grabbed Elizabeth's foot. \\"You have to put the sock on,\\" the girl screamed. Elizabeth continued swimming while her teammate put on the sock. By now, the girl in Lane 2 was about to pass Elizabeth. With the sock finally on, Elizabeth swam her heart out for the last 15 meters. It was close, but Elizabeth beat the other girl to the wall for the victory. On the ride home, she relived her moment of glory again and again.

After Moon's assistant Zao discovers that Bond is a British agent, Moon attempts to kill Bond and a hovercraft chase ensues, which ends with Moon's apparent death. Bond survives, but is captured by North Korean soldiers and imprisoned by the Colonel's father, General Moon. After 14 months of captivity and torture, Bond is traded for Zao in a prisoner exchange. He is sedated and taken to meet M, who informs him that his status as a 00 Agent is suspended under suspicion of having leaked information under duress. Bond is convinced that he has been set up by a double agent in the British government and decides to avenge his betrayal. After escaping from the custody of MI6, he discovers that he is in Hong Kong, where he learns from a Chinese agent that Zao is in Cuba. In Havana Bond meets NSA agent Giacinta 'Jinx' Johnson and follows her to a gene therapy clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring. Bond locates Zao inside the clinic and attempts to kill him, but Zao escapes. He leaves behind a pendant which leads Bond to a cache of diamonds, identified as conflict diamonds, but bearing the crest of the company owned by British billionaire Gustav Graves.

Q: Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text. The WHO says processed meats such as bacon, sausages and ham increase the risk of getting cancer. Dr Ian Johnson, from the Institute of Food Research, a publicly funded UK research institute that focuses on the science of food and health He reacted cautiously to the WHO's report, saying: \\"It is important to emphasise that this classification reflects the strength of the evidence for an effect, not the actual size of the risk. \\"Meat consumption is probably one of many factors contributing to the high rates of bowel cancer seen in America, Western Europe and Australia, but the mechanism is poorly understood, and the effect is much smaller than, for example, that of cigarette smoking on the risk of lung cancer. \\"It is also worth noting that there is little or no evidence that vegetarians in the UK have a lower risk of bowel cancer than meat-eaters.\\" Maureen Strong, of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, which is funded by farmers and growers to supply the food industry with information She said the WHO's report did not suggest eating red and processed meats \\"as part of a balanced diet\\" caused cancer. \\"No single food causes cancer. [The WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer] itself has said that the risk from processed meat remains small,\\" she said. Ms Strong added that the average daily consumption of processed meat was 17 grams, which meant that on average people would need to eat \\"three times their current levels to increase their risk\\" of developing cancer. Dr Louis Levy, of government health organisation Public Health England He said findings in the report were \\"broadly in line with current government advice\\", which is based on the possible link between consuming red and processed meat and colorectal cancer. \\"On average, we should be eating no more than 70g a day. This advice recognises the fact that red meat is also a good source of nutrients, including iron, zinc and vitamin B12.\\" Professor Tim Key, from Cancer Research UK He said there was \\"substantial evidence\\" for a link between meat-eating and bowel cancer. However, \\"Eating a bacon bap every once in a while isn't going to do much harm - having a healthy diet is all about moderation,\\" he said. \\"You could try having fish for your dinner rather than sausages, or choosing to have a bean salad for lunch over a BLT.\\" Meurig Raymond, president of the National Farmers Union (NFU) Mr Raymond said: \\"The NFU has always stated that eating lean red meat has an important role to play in a healthy balanced diet. It's a traditional part of the British lifestyle and is enjoyed by most of the population. He added that there was a \\"complex relationship\\" between diet and good health, and the solutions to any link between diet and illness \\"cannot be polarised or simplistic\\". \\"The scientific and medical communities both agree that consuming recommended quantities of red meat is beneficial to human health and provides the body with a ready source of essential vitamins and minerals,\\" he said. Clare Oxborrow, from environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth She welcomed the report, and said: \\"This should be a wake-up call that our diets urgently need to change. \\"Evidence shows that high meat diets not only harm our health; they damage our environment too. Experts have warned that unless we eat less meat globally, we will fail to meet our climate change targets.\\" Chris Godfrey, from Godfrey's Butchers in Highbury, north London, which has been selling sausages for more than 100 years Mr Godfrey said he was not concerned by the WHO's report as it is not telling people to avoid eating meat altogether. \\"They're not saying that meat's bad for you. What they're saying is that a healthy diet is good for you, which we already knew.\\" \\"Most people read these things, they're quite intelligent enough to be able to realise that it's not as bad as smoking a cigarette.\\" A:","output":"The WHO warns that processed meats like bacon, sausages, and ham increase cancer risk, sparking varied responses from experts on the significance of the findings and the importance of a balanced diet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is one of the world's most successful companies built on it's famous motto 'Don't be evil'. But a report by Business Insider says rather than peace and love, Google is filled with fierce relationships that would not be out of place in Game of Thrones. Behind the modern glass doors of the internet giant's California headquarters are complex stories of sex and intrigue. One member of staff told Business Insider: 'Inside Google, it's a Game of Thrones.' A report suggests Google is filled with sex scandal and political intrigue that would not be out of place in Game of Thrones, starring Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister. Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California, where insiders say bosses are trying to clamp down on in-fighting. Former staff told the website that the politicking that goes on behind the scenes is reminiscent of the secret networking in the famous book and television series. According to sources quoted by Business Insider, co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin actively encouraged loud and angry debate among their subordinates. But divisions within the company's various strands have now reportedly become so deep, that bosses are now trying to stamp out the in-fighting that was once so encouraged. Business Insider said that during a conference in Napa Valley in February, Page told senior executives that the warring had to stop and there would be 'zero tolerance for fighting.' The alleged change in stance comes after rumoured rivalries between the likes of former search and product executive Marissa Mayer, who is now CEO of Yahoo, and Salar Kamangar, CEO if YouTube. It was not only the networking and politicking that has been likened to Game of Thrones, in which mythical aristocracy and royalty battle for the crown. One member of staff said: 'Inside Google, it's a Game of Thrones'. Pictured: Court meddlers Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish (right) and Varys (left) Google co-founder Sergey Brin was involved in a recent sex scandal after it emerged he was dating Google worker Amanda Rosenberg. The book and series' sex and dangerous liaisons also has similarities to life at Google, according to insiders. The. most famous recent 'scandal' involved married Google co-founder Sergey. Brin who, it emerged last month, had an affair with Google Glass. employee Amanda Rosenberg. She had also previously dated Google executive Hugo Barra, according to reports. Although Google has a written code of conduct involving relationships with colleagues, staff say bosses mostly turn a blind eye. The internet giant's code states: 'If a romantic relationship does create an actual or apparent conflict it may require changes to work arrangements or even the termination of employment of either or both individuals involved. ‘When faced with a potential conflict of interest, ask yourself: Would this activity harm my reputation, negatively impact my ability to do my job at Google or potentially harm Google? Google co-founders Sergey Brin, left, and Larry Page, actively encouraged fierce debate among staff, according to the report. ‘Would this activity embarrass Google or me if it showed up on the front page of a newspaper or blog? If the answer to any of these questions is “yes”, the relationship or situation is likely to create a conflict of interest and you should avoid it.’ However, as Business Insider states, in Douglas Edwards' book about the launch of the company 'I'm Feeling Lucky: The Confessions Of Google Employee Number 59' relationships with co-workers were common. Mr Edwards quotes HR worker Heather Cairns as saying: 'hormones were flying and not everyone remembered to lock their doors.' But as one Google worker told Business Insider: 'In a place like Google, which has strong technical talent as well as business talent, it's very natural that people are going to be attracted to one another.' Google did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.","output":"This article says that Google is a very famous and successful company. But, people working there sometimes have arguments and disagreements, just like in the story called \\"Game of Thrones.\\" The big bosses at Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, used to let people have these arguments because they thought it was good for them to share their ideas. But now, they want to stop the fighting and make everyone work together nicely. Also, the article talks about romantic relationships between people who work at Google. Sometimes, these relationships can cause problems in the company. Google has rules about this, but they don't always follow them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Andrew Cuomo, both Democrats, spoke at separate, simultaneous news conferences, where each touted his administration’s response to the outbreak but declined to comment on the other’s. Two more people died from Legionnaires’ disease, officials said Monday, and additional sites tested positive for the bacterium that causes the disease. The death count is now 12, up from 10 this weekend, and the total number of cases is 113. Mr. de Blasio said two more sites tested positive for the bacterium, while Mr. Cuomo identified three, which he said were outside the “impact area that was initially tested.” At the end of the day, the state and city said 18 sites tested positive for the bacterium, both in and outside the impact zone. The city had sent 46,600 robocalls to households, Mr. de Blasio said. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo on Monday said that the state had canvassed more than 500 buildings and people Sunday and 1,500 Monday. State workers also distributed a state-produced flier with facts about the disease—distinct from the flier that city health department workers had distributed earlier. Mr. de Blasio declined to comment on the state’s response to the outbreak. Mr. Cuomo, answering questions after a criminal justice-related news conference, declined to comment on the city’s. “I am not in a position to comment on what the city has done,” he said. Both agreed that cooling towers, which have been blamed for the outbreak, should be regulated, and both had different plans to do so. Mr. de Blasio pushed City Council legislation, which he said would pass Thursday. “The City of New York obviously takes responsibility for our own people,” he said. “We’re going to pass the rules and laws we need to pass.” He added: “We’re not sure when Albany is going to treat the matter.” Mr. Cuomo said the state would regulate the buildings and that such regulation wouldn’t require legislative approval. Asked how his approach would differ from the city’s, he said, “I don’t know what the city’s protocol is, so I don’t know how it would be different.” The mayor and governor’s offices had a fight Friday night after remarks that an aide to the mayor made questioning the state’s response to Legionnaire’s disease, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Cuomo was upset and made it known to the mayor’s office, these people said. Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. issued his own statement, which noted that he proposed legislation last month. “When it became clear that such outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease could be prevented through regular inspections, I proposed that the City Council move to create such legislation as quickly as possible,” he said. Meanwhile, those in the Bronx said there remained continual worry about the disease and the official response. “If this was the Upper East Side, this wouldn’t be an issue,” said Ed Garcia Conde, a local activist and blogger. A spokeswoman for City Councilwoman Vanessa Gibson, who represents affected Bronx neighborhoods, said she was concerned that differing numbers and information could cause wider worry among residents. Teams from both the state and city tested cooling towers in the Bronx over the weekend. Thirty-nine buildings in the affected area of the South Bronx have a cooling tower of the type associated with this outbreak, city officials said. Mr. Cuomo said Sunday that the state that day would test 62 buildings at the city’s request. Both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio said they were collaborating on the testing. City officials had targeted the Opera House Hotel as a likely place where the disease originated, a senior official said. Tests were due back later this week, the official said. Of the 12 who have died of the disease, 11 were older adults with existing conditions, while one person was under 40. The last day someone became sick with Legionnaires’ was Aug. 3, which shows the outbreak continues to taper off, Mr. de Blasio said. City and state officials Monday identified 11 sites that tested positive for the bacteria in what they are now calling the impact zone: Concourse Plaza, the Opera House Hotel, Lincoln Medical Center, Streamline Plastics Co., two courthouses, a Verizon building, a nursing home, a post office, a Department of Homeless Services intake center and a high school. An additional four buildings are outside of this zone: another Verizon building, a police department, and buildings at 1201 Lafayette Ave. and 230 East 123rd St. —Erica Orden contributed to this article.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Monumental Hubris - Forbes.com History has a funny way of humbling men. So do markets. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of Lehman Brothers' (nyse: LEH - news - people ) fall is that it comes almost seven years to the day after 9/11. That day was supposed to teach us humility. The fall of Lehman, coming six months after the collapse of Bear Stearns and coupled with Merrill Lynch's (nyse: MER - news - people ) disappearance as an independent company, are the result of a complete lack of humility on the part of those executives charged with leading the world's most important purveyors of capital in the post-9/11 world. For all the talk of pulling together in the wake of the terrorist attacks that shook America to the core and that supposedly set our priorities straight, Wall Street rushed headlong back to its mindless pursuit of profits and speculation without consideration for the consequences of its actions. Now, the chickens have come home to roost. In April 2008, our firm, Hegemony Capital Management, published a controversial essay entitled \\"How to Fix It,\\" in which we outlined our (unsolicited) recommendations for how to correct the excesses that led to the credit crisis that began in mid-2007 and brought us to these historic days. Special Offer: Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley hit the skids! Merrill gets sold, Lehman goes under. Blood is certainly in the streets. What are you buying? Click here for a free trial of Forbes-Lehmann Income Securities Investor with new recommended buys of bank preferred stocks offering double-digit yields. Our key recommendations, which seemed much more radical in April than they do today, were the following: --Improve financial industry regulation and replace substance over form in the regulation we have. --Place absolute leverage limitations on financial institutions at much lower levels than the 30:1 levels that led to this crisis. --Place an absolute limitation on hedge fund leverage. --Regulate Wall Street compensation by basing it on multiple years' performance, adding claw-backs and high-water marks and limit cash compensation that weakens these firms' balance sheets. --Tax private equity firms' carried interests at ordinary interest rates rather than capital gains rates and restrict private equity firms' ability to go public. --Re-institute the uptick rule with respect to short selling. Finally, we made the point that too much economic activity in the U.S. was aimed at speculation rather than production. For example, the equity markets are increasingly dominated by quantitative investment strategies that are driven by considerations that are totally divorced from considerations of fundamental value. At the same time, the credit markets are increasingly utilized to finance change-of-control transactions for private equity firms that are done simply because low-cost financing is available, not because a project is going to add to the productive capacity or capital account of the nation. As we wrote in that April issue, \\"At some point, society has to figure out that the way an investor earns his money is even more important than the amount of money he makes. This is why human beings were vested with moral sentiments, so they could distinguish the quality of human conduct from the quantity of its results.\\" These changes cannot and will not be effected simply by legislative fiat. It is incumbent upon the gatekeepers of capital, the fiduciaries that make the decisions about allocating capital, to bring discipline to the system. This will require a rethinking of their priorities and a willingness to add to their investment calculus considerations that exceed their own narrow interests about short-term investment returns. Special Offer: Low-risk time to buy stocks? Click here for a free trial of InvesTech Research with veteran money manager Jim Stack's latest outlook and portfolio moves. Our system requires a new concept of fiduciary duty that encompasses systemic as well as single-firm interests, and that focuses to a greater degree on risk-adjusted returns than raw numerical returns. Obviously the forces that led to current events have been building for many years, and the changes needed to fix the system will not be made overnight, but we should not let this occasion pass to reflect on what has occurred. It is clear to us that the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury are not underestimating the enormity of the crisis. AIG (nyse: AIG - news - people ) is a much larger systemic threat than Lehman Brothers ever was, so this situation is profoundly serious. In our judgment, investors should not try to pick a bottom in today's or this week's market. The market is going to experience extraordinary volatility in the immediate future. Play the market at your own risk and only with money you can afford to lose. The indexes are heading significantly lower, as we have previously forecast. Gold, short-term U.S. Treasuries, short-term Swiss and German government paper, the Swiss franc and certain Asian currencies like the Singapore dollar are the safest places to park your cash for the moment. The U.S. dollar continues to be debased (less against the euro, which remains compromised, than against Asian currencies and the Swiss franc), particularly by the startling and historic decision by the Federal Reserve to accept equity securities at its discount window. If nothing else, that decision alone suggests the enormity and depth of the crisis we are facing. We never thought we'd live to see the day that the American central bank would accept equity as collateral for loans. We have to admit that took us by surprise and made us very nervous. Michael E.

The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. However, there are an estimated 59.5 million forcibly displaced persons around the world, according to United Nation's Global Trends report. This population not only includes refugees, but internally displaced persons, asylum-seekers and stateless people as well.
